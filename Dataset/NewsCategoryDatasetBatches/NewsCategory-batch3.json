            "Three seasons have passed since COVID-19 first broke out, and now the Northern Hemisphere is facing a long, masked winter. We’ll need to adapt our current face mask-wearing practices for the realities of living in a colder environment.",
            "The good news (if anything related to this pandemic can be called good news) is that you won’t have to change anything you’re doing — as long as you’re already following WHO recommendations to wear a three-layered nonmedical mask, one with an absorbent inner layer near the mouth, a middle filtration layer and an outer layer. But do you need to bulk up and wear a woolen mask, or will that only put you more at risk? Experts gave us answers.",
            "Your best bet: cotton masks with baby wipe filters",
            "Everyone seems to have an opinion about face masks, even if it’s just about what type of fabric they should be made from. In the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, two professors at the University of British Columbia tested 41 different mask and filter materials to find out how well they blocked particles out while still remaining breathable.",
            "The study they published in August showed that a mask with two layers of quilting cotton was the best bet for effectiveness and wearability. They found that a dried-out baby wipe filter was almost as breathable as a commercial nonsurgical mask but still effective at blocking particles. In fact, the wipes filtered out up to 80% of three-micron particles and more than 90% of 10-micron particles. (The COVID-19 particle is around 0.1 micron in size, but it always attaches to something larger, like the droplets produced by breathing, talking and coughing, which are typically larger than five microns.)",
            "How cold weather affects face masks",
            "Winter mask-wearing provides some upsides for people who are perennially chilly all season long.",
            "“One of the most commonly reported negative side effects is warmth and overheating,” said Jaimie Meyer, a physician specializing in infectious diseases at Yale Medicine and an associate professor at Yale School of Medicine. “So if your environment is colder or you’re just one of those people who are always cold in winter, then a mask might feel more comfortable now.”",
            "Colder weather can create condensation from breathing, which wets the layers of the mask. Bring a spare mask if you’re going to be out for a while, and switch it out when your mask feels damp. And if your glasses fog up while you’re wearing the mask, Meyer suggested washing the glasses with soap and water, then rinsing and drying them before you head outdoors.",
            "“Enough soap particles will remain on the lenses to prevent them from fogging up,” she said.",
            "Don’t knit yourself a woolen mask this winter",
            "If you’ve become a dedicated quarantine crafter, you might be thinking that knitting your very own mask is a brilliant, homespun idea. The quick answer: Stop yourself.",
            "“There are two problems with this idea. The first reason is that hand-knitted items will have large holes in them and that’s the opposite of what you want, since the tighter the weave, the more effective the fabric with filtration,” said Jing Wang, one of the professors who carried out the University of British Columbia study. ”Secondly, there’s the issue of comfort. We tested fleece and wool fabrics and found that they’re poorly tolerated due to overheating and moisture buildup. In other words, that knitted mask could cause overheating.”",
            "Instead, she referred back to the results of her study that showed double-knit cotton was the most effective common fabric for filtering out particles while still allowing for breathability.",
            "Two masks aren’t always better than one",
            "As COVID-19 cases continue to rise, some people are wondering if wearing two masks at a time might be better than wearing just one. Again, not so fast.",
            "“Sometimes in a patient room, I’ll wear an N95 mask with another mask over it in an attempt to protect that precious personal protective equipment,” Meyer said. “It’s very uncomfortable, and I can’t talk for more than a few minutes, so I wouldn’t recommend that people try it as part of their everyday activities.”",
            "“Wearing two masks might help in terms of offering more protection, but it also might make it harder for you to breathe,” Wang added. “Whatever you’re doing, you need to strike a balance between what’s safe and what you can comfortably tolerate.”",
            "What to look for in a winter mask",
            "In addition to making sure your mask is made of the right material, you also want to be aware of its design.",
            "“It should have a good piece of wire or aluminum around the nose, and the straps should fit snugly around the ears or around the head,” Wang said.",
            "When it comes to the fit, it’s important to keep the mask over your nose and entirely over your chin.",
            "“The mask should be slightly lifted off your face, not stuck to your mouth and nose,” she said. “A small space there allows for the exchange of air across the entire surface of the mask. Just be sure you don’t have a gigantic dome far in front of your face. That creates dead space for CO2 to be retained, and your breathing can become compromised. If you notice that you’re breathing faster or deeper when wearing a certain mask, that can be what’s happening.”",
            "And if you find it difficult to wear face masks that loop around your ears, there are alternatives.",
            "“I’ve seen masks that tie above the neck and above the head, which can help you avoid tying something behind the back of your ears and feeling uncomfortable,” Meyer said.",
            "How to test whether your mask fits properly",
            "Wang offered a quick tip for testing whether or not a mask is properly “sealed” around your face.",
            "“Adjust the mask and take a deep breath through your mouth. If the mask suctions inward and then re-expands when you exhale, you’ve got a relatively good seal,” she said.",
            "And what about those “neck gaiter” masks that cover both your face and neck?",
            "“They don’t give you that tight fight you need,” Meyer said. “My two very athletic sons keep telling me how comfortable they are to wear, and I get that. But when one of them told me how he loved being able to drink water right through his gaiter, I explained that being porous is the exact opposite quality you want in a face mask. If you hold up a mask to the light and see light shining through, it’s not a good mask.”",
            "What to avoid in a winter face mask",
            "You should consider the size of your head and face when choosing a mask.",
            "“I see people all the time who are wearing masks that are too small for them, so they basically become chin straps,” Meyer said. “And I’ve seen people wearing their masks upside down, so take a look at the picture on the package to figure out which end is up.”",
            "And some masks should be avoided altogether.",
            "“If you see that a mask is obviously poorly constructed or if it smells of chemicals, I wouldn’t wear it,” Wang said.",
            "Winter face masks to wear right now",
            "Note: None of the face masks listed below are a replacement for medical-grade PPE, and they’re not intended to replace other recommended measures to stop the spread of COVID-19.",
            "Coordinate with your winter coat",
            "“We were one of the first fashion brands to get into the nonmedical mask market,” said Aaron Luo, CEO of Caraa, a sport bag and accessory brand based in New York City. “The exterior of this mask is lined with a 185-gram cotton twill to provide that extra warmth factor, and we’re offering a range of winter colors that complement outerwear.”",

            "“We started to look for protective equipment, but none of it was good enough to convince us to use it, so we started our own company,” founder Adam Muszyński told HuffPost. “Our masks are airtight in the nose area, which helps to reduce foggy glasses.”",

            "We need a national day of mourning for the coronavirus.",
            "As the first vaccinations began in the U.S. on Monday, bringing with them a ray of hope, the nation hit a grim milestone: more than 300,000 people dead from the virus so far.",
            "“We’ve been struggling,” said Douglas Yankton, chairman of the Spirit Lake Tribe in North Dakota. Native Americans have been disproportionately infected, hospitalized and killed by the virus. Yankton lost four family members — an uncle and three cousins — in the span of a week.",
            "“It’s a burden not only on the families but on the community when we keep having to bury our people,” he said.",
            "Scott Davis, a member of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, who lost two cousins and a friend to COVID-19, said that there’s been “no closure” as coronavirus protocols have prevented people from visiting hospitalized loved ones or gathering for funerals.",
            "“They go to the hospital, you can’t see them, you can’t be around them, and all of a sudden it happens, and then the families are left struggling to have closure,” he said. “You gotta mourn.”",
            "With an average now of 2,400 people dying each day of the coronavirus, Black and Latinx people have also been disproportionately affected — not only by the deaths but also by the economic fallout from the pandemic, including high rates of joblessness.",
            "Grief coach Breeshia Wade said that a national day of observance for the coronavirus losses would be important for “accountability and acknowledging the massive failure in how this played out.”",
            "“It’s not just the death toll. There’s the loss of a way of life, of American identity and what it means to be a cohesive country that comes together to protect its citizens,” Wade said. “There’s a loss of trust with our neighbors, with some wearing a mask and some who aren’t.”",
            "“We need something to bring us together to honor what has been lost if we’re going to have any hope of healing,” she added.",
            "National days of observance are typically enacted by Congress, after which the president issues a proclamation on that day each year and local governments may also hold dedicated ceremonies or events. Existing ones include Veterans Day and Hispanic Heritage Month.",
            "Rep. Donald Payne Jr. (D-N.J.) introduced a resolution in the House last month calling for a day of mourning for coronavirus victims in January, to provide “a national opportunity to grieve.”",
            "The legislation, which specifically calls out the disproportionate infection rates and deaths among communities of color, is sitting in the House Oversight Committee. Payne, whose best friend lost his mother to COVID-19, plans to ask other lawmakers to support the resolution once the more immediate concern of passing another economic stimulus package has been resolved.",
            "“Every elected official in Washington has lost a constituent to the virus,” Payne said, noting that he’s hopeful he can get it passed. “I would hope it could be handled in a bipartisan manner.”",
            "Activists have been calling for such a day for months. In May, several progressive groups, including the Center for American Progress, Indivisible and the National Domestic Workers Alliance, organized a “day of mourning” protest by dumping body bags outside the White House to call out the mounting death toll, which had then reached nearly 100,000.",
            "NDWA’s Black Organizing Director Aimée-Josiane Twagirumukiza said that any acknowledgment of the death toll should also come with a commitment to “use this pain, this grief to create something better.”",
            "Twagirumukiza specifically urged more relief funding from Congress, particularly for essential workers, including child care and home care providers, who have “kept the country going in a time like this.”",
            "Similarly, Jim Bunn, the co-creator of World AIDS Day, said that at this stage, a simple day of remembrance would not be “enough.” When he helped found the HIV/AIDS awareness day in 1987, the public health challenge at the time was overcoming the stigma around the disease. With this virus, one of the main challenges he sees is convincing everyone to get vaccinated.",
            "“Let’s use it to perhaps bring more purpose to the day — and to the suffering those families are experiencing — so that it’s leveraged in order for there to be fewer families who have suffered these losses,” Bunn said of the need to get a large majority of people to take the vaccine to significantly slow the spread of the virus. “We need to get needles in arms.”",
            "Amy DeGurian, a grief expert and faculty lecturer at the University of Pittsburgh’s school of social work, noted how a national day of mourning would be important given how “so much of the grief that has occurred has been isolated.” As traditional funerals are replaced with Zoom memorials or drive-thru services, “we have not been able to tend to others in their time of need,” she said.",
            "Since the coronavirus pandemic is ongoing, organizers would have to think of a meaningful way to mark this day while staying safe and distanced. DeGurian suggested that everyone across the country could light a candle in their window or outside their home, or a banner of each of the names of the dead could scroll at the same time on national television. What’s key is for people to not feel alone in their grief.",
            "“You are more likely to have complicated grief when you grieve alone, more likely to have prolonged grief when you don’t have support, more likely to have lingering issues when you don’t have intervention,” DeGurian said. “We need each other.”",
            "Historian Diana Appelbaum, who wrote recently on the politics behind the creation of American holidays, noted that there are currently dozens of days of observance, most of which the vast majority of Americans pay zero attention to — such as Aviation Day or Safe Boating Week.",
            "Whether a national day of mourning for coronavirus carries significance in the future depends largely on how many people are still affected. Memorial Day, for instance, was a solemn day for decades, as many Americans who fought in World War II were still alive. Today, most people mark it as a day off to barbecue or rent a beach house, as Appelbaum put it.",
            "“When this [pandemic] started and people said, ‘That horrible flu epidemic of 1918,’ was it even on your radar? Was it in your high school history book?” Appelbaum said, referring to the deadly Spanish influenza outbreak that began in 1918. “That’s what this will be — unless it marks the start of a series of such pandemics.”",
            "The latter scenario is certainly possible. Last month, Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, warned that, when it comes to the pandemic, “there will be a next time.”",
            "But for those living through this moment, Appelbaum had no doubt about the value of dedicating a day to mourning coronavirus victims: “It’s important for people who are living now to do this. I think it will be tremendously meaningful.”",

            "Kara Eastman was supposed to win this year. The polling looked good, she had come so close to winning the Omaha congressional seat in 2018, and this time, the national party was all in for her. Progressive activists were eager to show that their ideas could win outside heavily blue areas. And Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District, which includes metropolitan Omaha and a more rural area around a military base, was as good a place as any.",
            "But the vindication progressives had hoped for never materialized. Eastman lost last month to Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.) by more than she had in 2018 (4.5 percentage points compared to 2 points two years ago). President-elect Joe Biden’s 6.5-point win in the district, four years after President Donald Trump won there, made Eastman’s defeat that much more frustrating.",
            "Eastman’s loss was a blow to Democrats hoping to expand their majority in the House. But it was an especially painful loss for the party’s progressive wing, which wanted to show it could do more than just oust incumbent Democrats in ultra-liberal seats. It wanted to demonstrate the viability of its preferred policies in the swing seats and states that determine control of Congress. The left touted Eastman’s race as a marquee opportunity to show that progressive policies designed to excite the party base are assets, rather than liabilities.",
            "The party tried to do things differently than it had in 2018. After Eastman defeated former Rep. Brad Ashford (D) in the 2018 primary, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee was late to endorse her and provided her relatively modest financial support. Bacon’s campaign heavily outspent Eastman until the final weeks. Eastman’s supporters believed an extra push from the party establishment would have pushed her over the finish line.",
            "This cycle, the DCCC tried to correct its mistake, endorsing Eastman from the moment she won her primary and spending $3.5 million to try to elect her with more modest support from progressive groups.",
            "Many of the forces that sank Eastman were out of her control. She received nearly 34,000 more votes than she had in 2018, but a surge in Republican turnout limited the impact of those gains. Ashford, the man Eastman defeated in the 2018 primary, worked against her. Eastman also defeated Ashford’s wife, Ann, in the 2020 primary, and Ashford endorsed Bacon, providing the GOP congressman with a valuable talking point. And plenty of Republicans who voted for Biden out of their disdain for Trump probably would not have elected a Democrat to Congress regardless of their positions or background.",
            "“Republicans just came out like crazy and voted for Biden and Bacon,” Eastman told HuffPost in an interview. “I personally don’t think it would have mattered who was running in my seat. I think the Democrat would have lost.”",
            "But Eastman’s race also offers some lessons for progressives eager to win seats like hers in the future. Republicans succeeded in casting Eastman as a radical left-wing figure partly because of her support for Medicare for All, her positive comments about Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and her affiliation with grassroots groups and causes associated with the movement to “defund the police.”",
            "What’s more, the progressive groups that had once been the foundation of Eastman’s support did little to offset the damage inflicted by Bacon and his allies, spreading small amounts of money between multiple TV ads in contravention of traditional campaign strategy.",
            "“By the 2020 election cycle, she already had a definition and they spent several million dollars reinforcing that definition and making it even worse,” said Paul Landow, a political science professor at the University of Nebraska, Omaha, who previously served as a top aide to a Democratic mayor of Omaha and a Democratic member of Congress from Nebraska. “When there’s that kind of money floating around, you’ve got a pretty good chance of making it happen. And they did.”",
            "The Creation Of ‘Comrade’ Kara",
            "It’s not hard to see what progressives saw in Eastman. As a social worker and the founder of the lead safety nonprofit Omaha Healthy Kids Alliance, Eastman boasts deep community roots in the district’s biggest population center. And she spoke movingly about how her mother’s struggle paying medical bills associated with cancer informed her commitment to providing health care as a right to all Americans.",
            "Although she did not vote for Sanders in the 2016 presidential primary, she told Politico she was a “big Bernie Sanders fan” and shared that her daughter had canvassed for him. Eastman’s platform reflected her affinity for the Vermont senator. In that first congressional run, in particular, Eastman ran as an unabashed proponent of a Medicare for All, single-payer health care system, a $15 minimum wage and free tuition at public colleges. And unlike the national party, Eastman’s campaign embraced the activist left’s belief that turning out infrequent, liberal-leaning voters made catering to moderate Republicans unnecessary.",
            "Since Eastman nearly unseated Bacon with little help from the national party during her first run, the plan seems to have worked. But in fact, the circumstances of the 2018 midterm elections were uniquely favorable for the left and did not necessarily provide a roadmap to victory in elections where the electorate would be less lopsided toward highly educated Democrats.",
            "“2018 was a Democratic wave year,” said David Shor, a data scientist who consults for Democratic candidates and campaigns.",
            "“In midterms, voters are much more educated. There are fewer working-class voters,” he added. “That creates a more fertile ground for highly ideological candidates.”",
            "Instead of serving as a template for an even stronger performance during a presidential election year, Eastman’s freewheeling remarks during the 2018 campaign provided fodder for Republican attacks in what would turn out to be a more favorable environment for the GOP in 2020.",
            "The National Republican Congressional Committee, which is House Republicans’ campaign arm, used these comments to characterize Eastman, whom they nicknamed “Comrade Kara,” as a socialist in the Sanders mold, rather than a Biden-style Democrat of the kind suburbanites and military families could stomach. One NRCC spot that aired more than 300 times beginning in early October featured a clip of Eastman telling a left-wing host in 2018, “Full disclosure: I love Bernie Sanders,” according to Kantar Media/CMAG. (All references to TV ads in this story rely on data from Kantar Media/CMAG.)",
            "Republicans also dishonestly pulled a clip of Eastman mocking how Republicans say of her, “I’m a radical socialist.” One TV ad from the GOP super PAC Defending Main Street that aired more than 100 times replayed the clip of her without clarifying that she reiterated it to laugh at how preposterous the characterization was.",
            "“What this really came down to was that Don Bacon is a moderate, commonsense Republican who is in line with the district, and Kara Eastman is a socialist who is far to the left of the district,” said NRCC spokesperson Bob Salera.",
            "Another advantage for Republicans this election cycle was that Biden, who was expected to perform well in Omaha’s highly educated, Republican-leaning suburbs, was on record condemning Medicare for All in the strongest of terms.",
            "The NRCC funded at least two TV ads using Biden’s words condemning Medicare for All to attack Eastman. The ads, which aired more than 600 times beginning in September, quoted Biden lamenting that Medicare for All would cost “$30 trillion” and would mean “Washington dictating to you, ‘You cannot keep the plan you have.’” Another NRCC spot that aired more than 300 times in October contrasted Eastman’s support for a Green New Deal with Biden’s opposition to it, deeming Eastman “too extreme for Joe Biden.”",
            "“If you just look at how Biden performed versus Kara, Kara did not fit the district,” said Nebraska Democratic Party Chairwoman Jane Kleeb.",
            "Struggling To Push Back",
            "Eastman and Democrats hammered Bacon, in turn, for his vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act. As a freshman lawmaker in March 2017, Bacon said prior to voting for the repeal bill that would have allowed states to opt out of federal protections for people with preexisting conditions that he was changing his vote from “‘yes’ to ‘hell, yes.’” The phrase came up again and again in Democratic ads, albeit without the video evidence that gave Republican attacks against Eastman extra punch.",
            "Campaigns and outside groups generally try to concentrate as much money as possible in individual ads to maximize the likelihood that voters will see a particular message. And the DCCC highlights the themes it wants those outside groups to amplify on an opposition research page ― or “red box” ― designed to circumvent campaign finance rules against coordinating with outside groups. In its red box on Eastman’s race, the DCCC said “voters in Omaha should see” that Bacon voted “hell yes” to repealing the ACA and for defunding Planned Parenthood.",
            "Some of Eastman’s progressive allies, such as the Congressional Progressive Caucus PAC, amplified the red box message with six-figure digital ad buys.",
            "But other groups spread their resources thinly over a greater number of ads with differing themes ― a tactical mistake, according to several veteran campaign operatives.",
            "Justice Democrats’ pro-Eastman blitz ― funded jointly with MoveOn, the Sunrise Movement and the Working Families Party ― spent $60,000 on a TV ad hitting Bacon for voting against funding to clean up drinking water. The spot aired just 34 times, though it echoed themes in an ad funded by the End Citizens United PAC that aired more than 125 times.",
            "The progressive coalition spent another $167,000 on a TV ad that aired nearly 130 times emphasizing Bacon’s ACA repeal vote. A separate TV ad funded by the Progressive Change Campaign Committee and Rebellion PAC’s super PAC focusing on Bacon’s resistance to COVID-19 relief ― and a secondary mention of Bacon’s ACA repeal vote ― aired just 36 times. (The super PAC spent a total of $200,000 on Eastman’s behalf, including on cable TV ads not counted by Kantar Media/CMAG.)",
            "Asked why Justice Democrats had decided to do a smaller ad buy about clean water, a Justice Democrats spokesperson said, “We had interest from the Working Families Party and other partners on that message.” The spokesperson noted that the ad expanded on the spot run by End Citizens United.",
            "Justice Democrats did not join forces with the PCCC on a single, unified ad campaign because they were already in the process of producing their own ads when the groups approached one another about cooperating, according to the Justice Democrats spokesperson. The PCCC declined to comment for this story.",
            "Landow, the veteran Nebraska Democrat and politics expert, blames the national party as well as progressive groups for a “bungled response” that failed to adequately shape the narrative.",
            "“It was too little, too late and didn’t come close to hitting the nail on the head,” he said.",
            "For his part, Bacon simply lied about the implications of his vote, co-opting the “hell yes” phrase as a description for his commitment to protecting people with preexisting conditions. He likely benefited from a national environment where Democratic attacks on the ACA repeal vote did not resonate as strongly as they had in 2018.",
            "Bacon, who is a retired general, also took pains to cast himself as the more moderate and bipartisan candidate in the race. For example, he funded an ad that featured a Black woman who said Bacon was the first Republican she was voting for.",
            "“It was a referendum at the federal level on Trump and we couldn’t make the case that Bacon was a madman,” Crystal Rhoades, who sits on the Nebraska Public Service Commission and is a former chair of the Douglas County Democratic Party, told HuffPost. “We didn’t do enough to tie them together.”",
            "Eastman tried her own version of bipartisan jiujitsu with a TV spot that featured the endorsement of Republican state Sen. John McCollister.",
            "But she never settled on a clear response to attacks on her support for Medicare for All. She defended the policy on the merits during an October debate with Bacon. Yet in a campaign ad, she sought to skirt the issue by highlighting Biden’s endorsement of her bid and their shared commitment to lowering prescription drug prices and “expanding health care for all families.”",
            "“We know that if you’re running a campaign and you’re trying to explain things to people, then you’re losing,” Eastman said.",
            "In ads and on the stump, Eastman ran as a crusader against corruption who refused corporate PAC money so voters could be confident that she would “put families first, not special interests.”",
            "“I see people talking about, ‘Well, you just have to run on a strong economic message,’” Eastman said. “We did run on a strong economic message.”",
            "Whether elevating validators like McCollister or promoting her plans to reduce prescription drug prices, Eastman found herself frustrated by her inability to cut through the narrative perpetuated by Republicans on the airwaves. She told HuffPost that she had greater success dispelling misconceptions in one-on-one conversations with voters.",
            "But Eastman’s campaign paused its door-knocking program in March due to the COVID-19 pandemic and resumed literature drops in September in lieu of face-to-face conversations. The DCCC’s opposition to canvassing also prompted the state party to shelve its plans to canvass with heavy health precautions, according to Kleeb.",
            "“I don’t think they ever came out and said, ‘If candidates door-knock, you will lose funding.’ But they said, ‘They cannot door-knock,’” she said. “That hurt Democrats everywhere.”",
            "The Don Kleine Debacle",
            "In congressional races, Republicans ran 216 advertisements on broadcast television attacking Democrats for being anti-police and pro-riots. Out of that total, 157 ads that aired 103,000 times specifically blasted Democrats for their association with the slogan “defund the police.”",
            "Republicans ran at least three such TV spots that aired more than 900 times against Eastman. One Bacon campaign spot featured two Omaha policewomen warning that Eastman would throw cops under the bus “for her radical friends in New York” as an image of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) appeared on-screen. Another Bacon ad tying Eastman to riots in Portland, Oregon; Kenosha, Wisconsin; and Omaha featured Tony Conner, the Black president of Omaha’s police union, declaring that Bacon would stand against “radicals who want to defund the police.”",
            "Unlike some Democrats who faced down policing-related attacks by marshaling law enforcement officers of their own to affirm their pro-police credentials in TV ads, Eastman and her allies did not use TV ads to rebut claims that she was beholden to radical, anti-police forces.",
            "But in public appearances, Eastman made clear that she does not support “defunding” the police. And unlike with some of Eastman’s other missteps, Republicans did not have footage of her saying anything that could be construed that way.",
            "What they had instead was Eastman’s reaction to white bar owner Jake Gardner’s killing of James Scurlock, a young Black man, in downtown Omaha on May 30. Omaha, like other areas of the country, was swept up in a wave of protests against police brutality over the summer, some of which spilled into vandalism and looting. Scurlock was allegedly part of a group of people who broke the glass of Gardner’s bar and got into a fight with Gardner’s aging father. Video appeared to show him engaged in a physical scuffle with Gardner and his father, who were trying to guard their store, when Gardner shot him to death with his handgun.",
            "The following morning, Eastman denounced the killing on Twitter as a “cold-blooded murder.”",
            "But Don Kleine, a Democrat serving as Douglas County’s prosecutor since 2006, announced two days after the killing that after a review of grainy video of the incident, he was declining to press charges against Gardner. Scurlock had pinned Gardner to the ground and held his head in a headlock, according to Kleine. In his press conference announcing the decision, Kleine also blasted Eastman without naming her, arguing that her characterization of the killing was “reckless” and “dangerous to our community.” Republicans would end up using those comments in attack ads against Eastman.",
            "The progression of the judicial process brought new headaches for Eastman. Scurlock’s family, Omaha’s Black community and progressive Nebraskans were outraged by Kleine’s initial decision not to prosecute, which they condemned as a rush to judgment. A neighboring bar owner said that Gardner and his father had “instigated” the fight with racists comments, including the elder Gardner’s use of the “n-word.”",
            "Under pressure, Kleine reversed his decision, convening a grand jury and appointing a special counsel to determine whether to bring charges. The grand jury indicted Gardner in September, for manslaughter, “terroristic threats” and other charges. Shortly before he was to turn himself in, he died by suicide in Oregon.",
            "The indictment and the suicide sparked another round of recriminations in Omaha as Kleine held a press conference to dispute characterizations of Gardner as a Trump-loving vigilante who provoked an altercation with Scurlock, instead claiming that Scurlock was the one involved in “terrorizing” other people.",
            "Kleine’s remarks angered Scurlock’s family and many Democrats. The Nebraska Democratic Party responded by passing a harshly worded resolution stating that Kleine’s handling of the Scurlock case “perpetuated white supremacy.”",
            "The move pushed Kleine to leave the Democratic Party and register as a Republican. Top Republicans in the state held a rally welcoming him to the Republican Party in early October with early voting underway. At the event, Kleine revealed that he had already cast his ballot for Trump, crediting Trump for being a “law-and-order guy.”",
            "Many Nebraska Democrats fault Kleeb for passing a resolution that effectively drove a ranking elected official out of the party and heightening the apparent gulf between the state’s old guard of moderate and conservative Democrats and progressives like Eastman.",
            "“That should have never happened,” said Ben Gray, the only Black member of the Omaha city council.",
            "Kleeb, however, insists the resolution helped all Democrats on the ballot by showing people of color, young people and progressives that the party had their back.",
            "“They saw us standing up to someone who was disparaging an African-American man who was shot by a racist bar owner,” she said.",
            "Gray sees the Scurlock killing as a complicated one. He believes that Gardner should not have been taking the defense of his own stores into his hands and put himself in a situation where he would be confronting looters, but that once Gardner was accosted, he shot Scurlock in an effort to defend himself.",
            "As a supporter of Eastman’s, Gray wishes that the Democratic congressional candidate had reserved judgment before calling the killing a “cold-blooded murder.”",
            "“If I had my choice and I had been running the campaign, I wouldn’t have had her say anything,” Gray said. “I never say anything about an event until I know all the facts about an event.”",
            "Yet despite her loss, Eastman has no regrets about her stand on behalf of Scurlock.",
            "“Calling that murder to me doesn’t seem very bold,” she said. “It just seems commonsensical.”"

            "“Many saw it, and watched,” she said in a Twitter thread. “I could never anticipate what to expect: would I be grilled on my work (which was very good) or harassed about my looks. Or would it be both in the same conversation?”",
            "Cuomo’s press secretary, Caitlin Girouard, denied the allegations against the governor in a statement to HuffPost on Sunday. “There is simply no truth to these claims,” she said.",
            "Boylan worked for the Cuomo administration from March 2015 to October 2018. She served as deputy secretary with the state’s economic development agency, Empire State Development, and then as a special adviser to the governor, according to her LinkedIn profile.",
            "Boylan, who did not immediately provide any corroborating evidence on the sexual harassment allegations against Cuomo, said in comments posted to Twitter that she has no interest in speaking with journalists about her allegations. She did not respond to requests for comment from HuffPost or reportedly from several other news outlets.",
            "“I am about validating the experience of countless women and making sure abuse stops,” she said.",
            "Boylan’s allegations came after she tweeted last week that working for Cuomo was the “most toxic team environment” and that people were “deathly afraid of him.”",
            "“I’ve had many jobs. Waitressing at Friendly’s as a teenager was an infinitely more respectful environment. Even when I had bad customers who tipped poorly,” she tweeted. “If people weren’t deathly afraid of him, they’d be saying the same thing and you’d already know the stories.”",
            "Internal documents obtained by HuffPost, also reported by the Associated Press, indicate that Boylan resigned from her position with Empire State Development in 2018 after several co-workers accused her of abusive behavior. Complaints to Human Resources against her alleged bullying, yelling and treating staff “like children.” Two employees asked to file their complaints anonymously due to “a significant fear of retaliation,” the report states.",
            "Boylan offered to resign during an “employment counseling” session at which the complaints were raised, according to an internal memo. Several days later, during a phone conversation with administration lawyer Alphonso David, Boylan admitted to having made mistakes but asked if she could rescind her resignation, according to a memorandum of the call.",
            "A former worker at Empire State Development, who spoke with HuffPost on the condition of anonymity, said she personally witnessed Boylan yelling at staff and threatening to fire workers. “Some of the words she used were just not acceptable, and it could be heard throughout the whole entire floor,” the source said. “I don’t think she has any footing to speak about toxicity or any kind of harassment when that is what she did to many people.”",
            "Boylan turned to the campaign trail the year after leaving the Cuomo administration, with an unsuccessful run against U.S. Rep. Jerrold Nadler in the spring of 2019. She announced her campaign for Manhattan Borough President this fall."

            "America is on the verge of an unprecedented eviction crisis. On Dec. 31, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s nationwide eviction moratorium will expire. According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, somewhere between 12 million and 17 million households — up to 40 million people — have little or no confidence that they can pay their rent and avoid eviction if they don’t get relief.",
            "“We’re looking at the very real possibility of tens of millions of people losing their homes this winter during a spike in COVID-19,” said NLIHC President Diane Yentel.",
            "The looming eviction crisis is not only a moral failing and a financial catastrophe, but an unprecedented public health disaster. A large body of evidence has found links between evictions and health outcomes ranging from homelessness to domestic violence to chronic stress.",
            "“If we get a wave of mass evictions in the new year, we’re going to see a huge range of long-term effects,” said Kathryn Leifheit, a UCLA researcher who studies the effect of housing disruptions on health.",
            "Children often have to transfer schools after an eviction, she said, which can affect their cognitive skills. Due to the difficulty of securing an apartment with an eviction on their record, adults often end up moving to more distant and lower-quality housing. Even being threatened with eviction can spike blood pressure, exacerbate mental illness, and provoke chronic stress.",
            "And, in a darkly ironic twist, evictions may even end up prolonging the pandemic that triggered them in the first place. Before the CDC enacted its nationwide eviction moratorium in early September, the agency left it up to states to decide what to do about tenants who fell behind on their rent. During the spring, 44 states enacted short-term moratoriums. In the summer, 33 of them lifted the bans.",
            "Leifheit and her co-authors published a study last month that found states that lifted their eviction bans had double the cases and five times more deaths compared to states that left their eviction bans in place. North Carolina, for example, banned evictions in April. When the state lifted the ban June 20, renters were left unprotected until the CDC moratorium went into effect on Sept. 4. Authorities carried out an estimated 18,000 evictions in those three months. Leifheit’s study found this resulted in 15,690 extra coronavirus cases and 304 deaths.",
            "Across the U.S., evictions led to 434,000 COVID-19 cases and nearly 11,000 deaths. But only a small portion of those deaths likely occurred among people who were evicted themselves, Leifheit said. The vast majority were second- and third-degree infections caused by evicted tenants coming in contact with other people through their households or jobs.",
            "“We tend to think about the link between evictions and COVID-19 as an individual process — someone gets evicted, they get COVID-19 and then, in the worst-case scenario, they die,” Leiftheit said. “But a wave of evictions ends up increasing the risk for everyone.”",
            "An urgent problem",
            "Even before the pandemic, America’s renters were in crisis. In 2018, nearly half of tenant households were spending over one-third of their income on rent. Black people, Latinos and families with children made up the bulk of America’s 3.6 million evictions every year.",
            "The pandemic has put that crisis on steroids. Since the start of the year, roughly 46 million Americans — roughly one-quarter of the workforce — have filed for unemployment benefits. The Urban Institute, a think tank, estimated in June that 20% of renter households included at least one person who had lost their job in the first two months of the pandemic.",
            "So far, the economic effects of the pandemic have hit renters disproportionately hard. The sectors most severely impacted — retail, restaurants, bars and tourism — employ large numbers of low-wage workers. In October, the NLIHC found that 26% of Black renters and 18% of Latino renters were behind on rent, compared to just 10% of white renters. Those who could pay were increasingly relying on credit cards, selling possessions and borrowing money from family and friends.",
            "“We’re seeing a different population facing eviction than we’ve ever had before,” said Pam Bridge, the director of advocacy for Community Legal Services, a Phoenix-based legal aid nonprofit that helps tenants avoid eviction. Over the last four months, Bridge has started to see clients from a wider range of the income scale. She used to mostly see unemployed and hourly workers. Now she gets office workers and Uber drivers.",
            "“The people being evicted aren’t necessarily low-income anymore,” she said. “We’ve got a lot more people dealing with evictions who have never been through one before and have no idea how the process works.”",
            "So far, COVID-19 hasn’t resulted in an avalanche of evictions, mostly due to the CDC’s soon-to-expire nationwide eviction moratorium. (The CDC declined to comment for this story.) The moratorium order, however, contains two significant loopholes: Tenants have to prove that the pandemic directly caused their failure to pay rent, and it only stops the evictions ― not all the legal processes and fees that come along with them.",
            "These provisions mean that a significant number of evictions are still trickling through the courts. Bridge said in many cases she deals with, the court has issued a judgment saying the tenant needs to vacate their apartment, but sheriffs won’t enforce it until after the CDC lifts the moratorium.",
            "That’s good news compared to being put out on the streets. But Bridge said renters often can’t find new apartments with an eviction judgment on their record. Plus, the court process can cost up to $200 in administrative fees — a tall order for workers already behind on rent.",
            "“Our COVID-19 numbers are the worst they’ve ever been, we’re in the middle of a pandemic, and we’re three weeks away from people having nowhere to go,” Bridge said.",
            "How an eviction crisis becomes a public health crisis",
            "While evictions do indeed spike homelessness rates, Bridge said most people don’t end up sleeping on the streets. Most of them end up moving in with family and friends while they sort out their finances and look for a new apartment.",
            "Under normal circumstances, this post-eviction “doubling up” would be a tragedy. During the coronavirus pandemic, it has become a significant health risk. According to a modeling study published in November, members of households that moved in together due to an eviction had a 40% higher risk of contracting COVID-19. Low-income workers already live in smaller homes than wealthy workers; each extra person moving into a crowded household makes it harder to maintain social distance and avoid respiratory droplets.",
            "These arrangements are also often a step along the path into homelessness, another significant risk factor for contracting COVID-19.",
            "“Once someone ends up in the shelter system, it gets a lot harder to socially distance and quarantine,” Yentel said.",
            "Even with the moratorium in place, this spiral is already playing out for low-income Americans. One of Bridge’s clients is a restaurant server who couldn’t handle the stress of being threatened with eviction and decided to move herself and her children into her sister’s home. Others have had to miss work to take care of older family members with COVID-19 — a situation that threatens their income and their health alike.",
            "Contact tracing studies earlier in the pandemic found that roughly 45% of new infections came from people living in the same household.",
            "And these impacts don’t just affect renters. Poor tenants are more likely to be essential workers, take public transportation and rely on food banks. These activities put them in contact with other people and risk extending the chain of coronavirus infection — and fueling even more evictions.",
            "“We’re starting to understand the relationship between evictions and health as cyclical,” Leifheit said. “Evictions lead to poor health, but poor health also leads to evictions.”",
            "Rent relief is a no-brainer",
            "The only good news about the eviction crisis is that it can be prevented with a relatively straightforward fix: rental assistance.",
            "“It’s kind of maddening because of how simple it is,” Yentel said. In June, the Urban Institute estimated the cost of providing relief to every rent-burdened household in America at $15.5 billion per month. The latest bipartisan stimulus proposal includes $25 billion in rental assistance — “It’s not enough but it’s a step in the right direction,” Yentel said — but the fate of the proposal remains unclear.",
            "Rent relief is a rare political no-brainer. Tenants (who want to pay their rents) and landlords (who want rental income) alike support it. It’s also a bargain: An eviction-driven homelessness crisis could cost up to $129 billion in extra spending for emergency shelters, medical care and other services, far more than the price tag for preventing it in the first place, according to an NLIHC analysis. And even that astronomical figure doesn’t include the second- and third-order effects of cities across the country experiencing a crash in home and rental prices as vacancy rates explode.",
            "“It’s extraordinarily shortsighted and cruel to allow this many evictions to occur,” Yentel said. “This was entirely predictable. And the solutions are simple even if they’re not easy.”"

            "The online grocery platform released its first “New Year, New Cart” 2021 report with at-home food trends, shopping habits and attitudes to look out for. It seems after indulging in comfort foods and booze to cope in 2020, consumers will be shifting to lower-alcohol cocktails, keto snacks and bolder spices, among other trends.",
            "The Instacart report combines a in-depth analysis of Instacart search and purchase activity and a new online survey conducted by The Harris Poll. The folks at Instacart compared searches and sales from Jan. 1, 2019, through Nov. 1, 2019, to activity from the same period in 2020 to identify trending products and categories. Meanwhile, the survey took place from Nov. 5-9 and reached 2,050 U.S. adults ages 18 and older.",
            "Without further ado, here are the five grocery trends to look forward to in 2021.",
            "Flavorful Spices And Condiments",
            "Although many turned to their favorite comfort foods this year, Instacart’s data suggests people may be trying to spice things up more in 2021. The report identified five spices and condiments that got a big boost in year-over-year sales: piri piri sauce (up 725%), Lao Gan Ma (up 227%), za’atar (up 39%), turmeric (up 18%) and gojuchang (up 17%).",
            "“2021 is shaping up to be a flavorful year. Consumers are looking for quick and easy ways to spice up the meals they’ve been making at home, and we’re seeing a lot of interest in handcrafted shelf-stable sauces and spice blends on the Instacart marketplace,“ said Instacart trends expert and senior product manager Laurentia Romaniuk.",
            "Keto, Keto, Keto",
            "According to Instacart’s survey, 28% of those who tried a diet in 2020 opted for the high-fat, low-carb keto diet. Sales trends were consistent with the survey, as products with “keto” in the name saw a 72% increase in the Instacart marketplace.",
            "The cities that had the most keto product orders this year were Austin, San Francisco, San Diego, Sacramento, Houston, Los Angeles, San Antonio, Denver, Chicago and Tampa. Additionally, Instacart found that keto treats in particular were in demand for adherents to the diet. The platform identified the 10 most popular keto products in the marketplace:",
            "KetoPint Salt and Caramel Keto Bar\n\nThink! Keto Protein Bar ― Chocolate Peanut Butter Pie flavored\n\nBirch Benders Keto Pancake and Waffle Mix\n\nSundae Shoppe Keto Peanut Butter Fudge Ice Cream\n\nSundae Shoppe Keto Cookie Dough Ice Cream\n\nLenny and Larry’s Keto Gluten Free Chocolate Chip Cookie\n\nSundae Shoppe Keto Mint Chip Ice Cream\n\nEpic Chicken Sriracha Protein Bar\n\nRatio Keto Friendly Strawberry Dairy Snack\n\nRatio Keto Friendly Vanilla Dairy Snack",
            "Less Potent Alcohol",
            "“Homemade craft cocktails have been popular this year with the work-from-home crowd,” Romaniuk said. “We’ve seen sales for trendy alcohol-free spirits boom, increasing by 195% year-over-year. Perhaps consumers are looking to turn over a new leaf in 2021 with tasty, guilt-free libations.”",
            "In addition to booze-free spirits, consumers have also indicated rising interest in low-calorie alcohol beverages and alcoholic versions of healthy drinks. Hard kombucha rose 320% in Instacart searches, with the most purchases coming from Seattle, San Diego, Sacramento, Los Angeles and San Francisco.",
            "While White Claw continues to dominate, searches for brands across the hard seltzer category rose 519% compared to 2019, and sales spiked in Orlando, Chicago, St. Louis, Tampa and Washington, D.C.",
            "Brand Mindfulness",
            "The year 2020 brought a racial reckoning that raised awareness for many brands owned by people of color. The economic crisis also highlighted the importance of supporting small, locally owned brands.",
            "About 23% of the Instacart survey respondents have researched brands that are locally run or owned in 2020, and 14% said they’ve researched brands run or owned by women and by BIPOC. The grocery platform predicts consumers will continue to be selective about the stores and brands they support in 2021.",
            "Instacart also put together a list of five women and BIPOC-owned brands to look out for in 2021, based on high-performers that have seen search traffic increases this year:",
            "Partake Foods ― Allergen-free cookies\n\nPipcorn ― Heirloom corn snacks\n\nPitmaster LT’s ― Kansas City-style BBQ products\n\nGlory Foods ― Seasoned vegetables\n\nUncle Nearest ― Premium whiskey",
            "Weekday Warriors",
            "With the work-from-home flexibility of 2020, Instacart unsurprisingly saw changes to the grocery shopping schedules people follow. The number of orders placed between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. during the work week rose by 32%.",
            "Twenty-two percent of survey respondents said they shifted from weekend to weekday grocery shopping runs this year, and the number of Instacart orders placed on weekdays increased by 8%. The report predicts that this evolution from the “Sunday Shop” to the “Monday Mission” or the “Tuesday Trip” may continue into the following year."

            "The Tony-winning actor and singer on Friday unveiled a new single, “(Everybody’s Waitin’ for) The Man with a Plan,” a politically tinged send-up of 1950’s “(Everybody’s Waitin’ for) The Man with the Bag.”",
            "Viewable above, the music video finds Benanti and a troupe of dancers executing Rockettes-style choreography as images of the White House and, of course, Melania’s infamous Christmas decorations appear behind them. Unlike the original, “(Everybody’s Waitin’ for) The Man with a Plan” swaps out Santa Claus for President-elect Joe Biden, who Benanti hopes will make America “feel normal again.”",
            "In an interview with HuffPost, Benanti said she found inspiration for the new song by watching classic holiday movies like “White Christmas.” She revised the lyrics in collaboration with comedian Randy Rainbow, who is known for skewering President Donald Trump and other members of the current administration with his musical YouTube series.",
            "“Randy’s brand of satire is my cup of tea and he was the first person I thought of for a holiday parody like this,” she said. “I’ve been wanting to collaborate with him for a while, and this was the perfect opportunity!”",
            "“(Everybody’s Waitin’ for) The Man with a Plan” wraps up a busy year for Benanti, who won a Tony Award in 2008 for “Gypsy” and is beloved by Broadway fans for her performances in “She Loves Me” and “My Fair Lady,” among other musicals.",
            "And though she also boasts a number of screen credits, she’s perhaps best known to television audiences for her impersonations of the first lady on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.”",
            "As well-received as her version of Melania has been, Benanti is ready to move on, and in October, she unveiled her self-titled solo album. Before COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, she’d planned to launch the record, which features versions of classic songs as well as pop tunes made famous by Selena Gomez and Rufus Wainwright, with a residency-style series of concerts in New York.",
            "Instead, Benanti wound up spending most of 2020 hunkered down with family in New Jersey, and sadly, lost a grandmother to the coronavirus.",
            "But 2021, as well as the waning weeks of 2020, are looking up. She’s the executive producer of “Homeschool Musical: Class of 2020,” a documentary-style special featuring performances by high school students whose school productions were canceled by the pandemic and slated to debut on HBO Max next week. And she’s currently filming roles on “Younger” and the much-anticipated “Gossip Girl” reboot.",

            "But until then, she hopes viewers find some solace in “(Everybody’s Waitin’ for) The Man with a Plan.”",
            "“Honestly, I just want to make people laugh, and give them some holiday cheer,” she said. “If I’ve learned anything during the four years I’ve portrayed Melania Trump ... it’s that the crazier things are, the more we need to laugh, and 2020 has been crazy as hell.”"

            "The Republicans embracing Trump’s cause, and the nonsensical conspiracy theories used to justify it, come from every level of government. They include prominent senators like Texas’ Ted Cruz, ambitious attorneys general, well-known conservative bombthrowers and little-known state legislators. They are egged on by a vocal portion of GOP voters who refuse to accept President-elect Joe Biden’s victory, and are unlikely to change their minds anytime soon.",
            "“This is going to be a long-term litmus test for some Republicans. Even though Trump’s leaving office, he’s not going to let go of the reins of the party,” said Ryan Williams, a GOP operative who was a top spokesman for Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign. He contrasted Trump with former Republican President George W. Bush: “He’s not going to go back to Crawford, Texas, to paint portraits of dogs and foreign leaders.”",
            "The efforts have zero chance of actually overthrowing the election. Almost every Republican with the power to somehow impact the result has declined to indulge Trump’s delusions, and many have subsequently faced vociferous criticism from other members of their party.",
            "“I make the distinction between what’s professional wrestling and what’s a serious attempt to undermine democracy,” said Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, a Democrat who has repeatedly worked to shoot down conspiracy theories about Biden’s narrow win in the state. He noted GOP leaders in Pennsylvania’s state Legislature “have never made an actual move to overthrow the election result.”",
            "The most recent evidence of the GOP’s decision to back Trump’s claims came on Wednesday afternoon, when 17 state attorneys general submitted an amicus brief to the Supreme Court backing a spurious lawsuit from Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton seeking to throw out the election results in four states won by Biden: Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan and Georgia.",
            "Trump, meanwhile, is actively asking congressional Republicans to sign on to a similar amicus brief, written by Louisiana GOP Rep. Mike Johnson, backing the Texas lawsuit.",
            "“President Trump called me this morning to express his great appreciation for our effort to file an amicus brief in the Texas case on behalf of concerned members of Congress,” Johnson wrote in an email to his fellow House Republicans, which was first obtained by CNN. “He specifically asked me to contact all Republican members of the House and Senate today and request that all join on to our brief. He said he will be anxiously awaiting the final list to review.”",
            "One hundred and five House Republicans, more than half of the party caucus, signed on to Johnson’s brief, which was filed Thursday afternoon.",
            "Paxton’s suit illustrates the self-interested game many elected Republicans are playing. Paxton, who is facing a federal investigation for securities fraud, is thought to be lobbying for a pardon from Trump before the president leaves office.",
            "Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson also announced Wednesday that he would hold a Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing on “irregularities in the 2020 election” next week, though it’s unclear who the witnesses will be.",
            "After being pressured by Trump to overturn Biden’s win in Pennsylvania, 64 elected state legislators there sent a letter to their congressional delegation urging them to reject the state’s Biden electors in January. State Senate Majority Leader Kim Ward, a Republican, did not see the letter in time to sign it, according to The New York Times, but suggested pressure from the base made it impossible for her to say if she would not have signed it.",
            "“If I would say to you, ‘I don’t want to do it,’” Ward told the Times, “I’d get my house bombed tonight.”",
            "Republican lawmakers in Arizona, Michigan and Pennsylvania felt the need to hold special hearings to allow the president’s lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis to air false conspiracy theories about supposed election fraud. The hearings ultimately forced the closure of the Arizona and Michigan legislatures after Giuliani and Ellis tested positive for the coronavirus after spreading it to legislators in both states.",
            "One of the lawsuits promoted by Giuliani and Ellis was filed by Republican Rep. Mike Kelly (Penn.) and failed congressional candidate Sean Parnell. After the suit failed at every level before reaching the U.S. Supreme Court, Cruz suggested, at Trump’s request, that he would offer his services to argue the case if the court took it up. The court refused to take the case on Tuesday with no dissent.",
            "Meanwhile, in Washington, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and Senate Rules Committee Chairman Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) voted to block the congressional inauguration committee from recognizing Biden as the president-elect.",
            "A slew of public surveys indicate a majority of Republican voters believe Trump’s unsupported claims about widespread election fraud. An NPR/PBS Newshour/Marist College poll released Wednesday morning found just 24% of Republicans trust the results, compared to 61% of Americans overall and 67% of independent voters. (An overwhelming 95% of Democrats said they trusted the results.)",
            "Backing the overturning of the election result and the end of American democracy is just the latest in the Republican Party’s long history of litmus tests imposed by the furthest right flank of the party. This dynamic was introduced into the party by the New Right political movement in the middle of the 20th century and became a routine feature after the movement took over the party after Ronald Reagan’s 1980 White House win.",
            "Since then, elected Republicans have been consistently pressured from the right to take increasingly extreme positions in order to fend off primary challengers from their conservative movement base.",
            "This played out when Rep. Tom DeLay (R-Texas) pressured House Republicans to impeach President Bill Clinton after the party lost seats in the 1998 midterm elections. “Besides, the DeLay camp says, a vote to impeach the President is the perfect inoculation for moderate Republicans under assault from conservatives in their districts,” CNN reported at the time.",
            "After President Barack Obama’s election, Republicans had to meet the litmus test of not supporting Obama — or even hugging him, as then-Republican Florida Gov. Charlie Crist learned. Appearing at an event to promote stimulus spending in his state, Crist hugged Obama — leading to a primary loss to Marco Rubio in the 2010 Senate race. Crist is now a Democratic House member.",
            "These litmus tests also often ran along ideological lines related to contemporary positions on immigration or gun rights or free market economics. But Trump’s election has mostly swept away these concerns and made the sole GOP litmus test fealty to Trump. There are a handful of elected Republicans who are willing to publicly cross Trump. And many of those who did hold office, like Sens. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) and Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) and Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.), retired. Rep. Justin Amash (I-Mich.) left the party before retiring. And some, like former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, lost party primaries because they weren’t pro-Trump enough.",
            "“The Republican Party has shifted,” Pawlenty said after losing his state’s Republican Party gubernatorial primary to a Trump supporter in 2018. “It is the era of Trump and I’m just not a Trump-like politician.”",
            "The party’s kneel-before-Trump litmus test also means that party members must either support the president’s worst actions or pretend not to see them. Members who dared attack Trump after the release of the Access Hollywood tape where he jokingly boasted of sexually assaulting women were savaged by pro-Trump opponents, and many lost primary elections. (More than two dozen women have accused Trump of sexual assault.) Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) was the only congressional Republican to vote to impeach Trump after the president tried to pressure Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 election on his behalf.",
            "And so now the Republican Party must defend Trump’s effort to steal the 2020 election and install himself as ruler to protect themselves from primary challenges. Whether or not the defense is sincere is irrelevant. By feeding their conservative base’s desire to believe that the election was stolen, elected Republicans are verifying those beliefs.",
            "Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, both Republicans, are already facing Trump’s wrath after they both certified Biden’s wins in their respective states. Trump tweeted that the two Republican governors “fight harder against us than do the Radical Left Dems.” He suggested that retiring Rep. Doug Collins (R-Ga.) primary Kemp in 2022.",
            "And while the midterm elections are a long way away, attacks on Kemp and Ducey could hurt GOP chances in key races in 2022. Democratic rising star Stacey Abrams, whose organizing has been credited with helping secure Biden’s victory in Georgia, plans to run for governor again. She’d almost certainly rather face the arch-conservative Collins than Kemp, an incumbent.",
            "Ducey is term-limited, but Senate Republicans are likely to try to persuade him to challenge Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, who will be running for a full term after winning a special election last month. Trump’s antagonism toward Ducey could encourage other Republicans to run for the party’s nomination.",
            "In Pennsylvania, meanwhile, Fetterman ― who is openly considering his own bid for Senate ― predicted almost every Republican running for office in the Keystone State would need to embrace Trump’s conspiracies.",
            "“There isn’t going to be a Republican that’s going to run on the platform that Joe Biden won the election fair and square,” he said. “If you represent a series of counties that voted 80% for Donald Trump and he says ‘X,’ and you don’t toe that line, you might as well look for a new line of work. There’s always going to be someone willing to primary you on that.”"

            "A video showing a simulation of someone sneezing near another person wearing a face shield has revealed exactly how much protection such face covers can offer ― and the answer is, not much.",
            "Researchers at Fukuoka University in Japan wanted to better understand what happens to the airflow around a face shield when someone nearby sneezes.",
            "They were particularly interested in sneezes because they produce a fluid phenomenon known as “vortex rings,” which lead researcher Fujio Akagi says is “a donut-shaped vortex that is generated by an instantaneous ejection of fluid from a circular orifice” ― a bit like bubble rings made by dolphins.",
            "Researchers found when a face shield wearer is exposed to a sneeze from an infected person standing about 3 feet away, the vortex rings generated by the sneeze capture microscopic droplets and transport them to the top and bottom edges of the face shield.",
            "They concluded that face shields alone are not “highly effective” to prevent COVID-19 infection, as aerosols can still be inhaled through the nose and mouth.",
            "On their own, face shields can help protect the wearer from the bulk of larger droplets caused by a cough or sneeze a short distance away, but studies have found smaller aerosols can travel up and underneath the shield.\n\nA study of healthcare workers found wearing a face shield reduced exposure to flu by 96% in the period immediately after a cough – from 18 inches away. But in the context of a smaller aerosol, the face shield was less effective, blocking only 68% of the cough.\n\nIn the half an hour period after a cough, during which the aerosol had dispersed throughout the room and larger particles had settled, the face shield was less effective, the study found ― with researchers concluding that people wearing face shields can still inhale infectious airborne particles.\n\n“They cannot be used as a substitute for respiratory protection when it is needed,” researchers said of face shields.",
            "Fujio Akagi tells HuffPost UK that people who want to prevent COVID-19 infection should wear a face mask under a face shield. Health experts agree ― and have continued to do so throughout the pandemic ― that doubling up offers the best protection.",
            "David Strain, a clinician at the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital in the UK, previously told HuffPost UK that face shields on their own are not protective and should be worn in addition to a face mask, rather than as a replacement. And Julian Tang, honorary associate professor in respiratory sciences at the University of Leicester, previously said face shields are “better than nothing,” but recommended wearing a shield and face mask together for “added protection.”",
            "One of the benefits of wearing a shield is that it can protect the eyes from potential droplet exposure, whereas a face mask alone cannot. They are also washable and re-useable, and less claustrophobic than masks.",
            "“However, as our research shows, small droplets and aerosolized COVID-19 can enter the shield and can be inhaled,” Akagi says. “So wearing a face mask and a face shield reinforces the weaknesses of both and is a much more effective preventive measure.”",
            "“We are currently developing and demonstrating several improved shields,” Akagi continues. “We want to contribute to keeping people safe from infection, and believe that one day in the near future, medical workers will be able to prevent infection using only a face shield and a regular mask or, ideally, with only a face shield.”",

            "Move over, PSL, it’s eggnog’s time to shine. For those of us who associate The Holidays™ with a glass of the custard-like beverage, the sight of bottles and cartons of nog snuggled against the usual dairy offerings at the grocery store is a welcome sight.",
            "But it’s also overwhelming! Which one do you choose? The generic grocery store brand, or the expensive organic stuff?",
            "While homemade eggnog is the best, it’s easier to grab a bottle at the store and live off of it for a week — put it in your coffee, turn it into a nightcap with bourbon, drink it from the bottle while standing at the fridge ... there are no more rules.",
            "Proper eggnog should have a golden color, but shouldn’t actually taste like eggs. It should be laced with nutmeg and maybe cinnamon. And when buying it at the store, there are obviously a lot of additives to be wary of, but sometimes you just have to do your best.",
            "To help make your holiday season more festive, HuffPost enlisted the help of Kelly Cornett, an Atlanta-based wine educator and host of the podcast ”A Cork in the Road.” We taste tested 11 nationally available eggnogs (three of them are nondairy) and there was definitely a clear winner. Here are the picks, from best to worst.",
            "Dairy Options",
            "1. Mayfield",
            "When Santa’s face is blown up and plastered on the bottle, it’s a sign of good things. Mayfield’s eggnog hit the right notes all the way around. It was a visual treat in the glass with a deep golden hue and plenty of flecks of spices, and had the flavor and texture to support it. “I’m so down with this,” Cornett said. “The texture is decadent. This is like dessert.”",
            "2. 365 Everyday Value",
            "The Whole Foods brand eggnog is not for the calorie-conscious — it packs a whopping 210 calories per half cup — but at least it’s incredibly delicious. Cornett’s first observation was how aromatic it was. “It kind of reminds me of when Cinnamon Toast Crunch sits in your cereal too long,” she said. Warming, and not too sweet with almost the right texture moved it up to No. 2 on our list. Bonus points for mostly pronounceable ingredients.",
            "3. Market Pantry",
            "The first thing you notice about the Target brand eggnog is how much it resembles melted ice cream. It’s slightly eggy, but has a strong vanilla and ginger flavor (ginger is great, but nutmeg is a defining spice of eggnog). While it wasn’t a beverage that we wanted to sit around and drink by the fire, the thinner consistency did seem like it would lend itself nicely to cooking (let’s say, French toast) and could be properly spiced in the process.",
            "4. Lactaid",
            "Lactaid is lactose-free (meaning it’s had an enzyme called lactase added to it), but that didn’t stop it from ranking moderately high on our list. It had a nice vanilla flavor with a hint of spice, making it delicious to sip, even if not as “noggy” as we would have liked.",
            "5. Southern Comfort",
            "The liqueur brand makes a booze-free eggnog and it’s ― fine. The color is so yellow it “resembles beaten eggs,” Cornett said, and it was almost cloyingly sweet. But we wouldn’t be offended if someone served us this, and maybe if you added some SoCo it would make a nice sipper.",
            "6. Promised Land Dairy",
            "Things were off to a — ahem — promising start with Promised Land and its old fashioned-looking bottle. The nog’s golden hue was inviting, but was too sweet and lacked depth. “That’s more like condensed milk kind of sweetness. Not a warm spice sweetness,” Cornett said. It was like drinking sugary liquid yogurt.",
            "7. Trader Joe’s",
            "We had high hopes for the Trader Joe’s brand of eggnog, but it thudded harder than Santa’s fall off the roof in ”The Santa Clause.” It had a thin consistency, and the turmeric in the beverage overtook the flavor. “This is just kind of a basic milk beverage. It doesn’t really float in one way or the other,” Cornett said.",
            "8. Horizon Low Fat",
            "Horizon, an organic brand, appears to only sell low-fat eggnog. It had a runny consistency and tasted synthetically sweet, which was surprising, considering the listed ingredients all were real. Sadly, it moved straight to the top of our naughty list.",
            "Dairy-free options",
            "1. 356 Everyday Value Almond Nog",
            "Almond milk will never be that thick, but 365’s almond nog did a pretty good job replicating the real deal. Although cinnamon isn’t listed in the ingredients (it contains nutmeg and ginger), it had a warm cinnamon scent that made up for the lack of dairy and eggs. If you don’t drink dairy or you want a lower calorie option, this would be a great one.",
            "2. Silk",
            "Soy milk isn’t without its problems, but Silk’s dairy-free nog was the best of the three we tried. It was almost rich and had a nice hint of spice.",
            "3. Califia Farms",
            "The almond milk brand’s nog bottle certainly sets a festive tone, but unfortunately, it had a watery consistency and was way too sweet. We’re not saying you’d have to be a cotton-headed ninny muggins to drink this one, but you can do better."

            "Following the election of former Vice President Joe Biden, President Donald Trump is in the “lame duck” period of his one-term presidency. This new era has spawned many cartoons and even merchandise featuring Trump illustrated as a duck.",
            "But why is an outgoing president called a lame duck, anyway? It turns out the term dates back centuries.",
            "The earliest reported reference to the term comes in a December 1761 letter written by British historian and politician Horace Walpole to Sir Horace Mann.",
            "“Do you know what a Bull, and a Bear, and a Lame Duck are?” he asked, alluding to a phrase used in the Exchange Alley, or “Change Alley,” coffeehouses that evolved into the London Stock Exchange.",
            "“Lame duck” described a person who defaulted on his debt. The idea was that this trader would be powerless and vulnerable to predators, like a duck unable to keep up with its flock. Unable to pay up, the defaulter has to “waddle” off.",
            "In 1771, playwright David Garrick wrote, “Change-Alley bankrupts waddle out lame ducks!” in the prologue to Samuel Foote’s play “The Maid of Bath.”",
            "The term remained in use into the 19th century and eventually reached the U.S. financial markets and other areas of culture. “Lame duck” reportedly appeared in naval contexts to refer to an “old, slow ship” as well.",
            "In 1869, writer George W. Bungay used the phrase in reference to supporters of the temperance movement who faltered in their commitment over time.",
            "“In Wall Street, New York, we have a class of men known as ‘lame ducks’: they have met with financial disasters, and can not keep pace with their more successful competitors,” he wrote. “We have lame ducks in our temperance associations, and I will briefly classify some of the men and women who do not and who will not keep up with our progressive organization. The lame ducks were once out-and-out friends of ‘the cause.’ ... When they have attempted to swim in whisky, they have become ‘dead ducks.’”",
            "The political application of the term appeared around the same time. In 1844, a writer for the Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, newspaper The Compiler opined about presidential candidates: “Henry Clay is acknowledged to be first rate at the game of brag, but [James K.] Polk will make a lame duck of him.” President Abraham Lincoln reportedly once said, ”[A] senator or representative out of business is a sort of lame duck. He has to be provided for,” per the Online Etymology Dictionary.",
            "And according to a January 1863 issue of The Congressional Globe (a record of the official proceedings of the U.S. Congress in the mid-1800s), Sen. Lazarus W. Powell of Kentucky stated, “In no event, either as originally organized or as now organized, could [the Court of Claims] be justly obnoxious to the charge of being a receptacle of ‘lame ducks’ or broken down politicians.”",
            "In the early 20th century, “lame duck” began to refer more specifically to politicians who had lost their recent elections but hadn’t yet left office. The New York Evening Post in 1910 alluded to “Lame Duck Alley ... a screened-off corridor in the White House offices, where statesmen who went down in the recent electoral combat may meet.” In 1922, The New York Times mentioned a plan “to have the convening of Congress moved up to avoid lame-duck Congresses.”",
            "As for the executive branch, Republican Calvin Coolidge was the subject of a 1926 editorial from the Grand Rapids Press called “Making A Lame Duck of Coolidge” about the possibility of a Democratic Senate majority during the final two years of the president’s term.",
            "“Lame duck” informally made its way into constitutional discussions with the adoption of the 20th Amendment in 1933. Nicknamed the “Lame Duck Amendment,” it moved the dates for the inauguration of the president and the start of the new Congress.",
            "People still use “lame duck” to refer to outgoing presidents and members of Congress in the period before newly elected officials take office. It’s also used to describe congressional sessions during that time.",
            "The term has faced criticism, however, for being ableist and mischaracterizing the role presidents can play at the end of their terms.",
            "In 2015, Atlantic writer Megan Garber described “lame duck” as “a terrible term.”",
            "“It is jargon-y. It is partisan. It is poorly descriptive. It is offensive to both humans and, we can reasonably assume, the entire waterfowl community,” she wrote. “More than anything, though, ‘lame duck’ is often simply inaccurate: The golden years of a presidency can be, for better or for worse, intensely productive ones — not just despite a president’s ability to extricate himself from standard political pageantries, but because of it.”",
            "For now, “lame duck” remains the descriptor many are using for the period after the 2020 election. Still, as one Twitter user posited, perhaps “president-eject” would be a better alternative."

            "At just 26 years old, Mominatu has lived many lives. She’s traveled the world — Puerto Rico, Portugal, India, Tanzania and Ecuador — and through it all, she has cultivated a deep yoga practice that has allowed her to stay grounded no matter where she is. This year, the model-turned-yoga instructor embarked on her biggest adventure yet: moving to Dakar, Senegal, to open her first yoga studio.",
            "Of course, she couldn’t have anticipated the emergence of COVID-19, but rather than throw a complete wrench in her business venture, the past several months have created opportunities for Mominatu to learn how to adapt and grow. Nine months after moving to Dakar, she’s birthed a beautiful community of mostly Black women, teaching virtual and socially distanced yoga classes to local clients who are discovering a new way of finding peace amid mayhem.",
            "In this interview for “Getting Through,” Mominatu discusses finding community, the key to mastering meditation and, after years of jet-setting, what she’s learned about the power of being still.",
            "OK, first: How are you, really?",
            "I think we’ve all been quietly going through it. As a Black woman in a patriarchal world, you’re always quietly going through it — on top of a pandemic, on top of racism, on top of the world sliding, falling apart. On top of people not honoring Black bodies. It’s like everyone is walking around with this weight on their backs. And any single person who is saying they are “OK” and that “everything is fine” has either not tapped into themselves — spiritually, emotionally or mentally — or are too privileged to acknowledge anything because it doesn’t affect them.",
            "On your Instagram, you’ve talked a lot about how yoga has helped center you during the hardest times. Right now you are in your studio in Dakar, getting ready to lead your first yoga class for the day. How did you find your way to Senegal, and how did you find your way to starting this yoga practice?",
            "Well, for some background, I’m Liberian and Senegalese. I went to school in America for broadcast journalism and a minor in fashion business. And then I was like, “Mmm, this ain’t it for me.” I decided I wanted to start traveling the world. I moved to Puerto Rico from Chicago with my best friend. I just followed my intuition and have been blessed along the way. I was doing marketing in Puerto Rico, and then I got signed to a major modeling agency. It was always my dream to model, so I did that. Then from Puerto Rico, I was like, “All right, I’ve made it here. I’ve done billboards here. I’ve done commercial campaigns. Maybe I’ll go to New York and see what that’s about.” This was after watching this movie, “Begin Again.” I was like, “These motherfuckers are on the rooftops and shit, following their dreams!” I’m like, “What am I doing sitting in Puerto Rico? I want to go to New York.” [Laughs] So I went to New York, and I got signed with this management team and started modeling there. But throughout it all, for the past 11 years, I was always practicing yoga. I got a yoga teacher training certification when I was 18.",
            "I always had the intention of deepening my own practice because it was something that I needed. I never called it anxiety because I’m African and “we don’t have depression and anxiety,” right? [Laughs] That’s a white people thing, right? But I never, ever felt good. There was always this underlying trauma. I always needed yoga, and I always needed meditation or working out to find an equilibrium. And whenever I fell out of my practice, I found that I was not OK. It has always been a medicine for me, and I’m sure maybe it would have been better for me had I found, like, actual medicine, but that was the holistic approach [that] has worked for me and has allowed me to not only heal myself, but to use this practice to heal others. And that’s what brought me to Africa this year. I have decided to come back to Senegal, which is where my mom is from, and to bring yoga from a Black woman to the Senegalese people.",
            "And how has that experience been for you? What has the response been from the people who take your classes?",
            "I’ve been here for nine months now. I’ve been teaching the community classes for about five months, and people are loving it. Senegalese people are loving it. They wanted it. They wanted it! I had a class on the beach just the other day. Let me tell you: My first-ever class, I was scared shitless. I had my friends — who are social media influencers and they’re very powerful people — and they came, they’re like, “Bitch, if you don’t teach this mothafuckin’ class...” [Laughs] And they’re like, “We’re just gonna sit in class and we’re going to put you on the stories. Teach a class.” And so I’m there and my class was full, and it was all Black women. It was all Senegalese women, Senegalese diaspora, Africans.",
            "And when one of the girls left the beach, a guy came up to her. He’s like, “You know, I have never, ever, ever seen Black people doing this. It’s always the white girls that come from America.” And that was so powerful for me. And now, fast forward, all my classes are Black. I mean, of course I have Lebanese clients and my private clients, but my group classes are African. They are Senegalese. And even African men are taking my classes. These men are coming in and stretching, and they’re not here for the fine girls. [Laughs] They’re here to find their peace.",
            "What are your self-care rituals? Not just yoga, but other things that you do to stay grounded and centered?",
            "I wake up in the morning at like 5 a.m., and I use a tongue scraper. Are you familiar with those Ayurvedic tongue scrapers, to get out all of the bacteria? And then I do oil pulling with coconut oil for 20 minutes. I just walk around the house. It changes everything. Everything. And then once I’m done with the oil pulling, I love herbs, so I’ll do an herbal tea to warm up. And then I do this specific massage called Abhyanga, and that’s an Ayurvedic self-massage. I love Ayurvedic science, and I treat my body on those philosophies. But the idea, basically, is pouring love into yourself. You take hot oil and you rub — it’s almost like lymphatic drainage. You rub the oil going down in strokes and then circling around the joints to [do] lymphatic drainage, but also as a self-love ritual. As you massage yourself, taking the time to really moisturize is an act of love. It’s like cleaning your temple. So I do that. And then I will go to the gym or train my first client that day. But those are things that, truly, no bullshit, I’m not the same person if I don’t start my day with those things. And then, of course, meditation.",
            "How has yoga, meditation and all these practices changed your outlook on your life, and specifically during this time, how have they aided you in dealing with the chaos of 2020?",
            "So for me, I like to say that yoga and meditation is very selfish, right? It allows you to deal with your own shit, but it doesn’t really show you how to deal with the world around you. So meditation allowed me to realize I wasn’t OK. And in that awareness, I could say, “All right, so what am I going to do about not feeling good right now?” ... We got a pandemic. We got to stay in the house. We can’t go anywhere. All right. That’s that. Now you got Black Lives Matter, the racism. All right. Then what? It’s just like, you’re constantly just — [takes three pronounced gasps] — taking in all these gulps until you’re like, “I. Can’t. Breathe. Anymore.” You know?",
            "So I think having the awareness of what was going on allowed me to feel it. I know that sounds really weird, but I think the knowing and the grieving and being able to know what I was crying about [helped a lot], whereas a lot of my friends were just like, “I don’t know why I’m so upset.” It’s like, “Babes, open your eyes.”",
            "You can’t solve a problem if you can’t name it.",
            "Exactly. And that’s what meditation did for me. It allows me the space to have stillness, to understand what’s going on and how I respond and react to that. And to find a little bit of peace under pressure.",
            "What was the worst thing that happened this year, so far?",
            "The worst thing? [Laughs] I’ll be deadass. I was messing around with this one dude who was just devil dick. We’re all quarantining. We had a curfew here, so you couldn’t leave the house past 7 p.m. You couldn’t be on the streets. In Senegal, they were beating people [for breaking curfew]. So, you know, you had your little quarantine bae. Just that loneliness of having to be home all the time, you’re sort of blind. There was this heartbreak from having this nigga over all the time and realizing that I was just his nice little house to chill at, you know what I mean? So that, for me, was the worst thing that happened — but also the best thing that happened, because it propelled me to focus on my yoga and go into super-drive for work. But the quarantine bae situation, I got played. [Laughs]",
            "And then on the flip side, what would you say is the best thing that’s happened this year so far?",
            "Launching my business and being able to ground in a space. I think corona has been a blessing because I’m always on the move, and that’s something that I learned in my meditation — that when shit got difficult, I booked a flight. I was like, “You know what, let me just go to Bali for a little bit.” You know what I mean? “Let me like find my zen.” But it was like, what the fuck is that? Like, if you can’t find zen within the space you’re at, you don’t really have zen. You’re just escaping. Because home is within you. You take you everywhere. So if at any point you get a little uncomfortable, you’re jumping and running — you’ve got nothing concrete.",
            "What would be your advice to anyone who’s struggling? And when I say struggling, I mean, struggling to cope with everything that’s coming their way, struggling with their mental health, struggling to be happy and content in this really chaotic time.",
            "I would say, don’t fake it. Acknowledge where you’re at and don’t let anyone tell you how you’re supposed to feel. But most importantly, community and finding people to just talk to and listen. It could be a therapist or it could be someone that’s one step ahead of you. Someone that genuinely wants to listen. ’Cause oftentimes, people — especially yoga instructors — say, “Well, do some meditation, do some yoga, eat some good food.” Like, “Bitch, it’s serotonin. It’s not kale.” Sometimes, it really does require Lexapro, you know what I mean? There are other tools.",
            "But I think the first step is acknowledging where you are and not faking it, because you’re living in your own prison because you have no integrity to your soul. You’re showing everyone this nice and pretty version of you when, inside, you’re crying and dying and no one can see your pain. So the only way that someone can help you or that you can get out of your situation is by one, acknowledging where you are, and two, understanding that you don’t do this life alone, so ask for help. And after asking for help, saying, “All right, so what are some tools that I can take to get to where I need to be?” It can be professional help or could even just be a friend. But I think the biggest thing with people suffering right now is that it seems like it’s a collective thing, [yet] no one wants to place their burden on someone else. When in reality, through us being able to discuss suffering, we’re able to be like, “Oh, it’s you, too? Oh, OK.” And that collectiveness, that — [takes deep, intentional sigh] — that collective sigh is enough. So I think that’s what I would recommend: finding a community.",
            "Yeah. I think that dovetails with this other idea I’ve been thinking a lot about over the past several months, which is that it feels like the world is ending in a lot of ways, but not in a bad way. It feels like a lot of institutions, systems, structures that have oppressed us are crumbling or have the potential to crumble. And that is inviting the possibility for imagination and imagining a new world. I’m curious to know what world, what portals are you imagining, what are you manifesting for the rest of the year and the years to come?",
            "Radical self-thought. In a way, I’m very, very thankful for Donald Trump because he showed us we weren’t bullshitting. We weren’t lying. Racism was real.",
            "I’d like to see more authenticity. More people just standing [up against injustice], but I also just want the whole fucking thing to deconstruct. I would like to see everything flipped upside down. I just want the whole cup to be poured over. I want to see the world tap into itself in a way that is not what we want to see necessarily, but what it is. And I think that it’s going to get so much more ugly before it gets good, but that’s how we build. That’s how we grow.",
            "It’s necessary, yeah.",
            "Suffering can be ugly, but it isn’t necessarily bad. I’m sure when you were in school and you were like, “I’m not trying to do this motherfuckin’ journalism class. This is hell on Earth!” [Laughs] You know what I mean? It was suffering for you at that time. But maybe you look back on that now and it’s like, “Wow, I’m so thankful for that because that’s what made me who I am. These situations, this trauma, this whatever put me into the space that I needed to be.” So I think it’s just shifting the narrative and shifting our perception.",
            "Finally, what are the books, movies and music that have fed you, that have centered you during this time?",
            "Wow. That’s a beautiful question. I love that. “Purple Hibiscus” was a treat in lockdown. I listened to a lot of Ethiopian jazz, so Dexter Story, the “Bahir” album. Florence and the Machine, her latest album. A lot of Osho — I love Osho. I know he’s so controversial, but I love Osho’s books. I love his talks.",

            "For weeks, leaders of Native American tribes all over the country have been urging President-elect Joe Biden to pick Rep. Deb Haaland (D-N.M.) to be his interior secretary. So have dozens of members of Congress, including Republicans.",
            "But for some reason, some of Biden’s advisers have begun anonymously planting the idea in news stories that the Native American congresswoman, who chairs a House subcommittee with oversight of the Interior Department, is not qualified. What’s also puzzling is that these sources say a better candidate is a lesser-known man who is also Native, Michael Connor, despite dozens of tribal leaders telling Biden, publicly and privately, that they back Haaland.",
            "“But her lack of policy experience worries some Biden advisers, who have suggested another Native American candidate: Michael L. Connor, a deputy interior secretary in the Obama administration, whose experience is unquestioned,” reads a New York Times piece in late November.",
            "“But many of Mr. Biden’s advisers fear that she lacks the experience to manage the sprawling complex agency,” reads a second New York Times piece on Thursday.",
            "Another anonymous “conservation source” told The Hill on Wednesday that Haaland’s support by progressive groups could complicate her Senate confirmation. This person suggested Haaland’s support for the Green New Deal, a legislative plan aimed at addressing climate change and economic inequality, could cause problems.",
            "But Biden himself has called the proposal a “crucial framework,” and another top candidate for Interior, Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.), supports the plan, too.",
            "The anonymous slights against Haaland haven’t gone unnoticed by her supporters, who say they are angry and confused to see her being belittled by people in Biden’s orbit. Some prominent Native women have noted the sexism of the anonymous comments, per reporter Julian Brave Noisecat. Some of Haaland’s supporters made similar suggestions to HuffPost privately; others were willing to go public with their frustrations.",
            "“Of course it’s offensive to say she’s not qualified,” said Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.), chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee.",
            "Not only is Haaland equipped for the job, he said, but she embodies the kind of diversity and representation in government that Biden says he wants. It would be a seismic shift to put a Native American woman at the helm of the federal agency that oversees public lands ― the same lands from which Indigenous people were previously forcibly removed by the U.S. government.",
            "It would also be historic: The U.S. has never had any Indigenous Cabinet secretaries.",
            "“I think those individuals being anonymous should think that through for themselves, because by going after this person, you’re standing in the way of history,” Grijalva said. “We’re not going to get it again. She’s real. She’s authentic. She’s legitimate. And she should have it.”",
            "He added, “Anything less than that, I think, is really going to create some blowback.”",
            "Shannon Holsey, president of the Stockbridge-Munsee Band of Mohican tribe in Wisconsin, lamented the “shroud of elusiveness” over the anonymous sources criticizing Haaland and floating Connor’s name instead. What’s odd about Connor suddenly being pushed, she said, is that so many tribal leaders are united behind Haaland while Connor’s name hasn’t even come up.",
            "“If there are truly concerns, in the spirit of transparency, they should put them forward. I don’t know what the issues would be,” she said. “We’ve lived the past four years in this kind of shroud. Why would you start a new transition that way?”",
            "Holsey is one of 150 tribal leaders who privately wrote to Biden last week in support of Haaland for interior secretary. HuffPost obtained a copy of the letter and agreed to only excerpt from it.",
            "“Rep. Haaland has championed the environment, helped lead efforts to address climate change, and worked to improve the nation-to-nation relationship between our Tribes and the United States – all issues within the Department of the Interior’s responsibilities,” reads the letter. “At every turn, she has been a leading voice against the Trump Administration’s work to roll back environmental protections ... She has also fought the Trump Administration’s efforts to cut programs that benefit tribal communities.”",
            "It concludes, “As the leaders of sovereign tribal nations, we believe it is long past time that a Native American person serve as Secretary of the Interior. Further, we believe that Congresswoman Deb Haaland is ready to serve as Secretary.”",
            "Adding to the confusion over the anonymous attacks on Haaland, Biden last week offered the interior secretary job to New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, who has relatively little experience with the public lands and energy issues the Interior Department focuses on. Grisham turned down the offer, which already made no sense but also would have pitted her against Haaland and Udall, both colleagues from New Mexico.",
            "One source who works closely with tribal leaders on federal strategy speculated there are people on Biden’s transition team who have worked with Connor in the past, and they are trying to push “a message of there being an alternative Native American” in an effort to help their former colleague get the Interior post.",
            "“This is not the will of the tribes who have thrown their weight heavily behind Deb Haaland, who is highly qualified,” said this source, who requested anonymity to speak freely. “This is an age-old classic of divide and conquer where you are supposedly working with tribes but, at the end of the day, you do the thing you want to do.”",
            "A spokesperson for Biden’s transition team said he could not confirm or deny that Haaland is under consideration for the Interior post (she is, but they have to say this), but whoever is anonymously criticizing Haaland is not someone authorized to speak for Biden’s team.",
            "“No one is trying to discount Deb Haaland,” he said.",
            "A Haaland spokesperson declined comment.",
            "Connor, who currently works for the international law firm WilmerHale, did not respond to a request for comment.",
            "Another member of Biden’s transition team emphasized that the team has already been meeting with dozens of tribal leaders, councils and organizations representing Indian Country, and will continue to do so in the coming weeks to strengthen government-to-government relations. The team also recently added a Native American doctor, Dr. Jim Jill, to its COVID-19 advisory board.",
            "Regardless of who Biden picks for the post, the surge of momentum behind Haaland for interior secretary ― not the most flashy job ― is remarkable. Republican and Democratic lawmakers have thrown their support behind her. Data for Progress, a progressive think tank, is circulating a petition urging Biden to pick Haaland for the post. Indigenous-led organizations like NDN Collective and Indigenous Environmental Network have been trying to get the hashtag #DebForInterior trending on Twitter.",
            "Some have come up with hilarious memes to go with it.",

            "Melanie Benjamin, chief executive of the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe in Minnesota, said Biden promised that his administration would have gender parity and diversity unlike any previous administration.",
            "“He promised he would listen to Indian Country,” said Benjamin. “Congresswoman Haaland’s accomplishments are already historic and her qualifications are not in question ... The opportunity for the Biden/Harris team to make this inspired choice is golden. It should not be overtaken by anonymous voices that insult both women and Indian Country.”",
            "“It is offensive that Congresswoman Deb Haaland is being subjected to a sexist whisper campaign that is attempting to undermine her experience,” said Crystal Echo Hawk, executive director of Illuminative, a nonprofit aimed at increasing the visibility of Native people.",
            "“It’s yet another example of how Native women, and women of color, despite having excellent qualifications and broad support, have to continuously fight against sexist narratives that could disqualify them from positions they deserve,” she said. “President-Elect Biden said he would strengthen the nation-to-nation relationship between tribes and his administration. Tribal leaders are endorsing Haaland and are telling the administration she is the best, most qualified candidate for the position. Is the president-elect listening?”",
            "Meanwhile, groups in New Mexico are still sending letters to Biden backing Haaland. On Saturday, 50 Indigenous, environmental and social justice organizations in the state wrote to Biden saying Haaland is “uniquely qualified” to be interior secretary. This was a day after the All Pueblo Council of Governors formally urged Biden to nominate Haaland, and two weeks after the Eight Northern Indian Pueblos Council wrote a similar letter.",

            "VALDOSTA, Georgia (AP) — President Donald Trump is pressing his grievances over losing the presidential election, using a weekend rally to spread baseless allegations of misconduct in last month’s voting in Georgia and beyond even as he pushed supporters to turn out for a pair of Republican Senate candidates in a runoff election in January.",
            "“Let them steal Georgia again, you’ll never be able to look yourself in the mirror,” Trump told rallygoers.",

            "The Jan. 5 Senate runoffs in Georgia will determine the balance of power in Washington after Biden takes office. Republicans in the state are worried that Trump is stoking so much suspicion about Georgia elections that voters will think the system is rigged and decide to sit out the two races.",
            "The latest futile attempt to subvert the presidential election results continued Trump’s unprecedented campaign to undermine confidence in the democratic process, but overshadowed his stated purpose in traveling to Georgia — boosting Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler.",
            "Republicans need one victory to maintain their Senate majority. Democrats need a Georgia sweep to force a 50-50 Senate and position Vice President-elect Kamala Harris as the tiebreaking vote. Party officials had hoped the president would dedicate his energy to imploring supporters to vote in the runoff, when Perdue and Loeffler try to hold off Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, respectively.",
            "Trump did echo Republican rhetoric that the races amounted to “the most important congressional runoff, probably in American history.” That is only true because he lost.",
            "But after Air Force One landed, it quickly became apparent that Trump was intent on airing his own complaints and stoking baseless doubts about the conduct of last month’s vote, rather than boosting his party.",
            "“I want to stay on presidential,” Trumps said minutes into his speech. “But I got to get to these two.” He praised the GOP lawmakers, Perdue for his support for military spending and Loeffler for pushing for early coronavirus relief spending. But he quickly pivoted back to his own defeat.",
            "Trump pulled out a piece of paper and read a list of his electoral achievements, including falsely asserting he won Georgia and the White House. Biden carried the state by 12,670 votes and won a record 81 million votes nationally. Trump continued to reiterate his unsubstantiated claims of fraud, despite his own administration assessing the election to have been conducted without any major issues.",

Brian Kemp in a phone call to order the legislative session; the governor refused, according to a senior government official in Georgia with knowledge of the call who was not authorized to discuss the private conversation and spoke on the condition of anonymity. A person close to the White House who was briefed on the matter verified that account of the call.",
            "Kemp, in a tweet, said Trump also asked him to order an audit of signatures on absentee ballot envelopes in his state, a step Kemp is not empowered to take because he has no authority to interfere in the electoral process on Trump’s behalf.",
            "Trump, though, vented his frustrations with Kemp on Twitter and at the rally.",
            "“Your people are refusing to do what you ask,” he complained in a tweet, as if speaking with Kemp. “What are they hiding? At least immediately ask for a Special Session of the Legislature. That you can easily, and immediately, do.”",
            "At the rally, he took aim once again at Kemp, saying he could assure him victory “if he knew what the hell he was doing.”",
            "Trump’s personal contact with the governor demonstrated he is intent on amplifying his conspiratorial and debunked theories of electoral fraud even as Georgia Republicans want him to turn his focus to the runoff and encourage their supporters to get out and vote.",
            "In his tweet, Kemp said: “As I told the President this morning, I’ve publicly called for a signature audit three times (11/20, 11/24, 12/3) to restore confidence in our election process and to ensure that only legal votes are counted in Georgia.”",
            "While the governor does not have the authority to order a signature audit, an audit was initiated by Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and it triggered a full hand recount that confirmed Biden’s victory in Georgia. The race has been certified for Biden and affirmed by the state’s Republican election officials as a fairly conducted and counted vote, with none of the systemic errors Trump alleges.",
            "But after two pro-Trump lawyers this past week questioned whether voting again is even worth it — in echoes of the president’s baseless accusations of widespread voter fraud — even Vice President Mike Pence betrayed concerns that the Republican coalition could crack under the force of Trump’s grievances.",
            "“I know we’ve all got our doubts about the last election, and I hear some of you saying, ‘Just don’t vote,’” Pence said Friday while campaigning with Perdue in Savannah. “If you don’t vote, they win.”",
            "Few Republicans in Washington or Georgia believe wide swaths of the electorate in this newfound battleground would opt out of voting because of Trump’s false claims or his denigration of the Georgia governor and secretary of state for certifying Biden’s victory in the state.",
            "The risk for the GOP is that it wouldn’t take much of a drop-off to matter if the runoffs are as close as the presidential contest: Biden won Georgia by about 12,500 votes out of 5 million cast. There’s enough noise to explain why Pence felt the need to confront the matter head on after two Trump loyalists floated the idea of the president’s supporters bailing on Perdue and Loeffler.",
            "Trump’s false claims have resonated with voters such as Barry Mann, a 61-year-old business owner who came to hear Pence in Savannah. Mann hasn’t decided whether he’ll vote for his senators a second time.",
            "“I think there’s some issues with our election and more investigation needs to be done,” Mann said, adding that he doesn’t think Perdue and Loeffler have done enough to support Trump’s efforts to overturn the results. “I want to see what happens between now and January,” Mann said."

            "In late November, as health officials urged the public to avoid travel amid a new wave of coronavirus cases, dozens of people traveled to a federal prison complex in Terre Haute, Indiana, for the execution of Orlando Hall. At the time, around 75 incarcerated people and staff at the complex had active cases of COVID-19.",
            "A few days later, Hall’s spiritual adviser Yusuf Ahmed Nur, who performed last rites for Hall while next to two unmasked executioners, tested positive. Since then, cases have spiked at Federal Correctional Complex, Terre Haute, where all federal executions take place. As of Monday, over 200 incarcerated people and 21 staff are sick with the virus. Now, the Department of Justice has admitted that eight members of the approximately 40-person execution team also tested positive after the execution.",
            "The latest disclosure came in response to a lawsuit brought by two men incarcerated at FCC Terre Haute. They are suing the government to halt executions until the pandemic is under control in order to protect their health.",
            "The government initially said that “some” members of the execution team had tested positive — but the admission was buried in a footnote of a court filing and did not specify how many people had gotten sick. In a subsequent court filing, Bureau of Prisons lawyer Richard Winter said that six members tested positive about a week after returning home and an additional two tested positive more than a week after going home. That at least 20% of the execution team contracted COVID-19 after the most recent execution is evidence of what public health experts and lawyers who represent people on death row have been warning for months: Carrying out executions during a pandemic puts people who live and work in and around the prison at increased risk of contracting a potentially fatal disease.",
            "Lawyers for the two men wrote that the government disclosure offered “compelling evidence of the significant risk that conducting the scheduled executions will spread COVID-19 within FCC Terre Haute (and beyond).”",
            "In the meantime, the Trump administration is pushing forward with the killings.",
            "On Thursday, the government plans to execute Brandon Bernard, a man who was sentenced to death for acting as an accomplice to a crime that occurred when he was 18 years old. Five of the nine surviving jurors who sentenced Bernard to death now believe he should live, citing information that came out after his trial.",
            "Prisons are some of the most dangerous places to be during the pandemic, as those living within them cannot socially distance themselves from others and often lack access to protective gear and cleaning supplies. Prisons also tend to be crowded and poorly ventilated. Since the pandemic began, many of the largest outbreaks have been linked to correctional facilities.",
            "There is no compelling reason these executions need to be carried out now.",
            "Until recently, there had not been a federal execution in 17 years. When the pandemic hit the U.S., most states paused executions in an effort to contain the spread of the virus. But in July, the Trump administration resumed federal executions, against the advice of public health experts. Since then, the government has rushed to put to death eight people, with five more scheduled to die before President-elect Joe Biden, who opposes the death penalty, takes office on Jan. 20. This is the first time since 1889 that an outgoing administration has carried out a federal execution after losing an election.",
            "Since resuming the killings in July, coronavirus cases have spiked at FCC Terre Haute, as well as in Vigo County, where the prison is located. (The government has argued in court filings that there is no evidence the spikes were definitively caused by the executions.)",
            "The consequences of the government’s rush to execute go far beyond health concerns. Criminal justice leaders have warned that death-row prisoners are being denied access to effective legal representation during the pandemic, and travel restrictions are jeopardizing clemency efforts.",
            "Still, there are serious public health risks involved with carrying out executions in the midst of a pandemic.",
            "“At the risk of sounding like a broken record, there is simply no doubt that these executions spread COVID-19,” said Cassandra Stubbs, director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Capital Punishment Project, in a statement. “The spread of disease that will occur if the wave of five scheduled executions — starting Thursday and scheduled until just before inauguration day — are allowed to take place will have been totally predictable and preventable. The courts must step in to stop them, protect the people incarcerated at Terre Haute who have no control over the risk the government is subjecting them, and slow the senseless suffering of the American people.”",
            "Part of the reason federal executions pose such a high risk of COVID-19 transmission is the number of people involved in the operation.",
            "Each one requires the involvement of an “execution team” sourced from Bureau of Prisons staff, usually from out of state. The roughly 40 people on a team are not required to quarantine once arriving in Indiana or undergo testing for the coronavirus prior to the execution, according to a government filing. Those individuals also work closely with about 200 FCC Terre Haute prison staff, who provide security and support. Testing after working an execution is voluntary; in an affidavit, the prison complex warden said that in the past, only five to seven members of the execution team have elected to be tested prior to returning to their home communities.",
            "Others, including lawyers, media, family and demonstrators also gather for each execution, making such occasions prime candidates for superspreader events. The Bureau of Prisons estimates that approximately 50 to 125 people will travel to the prison for each execution.",
            "The risks of carrying out executions during the pandemic were evident from the beginning.",
            "In July, when federal executions first resumed, the ACLU sued the government on behalf of Buddhist priest Seigen Hartkemeyer, the spiritual adviser to Wesley Purkey, who was scheduled to be executed later that month.",
            "Moving forward with Purkey’s execution in the middle of the pandemic presented “an untenable conflict” for Hartkemeyer by forcing the 68-year-old man with a history of recurring bronchitis and pleurisy to “decide whether to risk his own life in order to exercise his religious obligation to be present for Mr. Purkey’s execution,” the ACLU wrote in its complaint.",
            "Family members of the victims of another man who was scheduled for execution in July joined Hartkemeyer in calling for the executions to be delayed until it would be safe to attend.",
            "About a week after the ACLU filed suit, a BOP staffer who had attended meetings in preparation for three executions, including Purkey’s, tested positive for COVID-19. The staff member did not always wear a mask, a BOP lawyer acknowledged in a court filing. Asked how many staff and incarcerated individuals he was in contact with in the lead-up to his positive test result, the staff member simply reported, “? Alot.”",
            "The Trump administration went forward with the scheduled executions: In the week following the BOP staffer testing positive, Purkey and two other men were put to death.",
            "The rush to execute federal prisoners during the pandemic has also put attorneys in danger.",
            "The two lead attorneys for Lisa Montgomery, the only woman on federal death row, both contracted COVID-19 after visiting with her in prison after her execution date was set. Montgomery suffers from mental illness and was a victim of extreme childhood abuse, including incest and sex trafficking by her parents, according to her attorneys.",
            "Both her lawyers reported severe COVID-19 symptoms and were unable to prepare Montgomery’s clemency petition before the deadline. A judge delayed Montgomery’s execution until Jan. 12 — eight days before Biden’s inauguration — to give her attorneys some time to recover.",
            "Robert Owen, a lawyer who has worked with Bernard for the past 20 years, is not planning to attend his execution on Thursday if it proceeds. Owen is in a high-risk group for COVID-19 and doesn’t feel he can take the chance of contracting the disease. “I’m deeply disappointed at that. I’m angry about it,” he said in an interview.",
            "“I know that it can be really important to the client to have counsel present close to, or even at the time of the execution, and I would like to be able to offer that comfort to Brandon,” Owen said. “I’m frustrated that I can’t do it safely.”",
            "This story has been updated to reflect the government’s admission that eight members of a federal execution team tested positive for COVID-19 after returning home from a November execution."

            "As President Donald Trump’s attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election have veered into embarrassing farce, many of Fox’s biggest stars have begun to hedge their support of Trump’s delusional claims of an election fraud conspiracy. Not Lou Dobbs.",
            "Dobbs, the top-rated host on Fox Business and a fervent Trump ally, has been unwavering in his support of the president’s baseless allegations that President-elect Joe Biden and his supporters stole the election. Dobbs has declared that Trump should take “drastic action” over the vote. He’s hosted guests making unfounded claims of election fraud, and raged at Republican officials accepting the legitimate results of the election.",
            "This makes Dobbs one of Fox’s last true holdouts denying that Biden won the election. While far-right media outlets have largely detached themselves from reality, many mainstream conservative personalities have been more subtle: raising conspiracy theories, but not fully backing them. The savvier Fox News hosts, such as Tucker Carlson, have carefully walked a line of appealing to pro-Trump audiences while claiming some veneer of independence. Dobbs, whom Fox touts as having the most watched program on business television, has instead gone all in on trying to delegitimize the election.",
            "Dobbs started this week by giving pro-Trump lawyer Sidney Powell free rein to spout groundless allegations of voter fraud while presenting no credible evidence. Powell, who was abruptly kicked off Trump’s legal team last week, claimed on Monday that the election represented “the most massive and historical, egregious fraud the world has ever seen.” Meanwhile, Dobbs called on Trump to take action against “the crimes that have been committed against him and the American people.”",
            "The next day Dobbs was at it again, suggesting that Attorney General William Barr was “compromised” and part of the “deep state” after Barr (belatedly) acknowledged there has been no proof of widespread election fraud. Dobbs attacked Barr, himself a close Trump ally, as “a liar or a fool or both” who “joined in with the radical Dems.” Dobbs continued to espouse unfounded allegations and bizarre conspiracy theories throughout the show.",
            "“Could it be that antifa was running the election for Democrats in that room?” Dobbs asked a guest during a segment about Michigan vote tallying.",
            "On the same episode, Dobbs interviewed Jesse Morgan, a truck driver who claimed to have witnessed massive voter fraud but who has provided dubious evidence for his allegations. Morgan previously claimed in a series of YouTube videos that his family was being haunted by ghosts and that he caught a “shadow person” on camera.",
            "On Thursday, Dobbs is slated to host former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who this week tweeted out a call for Trump to declare martial law in order to hold a new election. In addition to his calls to suspend the Constitution, Flynn ― whom Trump pardoned last week for twice pleading guilty to lying to the FBI ― has been promoting a groundless conspiracy that China somehow rigged the election for Biden to win.",
            "It’s been this way for weeks. Throughout November, Dobbs featured guests like Powell on his show while trying to delegitimize the election and call on Republicans to rally around Trump’s attempts to overturn the vote.",
            "“This is an attempt to take over the country and deny this president what is rightfully his, a second term,” Dobbs said in mid-November.",
            "Dobbs’ relentless fealty to Trump, whom he has called “arguably the greatest president in our history,” has made his show more reminiscent of programming on far-right conspiracy outlets such as One America News Network and Newsmax than most of the other marquee Fox hosts at this point. Although Fox News hosts such as Sean Hannity are still deeply in the tank for Trump, most of the network’s programming now conveys a sense of inevitability about Biden’s inauguration in January.",
            "Even informal Trump advisers such as hosts Carlson and Laura Ingraham have started to distance themselves from the president’s most egregious falsehoods, and have at times been critical of the lack of evidence for his claims.",
            "But thanks to Dobbs, the Trump campaign still has an immense mainstream platform to promote its wildest election conspiracies to millions of viewers."

Namibia was also a former German colony from 1884 to 1915, meaning that a name like “Adolf” would not be uncommon.",
            "“As a child I saw it as a totally normal name,” Uunona said, in a translation by the BBC. “It wasn’t until I was growing up that I realized this man wanted to subjugate the whole world. I have nothing to do with any of these things.”",
            "Uunona added that his wife simply called him Adolf, and he usually went by Adolf Uunona in public. Unfortunately, Hitler remains his middle name on all official documents, making it too cumbersome to change.",
            "News of Uunona’s victory quickly went international and viral across social media, as the novelty of a man named “Adolf Hitler” taking public office in a year as chaotic as 2020 was simply too bizarre to resist."

            "President Donald Trump’s campaign lawyer Joseph diGenova suggested Monday that Chris Krebs, the former chief of U.S. cybersecurity, should be executed for defending the integrity of the Nov. 3 election.",
            "“Anybody who thinks the election went well, like that idiot Krebs who used to be the head of cybersecurity, that guy is a class A moron. He should be drawn and quartered. Taken out at dawn and shot,” diGenova said in a call-in interview to “The Howie Carr Show,” which was broadcast on the radio, Newsmax and online streams.",
            "Krebs was fired by the president earlier this month after the Department of Homeland Security office he led, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said publicly that it had found no evidence of votes being deleted, lost, changed or compromised in the 2020 election ― contradicing Trump’s baseless claims of rampant fraud.",
            "Krebs, a lifelong Republican, stood by his position during a “60 Minutes” interview on Sunday night, saying that those ongoing allegations are “dangerous” and “nonsense” and that Americans should have “100% confidence” in the security of the election.",
            "“We can go on and on with all the farcical claims alleging interference in the 2020 election, but the proof is in the ballots,” Krebs said Sunday. “The recounts are consistent with the initial count, and to me that’s further evidence, that’s confirmation that the systems used in the 2020 election performed as expected.”",
            "Krebs said Tuesday that he’s considering legal action against people lobbing death threats at him.",
            "“The way I look at is that we’re a nation of laws and I plan to take advantage of those laws,” Krebs told NBC’s “Today.” “I’ve got an exceptional team of lawyers that win in court and I think that they’re probably going to be busy.”",
            "He added that his legal team is reviewing “all our available opportunities.”",
            "Asked if he was concerned for his safety, Krebs said he wouldn’t give his harassers “the benefit of knowing how I’m reacting to this.”",
            "“They can know that there are things coming though,” he said.",
            "DiGenova, his host Carr and the right-wing network they appeared on all have a history of parroting unsubstantiated conspiracy theories that often benefit Trump. Carr responded to diGenova’s disturbing call for violence with a few chuckles before moving on.",
            "The reckless comments against the former public official come as the president himself continues to lash out at Krebs and other members of his own party who have publicly disputed his claims of widespread election fraud. Some officials have reported receiving threats of violence against themselves and their family members.",
            "Last month, another member of Trump’s inner circle, former White House strategist Steve Bannon, casually called for violence against public officials who disagreed with the president. He said he would like to see infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci and FBI Director Christopher Wray beheaded as a “warning to federal bureaucrats.”",
            "DiGenova and other members of the Trump legal team have failed to make any headway in their efforts to overturn the election results in key battleground states.",

            "The U.K. has become the first country to authorize a COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use, and the United States likely will not be far behind. It is plausible that there will be two COVID-19 vaccines available for use here before the end of this year.",
            "A federal advisory committee for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has now recommended that health care workers and nursing home residents should be the first to get a COVID-19 vaccine.",
            "But who comes next? As a debate develops over how to prioritize distribution among high-risk individuals, including essential workers and older adults, there is a growing push to put teachers on the next rung of the priority list.",
            "This week, 12 of the country’s largest education organizations, including the major teachers unions and National PTA, joined together to urge the CDC to prioritize educators and school staff. Here’s why.",
            "Teachers and school staff come into contact with a lot of people",
            "The CDC has identified several “distinctive factors” that impact COVID-19 risk for teachers and school staff. Teachers come into close contact with kids and other adults throughout the day, even if schools take pains to maintain social distance. Duration is also a factor. Teachers and school staff are indoors with children for hours at a time, every day.",
            "And those children may be silent spreaders. According to one recent estimate, one-third of children who have COVID-19 show no symptoms so they’re unlikely to be identified unless schools are doing robust testing.",
            "Of course, schools that reopened for in-person learning during the pandemic can — and have — done a lot to prevent COVID-19 spread, like cutting class sizes and adopting a hybrid model, keeping students in cohorts, and requiring masks.",
            "But in-person learning puts teachers and school staff at risk.",
            "“A child over the course of a school day — and this really depends on how the school’s flow is structured — will probably only have contact with a small group of other students,” said Dr. Sandra Kesh, an infectious disease specialist with Westmed Medical Group. “Teachers on the other hand, they’re exposed to large groups of kids every day. And then those kids are going back into their homes.”",
            "That’s one reason she believes teachers and school staff should be among the first to be vaccinated.",
            "“I’m very much in support of moving teachers up the line of priorities,” she said.",
            "Kids might be last in line for a vaccine",
            "While COVID-19 vaccine development has been astoundingly fast, the process has been — and will continue to be — slower for children. The American Academy of Pediatrics has called for kids to be included in vaccine trials, but that largely hasn’t happened yet (though Pfizer has begun testing its vaccine on children age 12 and up). Experts predict the vaccine may not be available to most children in the U.S. until sometime in the next academic year.",
            "“This research takes time. If this does not begin soon, it will be less likely a vaccine will be available for children before the next school year,” Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, chair of the AAP Committee on Infectious Diseases, said in a press release last month.",
            "That makes vaccines for teachers and school staff particularly important. The primary benefit of a COVID-19 vaccination is to the teachers themselves.",
            "“But then there is that important secondary benefit of limiting spread to all the kids they have contact with over the course of the day,” Kesh explained.",
            "So vaccinating teachers and school staff also decreases the risk of COVID-19 for students who may not be able to get the vaccine yet themselves — as well as their families.",
            "Vaccinating teachers could help solve major staffing problems",
            "One of the biggest challenges administrators have faced in reopening schools has simply been staffing. There has long been a teacher shortage in the U.S., exacerbated during the pandemic by the fact that an estimated 1.5 million teachers have health conditions that place them at a higher risk for serious complications from COVID-19. In New York City, for example, more than a quarter of public school teachers have been granted medical exemptions that let them work remotely — which is important to keep them safe, but makes it difficult to staff in-person learning.",
            "The problem has reached a boiling point in districts around the country where schools have been forced to close as case counts have surged and staff have needed to quarantine.",
            "As one superintendent in Maine said: “We have now entered a stage where we will be going between in-person and remote more frequently than we would like” — simply because there are not enough teachers, and not enough substitutes.",
            "Teachers could help spread public trust in a vaccine",
            "Evidence certainly suggests many Americans are wary of getting vaccinated. Earlier this fall, half of respondents to a Pew survey said they would probably not or definitely not get vaccinated if an option were available at the time. Other surveys have indicated that parents are less likely to get their children vaccinated against COVID-19 than they are to vaccinate themselves.",
            "Groups like the AAP know this is a problem. “Fear and mistrust of routine immunizations has been on the rise in this nation largely due to a vocal, well-established, and growing anti-vaccination movement” — and that movement is already “actively promoting disinformation” about a COVID-19 vaccine, it has warned.",
            "It’s unclear what impact vaccinating teachers, administrators and other school staff might have on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among parents, but they are generally well-trusted professions. In their appeal to the CDC’s advisory committee, national educational groups acknowledged this, arguing that if teachers are among the first to get vaccinated that could help increase public trust. “The education community could be a ‘trusted messenger’ to help ease anxieties and increase the trust factor,” the groups said.",
            "Experts are clear that in order for the new COVID-19 vaccines to bring the pandemic to an end, vaccination must be widespread.",
            "“I think you’re going to see this big rush of people who are the believers, who want to get the vaccine and have this peace of mind,” said Kesh. “What I worry about is the group of people who are not going to want to get vaccinated because of their concerns about safety. And then the question will be: Do we have enough herd immunity by those who do get vaccinated to mitigate the spread by those who don’t get vaccinated?”",
            "Experts are still learning about COVID-19. The information in this story is what was known or available as of publication, but guidance can change as scientists discover more about the virus. Please check the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the most updated recommendations."

            "Even as his position grows increasingly isolated, President Donald Trump is not walking alone in his suspended state of disbelief about the results of the 2020 election. He is being propped up, as he has for years, by his loyal evangelical Christian fans.",
            "While some evangelical leaders and institutions have congratulated President-elect Joe Biden on his win, there is a large segment of the group that is staying mum on the issue ― or clinging to the Trump campaign’s unproven claims of widespread fraud.",
            "The president’s closest evangelical advisers are split between those who are actively promoting the election fraud narrative, those who are subtly suggesting to their followers that there was fraud, and those who are silent, according to John Fea, a history professor at Messiah University who has been blogging about these Trump allies.",
            "Fea told HuffPost he doesn’t know of any of these “court evangelicals” ― his label for the modern equivalent of the religious courtiers who once surrounded kings ― who have openly rejected the voter fraud claims. The ally who got the closest to publicly acknowledging the election results was Dallas pastor Robert Jeffress. In a Nov. 7 Fox News op-ed, Jeffress wrote that Biden “appears” to be the president-elect, unless Trump wins his legal challenges. That op-ed made headlines and, after it became clear that Jeffress’ stance was not shared by his peers, the pastor tweeted a condemnation of “false media reports” that he’d broken with the president. Over the last few weeks, Jeffress, who spent the past four years vigorously defending some of Trump’s most controversial policies, has been largely silent about the election on Twitter.",
            "Some of Trump’s close evangelical allies have suggested they are waiting for the “truth” to be made known about the election ― including Franklin Graham, son of the late evangelist Billy Graham; Paula White, Trump’s spiritual adviser; and Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council.",
            "“In other words, they are giving credence to this whole election fraud narrative by virtue of their silence and carefully worded tweets that suggest there might be fraud,” Fea told HuffPost.",
            "Other evangelical figures have been eager to be part of the vanguard pursuing Trump’s claims of fraud. Much of this advocacy has come from Liberty University’s Falkirk Center, which counts Trump lawyer Jenna Ellis and right-wing activist Charlie Kirk among its fellows. Another fellow, Christian author Eric Metaxas, has been alleging on Twitter that the election was stolen ― at one point comparing alleged election fraud to the 9/11 terrorist attacks.",
            "“I’d be happy to die in this fight,” Metaxas told Trump on his radio show on Monday. “This is a fight for everything. God is with us.”",
            "This support has stayed strong even as nearly three dozen election-related lawsuits filed by Trump’s campaign have been thrown out or withdrawn. Two more key states ― Wisconsin and Arizona ― certified Biden’s victory on Monday. The campaign’s claims have even been rebuked by Attorney General William Barr, who told The Associated Press on Tuesday that the Justice Department has not uncovered evidence of widespread fraud that would change the outcome of the election.",
            "Evangelical leaders’ refusal to acknowledge the election results could be a product of their allegiance to the GOP. White evangelicals, in particular, are the most solidly Republican major religious group in the country. They could be simply following the example set by many Republican politicians who have refused to accept Biden’s win.",
            "The “alternate reality” embraced by some evangelicals could also stem from a “parallel culture” that the religious group has built in recent decades, according to Randall Stephens, a historian at the University of Oslo who has studied American evangelicalism. Evangelicals have established their own homeschooling curricula, higher education institutions and accreditation bodies. They’ve created a separate world of entertainment and consumer culture. They have their own alternative experts and fields of knowledge that are largely cut off from the wider academic and intellectual community in the U.S., Stephens said.",
            "“This parallel culture certainly now seems like it was primed for a figure like Trump to play a leading role in it,” he told HuffPost in an email. “Like so many believers, Trump was also skeptical of mainstream knowledge, climate science, vaccines, or the national origins of America’s first black president.”",
            "For some conservative Christians, it seems nearly impossible that Trump could actually have lost the election, Stephens said.",
            "“They might ask themselves why this could possibly happen. Surely, many are thinking, it must be by some malevolent design on the part of Democrats,” Stephens said. “To think that the election was rigged and stolen is a way for them to frame this without completely losing face.”",
            "Religious beliefs about Trump could also be at play. In the eyes of some Christians, his time at the White House has been touched with divine significance. At a moment when conservative Christians felt as if they were losing the culture wars, Trump was seen as a champion hand-selected by God. He may have been an outsider to the evangelical world, but his personal moral failings could be forgiven because of how he fought for causes dear to evangelicals. His actions evoked comparisons to kings in the Bible who, although they didn’t share the Jewish faith, treated the Jewish people with benevolence.",
            "For some Christians, the narratives about Trump being chosen for such a time as this weren’t just stories ― they were prophecies from God, waiting to be tested. According to André Gagné, a theological studies professor at Concordia University and an expert on the Christian right, the belief that God has restored the role of the prophet in modern times is most common among evangelicals from the “neo-charismatic” wave of Pentecostalism, which emerged in the 1980s. Neo-charismatic Pentecostals are a minority within American Christianity ― it’s more of a movement than a specific denomination. As a result, it’s hard to pinpoint exactly how many Americans currently believe prophecies about God wanting Trump to be a two-term president, Gagné said. However, he added, Trump-supporting prophets have amassed substantial followings. They spread their ideas by working with well-established professional networks of like-minded preachers, Gagné said. And now, they are using their platforms to spread theories about election fraud and encourage their audiences to wait just a little longer for the truth to triumph.",
            "“People need to realize that these movements in evangelicalism are not fringe,” Gagné told HuffPost. “These people are really active and they’re successful.”",
            "Lance Wallnau, an evangelical author who has enjoyed access to the White House under the Trump administration, claims that God revealed to him before the 2016 election that Trump would become president and act as a “King Cyrus” ― one of those biblical kings that evangelicals see as benevolent to God’s people. As of this week, Wallnau is still insisting that Trump won the 2020 election by a “landslide.” He has been speculating about election fraud in a series of Facebook live videos for his more than 500,000 followers.",
            "“You’re the smartest audience out there,” Wallnau told his Facebook followers on Monday. “You are the sharpest, you’re the ones that are informed ― you realize that America’s future and the lawlessness that could be released on America is contingent upon this president actually being able to stand in the place that God called him to. And as I believe, God called him to stand longer than what the enemy is trying to do right now.”",
            "Mark Taylor, a retired Florida firefighter, says that God told him in 2011 that Trump would be a two-term president. Taylor’s story inspired a Liberty University-affiliated film, “The Trump Prophecy,” that was released in over 1,000 U.S. theaters. Last week Taylor insisted on his YouTube channel that Trump would be declared president again and that faithful believers just have to be patient and continue praying.",
            "Another prophet, Kris Vallotton of Bethel Church in Redding, California, initially apologized for predicting that Trump would win the election. But he later took that apology down, saying he had decided to “wait until the official vote count is complete.”",
            "Pat Robertson, the 90-year-old founder of the Christian Broadcasting Network, is perhaps the prophet with the loudest microphone. His show, “The 700 Club,” reaches about 650,000 U.S. households every day, according to the network, and has over 2.8 million followers on Facebook. A longtime Trump fan, Robertson told his audience in October that God revealed to him that Trump would win the election “without question.” Last week, Robertson said that Trump still had several paths to victory and that there had been election fraud. On Tuesday, he continued to insist that Trump had “probably” won but turned his ire toward the president’s legal team, claiming they had “screwed up” by waiting too long to start challenging the results of the election.",
            "“They just didn’t think it was necessary, they thought it was an honest election, we’ll just go down and take the results, but they should have known,” Robertson said.",
            "Ultimately, Gagné thinks these prophets will have to grapple with the fact that their predictions didn’t come true. At that point, they may turn to their global networks to try to influence politics in other nations with a strong evangelical presence, such as Brazil. But before doing so, members of the movement will likely rely on “loopholes” to explain the failed predictions, he said ― by claiming that the prophets made a mistake or that God wanted Trump to win but decided not to let it happen to teach the American church a lesson.",
            "“So you either blame the prophet, saying he misheard, or you blame the church or Christians, because they didn’t do what they had to do,” Gagné said.",
            "Although he’s the figure at the center of all these prophecies, Trump hasn’t indicated that he is a charismatic Christian who believes in supernatural gifts granted by the Holy Spirit. The religious figure often cited as most influential for Trump was Norman Vincent Peale, a Christian minister who wrote the best-selling book “The Power of Positive Thinking.” Trump’s parents joined Peale’s New York City church in the 1970s, and Peale presided at Trump’s wedding to Ivana Trump.",
            "A forefather of the self-help movement, Peale encouraged people to visualize their success and to “never think of yourself as failing.” Negative thoughts would lead to negative outcomes, the minister suggested.",
            "In his 2004 book, “How to Get Rich,” Trump called “The Power of Positive Thinking” one of his favorite books. “Some people may think it’s old-fashioned, but what Peale has written will always be true. He advocates faith over fear. Faith can overcome the paralysis that fear brings with it,” Trump wrote.",
            "Both Gagné and Stephens said they see Peale’s influence in Trump’s inability to admit defeat.",
            "Trump’s approach to the election results is similar to how he has responded to the COVID-19 pandemic, Stephens said ― dismissing its severity at every opportunity and admonishing his supporters to not let it dominate their lives.",
            "In “How to Get Rich,” the future president asserted, “To me, germs are just another kind of negativity.”",
            "“That flippant attitude, shocking to many, speaks volumes about how Trump conceives of reality,” Stephens said."

There are numerous psychological and physiological reasons for this phenomenon, from loss of freedom and work stress to issues with transitional moments and disruptions to the body’s natural rhythm.",
            "Fortunately, there are ways to lessen the blow of the start of the workweek and ward off a “case of the Mondays.” Below, mental health experts share their tips for making Mondays less psychologically hard.",
            "Prepare in advance",
            "Take some time to prepare for Monday ― mentally, physically and logistically. it could be as simple as going through the emails that trickled in over the weekend while you weren’t checking your inbox.",
            "“At some point, and I would recommend it be Sunday, look at your schedule for Monday and get familiar with what you face. This lessens the dreaded unknowns,” said John Mayer, a Chicago-based clinical psychologist.",
            "“Take care of your biorhythms,” he added, referring to the body’s natural wake-and-sleep schedule. “Don’t stay up late on Sunday playing video games or scrolling Twitter to all hours and then expect to get up early on Monday. Sadly, Sunday’s sleep cycle should copy your weekday sleep cycle. And chill your alcohol consumption on Sunday. Very few things make Monday morning worse physically than a hangover.”",
            "Start the workday early",
            "“Someone who struggles with transitioning from the weekend to Mondays can find it helpful to get to work early,” said Sanam Hafeez, a neuropsychologist in New York.",
            "She advised arriving at the office (or your designated work-from-home desk) a little earlier than you do on other days, grabbing a cup of coffee, reading the news and maybe having a social interaction with co-workers.",
            "“This will help to ‘wake up’ the mind and quietly adjust to being in the work environment,” Hafeez explained. “Once the workday starts and you’ve found focus, begin with the easy tasks and gradually work up to the more difficult or challenging ones.”",
            "Give yourself something to look forward to",
            "“To ease the difficulty of Mondays, it can be helpful to build our own personal joy by creating something to look forward to on Monday,” said Becky Stuempfig, a licensed marriage and family therapist based in Encinitas, California. “It can be small, simple things such as a favorite breakfast or lunch, or perhaps Monday is ‘takeout night’ to relieve the pressure of cooking a family dinner.”",
            "Planning a special treat for yourself can give you some control over Monday ― whether it’s a personal reward like bar trivia with friends or a favorite workout class, or a work event like casual dress day or pizza day for everyone.",
            "“Maybe you take an extra break on Monday,” Mayer said. “Schedule yourself lighter on Monday if possible. Be creative and make it something to look forward to each Monday.”",
            "Pay attention to your thoughts and feelings",
            "As you wake up and go through the routine of Monday morning, pay extra attention to the thoughts and feelings that arise.",
            "“Even though thousands of them pass through our minds each day, focus on the first ones that pop up,” Hafeez suggested. “Those usually predict the worst and absorb a ‘can’t do’ mentality.”",
            "She noted that negative thoughts often have little or nothing to do with reality and facts, so once you embrace the fact that they aren’t based on anything real, they can more easily fade away with time.",
            "“Lastly, try to obliterate negative feelings like ‘this won’t work,’ ‘this will make me look stupid,’ or ‘I’m going to fail,’ and instead challenge it with a positive thought,” Hafeez said. “For example, turn them into ‘this will work,’ ‘I can do this,’ ‘I am not stupid,’ and ‘it’s worked before, and it can work again.’ This way, a person has control over their thoughts instead of giving them power.”",
            "Set a cutoff time for social media",
            "“I encourage people to limit their social media exposure on Sunday nights and Monday mornings, as there tends to be a very negative attitude about Mondays that often sets the tone for the day with people posting about how much they dread the day and how much caffeine/alcohol they will ‘need’ to simply get through the day,” Stuempfig said. “That kind of constant negativity, even if it is presented as humor, tends to be contagious and can leave us feeling drained.”",
            "Creating boundaries around your technology use in other ways can be helpful as well. If you tend to get overwhelmed by the volume of emails that accumulate on Mondays, consider designating specific times during the day to go through your inbox or sort emails into folders like “needs action” or “review later” to make the task simpler.",
            "Make time on Mondays to focus on your mental health",
            "Make Mondays as pleasant as you can by turning to your favorite self-care techniques, from meditation to journaling to hot baths.",
            "“Doing one thing that feels a little luxurious can go a long way with our mental health,” Stuempfig said. “That could be drinking coffee out of a special mug or taking a 20-minute walk before you start your Monday demands, getting fresh air at lunch or setting up a standing dinner date or, in pandemic times, FaceTime date with a friend on Monday evenings.”",
            "Noel McDermott, a psychotherapist based in the U.K., suggested using psychological tools to cope with feelings of anxiety or stress.",
            "“Like a child who is upset, you can trick your brain into looking at other things and not focusing on the pain, fear or sadness,” he said. “What do you like, what is fun, have you an emotional safe place? Think about those things, not the worry.”",
            "Assess your general happiness at work",
            "“If you consistently find yourself complaining about your job or feeling bored and uninspired, it may be time to create a new situation for yourself,” Stuempfig said. “That does not have to mean a new job necessarily, but you might try examining your current role and how you can find more meaning and enjoyment out of your current situation.”",
            "Do a self-assessment to see if you’re burned out. If so, seek out a career counselor or therapist to gain insight into how you can find more meaning in the way you spend their time during the weekdays.",
            "“Let’s face it, life is short and if you are not finding joy in the way you spend 8-plus hours a day at work, that translates to a large chunk of your life that feels unfulfilling,” Stuempfig said. “Mondays often represent how we feel about the remainder of our week to come. If you struggle with Mondays, it is a worthwhile effort to dig deeper to uncover the root cause of the struggle and take steps to improve it. The benefits will likely have a ripple effect that goes much further than just Mondays.”",
            "Look at the bigger picture of the week",
            "“Make a plan for some spectacular event beyond Monday,” Mayer suggested. “Maybe Friday is date night, so plan that ahead of Monday and you will embrace Monday’s arrival because that gets you to Friday all the sooner. Be creative.”",
            "He also advised against scheduling unpleasant obligations or general “downer” events for Monday, but rather balancing out the emotions of the week by planning to do these tasks on other days.",
            "“Try to not schedule spectacular, fantastic events on Sunday evening,” Mayer added. “This just makes the transition, loss and grieving of ‘MoanDay’ all that harder.”",
            "Accept that Mondays can just suck",
            "Coming to terms with the reality of something unpleasant can lessen its impact on you and give you more power over it.",
            "“Accept that sometimes, Mondays just suck and may be a sign of a good weekend,” said Meg Gitlin, a psychotherapist and the voice behind the Instagram account City Therapist. “Remind yourself that stress is part of living an active, engaged life and that you’re equipped to handle it. Reflect on other difficult weeks you’ve made it through where you’ve not only survived but thrived.”"

        "articleContent": [
            "At the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic in March, many of us were hopeful that things would be go back to normal by summer. But as we barrel toward the ninth month of COVID-19 infections and deaths, it’s hard not to question if this will ever be over.",
            "We’re still in the early stages of the pandemic, according to Manisha Singal, a board certified internal medicine physician and chief medical officer at BridgePoint Hospital in Washington, D.C.",
            "“The pandemic is still in the first half of an American football game. As much information as our scientists have gained to get us our touchdowns, COVID-19 is still blocking and tackling the best of us,” Singal said. “As we enter the winter months, there is the risk that we lose significant ground.”",
            "As discouraging as that may sound, it doesn’t mean this won’t end. It simply means we’ll have to adjust our definition of “over.”",
            "Paul Chung, chair of health systems science at the Kaiser Permanente Bernard J. Tyson School of Medicine, broke it down like this: “Does ‘over’ mean that life returns to 2019 conditions — no masking, no distancing, no hygiene, no fear? Or does ‘over’ mean something less — resumption of most 2019 activities, but with a heightened sense of caution and some attention paid to masking, distancing, and hygiene whenever practical?”",
            "The steps to each endpoint are similar, but the timelines are different, Chung said. The first will take longer, probably on the order of two to three years (or maybe even more). The second could potentially happen by some time next year, if everything goes well.",
            "But what does that even mean? What are these steps, and what needs to happen before this pandemic can be officially declared over? Here’s what experts say:",
            "We need to tackle COVID-19 differently.",
            "There needs to be a whole new approach to confronting the virus before the pandemic can be considered over or resolved, said Daniel B. Fagbuyi, an emergency room physician in Washington, D.C. That starts with leadership and a more coordinated, national pandemic plan.",
            "“It is clear that the pandemic response and messaging has been mediocre,” Fagbuyi said. “The cessation of this pandemic clearly begins with national leadership change, a change of the old guard and a visionary that embraces science.”",
            "Testing needs to improve.",
            "Testing has gotten quite a bit better over the last few months, but there’s still room for improvement, according to Joseph Comber, a professor at Villanova University who specializes in public health and immunization.",
            "“Several folks in the epidemiology and public health community ... have argued for the widespread distribution of rapid antigen tests,” Comber said.",
            "“Ideally these tests would be cheap and able to be performed every day in the home before someone goes to work, to school, etc.,” he continued. “Even if these tests aren’t perfect, if an individual tests positive they can isolate at home and avoid transmitting the virus to others. This is especially important, since there is a significant portion of spread driven by asymptomatic individuals. Widespread use of rapid test can drive down spread and infection rate in communities.”",
            "We need a vaccine.",
            "An effective vaccine will likely be a huge part of the pandemic coming to an end, said Rodney Rohde, a professor in the Clinical Laboratory Science Program at Texas State University and an expert in virology.",
            "“By effective, I mean a vaccine that is relatively as effective as the flu vaccine, hopefully better, that will help create global ― or even regional if we are not able to mass produce one for global delivery at first ― herd immunity,” Rohde said.",
            "Herd immunity at 80% or greater would be ideal, Fagbuyi said. The best way to accomplish this, he said, would be “by identifying safe and effective vaccines that neutralize the virus and augment the body’s immune response over a reasonable time frame without causing untoward side effects.”",
            "Thankfully, it seems like we’re already headed toward this benchmark. Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca have announced their COVID-19 vaccine candidates were highly effective at preventing the coronavirus in human tests, and it’s looking like some will be available for the first round of distribution by the end of 2020.",
            "There needs to be fewer deaths and fewer infections.",
            "This might go without saying, but seeing fewer COVID-19 deaths and infections would clearly indicate that we’re moving in the right direction. The mortality rate and the infection rate should drop significantly enough that it looks “somewhat normal” to the medical community, Rohde said. There’s no magic number, but it certainly would be far lower than the 200,000-plus daily infections we’re seeing right now in the United States.",
            "“In other words, we have thousands of deaths and infections every year from things like influenza, West Nile virus and even antibiotic-resistant infections, and we have become somewhat used to the idea of a steady, low or ‘normal’ mortality of these agents,” Rohde said. “Again, this usually occurs either with a vaccine ... or when the collective human population has enough infections or exposures to the virus that the population adapts and we have enough natural herd immunity to move on.”",
            "The medical community needs a better understanding of long COVID.",
            "Experts are still learning about COVID-19 and its effects, including the symptoms that last long after a patient has been cleared of the virus. William W. Li, a physician and disease researcher, said it’s important to gather more information about these long-term effects.",
            "“The long-term effects of COVID-19 must be figured out, and effective treatments [must be] found and then delivered to the tens of millions of people who have been infected,” Li said. “Experts believe the serious long-term effects of COVID, sometimes called ‘long hauler’s syndrome’ could lead to a second pandemic of illness emerging in people who survived the initial infection and now suffer from a new condition that can surface many months after recovery.”",
            "There needs to be a wider mask mandate.",
            "Fagbuyi said a “national, universal mask mandate” also could contribute to the end of the pandemic.",
            "“While masks aren’t perfect and 100% effective at preventing infection, they are a protective measure that protects both the person wearing the mask and others within the vicinity,” Fagbuyi said. “This is especially important given everything we are learning about transmission of the virus and that airborne transmission does occur.”",
            "“What’s more, masks are one of the most straightforward and easy protective measures that anyone within a community can take,” Fagbuyi continued. “There is no real downside to wearing a mask. Of course, mask mandates must come with continual reminders of safe and effective hygiene practices like washing hands.”",
            "We’ll likely need to continue some pandemic measures even after it’s over.",
            "The “new normal” is a phrase that’s tossed around a lot as everyone looks forward to what comes next. But what will this new way of living really look like? Singal said there will be an era of continued vigilance.",
            "“The practices of three Ws ― wear your masks, wash your hands and watch your distance ― are now indoctrinated necessities taught even to our preschoolers,” Singal said. “Due to lessons learned from past viruses, many people in Asian countries such as China have been wearing masks for years. This will become acceptable and expected across the United States well into 2022.”",
            "Singal said we can also expect to see an “increased use of plastic barriers in places where people congregate to minimize infection, an explosion of online business that minimize human contact, and an increased focus on preventive care to enhance health and wellness.”",
            "Experts are still learning about COVID-19. The information in this story is what was known or available as of publication, but guidance can change as scientists discover more about the virus. Please check the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the most updated recommendations."

            "Leave it to Laverne Cox to shine bright amid both a pandemic and a politically divisive moment for the world. A Netflix documentary she executive-produced, “Disclosure: Trans Lives on Screen,” debuted to great acclaim in June. And her acting career is in high gear, too, with plum roles in the films “Bad Hair” and “Promising Young Woman,” as well as Shonda Rhimes’ “Inventing Anna,” a limited series due out next year.",
            "However, the Emmy-nominated “Orange Is the New Black” star and transgender rights activist is conscious of the fact that her professional highs are set against a sobering reality. According to the Human Rights Campaign, 2020 has already been the deadliest year on record for trans and gender-nonconforming people, with 37 known victims of fatal violence so far. Meanwhile, COVID-19 has left many members of the trans community without access to social support and gender-affirming health care.",
            "To end the year on a positive note for her community, Cox partnered with Citi to promote the bank’s True Name initiative. Created in conjunction with Mastercard and unveiled last month, the program is billed as a first among major banks, offering transgender and nonbinary customers the ability to use their chosen names instead of their legal name or deadname. Previously, the feature was only accessible to those who underwent a legal name change.",
            "“When I changed my name legally 20 years ago and received my new ID with my chosen name reflected, it was so empowering,” Cox told HuffPost in an interview, noting that she’s hopeful other banks will follow Citi’s lead. “I know as a trans person, having ID documents that don’t match who we are can also be a safety issue.”",
            "If it succeeds, Citi’s True Name effort could have a major impact in addressing such concerns. A 2015 National Center for Transgender Equality report found that 68% of respondents did not have a single ID card printed with their gender identity or their chosen name.",
            "According to Citi’s chief marketing officer, Carla Hassan, more than 1,700 customers had already updated their name and gender identity in the month since the program launched, which she feels is “a testament to its direct impact.”",
            "“Our hope is that trans and nonbinary customers feel recognized, accepted and empowered by this initiative,” Hassan told HuffPost. “I believe that any time is the right time to be speaking up for LGBTQ equality and rights. This is a journey that needs to last week beyond any one moment in time, with a continuous commitment to effecting change.”",
            "Though LGBTQ rights as a whole have been rolled back under President Donald Trump, many transgender people have said they’re optimistic following Joe Biden’s election win earlier this month. The president-elect went on to single out trans voters in his victory speech, and last week, acknowledged Transgender Day of Remembrance (Nov. 20) with a poignant note on Twitter.",
            "Cox, for her part, has expressed a measured response to the election results in interviews. But she’s hopeful the Biden era will allow the Supreme Court’s June ruling protecting LGBTQ employees from workplace discrimination to “fulfill its promise.”",
            "She’d also like to see better protections in place for transgender youth in schools, as well as the narrative around transphobic violence reframed.",
            "“I would love the media talking about solutions to ending violence against trans people,” she said. “Helping to improve the material conditions of trans people through employment opportunities and housing could reduce violence against trans people.”",
            "She continued, “We also need to contextualize violence against trans folks in the context of intimate partner violence. We need to make a world where men being attracted to trans women is no longer deeply stigmatized. This is a huge reason why trans women are dying.”"

            "In announcing most of his national security team this week, President-elect Joe Biden sent a big signal about how he will handle foreign policy differently from his immediate predecessors: This will, for better or worse, be the Biden show. Unlike either Donald Trump or Barack Obama, Biden will manage America’s role in the world with a team that is already deeply committed to his perspective ― which could help him get far more done in a job that already has outsize influence over global affairs.",
            "News about Biden’s choices began to spread on Sunday night, when Bloomberg revealed that he would tap Antony Blinken as secretary of state and Axios reported that Linda Thomas-Greenfield would be his ambassador to the United Nations. Less than 24 hours later, Biden’s team confirmed that reporting and unveiled more appointments, notably Jake Sullivan as national security adviser and Avril Haines as director of national intelligence. Reporters, commentators and foreign policy activists scrambled to highlight various parts of the appointees’ pasts to predict how they will behave once in office.",
            "Most of the resulting commentary missed that nearly all of the picks share a crucial characteristic: years of working with Biden, who has his own complex views on international relations and a track record of both achievements and miscalculations. The former vice president is a firm believer in U.S. leadership on the world stage, seeing a role for America in tackling a range of global challenges that may seem remote to some stateside, but he is also cautious about dramatic interventions or attempts to force major changes abroad.",
            "Whether the issue is changing American policy to encourage diplomacy between the Israelis and the Palestinians, reining in U.S. counterterror operations that have killed thousands of civilians overseas, or reducing international troop deployments, Washington’s national security apparatus will soon be guided by the preferences of Biden and people who hew closely to his thinking.",
            "That poses risks like groupthink and a disregard for dissenting views. But it’s also an opportunity, particularly welcome for those who were horrified by how Trump amplified historic problems in U.S. foreign policy like excessive reliance on the military-industrial complex and who want Biden to be creative and interrogate established thinking.",
            "The outgoing president’s initial foreign policy team seemed to hardly understand the system they were taking over, much less share a vision for it. Halie Soifer, a former State Department official under Presidents Obama and George W. Bush who has also advised Vice President-elect Kamala Harris and senators close to Biden, noted the difference between the team in waiting and Trump’s relationship with his first secretary of state, Rex Tillerson.",
            "“They met for the first time in the interview. It’s just such an incredible contrast: Those two men did not know each other. ... Rex Tillerson probably still doesn’t know what Donald Trump’s worldview is,” said Soifer, now the executive director of the Jewish Democratic Council of America. “With Biden and Blinken, they’re almost family at this point. They are incredibly close. And similar things could be said about Jake Sullivan.”",
            "A Team Of Allies",
            "Obama became president after less than four years as a senator, which had been his first position that required work on foreign policy. He gathered national security advisers fast and had a deep bench of Democratic talent to choose from, but the figures he elevated were primarily associated with others in the party ― like his primary rival Hillary Clinton, who became his first secretary of state, or John Kerry, the Democratic presidential nominee before Obama and his top diplomat in his second term.",
            "As Obama confronted crises abroad, the feeling that there were different, sometimes competing centers of power at the White House, the State Department, the Pentagon and elsewhere never fully abated. The question of who best represented the president or who could swing his views was frequently debated both publicly and privately.",
            "Under Trump, who saw diplomacy as a question of how nicely foreigners treated him and was even less familiar with the world of national security experts, the fractures among important agencies working on global affairs became even starker. Trump’s penchant for sudden hires and fires based on a dizzying mix of personal and ideological reasons exacerbated the sense that no one really knew who was in charge or what the U.S. was trying to do.",
            "Biden’s Washington will operate very differently.",
            "At Foggy Bottom, for instance, Blinken will have a clear mandate. “There is no doubt not only that he has the ear of the president but that he has been a part of shaping Biden’s worldview and policies. He just intuitively knows where Biden stands on every issue that matters,” Soifer said.",
            "Former officials expect coherence and team spirit to grow even stronger between Biden and his top advisers after having secured such a hard-won election victory.",
            "John Brennan, a former CIA director, believes that will be the case for chief intelligence official-to-be Haines, who, like Blinken, previously worked with Biden in the Senate. “She enjoys the complete trust and confidence of Joe Biden, who will look to Avril to restore integrity and honesty at the helm of the intelligence community,” Brennan said in a statement.",
            "And international observers welcome the sense of predictability and competence that many believe has been missing for four years.",
            "Biden’s named and likely choices “are experienced, well-informed and with views that are close, if not identical, to the views of the president,” former Israeli diplomat Gadi Baltiansky told the newspaper Ha’aretz.",
            "Not Seeking The Spotlight",
            "In talking about his administration, Trump frequently described people as appropriate for jobs and worth trusting because they were straight out of “central casting.”",
            "The joke among Washington national security hands preparing for the new president is that while Trump gave posts to people who were recent college graduates and either looked the part or had the right ideological credentials, “with Biden, it’s like, you have five years’ experience and a Ph.D.? Maybe we can get you something as a scheduler,” one current official told HuffPost.",
            "By avoiding high-profile political picks for critical foreign policy jobs ― in contrast to Obama and Trump ― Biden has made clear that his administration will prioritize skills and experience in handling global affairs. That affects what advice he gets on foreign policy, in particular lowering the danger of his counselors pushing plans chiefly for the sake of their own future careers, as figures like Trump’s Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seem to have done. And it boosts the sense that his appointees are focusing on the national interest and Biden’s objectives without veering into politicking, not least because many of them are taking over the jobs that have always been their ultimate goals.",
            "Veteran diplomat Thomas-Greenfield, who Biden plans to send to the U.N. to succeed GOP donor Kelly Craft and likely GOP presidential hopeful Nikki Haley, is a prime example of the approach he seems to be taking.",
            "“A lot of people might not even know her. ... Anyone who’s worked at the State Department for the last 35 years would know her,” Soifer said. “She is not political; she’s someone with a wide breadth of diplomatic experience who will be incredibly helpful in rebuilding our relationships.”",
            "Biden’s approach could be the first step in reversing Trump’s yearslong assault on civil servants, which the defeated president has been ramping up in recent weeks.",
            "“Whether or not you agree with them across the board, Biden is building a team of people who actually value government expertise & public service,” David Kaye, a University of California, Irvine, law professor who previously worked with the U.N., wrote on Twitter. “That actually is building back.”"

            "On Monday, The New York Times named Barack Obama’s “A Promised Land” one of the 10 best books of 2020. Previously, the paper had listed it as one of their 100 annual “notable” books, a more uncontroversial claim: a 700-page memoir from a recent president is, if nothing else, at least notable. To deem it one of the best books of the year, however, reeks of grading on a curve. It’s good, considering that he’s a famous politician rather than a professional writer. It’s good, considering how much policy detail he needed to include. It’s good, considering.",
            "But isn’t this the refrain of the Obama presidency? All things considered, it was pretty good; no point in caviling at the flaws. Volume one of his presidential memoir takes this as a central theme: When all is said and done, he’s satisfied that he did the best he could.",
            "In “A Promised Land,” Obama does set himself a hefty challenge. There’s no shortage of raw material to cover. He begins by glossing quickly through his personal history (from his childhood to his stint in the U.S. Senate), spends over 100 pages on his 2008 presidential campaign, and then documents his eventful first three years in office in dogged detail.",
            "“What I’m trying to accomplish in this book is both history and a story,” he told the Atlantic’s Jeffrey Goldberg. “I think what ended up taking a long time was trying to do both.” At some points, Obama explained, he sacrificed narrative flow in favor of policy detail; at other points, he padded his pages with “really nice description[s]” he refused to cut. (Pity the editor tasked with killing Barack Obama’s darlings.) He hoped, he writes in the book’s introduction, to blend history with a “sense of what it’s like to be the president of the United States,” and with an inspiring personal story of his discovery of purpose in public service.",
            "Perhaps he could have trimmed his 700 pages down by nixing some of the more eye-wateringly dull policy explanations, or by reining in his tendency to wander into poetic riffs on his family, the seasonal charms of the Rose Garden, and the long arc of history. Certainly, he insists, he did not set out to write a two-volume memoir. “Despite my best intentions,” he writes, “the book kept growing in length and scope.” Even after eight years in the Oval Office, he was not yet immune to mission creep.",
            "Opening “A Promised Land,” like electing Joe Biden as president, is an uncomfortably nostalgic experience. The first 200 pages of the book revisit Obama’s political origin story and the electric rush of his 2008 presidential campaign ― his star-making turn at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, his cleverest soundbites and most adroit campaign stratagems, his soaring rhetoric, his decisive victory. There’s a subdued, diminished sort of comfort in calling up the memory of something that once thrilled you before it disappointed you.",
            "Obama, a more-than-capable stylist, renders his campaign vividly, sculpting it into a lively narrative. Each campaign stumble is an opportunity to recount a witty reprimand from one of his more seasoned advisers, and to lay the groundwork for a cathartic moment of triumph when he avoids a similar pitfall later. He overcomes poor performances at a health care forum early in the campaign and in early debates with the help of David Axelrod. “Take whatever question they give you, give ’em a quick line to make it seem like you answered it … and then talk about what you want to talk about,” Axelrod advised. “That’s bullshit,” said Obama. But it’s bullshit that works; he realizes that his job is to “perform while still speaking the truth,” and surges back with sharper showings at later debates. He fondly remembers shutting down Hillary Clinton with his response to a question about why he had so many former Clinton officials advising him if he believed the country needed change: “Well, Hillary,” he commented, “I’m looking forward to you advising me as well.”",
            "By the time he recalls election night, the electric rush of his campaign crackles off the page. It was almost difficult, with the unfamiliar sensation of optimism rising in my chest, to remember what happened next. But, as Mario Cuomo once said, “You campaign in poetry; you govern in prose.” Narratively, the book slams into a wall of policy minutiae and nonstop crises. For historical purposes, one understands the value of documenting Obama’s perspective on every beat of appointing Cabinet members and moving the health care bill out of the Senate Finance Committee, but it has the undeniable effect of resembling a briefing book rather than a literary memoir.",
            "Not that he doesn’t keep trying. In his bid for literary readability, Obama offers neat scenes, snappy dialogue and even cliffhangers, which can feel almost comically genre-ready. After several pages describing Muammar Gaddafi’s bloody crackdown against Libyan protesters in 2011, the escalating global pressure to intervene, and the downsides of instituting a no-fly zone over Libya, he ends the chapter with a line straight out of an action movie: “I think,” he tells the team gathered in the White House Situation Room, “I’ve got a plan that might work.”",
            "Obama also has a taste for characterization akin to that of a seasoned feature writer, summing up world leaders with a few revealing lines. Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy, he writes, looks “like a figure out of a Toulouse-Lautrec painting”; Russian President Vladimir Putin has “pale, watchful eyes” and “a casualness to his movements, a practiced disinterest in his voice that indicated someone accustomed to being surrounded by subordinates and supplicants.”",
            "In his interview with Goldberg, Obama explained that his care in describing high-level politicians and foreign leaders was intended to “remind people that these are humans and you can understand them and make judgments.” It works; by humanizing figures like Putin, former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, he diminishes the mythic aura that can surround powerful leaders.",
            "But humanizing also has the effect of inviting empathy. Obama can be harsh on occasion ― correctly assessing Sarah Palin as having “absolutely no idea what the hell she was talking about” ― but even his toughest critiques are gentle at their core. Ignorance, after all, is a kinder frame than viciousness, and he rarely ascribes to greed or cruelty what he can ascribe to obliviousness. The bankers who drove the American economy off a cliff are “people who had no doubt worked hard to get where they were, who had played the game no differently than their peers ... They gave large sums to various charities. They loved their families.” He claims that he can’t understand the bankers’ outrage over proposed Wall Street reforms, but he spends more time trying to empathize with them than he does condemning them.",
            "In one notable scene, driving to his 2009 inauguration with former President George W. Bush, Obama bristles at protestors lining the streets. “I felt quietly angry on his behalf,” he writes. “To protest a man in the final hour of his presidency seemed graceless and unnecessary.” Throughout the book, he describes his efforts to stay focused on those who need him as a champion ― ordinary Americans who lack health care, who face discrimination, who are under water on their mortgages ― but he often bridles at the audacity of those who make him, and other powerful leaders, too uncomfortable in demanding redress.",
            "Obama’s gift for self-reflection can be a balm, contrasting as it does with our current president. Without wallowing in doubt and shame, he offers insight into his own points of weakness ― a tendency to get bogged down in technocratic details, a seed of selfish ambition ― and often follows his own most troubling admissions with a bit of self-reproach. After describing his noble anger at Bush’s inauguration protesters, he admits to “a trace of self-interest.” After all, soon he would be the one facing protests.",
            "Yet when it counts, Obama often seems to leave things out. In his dramatic recounting of planning for the raid that ultimately killed Osama bin Laden, he emphasizes his concern that a targeted missile strike on the compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, would risk collateral damage: “I was not going to authorize the killing of thirty or more people when we weren’t even certain it was bin Laden in the compound,” he recalls. However, the second part of the sentence, though less noble, was likely the operative one: He wanted to be absolutely sure they got bin Laden. Just a couple of pages later, he makes a glancing mention of “U.S. drone strikes against al-Qaeda targets” which “had been generating increasing opposition from the Pakistani public.” When he revisits his counterterrorism policy, it is with grim satisfaction; his only regret is that he has no choice but to order the deaths of hardened young terrorists rather than save them with education and training. Self-searching and moral high-mindedness about the civilian death toll of his expanded program of drone strikes are tellingly absent.",
            "The memoir genre has long inspired debate about the ethics of using the lives of others — which necessarily intersect with that of the author — as fodder for art (or, if not art, for a product to sell). What if that author is a president whose legacy includes inflicting misery on innocents? Should he profit by selling a book defending his exploits? Those questions have hovered around discussions of a possible future Donald Trump memoir: A fat book contract would be quite the reward for his four years of incompetence, bigotry, corruption and cruelty. “A Promised Land” offers a thought-provoking foil; it’s undoubtedly better, more humane and more illuminating than a Trump memoir would be, and yet there’s something unsettling about seeing a 700-page defense of a former president’s decidedly mixed record touted as one of the greatest books of the year.",
            "Perhaps there’s an upper limit on the value and quality a presidential memoir can really offer, just as — as Obama so often argues in this book — there’s a limit on how much good a president, constrained by the vast fragility of the American economy and global politics, can actually achieve in office. Maybe “A Promised Land” is as good as we could ever expect. Maybe his presidency was too. But maybe that doesn’t mean good enough."

            "The general belief is that a COVID-19 and influenza co-infection could be devastating.",
            "Matthew Heinz, an internist treating COVID-19 patients in Tucson, Arizona, said he’s treated numerous patients who’ve had co-infections with the flu and other common coronaviruses in the past.",
            "“They look worse, they sound worse, they take longer to recover,” Heinz told HuffPost.",
            "Early data suggests the same is true with COVID-19. A study from the U.K. found that co-infected people typically had bleaker outcomes. Those co-infected had a doubled risk of dying compared with patients infected solely with COVID-19 (and nearly six times greater mortality risk compared with those with neither infection). They were also more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit and require a ventilator. Researchers in China and Iran have published similar findings.",
            "Influenza can harm the body similarly to COVID-19 — both cause decreased blood oxygen levels, respiratory issues and inflammation.",
            "“Really all strains of influenza and SARS-CoV-2 are potentially very, very lethal infections,” Winslow said. “Having [these] two infections at the same time could potentially make the inflammatory response much worse.”",
            "The risk is expected to be greater among people more susceptible to each virus — such as older adults and people with underlying health conditions like obesity, cancer and lung disease.",
            "“Those vulnerable groups overlap between both illnesses,” which puts them at an even higher risk, said Onyema Ogbuagu, a Yale Medicine infectious disease doctor.",
            "The immune response may not work on both",
            "According to Ogbuagu, there are both general and specific immune responses that a body mounts to fight a viral infection. In theory, that general immune response may be able to help out with other viruses to some degree.",
            "“Once that’s revved up, it can mitigate the severity of a second co-infection,” Ogbuagu said.",
            "Unfortunately, for some people, that general immune response might not be enough. And the more targeted response, which our immune system specifically produces for each distinct virus, won’t be effective at fighting other pathogens.",
            "“What [the immune system] throws at one virus doesn’t work on the other, so it has to figure out how to do both. It’s very taxing for the immune system to be fighting off two aggressive and severe respiratory illnesses at the same time,” Heinz said.",
            "Get tested for both illnesses this season",
            "Because it’d be easy to miss one of the infections or misdiagnose one as the other, it’s critically important to get tested for both. The treatments for COVID-19 and influenza are very different, and you definitely want to ensure both infections are appropriately treated.",
            "“Knowing that a person is co-infected and knowing what this does to the overall morbidity and mortality, the whole disease course, you will be more aggressive and more aggressive faster,” Heinz said.",
            "Doctors are still gathering data on co-infections. With flu season just kicking off, researchers suspect co-infections have been underreported. “We just haven’t had enough cases of co-infection to determine if there are better or worse outcomes,” Ogbuagu said.",
            "As we head into the colder months, we’ll see a clearer picture of how co-infections play out in different people. For now, health experts say the best way to prevent both infections is to continue practicing all the recommended pandemic safety precautions.",
            "“We really need everyone to get a flu shot, and we really need everyone to wear their masks and socially distance and buckle down and stick to it,” Heinz said.",

            "As coronavirus case numbers surge across the country, it’s not just the obvious places you should avoid: political rallies, large weddings, crowded bars, restaurants and night clubs.",
            "More and more, health experts warn that COVID-19 is being transmitted at the intimate get-togethers many of us believed were relatively safe: Dinner parties with close, trusted friends. Game nights with family members who live in different households. Sleepovers and learning pods with just a handful of kids and parents involved.",
            "“Right now, we are seeing rampant increases in transmission of the virus within the community, often tied to small gatherings or small outbreaks in controlled settings,” said Kirsten Hokeness, professor and chair of the Department of Science and Technology at Bryant University and an expert in immunology, virology, microbiology and human health and disease.",
            "Some health experts and government officials are calling this kind of transmission “living room spread.” It’s a simple concept: When people from different households and different social bubbles get together indoors sans masks ― to share some wings over a football game, for instance, or to have a dinner party ― they tend to let their guards down.",
            "Friends and family may swear they’ll keep to their separate tables or corners of the room beforehand, but at the moment, it’s all too easy to fall back into our old habits: Masks get taken off so we can hear each other better, we get closer, we try to sneak in a quick hug goodbye. We’re social animals, after all, and though this has been the longest eight months of many of our lives, we’re still acclimating to life with COVID-19.",
            "Still, because the virus can be passed asymptomatically, scenarios like these are scarily easy ways to contract the coronavirus. Your cousin or close friend may appear healthy while still being a carrier of the virus.",
            "Unlike super-spreader events, “living room spread” or mini spread events make contract tracing increasingly difficult for health department officials, Hokeness said.",
            "“What this means is that we need to be more careful with who we interact with, limiting it to those most necessary,” she said. “We need to decrease our inner circles once again until the levels of the virus become more manageable in the population.”",
            "It’s worth noting that some epidemiologists say it’s impossible to estimate how much social gatherings contribute to community transmission. They stress that large public gatherings remain the biggest culprit. Now that the virus is so widespread, they say it’s become increasingly difficult to pinpoint a single source for an outbreak.",
            "“More and more, our exposures are due to community spread and are not traceable to a single event,” Nicole Peske, chief communications officer for the North Dakota Department of Health, told The New York Times on Monday. “Many individuals are reporting more than one exposure.”",
            "Still, state governments can and are enacting restrictions limiting the number of people allowed to gather in private homes. Given how out of control the virus is now ― new infections surpassed 187,833 on Friday, exceeding the last daily record by more than 10,000, while the number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 reached 80,000 ― it couldn’t hurt to scale back on socializing.",
            "We’re all sick of social distancing, but as we get deeper into the winter months and spend more time indoors, it’s never been more important to keep our social circles as teeny-tiny and antisocial as possible.",
            "“It’s hard to tell who is a carrier of the virus or who is infected,” said Jagdish Khubchandani, a professor of public health at New Mexico State University. “We interact with people from all walks of life, these people also interact with others, and it’s hard to create a circle or keep a track of who interacts with who.”",
            "“The best way to avoid flooding our hospitals is to be responsible, stay with family members, avoid going out if not essential,” he added.",
            "If you’ve let more people into your social bubbles and quarantine pods in the last few months, now is the time to tighten up again. (Plus, with a vaccine now in sight, how depressing would it be to catch the virus mere months before distribution may be possible?)",
            "Sans a vaccine, face masks and tight-knit social bubbles are the best mechanisms we have to protect ourselves and each other, Hokeness said. Both she and Khubchandani agreed that a maximum of 10 people should be the limitation on the bubble, when you factor in family size, relatives and very close friends.",
            "To be safest, confine your bubble to only those people who live in your household, said Nikole Benders-Hadi, the medical director of behavioral health at Doctor On Demand.",
            "“To further outline the risk, think about the fact that for every new person you come into contact with, you have potentially exposed yourself to an additional 5-10 individuals depending on how isolated (or not) that person may have recently been,” Benders-Hadi said.",
            "Here’s how to effectively prune your social bubble without coming across as a jerk.",
            "At this point, you may be realizing that your bubble has gotten big enough to burst. How do you close up said bubble without losing friends or coming across as judgmental in the process? (“Sorry, you didn’t make the cut on my redefined quarantine bubble! Also, I’ve seen your Instagram stories, maybe you should do some pruning, too.” Please don’t take that tack.)",
            "Be polite and courteous, but firm. If they ask why you continue to say you’re unavailable for plans, let them know that for the time being, you’re being extra cautious because of the COVID-19 surge.",
            "“It’s OK to disagree with how others are reacting and responding to this virus, but you should be able to say that for the time being, it’s in the best interest of you and your family to restrict gathering,” Hokeness said.",
            "“You have to be confident enough to surround yourself with people that are like-minded and whom you trust when it comes to how they approach this pandemic,” she added.",
            "It’s important to note that you’re not likely to change people’s minds or behavior in their own lives when you broach this conversation. No need to go into a safety spiel, you’re already excommunicating them from your pandemic pod.",
            "“At this point in the pandemic, everyone has formulated their own opinions [on safety and risks], so certainly try to avoid that confrontation,” Hokeness said. “Instead, you can suggest alternative ways of staying connected such as using online platforms like Zoom or FaceTime to hang out.”",
            "And let’s be honest: You’ve probably been observing how members of your inner circle have been behaving in their daily lives on social media. That may come into play when you’re deciding who’s pod-caliber.",
            "If it’s someone you’re normally close to, you can always reintroduce them into your pod if you know they’re being mindful of the guidelines.",
            "If that’s the case, be sure you have candid, direct conversations with them about what you’re comfortable and not comfortable with in terms of risks, said Amelia Aldao, a psychologist and anxiety specialist in New York City. Find out what they’re uncomfortable with, too. Your pandemic pod should serve every member’s needs.",
            "“We all have different tolerance for risks, varying health risk factors and unique life circumstances ― for instance, someone may be living with older parents,” she said. “So, whether you want to bring people into your bubble, kick them out, or send them to bubble purgatory (i.e., quarantine until you join my bubble), be upfront, clear, and also patient and understanding of other people’s choices.”",
            "For what it’s worth, if you slipped recently and let your bubble get a little too big, you’re not alone. Humans have an insatiable drive for social connection and we also don’t do well with life uncertainties. This is alien territory for all of us. Given all of that, Aldao thinks slipping into risky behavior was bound to happen.",
            "“When we’re anxious, we tend to fall into a pattern of dichotomous thinking: We see things as black and white, good or bad, safe or unsafe,” she said. “Entertaining shades of grey or ‘maybes’ tends to fuel our anxiety. There’s comfort in the extremes.”",
            "When we started forming pandemic pods, we began to label people as “safe” without necessarily challenging our assumptions. These precautionary conversations about COVID-19 are not unlike “safe sex” talks in terms of awkwardness. It’s easier to just assume someone has been as cautious or vigilant as we have.",
            "“I think it just became easier to simply assign people the label of ‘safe’ and carry on,” Aldao said.",
            "The therapist added that we’ve done the same with people we’ve deemed unsafe. How many articles have you read bemoaning young people’s active social lives in the midst of the pandemic? You may have presumed the same is true of the Gen Z-ers in your family.",
            "But regardless of how lax you or others may have gotten in recent weeks, now is the time to clamp down, ask questions, generate thoughtful alternatives and also be kind and patient with others.",
            "“Will this be an easy conversation? No. Will it be awkward? Most likely,” Aldao said. “But, at the end of the day, you want to socialize with those people who care about you and understand your needs.”",
            "Experts are still learning about COVID-19.

            "Alan Ball won an Oscar for his original screenplay of “American Beauty” and has established himself as a prestige television visionary with “Six Feet Under” and “True Blood.” His new Amazon Prime film, however, affords him an opportunity his earlier work did not: the chance to revisit ― and subsequently reimagine ― his own family history.",
            "Written and directed by Ball, “Uncle Frank” follows Beth Bledsoe (played by Sophia Lillis), a young woman eager to escape small-town South Carolina in the early 1970s. She finds a kindred spirit in her uncle Frank (Paul Bettany), a New York University professor whose thoughtful demeanor and smart fashion sense set him apart from the rest of the Bledsoe clan, including his macho father (Stephen Root). When Beth arrives in New York to attend college, she learns that Frank is gay and in a committed relationship with Wally (Peter Macdissi, who is Ball’s real-life partner), a Saudi Arabian expat.",
            "An unexpected tragedy, however, soon prompts Frank and Beth to return to their hometown. Once there, he’s forced to drop the longstanding facade among loved ones and confront emotions he’d suppressed for decades.",
            "Catch a sneak peek at “Uncle Frank” via the clip above.",
            "Ball, a Georgia native, based the screenplay for “Uncle Frank” on a conversation he’d had with his mother 30 years ago, shortly after he came out as gay.",
            "“She said, ‘I blame your father because I think he was that way, too,’” Ball told HuffPost in an interview. “I’ll never know if that’s true [because] my dad had already died at that point. But the next day, we were driving around and passed this lake, and my mom said, ‘That’s where Sam Lassiter drowned.’ And I said, ‘Who is Sam Lassiter?’ And she said, ’He was a real, real, real good friend of your daddy.”",
            "At that point, Ball recalled, “I had this sort of ‘what if’ moment. What if that were true? What might their story have been?”",
            "To modern audiences, Bettany is best known as a Marvel Cinematic Universe stalwart, thanks to performances in “Iron Man” and “The Avengers,” as well as their subsequent followups. But it was his work in 2018’s “Journey’s End,” in which he portrayed a World War I soldier awaiting a deadly offensive, that convinced Ball the actor was a good fit for “Uncle Frank.”",
            "Like Ball, Bettany had a familial connection to the “Uncle Frank” narrative. In interviews, the actor has cited his father’s late-life decision to live openly as a gay man, only to renounce his sexuality before his death, as an inspiration for his performance. Still, his casting is likely to be scrutinized given that the actor, who is married to “A Beautiful Mind” star Jennifer Connelly, isn’t gay himself. Though Ball views the push to cast LGBTQ actors in queer roles as valid, he said he couldn’t imagine anyone except Bettany playing Frank.",
            "“His character [in ‘Journey’s End’] was imbued with such dignity, decency and compassion, and I knew I wanted those qualities for Frank,” Ball said. “Also, Paul’s father was gay. He had a 20-year relationship with another man, and when that man died, he went back into the closet.",
            "“So, for Paul, it was also a chance to do a ‘what if’ story about his own father,” Ball added. “He understood how early trauma in life can affect somebody.”",
            "“Uncle Frank” had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in January and was aiming for a theatrical release before COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. The movie, which also stars Judy Greer and Margo Martindale, debuted to mostly positive reviews, with Bettany’s performance cited as a career best.",
            "Ultimately, Ball would like “Uncle Frank” to impart an overriding “message of hopefulness, acceptance and coexistence” that can be read as an antidote to the tumult of 2020.",
            "“I wanted to make a movie that was a gay love story with a middle-aged couple where nobody had to die,” Ball said. “It’s not just about coming out, it’s about confronting the past. I don’t see a lot of stories about people overcoming trauma. That’s always of interest to me.”",
            "“Uncle Frank” will debut on Amazon Prime Nov. 25."

            "A Tennessee law outlawing abortion based on a patient’s reason for the procedure, including a potential Down syndrome diagnosis or the sex or race of the fetus, can take effect, a federal appeals court has ruled.",
            "The measure, dubbed a “reason ban” by reproductive rights advocates, was part of an extreme anti-abortion bill signed into law by Gov. Bill Lee (R) in July.",
            "The legislation was challenged by the Center for Reproductive Rights, the American Civil Liberties Union, Planned Parenthood Federation of America, and the ACLU of Tennessee on behalf of abortion providers in the state. The ban was in effect for less than an hour before it was blocked in court.",
            "The ruling Friday by the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals allows the reason ban to go immediately into effect. Another part of the law, which would ban abortion at nearly every stage of pregnancy, starting as early as six weeks, remains blocked.",
            "The groups that brought the lawsuit have asked the court for a temporary restraining order blocking the reason ban again, arguing that it is a violation of the constitutional right to abortion before viability.",
            "“These bans are just another way anti-abortion politicians are attempting to limit the constitutional right to abortion care and to create stigma,” said Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, in a statement. “Decisions about whether and when to continue or to end a pregnancy are best made by the individual and their family. We will continue to fight these bans in the courts.”",
            "More than a dozen states have passed similar reason bans, said Elizabeth Nash, who tracks abortion regulations at the Guttmacher Institute, which advocates for abortion rights. Some of the bans have been blocked in the courts; others are currently in effect.",
            "Four states, which as of now include Tennessee, prohibit abortions on the basis of genetic anomaly or Down syndrome diagnosis. Eleven states have a sex-selection ban in effect, and four have a race-selection ban in effect.",
            "These types of bans put providers and patients in difficult situations because they force doctors to ask their patients about the reasons for their abortion, Nash said.",
            "“This is far out of bounds of what you would consider compassionate health care,” she said. “You don’t interrogate people for their reason for an abortion, or other health care.”",
            "Reason bans, which have risen in popularity in recent years, are part of a multi-pronged strategy by opponents of abortion rights to reduce access, she said.",
            "“States are trying to ban abortion at lower gestational ages, trying to ban methods of abortion, trying to ban reasons of abortion ― really just trying to make it harder and harder to get an abortion,” she said.",
            "Reason bans are particularly problematic because the emphasis is on the patient’s decision-making process, Nash added.",
            "“Instead of looking at the patient’s needs and how to get them the care they need, it’s much more about questioning the motivations of the patient,” she said.",

            "“This law is just another unconstitutional effort to ban abortion in our state,” Weinberg said in a statement. “It does nothing to address the serious concerns of those with disabilities in our community or to ensure that people living with disabilities and their families have access to health care and other services they may need.”"

            "When the COVID-19 pandemic first shuttered schools nationwide last spring, many teenagers were ecstatic. They could sleep in. Wear pajamas all day. Spend hours on social media.",
            "“At first, it was this cool thing,” said a 17-year-old in a new report co-written by The California Partners Project and The Child Mind Institute, which explores how teenagers are navigating their new normal during COVID-19.",
            "Months later, the novelty has worn off and teenagers are suffering. Interviews and diary entries from nearly 50 California teenagers reveal that they’re sleeping and exercising less and spending more time on social media and gaming.",
            "The report paints a troubling picture of adolescents experiencing a profound sense of loss and grief amid school closures and lockdowns who are turning to technology and social media as a “constant sedative,” its authors say.",
            "The teens in the study said they were going to sleep later than they did before COVID-19, used their devices to check social media or games while they were supposed to be doing remote learning and often kept their phones with them throughout the night.",
            "“Sometimes the phone hits me in the face,” one survey participant said, “so I must fall asleep with it in my hand.”",
            "Several teenagers also described themselves as “addicted” to their technology during the pandemic, saying things like: “I know it’s bad, but everyone’s doing it.”",
            "“Kids are struggling with the pandemic — the fears that it brings and the limitations on their life,” Olivia Morgan, co-founder of CPP, told HuffPost. “The way they described their experience so aligned with the stages of grief. They talked so much about loss. They talked about being angry. They talked about in the beginning being in denial.”",
            "The new report is simply the latest in a string of surveys demonstrating the undeniable toll COVID-19 isolation has taken on everyone, including American teens, millions of whom are continuing to learn remotely at least part-time.",
            "In one May survey, 7 out of 10 teenagers indicated they were struggling with their mental health in some way.",
            "A June survey of more than 3,000 children found that 30% of 13- to 19-year-olds said they felt unhappy or depressed during COVID-19.",
            "Perhaps most concerning, a report released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention earlier this month found that the proportion of teenagers’ visits to emergency departments for mental health-related reasons jumped by more than 30% from the start of the pandemic through the fall compared to the same period of time the year before.",
            "Parents and caregivers are troubled, feeling powerless against new COVID-19 school routines that require their children to be on devices for much of the day.",
            "“I worry,” one parent said in a diary response that was part of the California Partners Project report. “He stays in PJs and seems generally unenthused about everything except food and video games. I told him to get half an hour of sun and he jokingly said, ‘It’s scary outside.’”",
            "Morgan, herself a parent of adolescents, said she has personally noticed many of the patterns described in the new report in her own household: Her children’s bedtimes crept later and later; they stopped playing sports; their family limits on video games “went out the window.” She hopes other parents will identify with the qualitative findings and that they might help reassure teenagers they are not the only ones struggling to cope during the pandemic.",
            "Parents can help kids be more mindful of how long they are on screens (but not blame them for it), the report suggests. They can set boundaries around using phones and other devices in the hour before bedtime and encourage children to take walks or move their bodies every day. Parents may find it useful to help children brainstorm downtime activities that don’t require them to look at a screen.",
            "“I think it’s helpful for parents to see these are becoming longterm habits and patterns. And we kind of let the wheels come off the bus because we were getting through something. But now it’s been eight months, and we have longer to go,” Morgan said. “We need to ‘reassemble’ at least a few of the wheels to take the best possible care of our kids through the remainder of this pandemic.”"

            "Loeffler attended in-person events with both men Friday after undergoing two tests for the virus. A rapid test immediately came back negative for the virus; a second PCR test, which requires lab analysis, came back positive later that evening, her campaign said in a statement Saturday.",

Vice President Kamala Harris, acting as president of the Senate, could cast any tie-breaking vote in the Democrats’ favor."

            "Stephanie Freed and Grant McDonald aren’t lobbyists, but they’re orchestrating a sophisticated campaign pressuring senators to save the federal unemployment benefits that are expiring next month.",
            "When those benefits lapse on Dec. 26, neither will have any income.",
            "The two New Yorkers lost their jobs in the theater industry in March. With the coronavirus pandemic raging worse than ever and Broadway shut down for many more months, they don’t know how soon they’ll be able to work again.",
            "“I can’t afford my apartment anymore and I will likely be moving to my parents’ house, in my 30s, which is a weird mental space to be in,” Freed said.",
            "“I’d lose my apartment come January and will not be able to continue to afford health care,” McDonald said. “It is a big ego and financial hit that because of government inaction we now have to uproot our entire lives.”",
            "They both consider themselves far more fortunate than many others who have lost their jobs, but they’re not taking the situation lying down.",
            "Freed and McDonald created a website, extendPUA.org, in July to call for a continuation of the federal unemployment supplement that added $600 to weekly payments under the CARES Act. They also traveled to Washington to speak at a press conference with Democrats outside the Capitol.",
            "Congress didn’t listen, and the $600 dried up. More than 6 million workers are still getting state-funded unemployment benefits, which average around $300 per week. Approximately 13 millions others are still getting payments from a federal program for gig workers and another for the long-term jobless, which will last until Dec. 26.",
            "Freed and McDonald want to see Congress not only revive the extra $600 per week, but also to save the remaining federal programs set to expire next month. And they’re organizing hundreds of other unemployed workers to demand action.",
            "Their grassroots lobbying effort has involved more than 30 Zoom and phone meetings with Senate offices. They have focused mostly on Republicans, and for the most part, staffers have told them their bosses support more assistance.",
            "Staff for Sens. John Cornyn (R-Texas) and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) even told them, in September, that the senators would support a continuation of the $600 supplement if Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) allowed a floor vote on such a measure. (Both senators voted for an amendment to curtail the benefit before the CARES Act passed in March, but voted for the broader legislation.)",
            "“Senator Tillis believes a bipartisan compromise should include extended unemployment benefits at a level that provides much-needed relief without inadvertently providing some with more federal benefits than they earned at their previous employer, which would ultimately hamper our nation’s long-term economic recovery,” a Tillis spokesperson said in an email.",
            "Democrats have pushed to bring back the extra $600, reauthorize the other expiring unemployment programs, and extend a plethora of other coronavirus relief measures as part of a $2 trillion package. Republicans have refused to go along, insisting that a smaller bill would be more appropriate.",
            "For the most part, Republicans have said the extra $600 was too much, because a substantial number of workers who received the increased benefit made more than they had earned at their jobs. Freed and McDonald have armed their volunteers with talking points explaining that available evidence suggests the $600 hasn’t held back hiring at all.",
            "People call their representatives every day to ask for help or to urge them to take action. They may also petition their government in-person, visiting Capitol Hill offices as part of a broader lobbying campaign coordinated by a professional association, whether it’s a labor union or the National Potato Council. Such a tactic is known as a “fly-in,” wherein career lobbyists leverage regular folks for a political goal.",
            "Freed and McDonald are doing a more grassroots (and digital) version of the fly-in, since they are themselves unemployed and not getting any help from a professional association. They said they’ve arranged for more than 100 unemployed people to talk to Senate staff, and that their website has funneled more than 20,000 emails to lawmakers.",
            "Freed is a production electrician and lighting designer. McDonald is a video director. The work simply can’t happen until people can gather to form an audience. Neither wants to give up their career, but they have applied for jobs outside of the industry. Both described meeting wariness from potential employers who feared they would return to their old jobs as soon as they could.",
            "It’s clear to them that the government has to step in and make sure they don’t go broke while they wait for the public health threat to subside.",
            "“I just can’t believe this is happening from our government,” Freed said. “It’s incredible that we have to fight this hard.”"

White evangelicals are more likely to say this than any other religious group, PRRI reported.",
            "The contemporary Christian music world Nordeman hails from has deep ties to white evangelical culture. Many of the artists in this music scene have either stayed silent about whether or not they approved of Trump’s actions and policies over the past four years ― or they’ve been willing to come right out and boldly support him. It’s rarer for musicians from that world to be openly critical of Trump, as Nordeman has been.",
            "Nordeman had a considerable presence in the contemporary Christian music world in the early 2000s, winning multiple Gospel Music Association Dove Awards, the Christian music industry’s equivalent to the Grammys. After taking a hiatus to focus on her personal life, she released her fifth studio album, “Every Mile Mattered,” in 2017. She’s still writing and recording music while also serving as worship arts minister at a United Methodist Church in Tulsa, Oklahoma.",
            "Most evangelical Christians agree that churches should follow the same rules about social distancing and large gatherings as other organizations or businesses in their local area. Dozens of Christian leaders — including Dr. Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health —have called on fellow believers to follow the advice of public health experts during the pandemic.",
            "Still, conservative Christian activists, pastors and legal firms have been leading the charge against coronavirus restrictions on churches ― filing lawsuits against worship restrictions in various states and even openly flouting local rules. One Christian musician, Sean Feucht, has drawn hundreds of often-maskless worshippers to events across the country to protest what he has called “unprecedented” attacks on the “freedom to worship God and obey His Word.”",
            "Nordeman hasn’t been shy about calling out Feucht or other Christians who disregard public officials’ health orders.",
            "“I am weary of fabricated ‘persecution’ narratives,” she tweeted in September, responding to one of Feucht’s posts about a protest event in Chicago. “Worship doesn’t require self orchestrated chaos.”",
            "Leaders are charged with shepherding their people well, communicating both hope and reality, she wrote in March. Refusing to submit to experts’ guidelines “is not standing your ground against Satan, it’s choosing not to love and protect the most vulnerable neighbors in your flock.”",

            "Duncan Sheik can’t escape the shadow of “Barely Breathing,” his 1996 breakout hit that’s become an era-defining, pop-rock staple. The Grammy-winning singer-songwriter made peace with this fact long ago, even though the song (and mainstream radio as a whole) has never encapsulated his ambitions.",
            "Sheik went on to showcase his artistry through a mid-career pivot into musical theater, endearing himself to a new legion of fans as the composer of 2006’s “Spring Awakening,” among other shows. But he still has a lot to say as a solo artist, as evidenced by his exceptional new album, “Live at the Café Carlyle.” HuffPost got an early listen to the album’s third single, an emotional version of Radiohead’s “Fake Plastic Trees.” The track’s music video was shot at Sheik’s home studio in Garrison, New York, and is viewable above.",
            "Never one for covers, Sheik nonetheless began including “Fake Plastic Trees” in his live shows in the 1990s. The song, which first appeared on Radiohead’s 1995 album “The Bends,” alludes to the power of forging human connections in a world of artifice. It’s oddly appropriate that Sheik is releasing his first recording of the track in 2020, a time when loved ones are distressfully out of reach for many.",
            "“It’s just one of those songs I feel like I can sink my teeth into,” he told HuffPost in an interview. “It’s just a really poignant idea ― how contemporary urban life alienates us from everything real. It captured a moment in time that I just carry around.”",
            "Like the rest of the album, “Fake Plastic Trees” was recorded during Sheik’s weeklong concert run at the Café Carlyle, an intimate New York music venue, in 2017. Due out Dec. 4, the 17-track set offers a sense of welcome melancholy befitting its late autumn release. The set’s highlights include the wistful “Such Reveries,” off of 2002’s “Daylight,” as well as “Circling” and “Half a Room,” both from 2015’s “Legerdemain.” Actor Kathryn Gallagher joins Sheik on several songs from his theater scores for “Spring Awakening” and “Alice by Heart,” the latter of which was staged off-Broadway last year.",
            "A stripped-down version of “Barely Breathing,” which should appease both pop purists and those wanting to hear Sheik flex his musical muscle, appears late in the set. While not exactly an afterthought, the song’s placement is perhaps indicative of the relationship the artist has with his best-known composition nearly 25 years after its release.",
            "“I bore a grudge against it because it lived on the radio far longer than it should have,” Sheik said. “And then other things that I was hoping would make it onto the radio never got a chance to, so I was being cock-blocked by my own song at the time. But once ‘Spring Awakening’ happened and I had other successes to hang my hat on, I became much more open to performing it without any complicated energy around it.”",
            "The release of “Live at the Café Carlyle” comes at a creatively bittersweet time for Sheik. Before theaters and performance spaces closed in March due to COVID-19, a New York production of his musical “Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice” was nearing the end of its off-Broadway run. A second show, “Whisper House,” was in rehearsals and set to begin performances that month.",
            "Begrudgingly released from his theatrical responsibilities, Sheik has been relishing the time at home with longtime girlfriend Nora Ariffin and their 3-year-old daughter, Ines. And while a return to the concert stage isn’t in the foreseeable future given the continued impact of COVID-19, the recording studio continues to beckon.",
            "“It’s been great to write and record a piece of music and not have any specific intentions about where it needs to land,” he said. “The little nascent musical ideas are some of the most immediate things I’ve done in a really long time. I’ve been able to really concentrate on making music for music’s sake.”",

But some conservative bishops, noting the church’s strong opposition to abortion, were upset last week when Gomez congratulated Biden — a fellow Catholic — on his victory.",
            "On Tuesday, as the USCCB ended the public portion of its two-day national meeting, Gomez departed from the official agenda to broach the issue.",
            "“We are facing a unique moment in our history,” he said. “The president-elect has given us reason to think he will support some good policies” but also some that “undermine our preeminent priority of the elimination of abortion.”",
            "“These policies pose a serious threat to the common good,” Gomez said. “When politicians who profess the Catholic faith support them ... it creates confusion among the faithful about what the church actually teaches on these questions.”",
            "Gomez said he would form a working group to address the matter, headed by the USCCB’s vice president, Detroit Archbishop Allen Vigneron.",
            "There was no immediate response by Biden’s transition team to an AP request for comment.",

            "“These conversations can be difficult, painful,” Lori said. “A lot of people don’t think they need those conversations because they don’t have a racist bone in their body. The reality is much different.”",

            "“It brought home the fact that white supremacy is not a harmless fringe ideology. It’s a death-dealing ideology,” Seitz said. “It reminded us that words matter — words that denigrate immigrants and other people of color really matter and feed into these ways of thinking.”",
            "Seitz said the diocese is looking at forming a truth commission exploring the history and current status of racism in the region, and how it has impacted Native Americans, Hispanics, immigrants and others.",

            "Amid the protests following Floyd’s killing, some Black Catholics were outspoken in urging the church to take substantive steps conveying that their presence is valued. There have been calls for some form of reparations, and for the teaching of Black Catholic history in Catholic schools.",
            "Black Catholics’ somewhat marginal place in the U.S. church is illustrated by statistics compiled by the USCCB: There are about 3 million African American members of the faith, roughly 4% of the nation’s 69 million Catholics, but as of January there were just 250 Black priests, or less than 1% of the total of 36,500.",
            "Also Tuesday, a dozen bishops shared their experiences coping with the coronavirus pandemic, which has forced many dioceses to halt or sharply reduce in-person worship.",

            "The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) is sounding the alarm on the consequences of not immediately including children in ongoing COVID-19 vaccine research.",
            "Preliminary data released from drug manufacturers Moderna and Pfizer Inc. this month has been extremely impressive, suggesting both vaccines may be more than 90% effective.",
            "But as members of the AAP argued earlier this fall — and reiterated in an open letter to federal health officials on Tuesday — it is essential that the Food and Drug Administration stick to “transparent requirements” for measuring risks and benefits of vaccines in all sub-groups of the population, including children.",
            "The letter was also signed by six other major medical groups, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and American Medical Association (AMA).",
            "“We eagerly anticipate seeing the safety and efficacy data in vaccine trials that are underway in adults, and urge pharmaceutical companies to rapidly expand their participant panels to include children and adolescents,” Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, chair of the AAP Committee on Infectious Diseases, said in a press statement.",
            "Buoyed by the preliminary findings from Pfizer and Moderna, experts have predicted it’s possible that multiple coronavirus vaccines could be widely available in the U.S. by next spring. But thus far children have been largely excluded from the vaccine research.",
            "In late October, Pfizer was given the green light to test its vaccine in children in the U.S. ages 12 and up. And Moderna has indicated it plans to start testing its vaccine in children, pending approval to do so.",
            "All of which means that children may not have a vaccine available to them until well into 2021.",
            "“This research takes time. If this does not begin soon, it will be less likely a vaccine will be available for children before the next school year,” Maldonado said.",
            "Of course, one significant challenge is that parents must volunteer their kids to receive an experimental treatment. Some parents who have enrolled their children in Pfizer’s study say they have faced trolling online from people questioning their judgment.",
            "But pediatricians cite many reasons why it is essential to test COVID-19 vaccines in children. For one, their immune systems are different than adults’, and they also appear to respond differently to COVID-19 itself for reasons that are not fully understood.",
            "Children also face the rare but serious risk of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, or MIS-C, which appears to develop weeks after they are exposed to the coronavirus. It’s important that whatever vaccine is available to children not trigger a similar response.",
            "Delays in vaccinating children could also hamper our collective effort to stem COVID-19 transmission. As Dr Priya Soni, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Los Angeles’ Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, told HuffPost in October: “Children could likely remain a large reservoir for infection. This would in turn undermine all our other pandemic mitigation efforts.”",
            "Experts also say children must be included in trials as soon as possible to shore up public trust in vaccines when they become available. Vaccine hesitancy among parents is an ongoing public health problem in the U.S., and the AAP fears that it will only be exacerbated by not including children in ongoing vaccine research as soon as possible.",
            "“Assuming that one or more of these vaccines are shown to be safe and effective in adults, in order for parents to be comfortable giving these vaccines to their children, we must have studies showing they are safe and effective in children as well,” Maldonado said.",

            "For many Americans, the unwritten rule is to wait until after Thanksgiving to start decorating for the December holidays. Once the last leftovers have been eaten, out come the Christmas trees, wreaths, menorahs, lights and various cheerful tchotchkes. But in 2020, people seem to be breaking with tradition and putting up their decorations early — and that could be a good thing, mental health experts say.",
            "Scroll through social media and you’ll find friends, influencers and celebrities already sharing photos of their festive living room setups or lawn displays, the rules about when it’s “appropriate” to decorate be damned.",
            "One Ohio woman, who for the first time ever put up decorations the day after Halloween, told Cleveland.com, “There has been so much doom and gloom and so much stress and misinformation and absolute torture in 2020 that I said, ‘My lights are going up, and they’re going on,’ because I need that. We all need that. I wanted to make myself happy and to maybe bring a bit of cheer and pretty lights to somebody else.”",
            "It makes sense that more people are trying to get into the holiday spirit earlier this year, said New York City psychologist Melissa Robinson-Brown.",
            "“People are longing for happiness and joy,” she told HuffPost. “This year has been a significant year of grief and loss: loss of freedom, loss of time with family, loss of income and job, and loss of loved ones, just to name a few. As such, people are seeking comfort and even healing.”",
            "Plus, many of our beloved holiday traditions — like parties with friends and family gatherings — may be on pause because of COVID-19. Decorating is one way we can safely and healthfully lift our spirits.",
            "“Drop the judgment. If it makes you feel good, this is the year to do it,” said Ryan Howes, a psychologist in Pasadena, California, and author of the “Mental Health Journal for Men.” “If starting your holiday season in August was your desire, go for it and feel no shame.”",
            "We asked psychologists to share some of the potential mental and emotional health benefits of decorating early this year, if that’s your thing.",
            "It may evoke comforting memories from happier times.",
            "Putting up the tree and adorning your living space with lights and garlands may trigger nostalgia, reminding you of warm holiday memories from your childhood. For people who are unable to physically celebrate with their loved ones this year, thinking back to positive experiences from the past may bring comfort. Decorating early means you’ll get to soak up these good vibes for a few extra weeks.",
            "“As a psychologist, I often talk about the connection between our thoughts, emotions and behaviors,” said Los Angeles psychologist Erlanger Turner, an assistant professor of psychology at Pepperdine University. “Given the stress of the pandemic, thinking about positive images is one way to help prevent stress or anxiety. Decorating your home may serve as a cue of positive memories and emotions, which can be really helpful to promote joy and prevent sadness.”",
            "Smell is also strongly tied to memory, so consider lighting a scented candle that reminds you of sitting by your grandparents’ fireplace or getting a real tree, instead of an artificial one, for that piney fragrance.",
            "“If someone has a holiday smell that sparks positive emotions or memories, having that smell around has a potential to lift your mood,” said Atlanta psychologist Rebecca Leslie of Living Fully Psychological Services.",
            "It’s a healthy distraction from the heaviness of 2020.",
            "While it’s important to let yourself feel your feelings (yes, even the unpleasant ones), that doesn’t mean you need to be consumed with fear and anxiety 24/7. Finding healthy ways to take your mind off all that’s happening in the world can provide some relief and help you cope.",
            "“There have been so many heavy events this year, including the pandemic, racial injustice and the election,” Robinson-Brown said. “It’s easy for folks to get caught up and even obsessed with what’s going on in the media, which can heighten feelings of anxiety and depression. Decorating early provides great distraction and a pleasurable activity in which to engage.”",
            "It makes you feel a little more in control.",
            "So much of what’s happened this year has been far outside our control. We can’t individually end the pandemic, stop police violence or change political turmoil — and this can make us feel powerless at times.",
            "“We can do our part, but it takes a massive effort from many people to make these changes, and this contributes to a feeling of helplessness,” Howes said.",
            "Mental health experts recommend focusing on what you can control in order to abate some of the anxiety prompted by 2020, so why not make one of those focuses your decorations? You have the ability to make your home feel like a cozy oasis despite the chaos outside.",
            "“If you can transform your living room into a winter wonderland, this can give you a feeling of control and efficacy that has been missing in 2020,” Howes said.",
            "It can help you look forward to something uplifting.",
            "In a year filled with dread, building positive anticipation has been a challenge. But when you look at your decorations, you start daydreaming about the good times ahead: watching holiday movies with your kids, blasting holiday music in the car, baking cookies, getting some time off from work or school, and opening presents.",
            "“At a time where we’ve had few things to look forward to, the holidays are a welcomed shift from dread to excitement,” Howes said.",
            "That said, decorating isn’t right for everyone.",
            "For many people, the holidays may actually be a dark time — particularly for those who had difficult childhoods or are grieving the loss of a loved one.",
            "“If decorating also triggers stressful memories, decorating sooner this year may not be beneficial,” Leslie said.",
            "And even people who normally enjoy the holidays may find it difficult to do so this year.",
            "“If the decorations spark sadness around not being able to be with family for the holidays, having them up for a long period of time would not be beneficial,” Leslie added.",
            "The most important thing is to do what feels good for you — whether that’s leaning into the holidays, avoiding them altogether or somewhere in between.",
            "“If you feel like skipping the holidays this year because it feels too taxing or doesn’t bring joy, do it,” Howes said. “If 2020 has any lasting benefits, I hope that we learn to become more aware of what really feeds us and what doesn’t and gain permission to pursue what we most desire.”"

            "Shelton, who advised Trump’s 2016 presidential run, has been an outspoken opponent of the Federal Reserve as an institution. Her critics have questioned whether Shelton would support the central banking system’s independence from the White House.",
            "In a statement released ahead of the vote, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) called Shelton “without a doubt, one of the least qualified nominees I have ever seen for our nation’s central bank.”",
            "“Ms. Shelton has shown herself to be an economic weathervane, pointing whichever direction she believes the partisan winds are blowing,” Schumer said in his statement.",
            "Shelton made her career working with right-wing organizations including the Atlas Foundation and the Hoover Institution, where she criticized the very existence of the Federal Reserve and advocated a return to the gold standard ― the monetary system from the late 19th century that was abandoned during the Great Depression.",
            "In a Financial Times interview from May 2019, she claimed the Fed exercises Soviet control over financial markets and dismissed the very idea that its top officials could perform their jobs effectively.",
            "“How can a dozen, slightly less than a dozen, people meeting eight times a year, decide what the cost of capital should be?” Shelton asked. “We might as well resurrect Gosplan,” the USSR’s economic planning committee.",
            "Shelton has also opposed the government guarantee on bank deposits — a program initiated under President Franklin Delano Roosevelt that ensures that ordinary citizens don’t lose their money if their bank should fail. During the early years of the Great Depression, millions of Americans lost their savings through no fault of their own when their banks failed. During the crisis of 2008, nobody did.",
            "Shelton’s views have made her a doyen of the far-right fringe, where a return to 19th century economic institutions is viewed as the cure for all that ails the global economy. But those same ideas have alarmed mainstream economists and financial professionals who believe such programs fueled the Depression and would generate international economic chaos today.",
            "Shelton is also viewed even within her own party as a partisan opportunist. After advocating the gold standard and voicing support for high interest rates, she quickly reversed course once Trump announced his intention to nominate her to the Fed. Trump is an outspoken advocate of low interest rates, believing them to be a source of economic growth. And prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Fed’s commitment to low rates proved an economic boon, helping to drive unemployment to its lowest levels in decades. With Trump in the White House, Shelton insisted she wanted to keep rates low and distanced herself from her prior comments about the gold standard and deposit insurance.",
            "The fear ― shared by liberal Democrats and otherwise conservative stalwarts in the financial sector alike ― is that Shelton would have encouraged economic contraction under a Democratic president, a scenario that would be bad for Democrats and also bad for bank profits, even as it would spur business failures and corporate concentration.",

            "“The intensity of merging with him is just overwhelming, and the threat it poses is so powerful but so beautiful that you have no choice to surrender with reverence and with gratitude,” she said of the 30-year-old, whose real name is Colson Baker.",
            "Fox added that she shares a connection of “mythic proportions” with MGK, and called their love a “once in a lifetime thing.”",
            "The two met on the set of the movie “Midnight in the Switchgrass” and their connection was immediate, Fox said.",
            "“I looked into his eyes [and] I felt the most pristine, most gentle, most pure spirit,” she told the magazine. “My heart shattered immediately and I just knew that I was fucked.”",
            "Previously, Fox has described the two as being akin to twin flames and “two halves of the same soul.”",
            "“A twin flame is actually where a soul has ascended into a high enough level that it can be split into two different bodies at the same time,” she said on the “Give Them Lala...with Randall” podcast back in July.\n\n“So we’re actually two halves of the same soul, I think. And I said that to him almost immediately, because I felt it right away.”",
            "Fox and the “Bloody Valentine” musician first sparked dating rumors back in May, when they were photographed on outings together.\n\nDays after the pictures emerged, Fox’s partner of over a decade ― “Beverly Hills, 90210” actor Brian Austin Green ― announced that he and Fox were indeed splitting up.\n\n“Neither one of us did anything to each other. She’s always been honest with me. I’ve always been honest with her,” the actor shared at the time on an episode of his podcast “…With Brian Austin Green.”\n\n“We’ve had an amazing relationship. I will always love her. And I know she will always love me and I know as far as a family, what we have built is really cool and really special.”\n\nThe two share three children: Noah, Bodhi and Journey."

            "It’s as if it were grown on the Island of Misfit Toys.",
            "Every year, New York City’s Rockefeller Center erects its iconic Christmas tree. The plush conifer, which sits pretty on Rockefeller Plaza, is traditionally massive and opulent — topped with a roughly 900-pound Swarovski crystal. The flashy display signals to the city, and America at large, that the holiday season — brimming with loved ones, yuletide cheer and a whole lot of capitalism — has officially begun.",
            "Last week, Rockefeller Center gave a preview on Twitter of the donated, 75-foot Norway spruce from Oneonta, New York, that would adorn its plaza. The tree looked as healthy and lush as any mature plant that hadn’t been uprooted and forced into transit would appear.",
            "But when that same tree arrived at Rockefeller Plaza on Saturday, it fittingly had, uh, very 2020 vibes:",
            "As a crane began to hoist the leafy lady upright, its boughs began to fall, leaving noticeably large gaps in its greenery.",
            "In response to images and videos uploaded online of the shabby tree, Twitter users began to crack Charlie Brown jokes and note that the tree — much like the rough year most Americans have experienced due to the pandemic and a tense presidential election — is the epitome of 2020.",
            "Yet, much like the seemingly inadequate gifts abandoned on the Island of Misfit Toys in 1964’s “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,” many online felt the Rockefeller Center’s 2020 Christmas tree’s imperfections had been judged too harshly. Some said it would look different when its branches had settled and it was decorated.",
            "One Twitter user, who said they had worked at Rockefeller Center, noted that each year the tree “usually looks like this at first.”",
            "“They go in and fill in the holes with loose branches and floof it up,” the Twitter user said.",
            "Even the tree itself has defended its appearance. A blog that is apparently written by the Rockefeller Christmas tree also noted that she will be getting “some work done” and that the haters will “eat your words” when they light her up on Dec. 2.",
            "And although the tree may not have been much to look at on the outside, it did contain one adorable stowaway — who provided many social media users with an early Christmas gift in the form of some very cute photos.",
            "Someone who worked for the company that transported the tree to New York discovered a little saw-whet owl perched on its branches. The bird was taken to Ravensbeard Wildlife Center, where it’s currently being cared for.",
            "On the other hand, looking at things from this owl’s perspective — getting its home cut down and dragged to Manhattan was probably classic 2020."

            "On the heels of his appearance, many fans have been left wondering if Katherine Heigl might finally get her own swan song considering her rather abrupt departure from the show amid friction with creator Shonda Rhimes.",
            "But, it turns out showrunner Krista Vernoff already penned a goodbye episode centered on Heigl’s character, Izzie Stevens, years ago that would have wrapped up her fan-favorite love story with Alex Karev (Justin Chambers).",
            "In a Los Angeles Times interview published last week, Vernoff claimed that Heigl never showed up for filming.",
            "“We had planned to have her come back for an episode to really properly tie up Izzie and Alex,” Vernoff told the outlet. “I wrote that episode, and it was beautiful. The day before it was supposed to start prepping or shooting, I can’t remember, we got a call that Katie wasn’t coming. Just wasn’t coming. Wasn’t going to do it.”",
            "“I don’t know what was happening in her life,” Vernoff added. “I don’t know what led to that decision. All I know is that the night before a thing is supposed to start shooting that is entirely centered on one character and the completion of her story arc, I got a phone call that she wasn’t coming to do it.”",
            "Sources close to Heigl, however, have since refuted the story.",
            "“This account isn’t true. Krista is mistaken,” an unnamed source told Entertainment Weekly. “Katherine was back in LA after parental leave (when she adopted her daughter) waiting to be called to set.”",
            "Heigl, one of the long-running medical drama’s original cast members, remained on the ABC show from its debut in 2005 until 2010, when she exited midway through the sixth season.",
            "At the time, Heigl rumors swirled that she was trying to break her contract on the series after repeatedly disparaging the show in the press, most notably when she removed her name from Emmy consideration in 2008 because she felt the material didn’t “warrant a nomination.”",
            "Reports at the time mirror Vernoff’s claim that Heigl failed to show up for filming, while sources in the actor’s camp back then maintained that she “was at home and ready to return to work.”",
            "While it’s highly unlikely that Heigl will ever walk the halls of Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital again, Vernoff said seeing an old cast member like Dempsey on set again was “so moving and healing.”",
            "“This show has been on for 17 seasons. There’s been some drama around some exits. And there have been enough years in the interim that everyone grows up; they grow up, they realize where they got things wrong,” she told the Los Angeles Times. “There’s always sort of two sides to every story. What it felt like was a homecoming.”"

Now, dozens of tribal leaders are urging President-elect Joe Biden to make history again by picking Haaland to be his secretary of the interior.",
            "More than 120 elected tribal leaders and intertribal organization officials plan to send a letter to Biden this week saying it is long past time for an Indigenous person to serve in a Cabinet position ― particularly at the Interior Department, which has a unique impact on Indigenous and environmental issues.",
            "“We’ve never had a Native American serve in any Cabinet position,” Bryan Newland, tribal chairman of the Bay Mills Indian Community in Michigan and a lead organizer on the letter, said Tuesday. “Rep. Haaland is more than qualified and capable of serving as secretary of interior and would be a great choice.”",
            "Last month two other tribal leaders published a commentary describing the “glass ceiling in our Federal government” when it comes to Native Americans getting picked for Cabinet positions. They named Haaland as an ideal choice to oversee the Interior Department.",

Haaland is the type of candidate who would have a deep understanding of all of the responsibilities of the Secretary of the Interior from day one,” wrote Shannon Holsey, president of the Stockbridge-Munsee Tribe, and Leonard Forsman, chairman of the Suquamish Tribe. They noted she is a citizen of the Laguna Pueblo in New Mexico and chairs a House Natural Resources subcommittee with oversight authority for the Interior Department.",
            "Haaland’s name has been floating around for weeks as a possible pick for the position. New Mexico’s two Democratic senators, Tom Udall and Martin Heinrich, have also been circulating the idea.",
            "Asked if she is interested in the position, Haaland told HuffPost on Sunday that she is “honored and privileged” to represent her district in Congress. After it was pointed out that is precisely what politicians say when they’re interested in a promotion but want to seem humble, she conceded that she would enthusiastically take the Interior Department job if it were offered to her.",
            "“Oh yes, of course,” said Haaland. “Of course.”",
            "The Interior Department is responsible for managing the country’s natural resources and honoring the federal government’s commitments to Native American tribes, which it has failed to do time and time again. It also oversees the Bureau of Indian Education and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the latter of which manages over 55 million acres of land held in trust for Native Americans by the government. Both agencies are notoriously underfunded and have failed to adequately serve Indigenous communities.",
            "The seismic shift of putting a Native American woman in charge of the department with oversight of public lands ― from which Indigenous people were forcibly removed by the U.S. government ― is not lost on Haaland.",
            "“The symbolism alone, yes, it’s profound,” she said.",

            "Cameron French, a spokesman for Biden’s transition team, declined to say whether she was being considered for the Cabinet position. “The Biden-Harris transition team has not made any personnel decisions at this time,” said French.",
            "But Haaland said the fact that people are even lobbying on her behalf is a sign of progress in a country where many Native Americans weren’t allowed to vote until 1948.",
            "“I tell people I’m a 35th-generation New Mexican because I am. The Pueblo people migrated to the Rio Grande Valley in the late 1200s, 35 generations ago,” she said. “I think it’s a time in our world ― not just in our country, but our entire world ― to listen to Indigenous people when it comes to climate change, when it comes to our environment.”",
            "Regardless of whom Biden picks for the job, Haaland said he gets credit for starting off with the most progressive climate and environmental plan of any president.",
            "“Whoever becomes secretary has an opportunity to combat climate change, to take this 25% carbon that our public lands are emitting right now and eliminate that,” the congresswoman said. “I think that what is required is somebody who cares about our public lands.”",
            "Biden also has pledged to work closely with Indigenous tribes when it comes to preserving natural resources, which is a far cry from President Donald Trump’s record.",

            "Well before his best-known character Tywin Lannister was shot on the loo at the end of “Game of Thrones” Season 4, Charles Dance was contemplating his career. Sure, he was getting older, but the British actor knew there were plenty of substantial roles yet to come his way, despite the film industry’s long-standing focus on youth and beauty.",
            "People may age, Dance told me last week as he sipped tea and snacked on a cinnamon bun, but they don’t ― or rather shouldn’t ― age out of Hollywood.",
            "“If actors retire, there would be nobody to play the old, wrinkly people,” the 74-year-old said with a chuckle.",
            "Dance applauded the late French actor Simone Signoret, whose 1979 autobiography, “Nostalgia Isn’t What It Used To Be,” featured a closeup photo of her face on the cover.",
            "“There were these wonderful lines around her eyes and around the corner of her mouth. She was puffy. But she looked fantastic. On her face was the story of her life,” he recalled. “Our faces, if we let them, get more interesting as we get older.”",
            "In his 60s, Dance was cast as the ruthless head of House Lannister in “Game of Thrones,” which became HBO’s most-watched series over its eight-season run. The highly respected stage and screen actor’s memorable performance as Tywin made him a household name and was followed by other successful projects, including “The Imitation Game” (2014), “Ghostbusters” (2016), “Godzilla: King of Monsters” (2019), and most recently “The Crown” and David Fincher’s upcoming buzzed-about film “Mank.”",
            "Dance ― who, I can assure you, is much more charming over the phone than Tywin might be if he were pushing his latest project ― said, “I’m very lucky, especially at the moment when the world’s turned upside down and people from all walks of life are struggling in one way or another.”",
            "When Dance and I spoke over the phone, it was a “wintery, blustery” day in London and he and his countrymen were back in quarantine after Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a second national lockdown amid spikes in COVID-19 cases. Dance is tested frequently for the coronavirus while he’s currently in production on Netflix’s “The Sandman,” although he notes that isn’t the case for his fellow citizens.",
            "“We claim to have this world-beating test and trace system in this country. Well, it’s a shambles,” he said. “People maybe have to drive 100 miles to just test and wait for five days before they get a result and it’s chaotic. Whereas, if you’re prepared to pay for it, you can have a rapid test and get your result in an hour. That’s how we are able in this industry to keep going.”",
            "Dance said the Netflix set observes all the rules and regulations, including mask-wearing and social distancing. “We have lunches prepacked and not very nice, usually,” he said, laughing. “But the job remains the same. We just have hurdles to jump every day.”",
            "Dance is an expert hurdler after 50 years in the entertainment business. He began as a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company in the 1970s before getting his big break as Guy Perron in the 1984 television series “The Jewel in the Crown.” Although he played James Bond creator Ian Fleming in 1989’s “Goldeneye,” he turned down the opportunity to screen test for Fleming’s famous character years prior. Dance said his agent urged him to stay out of the fold.",
            "“In hindsight, she was probably right because I think I would have blown it,” he said. “I didn’t have nearly enough experience to go into a franchise like that and suck it up. That would have really killed my career.”",
            "After bidding adieu to 007, Dance gained additional recognition in miniseries like “The Phantom of the Opera” (1990), “Rebecca” (1997) and the BBC’s “Bleak House,” for which he was nominated for an Emmy for Lead Actor in a Limited Series or Movie in 2006. He was never individually nominated for “Thrones,” but received Emmy nods for his narration work on National Geographic’s “Savage Kingdom.”",
            "Of awards, Dance said, “Well, you can’t win ’em all.”",
            "He is interested, however, to see what accolades come for “Mank,” Fincher’s ambitious new movie in which Dance stars as William Randolph Hearst, newspaper mogul and the real-life inspiration behind “Citizen Kane.”",
            "“Mank” is a dense black-and-white biopic that reevaluates 1930s Hollywood by detailing the working relationship between “Citizen Kane” actor-director Orson Welles (Tom Burke) and alcoholic screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz (Gary Oldman). Fincher’s late father Jack wrote the script, which was first floated around in 1997 before the father-son duo decided to shelve it. His father died of cancer in 2003, but Fincher eventually found an opening with Netflix ― which houses his crime series “Mindhunter” ― to make the movie the way they envisioned it.",
            "“Because of the opinion I have about Fincher, which is basically I think he’s a genius, I just have this feeling all the time that the end result is going to be a really good movie,” Dance said. “I did his first film years ago, which is ‘Alien 3,’ and I thought at the time, ‘Well, this guy’s clever.’”",
            "“Mank” is only his second project with Fincher, but Dance confirmed the 58-year-old director’s intense working method hasn’t changed much since 1992.",
            "“He has a reputation for being demanding,” Dance said. “He goes through a lot of takes and actors moan a bit about that, but it’s not a very deep moan. With success comes a degree of power, so he’s able to put his foot down and basically tell people to ‘fuck off’ and ‘this is what I’m gonna do and if you don’t like it, tough shit.’ Forgive my language.”",
            "“He’s a film animal from the top of his head to the soles of his feet,” the actor added. “He is a perfectionist and he will strive for it, no matter how long it takes.”",
            "Dance appreciates that mindset, even if it’s hard to keep energy levels up after countless calls of “action” and “cut.” For a particular party scene in “Mank,” he said he was impressed by Oldman’s stamina and commitment to his character as Oldman brought new vigor take after take after take.",
            "“We were pretty close to 50 takes,” Dance remembered. “That scene is one long monologue with Mankiewicz vomiting halfway through. And David was covering that scene like he’s covered all the scenes, with four cameras.”",
            "Dance said composition is what the director is focused on. It’s only after he is satisfied with that element that he’ll turn his attention to the actors’ performances. Fincher wants his full artistic vision realized, from start to finish, while Netflix, of course, is probably more interested in the economic side of the business and attracting audiences.",
            "“Although it’s quite a while ago, and Hollywood was a different place, the way the industry was run [during the ‘Citizen Kane’ era] is really not that dissimilar to the way it’s being run now, is it?” Dance said. “It’s this continual trying to please all of the people, all the time, while knowing that we can’t.”",
            "On the note of pleasing people, how does Dance feel about that polarizing eighth and final season of “Game of Thrones”?",
            "“I have to say, personally, I was underwhelmed,” he observed of the show’s lackluster conclusion. “It was decided by committee and I thought, ‘Oh, no, no, no, no, no.’ I wanted it to go out with a bang.”",
            "“Anyway, it’s just nitpicking,” Dance quickly added. “I wouldn’t have continued to watch it if the show hadn’t been good. It raised the bar when it came to television drama.”",
            "“Thrones” surely paved the way for series like Netflix’s royal family saga “The Crown,” which, when it launched in 2016, was reportedly “the most expensive TV show ever made.” Now, budgets are even bigger as premium content continues to shift from cable networks to streaming platforms. That might explain why Dance has primarily worked with Netflix over the last 18 months.",
            "“Television, both physically and metaphorically, was something that you looked down to ― it was this little box that used to sit in the corner of your living room. Film was something that you looked up to, by virtue of the fact that you went into a cinema and there was an enormous screen. Now, of course, the dividing line between television and film has totally blurred,” Dance said. “People can stream a movie into their television, which is as big as the cinema screen, rather than go to the cinema and listen to the noise of others chomping on popcorn. They can watch it in their home whenever they want to see it, rather than the times a distributor says they have to see the film.”",
            "“I think it’s sad, of course, because there’s a community experience of going to the movies that we’re missing out on,” he continued, “but we’re getting close to emulating that [at home].”",
            "For now, Dance ― whose brilliant Lord Mountbatten, aka Uncle Dickie, meets his end on Season 4 of “The Crown” ― is taking advantage of his working relationship with Netflix, which has allowed him the chance to not only make a living but examine his own country’s monarchy.",
            "“I have no idea whether they ever watch it,” he said, laughing, of Queen Elizabeth and company, “but I fear probably not.”",
            "As for the entrance of Diana, Princess of Wales (Emma Corrin) in the new batch of episodes debuting Nov. 15, Dance believes her story gives viewers a glimpse into the never-ending pressure the royals endure.",
            "“There comes a point where I think one has to be kind and leave them alone, you know? Obviously, they have a life of enormous privilege, but I would hate to be a member of that family. You’re in a goldfish bowl, you’re on show, all the time ― it’s much worse than being a movie star.”",
            "Dance gets his fair share of recognition from passersby, although in pandemic times, that in-person attention has certainly waned a bit. For now, he’s focused on his current Netflix project, which he predicts will get people talking, and set to direct his second feature, “The Inn at the Edge of the World,” whenever the world picks up its pace again.",
            "In terms of a role he can sink his teeth into, I did mention that Hollywood is still on the hunt for a new James Bond.",
            "“I’m too old,” he insisted. “Bond has to be 40 or below.”",
            "This article has been updated to identify the “top-secret Netflix project” that Dance is working on."

            "Sixty years after John F. Kennedy’s election, Americans are preparing to welcome a second Roman Catholic politician, President-elect Joe Biden, to the nation’s highest office.",
            "Despite suggestions from some bishops that Catholics can’t be Democrats, early exit poll data suggests Biden won between 49% and 52% of the Catholic vote this year ― demonstrating the diversity of political views within America’s largest single religious institution.",
            "As Biden heads to the White House, some Catholics are hoping his election will highlight a different side of their faith. These are the Catholics whose consciences place them in disagreement with church doctrine on culture war issues. It’s a segment of the religion that often gets overshadowed by the loud voices from the church’s staunchly conservative wing.",
            "Biden, an Irish Catholic who carries a rosary in his pocket, spoke often on the campaign trail about how his faith has led him through periods of suffering in his life. He’s also spoken about how he’s been influenced by Catholic social doctrine, a set of church teachings about how faith should be lived in public life.",
            "John Gehring, Catholic program director at Faith in Public Life Action, said the “sincere pride” and “quiet humility” of Biden’s faith reminded him of how his Irish American grandmother carried her Catholicism.",
            "“Biden’s faith is an old-school, lunch-pail, ethnic Catholicism that animated places like Scranton,” Gehring said, referring to Biden’s hometown in Pennsylvania. “It’s a faith deeply connected to the dignity of work, respect for unions and a communitarian ethos that values the common good.”",
            "“I imagine there will be more than a few Catholics who come from those places and that particular culture raising a beer in celebration,” he told HuffPost.",
            "Although Biden’s stances on culture war issues have often placed him at odds with official church teachings, his views aren’t too far from those of many fellow U.S. Catholics. Most ignore church teaching on contraception, and a majority say abortion should be legal in all or most cases. Biden has long been more conservative than many Democrats on abortion, but his agenda as a presidential candidate this year included plans to strengthen women’s access to the procedure.",
            "Biden has also pledged to protect queer Americans’ rights ― even though the church views queer relationships as sinful and Catholic institutions have fiercely defended their ability to use religious exemptions to discriminate against LGBTQ people. In 2016, Biden served as an officiant at a wedding of a gay couple, reflecting a shift in the pews toward a more accepting view of same-sex marriage. Most Catholics also oppose allowing small business owners to refuse to serve gay or lesbian people for religious reasons.",
            "Sister Simone Campbell, executive director of the Catholic social justice advocacy group Network and a close ally of Biden’s, said she thinks of the president-elect as a “Pope Francis Catholic.” Francis has cautioned against Catholics becoming “obsessed” with issues like abortion, gay marriage and contraception, urging his flock to focus on serving the poor and oppressed.",
            "Biden “integrates [his faith] into his lifelong quest to improve things for people in our nation, and his compassion and caring is for those who are too often left out,” Campbell said. “He represents the fullness of our faith.”",
            "The Republican Party has manipulated Catholics into believing that they must fight for the criminalization of abortion, Campbell said. Biden’s approach to the issue is to care for the “unborn” by caring for pregnant mothers, Campbell said ― making sure they have health care, good nutrition, stable housing, affordable child care.",
            "In her conversations with the president-elect, Campbell said she got the impression that while Biden personally opposes abortion, he doesn’t think he can force his religious views on others.",
            "Biden has received fierce backlash from some pockets of American Catholicism for his stance on abortion. Last year, Biden was reportedly denied Holy Communion at a South Carolina Catholic church. A Rhode Island bishop suggested over the summer that Biden wasn’t a real Catholic, and a Texas bishop promoted the idea that Catholics can’t vote for Democrats.",
            "But even among the bishops, there is disagreement about whether Catholics owe fealty to the Republican Party because of its opposition to abortion. A handful of American bishops ― most of whom were appointed by Pope Francis ― have criticized President Donald Trump and the GOP as being “anti-life” for failing to care about issues such as racism, workers’ rights, climate change and restoring protections for asylum seekers.",
            "It’s unclear how the right-wing Catholics who attacked Biden’s faith will react to a Biden presidency. Gehring said the “quasi schism” between Catholic leaders who oppose Pope Francis and those who support him bleeds into fights about who owns the Catholic political narrative.",
            "“Given how much animosity and contempt some showed toward Obama, I expect it will often get ugly,” Gehring said. “But my hope is there will be a distinction between reasonable conservative Catholics who will oppose some Biden administration policies without attacking his faith, and the far-right Catholic fringe that has no interest in building bridges or finding common ground.”",
            "Natalia Imperatori-Lee, a scholar of Catholicism at Manhattan College, said she finds it “incredible” that for both of the Catholic men elected president, the pope was a liability, not an asset.",
            "While campaigning, Kennedy had to defend himself against centuries-old discriminatory notions that Catholics held “dual loyalty”― that they couldn’t be trusted as citizens because they owed religious loyalty to the pope. According to Kennedy’s presidential library, the first Catholic president’s religious identity contributed to election losses in certain states.",
            "Decades later, Catholics ― particularly white Catholics ― have attained positions of political power in Congress, as state governors, and on the Supreme Court. They are so far into the mainstream of American society that Pope Francis’s central message of caring for the poor, immigrants and the environment are seen as partisan issues, Imperatori-Lee said. White Catholics’ alliance with “culture-war conservatism” turned some members of the faith against a Catholic candidate who was actually in agreement with many of the church’s core teachings ― about the dignity of the human person, the importance of solidarity, and the importance of a fair wage and unionized labor, she said.",
            "“As white Catholics have climbed the socioeconomic ranks, their concerns have turned away from labor issues (once the bread and butter for Catholics) to sexual issues,” Imperatori-Lee said.",
            "The mark of a “Catholic president” is governing “with the most vulnerable in mind,” Imperatori-Lee said. Biden’s win means that the conservative wing of the church has a great deal of soul searching to do on race, sexism, and what freedom of religion means, she said.",
            "The president-elect represents many “average Catholics who are just trying to do their best,” Imperatori-Lee said.",
            "“If many of the more zealous or partisan bishops and priests who were telling their parishioners that you cannot vote for a Democrat and be a good Catholic would get to know their church communities more, I think they’d find a lot of people like Joe Biden in their pews,” she said."

            "“We’d be fools not to engage in some amount of self-reflection,” said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.).",
            "The party had hopes of winning a dozen Republican-held seats on Election Day after spending hundreds of millions of dollars of both grassroots and big-donor money to put the GOP on defense. Instead, Republicans have swept most of the competitive races, and Democrats have only netted a single seat after losing incumbent Sen. Doug Jones in Alabama and ousting Republicans in Colorado and Arizona.",
            "The party still has a chance at claiming a narrow majority if it’s able to sweep two runoff elections in Georgia set for early January.",
            "Senators interviewed for this story said the party needs to reexamine its message, polling methods and how it spends the tens of millions of dollars it collects from donors every election cycle. Some suggested significant overhauls to the party’s operations, including reorienting the party to focus more on long-term goals instead of supporting individual candidates.",
            "Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz, who worked with Murphy to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars for Democratic Senate candidates from online donors, said the party owes “the majority of voters across America who are desperate for a Democratic Senate our very best, most disciplined, and most effective effort.”",
            "“If you lose a football game, you never say everything went perfectly, even if you did some things well and it was close,” Schatz said. “A loss is a loss. Every Democratic organization, including the DSCC [Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee], should be looking at what strategies, processes, candidates, consultants and messages were most effective.”",
            "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, whose tight control of the DSCC is legendary among operatives, was unanimously reelected to another two years in his job on Tuesday. Schumer is known to put in a full day on senatorial work, then work late into the night at the committee’s offices near the Capitol.",
            "During his weekly press conference on Tuesday, Schumer was focused on the possibility that victories in both Georgia runoff elections could bring Democrats to 50 seats, and to the barest of majorities.",
            "“We are happy. We have won the most important election that we’ve faced,” he told reporters. “When it comes to the Senate, it’s not over at all. Georgia is close. We are working very hard to win Georgia and we believe we have a very good chance of winning.”",
            "Senators did not vote for a new chair of the DSCC, though two Democratic sources said Ben Ray Luján, a newly elected senator from New Mexico and a former chair of House Democrats’ campaign arm, was seen as a front-runner for the job. Other Democratic Senate staffers said there was some desire among some senators for a more experienced member of the caucus to take the job.",
            "In a statement, DSCC spokeswoman Lauren Passalacqua said the committee was constantly examining its own work.",
            "“There are always lessons we can apply to future elections, which is how we flipped two seats in Colorado and Arizona, forced Republicans on defense everywhere and are still in a position to win the majority with the Georgia runoffs,” Passalacqua said.",
            "The Senate map’s bias toward rural voters and states makes it more difficult for Democrats to win control of the chamber, and only two GOP incumbents up for reelection were in states Hillary Clinton won in 2016. But senators were particularly upset by losses in Iowa and Maine, where candidates they saw as strong contenders ended up losing by significant margins.",
            "“There’s just become such a convergence between how presidential candidates do and how Senate candidates do. It doesn’t mean you can’t buck the trend, but it means there has to be something that pulls you over the top when your presidential candidate is losing,” said Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen, who chaired the DSCC during the 2018 election cycle. “I really think it’s important not to jump to conclusions in races like this.”",
            "Michigan Sen. Debbie Stabenow, a member of Schumer’s leadership team, said she thought Republicans were able to effectively label lesser-known first-time candidates as more leftist than they were.",
            "“I think the truth is that even though none of our candidates were supporting defunding the police or socialism, or so on, you still got tagged by it,” Stabenow said. “So the question becomes addressing how do you rise above that. People knew President-elect Biden enough and didn’t believe it when they attacked him because people knew him and he had a track record. When you have a new candidate running who people don’t know, it’s easier to make something like that stick.”",
            "Montana Sen. Jon Tester, who watched Gov. Steve Bullock lose by 10 percentage points in what was supposed to be a close race, was focused on fixing the party’s internal polls. Tester, who chaired the DSCC in 2016, said the party’s surveys were off four years ago and were even worse this cycle.",
            "“We need to get some answers on what’s going on the last few cycles with polling,” said Tester. “I got on the phone with many a donor and told them Montana was tied or within the margin, and you need to send money. And it wasn’t. That’s false advertising. That means we’re putting funds in places that aren’t working.”",
            "Murphy said he was hoping to refocus small-dollar donor energy and cash toward “building permanent political infrastructures in every state rather than just channeling it toward the flavor-of-the-week candidate.”",
            "“Why does Nevada move into the Democratic column more quickly than other Southwestern states?” Murphy asked rhetorically. “It’s because Harry Reid built the permanent political organization. Why does Georgia look different than Florida and North Carolina? Because of Stacey Abrams.”",

            "If everything goes as planned, Jill Biden will become the first first lady with a paying job, as a college professor, outside the White House. She’s been talking about this frequently, her spokesperson told HuffPost on Sunday night.",
            "“I like working,” the 69-year-old Biden explained to Vogue in September. “Like so many of your readers, I’m a working woman. [Teaching is] my passion. That’s what I love doing. That has been my career and really a major focus in my life, so I feel like I could handle it and do everything else that first ladies want to do.”",
            "In one sense, this isn’t much of a surprise. Biden kept teaching at a community college in Northern Virginia when her husband was vice president ― a decision that an aide recently called “insane” because of the grueling workload it entailed.",
            "And it’s hardly revolutionary in 2020 that someone’s wife has a paying job. But in the Upside Down of presidential gender dynamics, it’s a big deal.",
            "A first lady is expected to support her husband and to take on causes of a stereotypically feminine nature ― perhaps to do with children, maybe food, fighting disease is good. She is judged on how she runs the White House, graciously hosts events, and dresses. Millions of words have been spilled on, say, Melania Trump’s outfits, Christmas decorations and landscaping decisions.",
            "“I’m working ... my ass off on the Christmas stuff, that you know. Who gives a fuck about the Christmas stuff and decorations? But I need to do it, right?” the current first lady said in a secretly recorded conversation with one of her advisers, expressing her frustration with the expectations of the role.",
            "Fulfilling the traditional responsibilities of a first lady is definitely a job, demanding hard work with no pay.",
            "But it’s when a first lady steps out of that space ― particularly if she’s seen near real policy ― that she is typically excoriated.",
            "Eleanor Roosevelt took heat from members of her husband’s Cabinet for her activism. Nancy Reagan was vilified for her involvement in her husband’s administration. Hillary Clinton was reviled for ... the list is long, but as first lady it was partly for being involved in health care reform (and that one time during the 1992 campaign when she disparaged homemakers).",
            "Even if the first lady stays in her lane, she can get called out. High-profile women walk a tightrope and live in a double bind: Be successful but not ambitious. Beautiful but not showy about it. Well-spoken but not loud. Confident but not arrogant. Michelle Obama faced all of that and more as our first Black first lady, dealing with the pernicious overlay of both racism and sexism.",
            "“Name a first lady and she has been reprimanded for being too outspoken or too reserved, too controlling or not ambitious enough,” author Kate Andersen Brower wrote in The New York Times four years ago, pondering what would happen if a man were in that role. Essentially, the first lady is supposed to embody the perfect woman, she wrote.",
            "These days, the perfect woman typically has a job, in addition to all her other roles. Even conservatives out there touting a woman’s place at home seem to concede this point. Just last month, Republicans fawned over Amy Coney Barrett for having young children and a career. A woman’s place is still in the home, their new line of thinking seems to go, but it’s fine if you can handle that and hold down a paying job, too. (And expect no policy help from us.)",
            "Possibly, the culture has moved a bit since Hillary Clinton was condemned for continuing her work as a lawyer even as her husband was governor of Arkansas. And for justifying it with her infamous quote about baking cookies.",
            "There are also definitely a lot of caveats at play here. If Jill Biden were still the parent of young children, her choice to keep working would likely receive a lot of criticism. Expectations for women with little kids are different.",
            "And if Biden said she was going back to work at a law firm or a widget factory or something more commercial and less recognizably altruistic than teaching, that would almost certainly still be controversial.",
            "Teaching has always been seen as an acceptable job for a woman. It conforms to stereotypical expectations that women are simply better with kids, more caring, more empathetic and more giving. Laura Bush, a former teacher, was widely praised for her focus on education and literacy during her time in the White House.",
            "Teaching also complements the work that Biden wants to do in her role as first lady.",
            "“You wouldn’t want to have a situation where you had a first lady working in a sort of job that was in conflict for ethical reasons,” said Betsy Fischer Martin, executive director of the Women & Politics Institute at the American University School of Public Affairs. “And certainly teaching only enhances the kind of platform I know she’ll want to advocate for,” Fischer Martin said.",
            "Still, Biden keeping her outside job is significant, said Jennifer Lawless, a political science professor at the University of Virginia. “It sends a very strong message to women: No matter how accomplished, powerful, or important your husband, you don’t have to abandon your own career or play second fiddle.”",
            "The First Second Gentleman",
            "The 2020 campaign was a groundbreaker for gender roles from the start. In the Democratic race, the possibilities for a presidential spouse were wider than ever before. Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s husband kept his role at Harvard Law School when Warren ran for the nomination. Former Mayor Pete Buttigieg’s husband took time off from his job at a Montessori school during Buttigieg’s campaign for the nomination.",
            "On social media, candidates were able to showcase their personal lives and their supportive spouses.",
            "“In this whole cycle, even during the primary, there’s been a lot of different examples of what a partner looks like when you think of the fact that there were a couple of potential first gentlemen in the mix for a while,” said Amanda Hunter, research and communications director at the Barbara Lee Foundation.",
            "Hunter pointed to another groundbreaking political spouse: Douglas Emhoff, soon to be the nation’s first second gentleman.",
            "Emhoff had taken a leave of absence from the elite law firm DLA Piper to support his wife, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, during the campaign. He will officially leave the firm by Inauguration Day, a Biden campaign representative said on Tuesday.",
            "It’ll be fascinating to see what Emhoff does with his new position. “It’s nice to have a man as the first for once,” said Fischer Martin.",
            "Having Biden and Emhoff in these roles could open up the possibilities for all spouses.",
            "“Overall we’ve seen so many stereotypes challenged in the 2020 cycle,” Hunter said. “This is one more opportunity for both Doug Emhoff and Dr. Biden to create their own role and not follow the cookie cutter of what previous first and second spouses have done.”",
            "Crucially, Biden hopes to keep teaching at a moment of educational crisis amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Many kids around the country are going to school virtually or are stuck in some kind of “hybrid” limbo of both in-person classes and online learning. State and local governments are facing budget shortfalls that could severely undermine public schools. The long-term consequences of this break in regular education could be devastating for children.",
            "So after four years of an administration that did little on education except push for more charter schools, having a first lady with a direct hand in education and a passion for public schools could prove to be no small matter.",
            "“It demonstrates that education will be front and center in a Biden administration, which is a significant departure from the last four years,” Lawless suggested.",
            "Other than confirming that Biden plans to return to teaching, her spokesperson Michael LaRosa emphasized her other goals right now.",
            "“She is spending time with her children and grandchildren in Wilmington, Delaware,” said LaRosa in an email. “Dr. Biden is focused on building her team and developing her priorities focused on education, military families and veterans, and cancer.”"

            "President-elect Joe Biden faces the very real possibility of taking office with a Senate controlled by Republicans, ready to block him at every turn. Progressive activists say they have a simple solution, at least when it comes to installing his top officials: Just go around Congress.",
            "The Senate is currently split, with two races still to be called and two others in Georgia to be decided in Jan. 5 runoffs.",
            "Allies of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told Axios last week that a GOP-controlled Senate would be willing to go along with Biden’s nominations for his administration, as long as they’re centrists.",
            "But progressive activists say that path would be unacceptable, and they’re already putting pressure on the incoming Biden administration to go around the Senate so that McConnell doesn’t get to decide a Democratic Cabinet.",
            "“There are legal tools are available and Biden should be unafraid to use every legal tool available — just as McConnell has used to stack the courts,” said Jeff Hauser, founder and director of the Revolving Door Project, which scrutinizes executive branch appointees for their ties to corporate interests.",
            "The two main options center around using a law called the Vacancy Act, and appointing officials when the Senate is in recess. Transition officials have so far been unwilling to discuss what sort of strategies they’re considering.",
            "The first option is a 1998 law that allows a president to temporarily fill vacant executive branch positions that typically require Senate confirmation with “acting” secretaries.",
            "“There’s no need to heed to McConnell’s demands to install corporatists,” said David Segal, who runs the group Demand Progress and has been leading the progressive effort to influence the Biden transition process. “He’s got to [appoint liberal Cabinet members] If he’s got any chance to attack the crises before us and stave off total democratic collapse in the midterms.”",
            "Demand Progress and the progressive group Data for Progress ran a survey in September that looked at support for the types of people Biden could install in his administration, which they shared with HuffPost. A majority of likely voters all said that lobbyists, Wall Street executives, executives of large technology companies and oil and gas executives all already have too much influence over government policy.",
            "In other words, these groups argue, picking the types of people who usually have power in Washington ― and could perhaps get McConnell’s approval ― will be a bad idea.",
            "Trump has relied heavily on acting secretaries to run the administration, including for high-profile positions like for the Office of Management and Budget director, the director of national intelligence as well as the head of the Department of Homeland Security, which has not had an official head since early 2019.",
            "Installing these temporary picks through the Vacancy Act is limited. They can serve for only 210 days once the position becomes open, although it can be extended if the president nominates someone to be the permanent secretary.",
            "Still, that period would be long enough for Biden to enact the agenda of his first 100 days and to start to address the most pressing crises, including the raging coronavirus pandemic and the struggling economy.",
            "Even aside from appointments, Democrats are hoping that Biden uses his executive authority to get as much done on policy as he can without the Senate.",
            "“Biden’s got to use executive orders,” Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) said on MSNBC last week.",
            "“It’s important to get personnel right so that you can use executive authority robustly, and in this context it will also be important to use executive authority robustly to get personnel right,” said a Democratic Senate strategist who requested anonymity to speak freely.",
            "Progressives argue that unless Democrats pick firmly liberal officials for top posts in the new administration, the party will face even more crushing results in the next election cycle.",
            "“The many people who swung back to Democrats relative to Trump need to see that Biden is in a position to actually address the crisis,” Segal said. “We need to not repeat 2010 — 2010 was not a function of too much response to the crisis, it was a combination of insufficiency and too much largess to corporations.”",
            "Democrats lost control of the House majority in 2010, fundamentally changing the course of President Barack Obama’s remaining years in office.",
            "Biden’s administration could also make appointments when the Senate is in recess, according to Segal. But the Senate has, in the past, blocked the president from making recess appointments by scheduling “pro forma” sessions ― when the Senate meets for a very short time to avoid technically being in recess.",
            "These acting appointments aren’t without drawbacks. Government experts say they don’t have the full authority within their departments of someone who is Senate-confirmed, and their temporary nature makes it harder for them to implement a full agenda.",
            "But supporters of this approach say it’s better than allowing an opposing party hellbent on blocking Biden’s agenda from controlling the entire process.",
            "Biden has already received backlash for some of his more centrist influences; over the summer his campaign had to distance itself from Larry Summers, a longtime economic adviser who has become a bogeyman on the left for his ties to Wall Street and Silicon Valley and for repeatedly backing bailouts for big financial institutions.",
            "Biden won with a large, ideologically diverse coalition. It includes corporate-friendly moderate Democrats who have long been at the center of power in Washington, and a growing progressive grassroots, advocating for the working class. And people from both sides of the spectrum ― and even a few Republicans ― have been discussed as Cabinet secretary choices.",
            "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) told The New York Times that if the administration shuts out progressives and caters to centrists and conservatives, it will be disappointing ― and will alienate a portion of the country that the Democratic Party needs to win.",
            "“These transition appointments, they send a signal. They tell a story of who the administration credits with this victory,” she said. “And so it’s going be really hard after immigrant youth activists helped potentially deliver Arizona and Nevada. It’s going to be really hard after Detroit and Rashida Tlaib ran up the numbers in her district. It’s really hard for us to turn out nonvoters when they feel like nothing changes for them. When they feel like people don’t see them, or even acknowledge their turnout.”",
            "If the Senate continues to be controlled by McConnell, Biden would have an easy excuse to pick more moderate figures to be part of his administration. But it could also hamper much of his agenda, which is certainly more progressive than any Democratic presidential candidate in recent history.",
            "“We’ve always been worried that Biden’s not going to have the will or interest in using his authority aggressively,” the Democratic Senate strategist said. “But hopefully he’ll see that it will be necessary for his administration to get anything done and ultimately to succeed.”",
            "“There is a corporate wing of each party and they could definitely make deals together,” Hauser said. “I’m definitely worried that they might say that the election means we should go to the center.”",
            "For now outside groups and labor organizers who have also been involved in transition talks — at least on the periphery — are not giving up hope on Democrats’ chances in the Senate.",
            "Mary Kay Henry, the president of the Service Employees Union International (SEIU), who has a direct line to the Biden campaign, told HuffPost she’s not yet entertaining the idea of a McConnell-led Senate. Her members are planning on organizing around an outstanding race in North Carolina and the possibility of two runoff elections in Georgia.",
            "Losing the Senate, she said, however, will not be an excuse to lower the party’s ambitions.",
            "“We just had essential workers turned out in this election and created a record-setting vote in this country,” Henry said. “We are not going to reduce our expectations one bit no matter who is in the Senate. They have to understand their political future rests on taking bold and dramatic actions to address the crises of a generation.”",
            "CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article misstated the date of the Senate runoffs in Georgia; it will be held on January 5, not January 30."

            "There’s no mistaking Carol Kane’s voice. Even if we hadn’t coordinated an exact time for our phone conversation, I would have recognized that throaty warble immediately. It’s grown more distinctive since she first appeared in “Carnal Knowledge” in 1971 and earned an Oscar nomination for the bittersweet 1975 immigrant romance “Hester Street.” Paired with Kane’s decadent blond curls, her speech has been a vessel for all sorts of madcap characters, including Simka on the sitcom “Taxi,” an amateurish witch in “The Princess Bride,” a Christmas ghost in “Scrooged,” the aptly named Granny Frump in “Addams Family Values,” an offbeat landlord on “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,” a wine-drunk zombie in “The Dead Don’t Die” and a Nazi combatant on “Hunters.”",
            "Kane, 68, didn’t set out to be a comedy maven, and at times she has longed for more opportunities to flex other muscles. But when you’re remembered for one particular mode, it can be hard to convince Hollywood to see you any other way. Even she used to doubt her own talents. During our 80-minute chat last week, she teared up thinking about the roles she turned down in the ’70s out of intimidation.",
            "Along the way, we talked about being typecast, self-doubt, carrying the influential opening scene of “When a Stranger Calls,” befriending Bette Davis, attending Madonna and Sean Penn’s wedding, Woody Allen and why “Kimmy Schmidt” changed her life.",
            "David Schweizer, who directed you onstage, once described your signature role as the “breathy-voiced ditz.” Why do you think that became your specialty?",
            "I think that’s kind of diminishing. I’m surprised that David would say that because I did two very different plays with him. But, you know, each to his own, I guess. It is certainly an aspect of what I’ve done. Of course, no one likes to be typecast. One does not want to be able to be described in six words after having worked for, luckily and gratefully, a long lifetime. I’ve been really lucky at my age to go back to doing dramatic characters [like in] “Hester Street” or some of the earlier films that I was fortunate to do. I’ve been lucky enough to do a lot of variety, and certainly some great breathy-voiced ditzes, like maybe the ghost in “Scrooged.”",
            "Have there been moments when you’ve felt upset that there wasn’t more dramatic work coming your way?",
            "Well, I don’t want to characterize it as upset because I’m so grateful for a great deal of the comedy work that I’ve been privileged to do. It’s really been a treasure, and I’ve worked with so many brilliant people. But certainly one wants to play the full scale. For a while, I was mainly being asked to do comedy, and I guess I did wish that maybe there was more dramatic work. But on the other hand, even when I was doing more film or television comedy, like “Taxi” or “Kimmy” or whatever, then some of the stage work has been dramatic.",
            "You’re right that early in your career, in movies like “Dog Day Afternoon,” “The World’s Greatest Lover” and “Annie Hall,” you were playing mostly relatable, everyday people. And over time, particularly after “Taxi” ended, your most popular movies found you portraying zany, over-the-top loons: “The Princess Bride,” “Scrooged,” “Addams Family Values” or even something like “My Blue Heaven.” Did you consistently enjoy working in that more ostentatious mode?",
            "Yeah. Because the movies that you’re describing, I got to work with such great actors and directors and writers, and for me, the writing is just everything. Luckily, in all the work you’re describing, I’ve been fortunate in that they’re just wonderfully written.",
            "You’ve said you felt insecure about your voice, but your voice is the thing you’re most known for. Have you learned to treasure what you can do with it?",
            "I don’t treasure my voice. I am grateful that I can alter it a great deal depending on the role. I enjoy doing that, finding the very specific voice of a character.",
            "Is there a voice that was particularly fun to develop?",
            "Several. I mean, the voice of Gitl in “Hester Street.” The voice in “Hunters.” Certainly the voice in “Scrooged” was really fun. “When a Stranger Calls” was a very different voice than “Scrooged” or whatever, so there’s a whole bunch of them. I think “Scrooged” was really fun because it was so crazy, getting to fly around. It was just really great. And then I had a lot of fun when I was doing “Wicked.” Madame Morrible’s voice was very low and very highfalutin and English. I just love the experimentation and alteration that goes along with different characters.",
            "I watched “When a Stranger Calls” for the first time not too long ago.",
            "I hope you didn’t watch it late at night!",
            "I did turn the lights out. I’m a big horror fan. You carry the opening scene almost single-handedly, and it inspired the famous opening scene of “Scream.” How did that make you feel?",
            "I know! I’m tickled by it. And one must give credit to Fred Walton, who wrote and directed “When a Stranger Calls,” who created that incredibly suspenseful scene where you don’t see anything particularly frightening. It’s just sounds of the refrigerator and the way he built it up. The pacing of it and everything was just so brilliant, and it tickles me that it became slightly iconic.",
            "I’m guessing you’re not a horror person.",
            "You know what? You are guessing correctly. I’m such a sucker. Now, how come you guessed that? But you’re right. I can’t watch it. I get really scared.",
            "Well, you just sounded so aghast when I said that I would want to watch “When a Stranger Calls” with all the lights turned out.",
            "Oh, God! I can’t stand that you did that! Yeah, no, I am totally chicken. I guess I just get carried away with the possibilities of it being real, you know?",
            "You did at least one other horror go-round with “Office Killer,” which I only recently learned was directed by Cindy Sherman. It’s the only movie she’s made.",
            "I hope it won’t be the only one, though, because she’s so brilliant. I love it. Also, her aesthetic is all true to that Cindy Sherman visual aesthetic. I just adore her, and I had a lot of fun with her. She had very specific taste, as you know, but she also encouraged a lot of freedom. For instance, one fun thing for me: I guess you may have noticed that [Kane’s character] Dorine’s eyebrows were very unique and didn’t match at all. Every day, Cindy painted them on for me. I just said, “You just have to do it yourself,” because they were so creative, those eyebrows, and they changed over the course of the film. The left one had nothing to do with the right one. I think only Cindy could do it.",
            "There’s a funny joke in “Kimmy Schmidt” where Lillian says that Cindy Sherman doesn’t really exist and is just a persona she created.",
            "I know! Isn’t that so funny? Tina Fey and Robert Carlock, sometimes they throw in a reference to other work that you’ve been in. I love that Tina does that. I feel like it’s getting a bonbon, if anybody still knows what that word means, to say what it means to me, as opposed to what it means to Lillian. Like a delicious little treat.",
            "You have a small role in “Ishtar.” For a long time, I was more familiar with the lore of “Ishtar” than the movie itself. At the time, it was called one of the worst movies ever made. It famously went over budget, and Elaine May and Warren Beatty had a falling out. The movie has since been reappraised, but what do you remember about the melodrama that apparently went on behind the scenes?",
            "Well, I remember that I got to go to rehearsal with Elaine May directing and writing. And I got to act with Dustin [Hoffman] and Warren and the great cinematographer [Vittorio Storaro]. I was not aware of behind-the-scenes drama, which I’m really glad about. And by the way, I have to say, on the movies or even theatre pieces that I’ve done, where there’s a great deal of gossip, a lot of it seems to me to be made up. But I also wasn’t there for a long time. I just adore Elaine, and I’ve gotten to do two other works with her.",
            "Is there a greater achievement than befriending Bette Davis?",
            "I don’t know. I’m speechless.",
            "Do you have a favorite Bette Davis memory?",
            "This is such a great memory of how I met her, and how I met her assistant, Kathryn Sermak, in the laundry room in the building I moved into in Hollywood. I was on my way to a movie in Sydney, and I was very young and kind of frightened to travel that far, to know no one. And Kathryn told Miss D, as she called her, about me and what was about to happen, and that very same day a beautiful note came under my door: “I’ve been to Australia. Maybe I can help. Come for drinks at 6.” Signed Bette Davis, whose movies I had watched all my life. I think she’s just the greatest screen actress in my childhood. I’d just read her book, and there was this invitation. She was generous like that, very kind towards me. I went to the Emmys one time for “Taxi,” and she had me in before for drinks and she was just so supportive.",
            "How lovely and how, perhaps, contradictory to the reputation that she earned as this brassy diva.",
            "Well, you know, the thing is, her greatness came along with being a perfectionist. I think many people who are perfectionists, a lot of people don’t understand that that can be the source of what people might think of as distant or tough. But she drove herself the hardest of anybody. I believe, from what I know of her and read that she’s written about herself, she expected the same kind of standard around her. I mean, I didn’t get to work with her, but as far as our relationship, she was nothing but supportive.",
            "I read that you were the only “Taxi” cast member to attend Andy Kaufman’s funeral. Why was that?",
            "I don’t even remember if that’s true, to tell you the truth. It could have just been that I was the one that lived on the East Coast. I’m wondering if Judd [Hirsch] was there, but I really can’t remember.",
            "Around that time, you ended up at Madonna and Sean Penn’s wedding. Was that because you and Sean had made a movie together?",
            "Yes. We made “Racing with the Moon,” and I met Madonna, was it through Sean? Also I think I met her with [Kane’s close friend] Diane [Keaton]. I can’t remember why that would be, but I do remember that to be true. I was invited to the wedding. I don’t know how they got through it, to tell you the truth. The amount of helicopters. It was really one of those things that you just read about but can’t relate to because it’s so crazy.",
            "That’s why I had to ask you about it, because it sounds so cinematic and almost fantastical.",
            "Well, that’s a great word for it. It was fantastical.",
            "When you are at an event like that, where there are paparazzi flying overhead and it becomes this storied legacy that will go down in the pop-culture history books, do you feel like it’s a sign that you’ve achieved some sort of celebrity status?",
            "Maybe for a second. I went with my girlfriend, Sheila Jaffe, who’s also close to Sean. Sheila’s a casting director that cast “The Sopranos” and most of Mark Wahlberg’s movies, and they were close. I can tell you that we never got the illusion or delusion that any of that attention or craziness has anything to do with you. It was very surreal, you know? Like a Fellini movie. You just get in a car and you drive an hour and suddenly you’re in a totally different world. And then you get back in the car and go home.",
            "I wondered if it was similar to the way people imagine getting an Oscar nomination, which you’ve also experienced. There are these singular things that, for the outsider who doesn’t know what it’s like to be famous, seem like a token of your having “made it.”",
            "Yeah, I guess so, to the outsider. It comes and goes so fast, and it’s all an illusion. Just to illustrate that, for instance, I can say that when I was out in Los Angeles staying at the Beverly Hills Hotel going to the Academy Awards [in 1976], I was also on unemployment. Those are the types of things to just drive you crazy. How do you balance those two realities? I think you have to be extremely sane and secure to balance.",
            "Was it easy for you to balance the two realities?",
            "Oh, no. I didn’t do well with it.",
            "What do you mean by that?",
            "What I mean is that it really frightened me. I was too young to cope with it, and I definitely turned down work that would’ve been very important for me to do because I just was too frightened and I was not sane and secure. I did this tiny little black-and-white movie [“Hester Street”] for no money. It was shot for no money, we made no money, and suddenly this thing happened. I was not prepared. I’ve seen, by the way, people that are prepared and are very gracious and can hit that level of success in a much better way than I was able to.",
            "And when you say that you were ill-prepared or frightened, was it the fame aspect that intimidated you?",
            "Yeah. Totally. And the Groucho Marx thing: not wanting to belong to a club that would have me as a member. [Kane briefly tears up.] I really suffered from that intensely, and that’s why I made some artistic choices that, as you can hear, are very painful to me to this day. But, you know, what can you do? I was 23 years old.",
            "Are you comfortable talking about some of those choices? What was the work that you turned down?",
            "There was a role in a movie playing a true story of an artist. I don’t want to say the name of it because I wouldn’t want to cause anybody involved with it pain. But it was a great, great role and an important true story having to do with the Holocaust. I guess you could say I didn’t allow myself to do it. It was after “Hester Street,” and I was just, to use the horribly overused phrase, too freaked out to accept that it was OK to come my way.",
            "There are so many different nuances to that feeling, and I think a lot of people have what they would call imposter syndrome.",
            "Hey, interesting! I’ve never heard that phrase, but that’s an interesting way to describe it. You don’t want to call it the Groucho Marx syndrome?",
            "I think that’s a far more clever way to frame it, yes. It’s interesting, though: During that same period we’re talking about, you were getting some really impressive work, including a few movies that are resonant to this day. Did you not feel at the time that that was the case?",
            "Well, I know a movie I love that we haven’t mentioned: “The Last Detail.”",
            "Of course. And “Carnal Knowledge.”",
            "“Carnal Knowledge” was the beginning of my life as an actress, really. Anyway, I think that I knew that I was fortunate to be in some very great movies and plays, but I also knew that I had gotten rid of some great roles that I should have taken on. More than one. That is not to say that I reject or don’t value or am not endlessly, endlessly grateful for what I have been a part of as an artist.",
            "You are close friends with both Diane Keaton and Mia Farrow, who have very different interpretations of the reputation that Woody Allen currently has. I’m curious what it’s like to watch someone you worked with assume such a complicated place in your friends’ lives, and to watch that person’s reputation sour so gravely.",
            "Well, look. I don’t know the truth of what happened. I mean, it’s something that is just ... I have no idea. The truth is, I have no idea. I think that Woody is a great, great director and has given us all the most extraordinary works of art. And I do not sit in judgment at all. I mean, the whole thing is so distressing. The pain on everyone’s part in the situation is awful. And I think that’s all I can say.",
            "Sure, you don’t have to answer for his allegations. I was just curious because of the connections you have with those two women who play very different roles in his life and have said very vastly different things about him.",

            "Do you think you might have felt more encouraged about yourself when you were young if you’d come up in the business today, given the attention being paid to elevating women in film and television?",
            "To tell you the truth, I would’ve been more encouraged if I had grown up during the ’30s and ’40s. Even in silent films, there were so many great female writers and directors and actresses. I don’t have any regret. The late ’60s and ’70s were such a rich soil for the work and the birth of independent films. And if it was today, then I wouldn’t have worked with Hal [Ashby], and I wouldn’t have worked with Cindy, and I wouldn’t have worked with John Cassavetes. Or Mike Nichols! But let’s face it. In the ’30s and ’40s and even ’20s, women were just extraordinary. Look at the roles that Bette Davis played. You can’t say things have gotten better than that. Ida Lupino, you know? If you want to talk about the ’70s, look at the roles created for Gena [Rowlands]. I’m glad for any enrichment that has happened, but I guess I don’t quite see it that way.",
            "I also think that if you look at European movies — English movies, French movies — the roles for women of all ages were so rich. America went through a period where, when you turned 40, you had to check with the phone company. It literally felt that way.",
            "Did it feel that way for you?",
            "Yeah. All of a sudden, the scripts that I was getting, [the characters were in their] 50s or 60s. It felt that way for a lot of us. But anyway, like I said, I have no regrets.",

And I did get to do the kind of physical comedy that I love and haven’t gotten to do on TV since “Taxi” and “All Is Forgiven.” It was a meal, and it was just served up to me in the most grateful, generous way.",

            "The Trump administration is moving ahead with a federal rule that would freeze pay for many agricultural guest workers for the next two years, even as they remain essential personnel during a pandemic.",
            "The new regulation would change the methodology used to determine the prevailing wage rates for workers with H-2A visas. Until now, minimum pay rates for most of these workers were set by a survey the U.S. Department of Agriculture conducts twice a year, asking farms for data on their workers’ hours and earnings. The Trump administration has tried to suspend that survey and intends to base future pay increases on data from the Labor Department starting in 2023.",
            "In the intervening years, the prevailing wage rates, which vary from state to state, would remain at their 2019 levels, leaving workers’ pay stagnant. Once pay increases resumed, experts say they would likely be smaller for most fieldworkers than they would have been under the previous methodology.",
            "Workers on H-2A visas come from Mexico and other countries to work temporarily on U.S. farms, typically picking and processing crops. Worker advocates say the wide use of guest workers means the farm labor market does not function like a free market, since these foreign workers are poorer and more willing than Americans to accept below-market pay.",
            "Under the law, employers have to pay guest workers a minimum prevailing wage ― known as the Adverse Effect Wage Rate (AEWR) ― so that their pay isn’t so low that it undercuts that of U.S. workers. In most cases, that prevailing wage comes from the survey that Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue has moved to suspend.",
            "The Labor Department published the new regulation last week. Senior agency officials said on a call with reporters just before Election Day that the change would give employers more stability and predictability when it came to wage increases. They described the current pay rates determined by the agricultural survey as too volatile, making it hard for employers to plan their payrolls each year.",
            "“It is a victory for farmers, agricultural workers, and the American people, who rely on a vibrant agricultural sector to supply food for our families,” John Pallasch, the Labor Department’s assistant secretary for employment and training, said in a statement.",
            "But as the agency’s own analysis shows, the rule would undoubtedly bring growers long-term savings on labor costs relative to the status quo.",
            "The text of the rule says it would lead to “transfer payments” of an estimated $1.68 billion over 10 years. As a Labor Department chart makes clear, that term is a euphemism: H-2A workers would be transferring $1.68 billion to their employers, in the form of lost wages.",
            "From the Labor Department’s rule:",
            "Last year, farmworkers who weren’t supervisors earned $13.99 per hour on average, compared with $23.51 for production workers outside agriculture.",
            "Farmworker Justice, an advocacy group for migrant workers, called the new regulation “cruel.”",
            "“The government has designated farmworkers as essential workers; they’re expected to work during a pandemic,” Bruce Goldstein, the group’s president, told HuffPost. “The federal government refused to mandate safety standards to protect farmworkers and others against COVID-19. Now the administration is punishing farmworkers by effectively cutting their wage rates. It’s just cruel and unreasonable.”",
            "Farmworker Justice estimates that the new rule would directly impact more than 200,000 workers.",
            "Goldstein said the incoming Biden administration could move to reverse the rule, but it would take at least a few months and perhaps longer to do so through the federal rulemaking process. He expects that the wage freeze would apply to the 2021 season at the least. He said the Trump administration was likely moving as quickly as possible with the rule before being forced out of office.",
            "The administration published the rule after the election but before Biden was projected to be the winner. It has been in the works for more than a year.",
            "The United Farm Workers union sued to prevent the farm labor survey from being ended, and a federal judge recently granted a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction against the Agriculture Department. In his order, the judge said the USDA offered “no indication that [it] considered the impact on farmworker wages caused by its decision to eliminate” the survey.",
            "The government must continue the survey for now, but the Trump administration does not have to use the survey to set prevailing wages for workers.",
            "The agriculture industry doesn’t like the survey because it’s typically led to pay rates well above those set by local minimum wage laws. The industry claims the methodology skews the wage rates too high. This year the prevailing wage rates range from $11 to $16 an hour, whereas most state minimum wages are well below that and the federal minimum wage is still just $7.25 an hour.",
            "A lobbyist for the American Farm Bureau Federation wrote earlier this year that the wages determined by the survey make it hard for farms “to stay open for business and compete against imports from countries with lower labor costs.”",
            "Under the Trump administration’s plan, the prevailing wage rates would freeze until 2023 even as wages in the broader labor market are likely to rise. Then the savings for growers would be locked in, as the rates increased thereafter according to a wage index.",
            "Daniel Costa, an immigration policy expert at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, said the index preferred by the Trump administration might produce bigger increases for some higher-skilled workers on farms. But the vast majority of guest workers would see smaller wages than they would have under the current system, hence the “transfer payments” going to employers.",
            "In an analysis, Costa found that fieldworkers’ wages rose an average of 3.6% each year between 2010 and 2019 based on the survey; under the index proposed in the new rule, they would have risen at an annual rate of just 2.3%.",
            "Over time, Costa said, the impact could be significant. The fact that guest workers would receive smaller pay hikes could soften wage increases for U.S. workers as well. The change would also allow farms to advertise lower pay than they would have under the survey, making the positions less attractive to U.S. workers.",
            "“This is absolutely a wage cut for migrants who are H-2A farmworkers,” he said. “H-2A farmworkers will not benefit from any natural wage growth that occurs [until 2023] ― during what farm owners are saying is a severe labor shortage, which is exactly when you would expect wages to grow in a free market.”"

            "Eta had maximum sustained winds of 65 mph (100 kph) at midday Sunday and it was centered north of Cuba, about 145 miles (235 kilometers) southeast of Marathon, Florida, and about 170 miles (275 kilometers) south-southeast of Miami. It was moving toward the north-northwest at 17 mph (28 kph).",
            "The storm swelled rivers and flooded coastal zones in Cuba, where 25,000 had been evacuated. But there were no reports of deaths.",
            "Eta hit Cuba even as searchers in Guatemala were still digging for people believed buried by a massive, rain-fueled landslide. Authorities on Sunday raised the known death toll there to 27 from 15 and said more than 100 were missing in Guatemala, many of them in the landslide in San Cristobal Verapaz.",

Caal, 65, suffered a dislocated shoulder when the landslide sent rocks, trees and earth hurtling onto the home where he was about to sit down to lunch with his wife and grandchildren. Caal said he was blown several yards (meters) by the force of the slide, and that none of the others were able to get out.",

Activists around the country poured money into Senate races, and candidates were significantly outraising and outspending their Republican Party opponents.",

Control of the Senate could have to wait until Jan. 5, when Georgia’s two Senate seats will be determined in runoff races.",
            "“For a President Biden, governing will have a Jekyll and Hyde feel,” said a senior Democratic Senate aide. Like others interviewed for this article, they requested anonymity to speak freely. “On one level, there is a substantial number of steps he can take via executive action. Moreover, a sizable portion of the country will be relieved that the person sitting behind the Resolute Desk is no longer a madman.”",
            "“On another level, legislating will be a real grind,” they added. “If Democrats don’t win the Senate, governing in the Biden era will make the post-tea party years of the Obama administration seem idyllic in comparison.”",
            "Biden already faced enormous challenges in the best of circumstances. He has to tackle a growing pandemic, heal a fractured country and please activists who want him to make big changes to structural problems.",
            "The question now is how he will be able to do any of that with a Democratic-led House and a divided Senate. (Democrats held on to the House, but they appear set to lose ground after expecting to pick up seats.)",
            "“So once this election is finalized and behind us, it will be time for us to do what we have always done as Americans,” Biden said in a speech Wednesday afternoon. “To put the harsh rhetoric of the campaign behind us. ... I know this won’t be easy. I’m not naïve. Neither of us are. I know how deep and hard the opposing views are in our country on so many things. But I also know this as well: To make progress we must stop treating our opponents as our enemy.”",
            "Biden has long pitched his ability to work across the aisle as a selling point, saying he believes that GOP lawmakers will be different once Trump is gone. In May, he lamented that “an awful lot of Republicans have become intimidated by the president.”",
            "″The thing that will fundamentally change things is with Donald Trump out of the White House ― not a joke ― you will see an epiphany occur among many of my Republican friends,” he added.",
            "It’s not clear if Biden still believes that Republicans will start cooperating with Democrats after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) rushed through a conservative replacement on the Supreme Court for liberal icon Ruth Bader Ginsburg a week before the election. That move had nothing to do with Trump and everything to do with longstanding Republican priorities.",
            "On Wednesday, McConnell said he was “not troubled at all” by the president prematurely declaring reelection victory when millions of votes had yet to be counted.",
            "Another Democratic Senate aide said McConnell has two options: Obstruct Biden at every step, like he did with Barack Obama, “or work with him a little because they know each other.”",
            "“Count me very skeptical on Option 2,” the aide said.",
            "“I also think they will get a middle ground COVID deal passed, but not a big one that actually makes a difference because, you know, deficits,” they added sarcastically, since the GOP has largely been content to let the deficit balloon under Trump.",
            "On Friday night, Biden said voters had given him “a mandate for action on COVID, the economy, climate change and systemic racism.",
            "But with results more mixed for Democrats down-ballot, it’s likely that Republicans will disagree and refuse to go along with his agenda. On the other hand, the 2022 Senate map is considered more favorable for Democrats, so there might be vulnerable GOP senators willing to play ball.",
            "“Senate Republicans will have to decide if they want to govern or run the Obama-era playbook of obstruction,” said the senior Democratic Senate aide. “The consequences of that decision cannot be understated. If one takes a step back, it’s obvious we’re living in a nation on the brink. The question of what we’re on the brink of if nothing gets done only leads to a very dark place.”",
            "Another Democratic staffer said it was just too soon to tell.",
            "“Maybe Senate Republicans act differently without Trump in the White House, particularly knowing they have another hard cycle in 2022? But do they work together on anything? Infrastructure week, anyone? Do they block everything? Do they want to wash the bad taste out of their mouth?” they wondered.",
            "But without a majority, Biden will need at least some Republican cooperation to get his nominees through the Senate, leading progressives to worry that it could lead to a more centrist Cabinet. A source close to McConnell told Axios that the GOP leader would work with Biden ― but only if his picks are more moderate.",
            "Reid also predicted that Biden would be working with McConnell.",
            "Biden is “a man who is a dealmaker,” the former majority leader said Thursday on MSNBC. “Legislation is the art of compromise. Compromise is not a dirty word, and Joe Biden understands that. I have every confidence that Joe Biden as president of the United States will do everything he can with executive orders, but he’ll also do everything he can to work with Democrats and Republicans.”",
            "There seems to be a fairly universal recognition that Biden is going to need to do what he can with his executive power if he wants to get anything done.",
            "“Biden’s got to use executive orders,” Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) said Wednesday on MSNBC.",
            "Trump embraced executive orders, even though in 2016 he criticized Obama for using them. He called them “the easy way out” and said if elected president he would “do away with executive orders for the most part.”",
            "Trump ended up issuing 193, compared with 147 for Obama in his first term, 171 for George W. Bush and 128 for Bill Clinton. And, according to The Washington Post, Trump was eager to use them rather than turning to them as a last resort, as most presidents do.",
            "Biden could use them for everything from immigration reform to canceling student debt to promoting unionization to undoing Trump cuts to safety net benefits to increasing wages for some workers.",
            "“One of the first things [Biden officials] need to learn is how to use the executive order,” Manley added. “As Trump found out, it’s not the answer to everything. Many of his orders end up in court, but that’s also because many of them were sloppily drafted. If you draft them correctly and go through the process, you can get some wins. I assume that’s what Team Biden is going to have to work at very closely.”",
            "“If you think that McConnell’s going to be in a mood to cut deals,” he added, “you’ve got to get your head examined.”",

            "HARRISBURG, Pa. — After news networks declared President Donald Trump the loser of the 2020 election on Saturday, about 2,000 of his supporters gathered here in the capital of Pennsylvania — a must-win state the president lost — for a heavily armed pity party.",
            "The rally outside the state Capitol was in stark contrast to the joyous celebrations seen across the globe, including in the president’s hometown of New York City, where residents took over the streets to sing, dance and drink Champagne.",
            "In Harrisburg, a ghoulish and cruel coalition of gun-toting MAGA extremists — who have enjoyed four years of being emboldened and condoned by the president ― gathered for hours to participate in the shared delusion that their guy hadn’t really lost the White House.",
            "They arrived around noon, immediately attempting to disrupt a permitted protest organized by pro-democracy progressives who had just heard the news that their preferred candidate, Democrat Joe Biden, had won Pennsylvania and was therefore the new president-elect.",
            "As the Biden supporters danced on the steps, the MAGA crowd yelled “Stop the steal!” — a common chant at right-wing rallies across the country this week, part of a coordinated campaign to falsely allege Biden was winning because of widespread voter fraud.",
            "As I approached the dueling demonstrations, I was immediately accosted by Jonathan Lee Riches, a notorious troll. He wore a red MAGA hat and a T-shirt emblazoned with symbols of the Proud Boys, a violent neo-fascist street gang. He repeated the white nationalist slogan “It’s OK to be white” as he started to film me, demanding that I denounce “antifa.”",
            "Police eventually told the MAGA crowd that it needed to move its demonstration to the other side of the building. The protesters obliged, waving their MAGA flags and Thin Blue Line flags along the way.",
            "Once assembled there, Rep. Dan Mueser (R-Pa.), a Trump fan widely believed to be eyeing a run for governor, took hold of a megaphone and spoke to the crowd about how the results of the election were illegitimate.",
            "He was surrounded by fascists. To his left, a man waved a flag for the anti-Semitic white nationalist movement known as America First. To his right, a man clad in black held a sign that read “Standing Back And Standing By For Our President” — a reference to when Trump, asked at a debate to condemn the Proud Boys, instead told them to “stand back and stand by.”",
            "Far-right extremists have been a fixture of Trump rallies over the last four years, but it’s still hard to overstate how many were in Harrisburg on Saturday. The place was crawling with them.",
            "A man in sunglasses, who had a collared shirt tucked into his khakis, stood silently watching the MAGA rally. He held a mug in his right hand with the logo of America First, the white nationalist group whose founder marched in the deadly 2017 “Unite The Right” fascist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.",
            "When I asked him about the mug, and to identify himself, he looked back at me silently.",
            "Another man took hold of the megaphone before telling the crowd that it was time to “free Kyle” — a reference to the 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse, a Trump supporter charged with shooting and killing two people at an anti-racism protest in Wisconsin in August.",
            "Armed militias were also in the city. They carried long guns and wore bulletproof vests. Some were members of a Pennsylvania chapter of the Three Percenters; others were followers of the militia-world influencer Daryl Stevens, aka “Angry Viking.”",
            "Stevens did an interview with Fox News, and told various people in the crowd that the Supreme Court would eventually deliver the presidency back to Trump and that “antifa and Black Lives Matter are both terrorist organizations.”",
            "The militiamen weren’t the only ones with guns. Multiple Trump supporters could be spotted carrying sidearms throughout the day.",
            "Also in the crowd were believers in QAnon, a pro-Trump conspiracy movement based on online posts by an anonymous person known as “Q” who claims to be a senior government official with access to information about a globalist cabal of pedophiles waging war against the president.",
            "Many people wore QAnon pins or hats or T-shirts, and the crowd often broke into chants of “Joe Biden is a pedophile!” — a baseless accusation popular among the QAnon faithful.",
            "Despite many massive worldwide celebrations of Trump’s defeat Saturday, the demonstration in Harrisburg — along with similar pro-Trump rallies in Michigan and Minnesota and Oregon — offered sobering evidence that the fascist political movement the president has cultivated during his sole term in the White House is still hopelessly devoted to him, and that America will be dealing with the MAGAverse and all its delusions long after Biden is inaugurated in 74 days.",
            "After the sun set in Harrisburg, and as people began to leave the Capitol building, a man on Third Street sat in an RV papered over with some of the MAGA merchandise he sells at Trump rallies across the country: posters reading “Fire The Lockdown Liberal” or featuring an illustration of Trump standing atop a tank holding a machine gun.",
            "The man, who refused to identify himself, told me that without Trump, America would fall into the hands of globalists who would turn it into a “third-world country.”",
            "When I asked him if he was worried about losing business if Biden took over in the White House, he gave a one-word answer: “Nope.”",
            "CORRECTION: A previous version of this article misstated Rep. Dan Meuser's first name as Jim."

            "MOSCOW (Reuters) - Scientists in northern Russia have discovered a huge walrus haulout on the shores of the Kara Sea where their habitat is under threat from shrinking ice and human activity.",
            "The haulout, a place of refuge where walruses congregate, reproduce, and socialise, is located in a remote corner of Russia’s Yamal peninsula, and scientists say they counted over 3,000 animals there last month.",
            "Walrus haulouts have traditionally been located on drifting sea ice or on Arctic islands, scientists say. But warmer climate cycles mean sea ice is shrinking and habitats are under threat from oil and gas exploration and more Arctic shipping.",
            "“This haulout is unique because there are both female and male walruses, as well as calves of different age,” said Aleksander Sokolov, a senior Arctic researcher at Russia’s Academy of Sciences who called the find a “unique open-air laboratory”.",
            "The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) listed the species as “nearly threatened” in 2016, estimating the total number of adult Atlantic walruses in the world at 12,500.",
            "Before commercial hunting of them was banned internationally in the middle of the 20th century, their numbers were threatened by overharvesting for their blubber and ivory.",
            "Andrei Boltunov, from the Marine Mammal Research and Expedition Center, said the Yamal haulout which was first discovered last year but only properly documented last month, showed that the Atlantic walrus population was recovering.",
            "“We want to believe that it’s a positive sign,” said Boltunov, who said there was too little information for now to draw sweeping conclusions however.",
            "According to Boltunov, the Kara Sea’s ice-free season has become longer in recent decades.",
            "Scientists have taken DNA samples and fitted several walruses with satellite tags to monitor their movements for up to several months.",
            "But Boltunov says much work was required to establish what made this particular Arctic beach so attractive for thousands of walruses and what steps could be taken to protect them."

            "In the year 2020, it’s normal — and very reassuring — to see our friends and family members in face masks. It can be off-putting, however, to see a favorite TV character wear one.",
            "For most of us, television is an escape. We cling to it, knowing it may help us get out of our heads. But when the shows we depend on to soothe our minds start giving us a dose of a reality — about the pandemic, election and other news — things can get complicated, according to mental health experts. There are positive and negative effects to seeing real-life scenarios play out on screen, depending on the type of content we’re consuming.",
            "Specials like Freeform’s “Love in the Time of Corona” and sitcoms including NBC’s “Connecting…” and Netflix’s “Social Distance” were made in and about the pandemic, but preexisting scripted series are also choosing to tackle coronavirus storylines. Showrunners for “This Is Us,” “black-ish” and “The Conners” are already addressing the pandemic and its effects on their characters. And network shows about essential workers, including “Superstore,” “Grey’s Anatomy,” “Station 19, “The Good Doctor,” “9-1-1 Lone Star” and the “Chicago” franchise, all plan to take on the early days of the coronavirus lockdown.",
            "But is it healthy for viewers to absorb visual retellings of our pandemic lives?",
            "“At a time when social distancing guidelines have increased isolation and decreased ― or, at the very least, complicated — opportunities for social connection, these storylines and the people in them may be the next best thing in terms of connecting to others,” said Enrique W. Neblett Jr., a professor of health behavior and health education at the University of Michigan. “The storylines can help people normalize and process events and experiences they are having with others. They could potentially also provide a sense of control over an environment that is often uncertain and unpredictable, especially in the context of national events, like the election.”",
            "Melissa L. Whitson, an associate professor of psychology at the University of New Haven, said that while fantasy series offer viewers a respite from the news and our day-to-day, dramas like “This Is Us” and “Grey’s” have been known to realistically address lived experiences. Viewers respond to storylines they can identify with and relate to, whether they be about the adoption process or someone’s battle with cancer.",
            "Critics and fans alike have commended “This Is Us” showrunner Dan Fogelman for diving headfirst into topics other Hollywood writers avoid, including pregnancy loss and the foster care system. So perhaps it’s not surprising that he tweaked Season 5 scripts to reflect the ways in which the coronavirus pandemic has affected his characters.",
            "In the two-hour premiere of “This Is Us” that aired last month, Kevin (Justin Hartley) and his fiancee, Madison (Caitlin Thompson), navigated a pandemic pregnancy. His brother Randall (Sterling K. Brown) and his family grappled with civil unrest following the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor.",
            "In a recent interview with Entertainment Weekly, Fogelman said he was initially torn between avoiding the horrors of 2020 and attempting to comment on them through his scripts.",
            "“I can’t tell you the amount of debate that has gone into everything from our show existing in a world that corona has not happened — like many shows are going to choose to do — to making an entire first nine episodes all happening during a quarantine period in our off-season,” he said. “We’ve been all over the map. I think we have a plan that splits the balance.”",
            "Similarly, on the Season 7 premiere of “black-ish,” front-line worker Dr. Rainbow Johnson (Tracee Ellis Ross) balances the fight against COVID-19 and her family’s quarantine habits. Star Anthony Anderson also said the show will address how the protests against systemic racism affect the Johnsons.",
            "“Even though we say we want to escape and to forget about things, watching people struggle with these issues and seeing different ways they deal with it might actually be somewhat restorative or calming,” Whitson said.",
            "But other psychologists said watching certain situations play out on a fictional TV show can be hard for viewers.",
            "“It is important to understand that not all ‘escapes’ are healthy ones,” said Dr. Teralyn Sell, a psychotherapist and brain health expert. “Perhaps it would be a better idea to tune into television that is unrelated to what is going on in the world today, to offer our stress hormones a much-needed rest.”",
            "Neblett said it can be mentally damaging to reexperience trauma and overengage with shows and films that touch on the pandemic, especially for those grappling with depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder.",
            "“The same questions that arose around repeated exposures to trauma, be it with 9/11 or social media footage and clips of police violence, may be relevant in considering how repeated exposure to these storylines could be triggering and lay the foundation for post-traumatic reactions and responses,” he said.",
            "According to Twitter, some audiences seem to agree. A lot of people on the platform are complaining about pandemic-focused plots and how they fuel anxiety.",
            "Dr. Frank Farley, a professor of psychological studies in education at Temple University and former president of the American Psychological Association, said he strongly believes reevaluations of our current reality can be detrimental.",
            "“We are, in general, a life-seeking, stimulation-engaging species overall ― pursuing change, overcoming challenges, motivated by tomorrow’s possibilities, invigorated by variety, engaging the new, battling boredom,” he said. “Thus a reliving of what is already in front of us and all around us, and is interfering with any semblance of a good and happy life, is not in general a healthy offering of the media.”",
            "“It is a piling-on of misery, an overload of negativity,” he added.",
            "Whitson, however, said it doesn’t necessarily work that way.",
            "“We don’t have to remind anybody about the pandemic; we’re all impacted by it and we’re all living it,” she said. “So I don’t see that there’ll be a lot of negative impact.”",
            "Indeed, some viewers sound excited to see how their favorite TV doctors will handle the pandemic.",
            "Like Fogelman, “Grey’s Anatomy” showrunner Krista Vernoff went back and forth on whether to incorporate COVID-19 into her medical drama, but ultimately decided that she’d balance out activism with escapism.",
            "“I wanted to tell the story of the impact of the pandemic on our ‘front-line’ workers,” she told The Seattle Times. “Think about that: Doctors and nurses and orderlies are being called front-line workers. But they have not been trained or equipped to fight a war.”",
            "The same is true for “Superstore,” whose Season 6 premiere featured the Cloud 9 team facing their new masked-and-sanitized normal as grocery store workers. The half-hour comedy, of course, takes a more humorous approach to the pandemic than “Grey’s.” Still, it will be triggering for some people as our country braces for a possible surge in cases, Neblett said.",
            "“TV shows and culture might provide some semblance of control and connection that viewers may find reassuring,” he said. “However, I imagine no one will be interested in an overwhelming number of stories about death and dying, particularly if they are experiencing these losses and impact of the pandemic directly and personally.”",
            "There will always be those who crave coronavirus storylines, even if they are mentally scarring.",
            "As lockdown started earlier this year, people began watching media about pandemics to better understand best- and worst-case scenarios. Steven Soderbergh’s star-studded 2011 thriller “Contagion,” about the rapid spread of an Asia-originated virus, topped the most-watched charts in March. The docuseries “Pandemic,” as well as films like 1995’s Ebola-in-the-U.S. movie “Outbreak” and South Korea’s 2013 “Flu,” also experienced spikes in viewership.",
            "Whitson said even the controversial Michael Bay-produced “Songbird,” an upcoming film starring KJ Apa and Sofia Carson that envisions a four-year lockdown caused by a coronavirus mutation, will attract plenty of attention. She said that what really matters is how how viewers digest these outbreak stories.",
            "“It’s so difficult right now for us to think about what the future is going to look like in the next three months, in the next six months, in the next year. Some of us are trying to think positively about what it might look like, but there’s also a lot of people who are thinking, ‘Well, what if it doesn’t look like that?’” Whitson said. “Our ability to think out those different scenarios is not necessarily a bad thing as long as we don’t get fixated on, ‘Oh, this is definitely going to be horrible.’ That sends you into this vicious spiral where you’re not able to see any potential positive outcomes and then you become depressed or withdrawn.”",
            "Deborah Ann Davis, an award-winning author and parenting skills coach, counters that idea: “Once you watch a pandemic movie in the middle of a pandemic crisis, you can’t un-watch it. If it generates emotions and fears in you, there’s no escape from that.”",
            "Watching something like “Contagion,” she added, might leave viewers reevaluating their own lives, and depression or fear could skyrocket with every coronavirus news alert.",
            "As a solution, Farley said showrunners or filmmakers who choose to tackle a pandemic storyline should incorporate realistic solutions to our public and private problems, and address complaints about lockdown life.",
            "“Any means of having fun, finding connections and staying alive will be embraced, in my view,” he said."

Earlier in the day, he overtook President Donald Trump’s once-sizable leads in Georgia and Pennsylvania. Vote totals released in swing states throughout Friday continued to bolster Biden’s position and reduce Trump’s chances of victory to the near-impossible.",

            "Biden leads Trump nationwide by more than 4 million votes, a margin that will surely increase as the remaining states, particularly California, conclude their counts. Biden received 50.53% of the total votes cast, compared with Trump’s 47.81%. Should the final results reflect that lead, Biden will join Barack Obama as the only presidential candidate in decades to win a first term with a popular majority, unlike President Bill Clinton in 1992, President George W. Bush in 2000 and Trump himself in 2016.",
            "Scroll down or click here for the latest updates.",
            "As states worked on their official tallies, Trump and his allies continued to lash out and accuse Democrats of fraud ― without offering any evidence. On Thursday evening, Trump hosted a brazenly dishonest press conference at which he baselessly insisted that Democrats were “trying to steal” and “rig” the election.\n\nTrump did not appear in public on Friday but continued his furious, fact-free attacks on the democratic process on Twitter. As anticipation built for Biden’s speech in the afternoon, Trump tweeted that “Joe Biden should not wrongfully claim the office of the President. I could make that claim also. Legal proceedings are just now beginning!”\n\nThe Trump campaign, as it warned it would, has filed multiple last-ditch legal challenges in swing states. In Michigan and Pennsylvania, the campaign wants election officials to stop counting ballots until it receives “meaningful” access to ballot-counting sites and a review of ballots already counted, according to The Associated Press. And in Georgia, the campaign is demanding that state law regarding absentee ballots be followed.\n\nBut judges in at least three states — Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania — have already rejected the campaign lawsuits.\n\nMeanwhile, Republican leaders alternately embraced Trump’s baseless claims of fraud or began to distance themselves from the president as his likely loss became clear.\n\nSen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) said Friday morning that Trump’s fraud allegations were “very disturbing” and there was “simply no evidence” for them. But some potential contenders for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination took a different approach. Nikki Haley, who served as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under Trump, tweeted a call on Friday for more “transparency” in the vote-counting process, while Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) baselessly declared Thursday night on Fox News that election officials in Pennsylvania were “setting the stage to potentially steal an election.”\n\nFor the latest results, maps and more, check out HuffPost’s elections hub.\n\nQuestions remain around five states.",
            "Arizona: The Associated Press and Fox News both projected a victory for Biden on election night, but no other network has since. Although the gap has narrowed during continued vote-tallying, Biden still leads by about 20,000 votes.\n\nGeorgia: Biden took the lead over Trump early Friday morning by more than 4,000 votes, with votes still left to be counted. The state will be headed to a recount, Georgia’s secretary of state said Friday.\n\nNevada: Biden leads by about 22,000 votes, with an estimated 30,000 ballots still uncounted. Daily updates will come at 12 p.m. Eastern time, including on weekends. Biden is heavily favored to win the state at this point.\n\nNorth Carolina: Trump leads by more than 75,000 votes, with an estimated 95% of votes counted. He appears to be in a strong position to win the state.\n\nPennsylvania: Biden leads by around 31,000 votes, having eliminated Trump’s lead as the week went on. Biden is heavily favored to win the state at this point, which would be sufficient to deliver him the presidency.",
            "Trump’s path to a second term has become virtually nonexistent. To hold on to the White House, he would need to win Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. In only one of those states — North Carolina — does he appear strongly favored to win.",
            "Biden, on the other hand, can secure the electoral votes to win the presidency in numerous ways: a victory in Pennsylvania would put him over the top, as would wins in any of the two other remaining states.",
            "The current Electoral College tally is complicated by the fact that news outlets have not agreed on whether to call Arizona. The AP, which HuffPost relies on for its projected results, and Fox News called Arizona for Biden on election night. However, some outlets still have not done so. It’s possible that Biden will get to 270 votes per AP projections without a formal concession from the Trump campaign or an end to legal challenges.",

            "Ten years ago, Republicans redrew congressional and state legislative districts overwhelmingly to their advantage, tilting the playing field by making it harder for Democrats to win and hold control of both statehouses and the U.S. House.",
            "They’re poised to do so again next year after the Democrats’ disappointing down-ballot performance in Tuesday’s elections, which saw unprecedented voter turnout for both parties. The GOP appeared to have held on to control of key legislative chambers across the country where the decennial redistricting battles will take place after the 2020 census.",
            "Democrats poured millions of dollars into efforts to flip statehouses in key battleground states like Arizona, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Texas. They were also seeking wins in Florida, Georgia and Wisconsin. The party missed nearly all of its top targets.",
            "At stake in the fight is not only the future makeup of Congress, but also the laws enacted at the state level, where much of the policymaking is done. State legislatures also set the rules governing voting and how ballots are counted and cast. GOP officials in states like Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, for example, blocked efforts this year to count ballots before Tuesday’s election to head off false allegations of fraud like those being spread by President Donald Trump and his allies.",
            "While the outcomes of several key down-ballot races have yet to be called, Republicans claimed victory and touted their hold on legislative majorities in Georgia, Florida and Texas. Democrats had big hopes for Texas, in particular, after making gains there in 2018. But they lost big this week, failing to pick up a single congressional or statehouse seat.",
            "“Liberal coastal elites spent every last bit of energy and every dollar they could find ― flooding Texas in an attempt to take the soul of the state,” said Austin Chambers, president of the Republican State Leadership Committee. “Texans let Democrats know they cannot and will not be bought, and we couldn’t be more proud to celebrate these wins.”",
            "Republicans are actually likely to gain two more trifectas ― in Montana and New Hampshire ― under newly elected Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte and New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu. They also held on to control of the Arizona Legislature despite Fox News and Associated Press projections that Democrat Joe Biden would take the state in the presidential contest.",
            "Democrats pointed to some minor gains on Tuesday that will help them in coming fights at the state level. They blocked a GOP supermajority in the Wisconsin Legislature that could otherwise override Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ veto. They also made gains in the Ohio and Michigan state supreme courts.",
            "Still, those wins are far from a consolation prize for disappointed Democrats who had hoped to regain control of both chambers of Congress next year and enact major progressive policies, if they’re able to oust Donald Trump from the presidency.",
            "Christina Polizzi, a spokeswoman for the Democratic State Leadership Committee, attributed the party’s difficulties in flipping statehouses to Trump’s presence on the ballot, something they didn’t have to contend with during the 2018 midterm elections and the 2017 elections in Virginia and New Jersey.",
            "“It’s clear to us so far that in some of our districts in red states is that Trump really overperformed expectations. He did a lot better. He brought Republican voters with him,” Polizzi told HuffPost.",
            "Polizzi argued that Democrats stood a better chance in redistricting fights next year because of their gains at the state level over the past decade, including in Virginia, Maine, New Mexico, Minnesota, New York and Oregon.",
            "“We are much, much, much better positioned going into 2021 than 2011. We know exactly what they’re going to do this year and we’re prepared to stop them,” she added.",
            "Still, Republicans will likely have a huge advantage in drawing maps for congressional districts next year, possibly as many as 4-5 times as many as Democrats, according to Daily Kos. The GOP could once again gerrymander districts in the party’s favor, entrenching minority rule for the next decade.",
            "The picture looks even more daunting for Democrats in the coming years. While they can look forward to a more favorable Senate map in 2022, they still face long-term headwinds in the upper chamber due to the disproportionate power it grants to rural Americans, who are far more likely than their urban counterparts to vote Republican.",
            "In addition to the issue of skewed congressional maps, Democrats are also likely to be playing defense in the House, where they are projected to hold a slim majority after Tuesday’s unexpectedly brutal losses.",
            "The party also can’t look to the courts to save it. A 6-3 conservative Supreme Court majority that has already proven hostile to voting reforms, for example, will be more inclined to uphold any GOP-drawn maps that may disadvantage Democrats at the ballot box. It could also block any major policies a Democratic president may try to enact by sidestepping Congress through executive actions.",
            "Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) on Wednesday urged Democrats not to get too down on themselves, calling a possible Trump loss a “big deal.” He also emphasized the need to win two possible runoffs for Senate seats in Georgia, which could produce an evenly split upper chamber, giving them a tie-breaking advantage if Kamala Harris becomes vice president."

            "President Donald Trump, in an entirely predictable fashion, is using speculative and ill-informed allegations of mass voter fraud to suggest that an Electoral College victory is being stolen from him. Many Republican voters, primed for unfounded accusations of widespread voter fraud by a decades-long campaign unmoored to facts, are likely to believe him.",
            "And, at the moment, Republican Party leaders and top officials at the Justice Department are aiding Trump in his campaign to undermine the election results, either actively or through their silence.",
            "Former Vice President Joe Biden has a commanding lead of the popular vote, and is likely to receive more votes than any presidential candidate in history. But the candidate who wins the most votes doesn’t necessarily win the presidency, which is what gave America the presidencies of George W. Bush, in 2000, and Trump, in 2016.",
            "With all eyes on the Electoral College, Trump is spreading disinformation about the voting process and suggesting that officials should stop counting votes. On Wednesday morning, he tweeted:",
            "“Last night I was leading, often solidly, in many key States, in almost all instances Democrat run & controlled. Then, one by one, they started to magically disappear as surprise ballot dumps were counted.”\n\n“We are up BIG, but they are trying to STEAL the Election. We will never let them do it. Votes cannot be cast after the Polls are closed!”\n\n“They are finding Biden votes all over the place — in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan. So bad for our Country!”\n\n“They are working hard to make up 500,000 vote advantage in Pennsylvania disappear — ASAP. Likewise, Michigan and others!”",
            "This is the point where responsible Republicans could step in and condemn this sort of rhetoric, and encourage patience and a fair count of all the votes. So far, they haven’t.",
            "A spokesman for the Justice Department, which should be keenly interested in any criminal conspiracies to steal elections, did not respond to a request for comment. Nor did a spokesman for U.S. Attorney William McSwain, a Republican whom Trump appointed as the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania who has taken an extremely political and pro-Trump approach to his job at the top federal prosecutor in the district, which includes Philadelphia.",
            "HuffPost also contacted spokespersons for Pennsylvania’s other two top federal prosecutors: David J. Freed of the Middle District and Scott W. Brady of the Western District. Before the election, each Trump nominee reassured voters in their state that they were looking closely for signs of fraud and would work to uphold the integrity of the election. Neither provided comment.",
            "In Pennsylvania, the false conspiracy about mass fraud has been pushed by a network of right-wing activists that deals in misinformation. Trump was already spreading his skepticism of vote counting in Philadelphia in presidential debates, saying that “bad things happen in Philadelphia” and urging his supporters to “go into the polls and watch very carefully.”",
            "Rudy Giuliani, who helped Trump spread misinformation ahead of the 2020 election, said Wednesday that he would be heading to Philadelphia. “Will not let Philly Democrat hacks steal it!” he tweeted. Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), claimed in a press conference that what Trump really wanted is to “make sure” that “every legal vote is counted” — even though the president has said nothing of the sort and has called for legal votes not to be counted because they come from districts unfavorable to him. McCarthy also suggested, completely baselessly, that people were voting after the election. Asked if he had evidence, he ignored the question.",
            "But Philadelphia officials were prepared. The office of District Attorney Larry Krasner put out updates on how things were unfolding in Philadelphia, the city ran a calming livestream of the vote counting process, and Philadelphia City Commissioner Al Schmidt ― a Republican ― urged patience as the votes rolled in.",
            "So far, Fox News has also appeared to act with some responsibility; it called Arizona for Biden on Tuesday night and stood up to withering criticism from the Trump campaign and even some of its own talent over the call, which was later made by other mainstream news outlets. But all that might not be enough to shut down the narrative that the network and conservative activists have promoted for years: that Republicans lose elections because Democrats ― particularly in majority Black cities ― engage in massive criminal conspiracies to steal votes. It’s a conspiracy theory that also requires you to believe that Republicans on every level are totally inept at discovering these massive criminal conspiracies.",
            "Ballot fraud does occasionally happen. In Philadelphia, a former judge of elections in South Philly admitted to accepting bribes to inflate vote totals, and a former congressman caught in a FBI sting in the 1970s was indicted in the same election fraud scheme.",
            "Huge voter fraud on the scale Trump has suggested, however, would require a massive criminal conspiracy by countless officials. And Republicans, especially in this election, have been watching the voting process closely. In Philadelphia, the Trump campaign was reduced to surveilling ballot boxes and watching as voters dropped off a couple of ballots, which they attempted to spin into a mass conspiracy threatening election integrity. On Election Day, a Trump campaign official spread misleading information about extremely minor potential violations of election code. But an effort to find any evidence of mass voter fraud in the city of brotherly love landed, like expected, as a complete failure.",
            "Election Day 2020 went relatively smoothly. There were no huge systemic issues at polling places. But the 2020 election ― happening in the midst of a pandemic that has taken the lives of 230,000 Americans ― is zeroing in on mail-in ballots, the exact form of voting that he discouraged his voters not to use. He’s returning to the same playbook he used in 2016.",
            "“I’m guessing that part of it is he’s preparing to lose the election, and he wants to be able to say that he didn’t actually lose the election,” Lorraine Minnite, author of the 2010 book “The Myth of Voter Fraud,” said in 2016. “I just don’t think he cares about the effects of what he says.”",
            "Back in 2016, when Trump also warned about voter fraud, a poll showed that 72% of Trump supporters thought that “a lot” or “some” voter fraud happened in their state. At the time, some Republican officials downplayed Trump’s claims of mass voter fraud. Former House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said he was “fully confident” that states would conduct the election with integrity.",
            "Trump won the electoral college in 2016, so his claims of voter fraud didn’t play as big of a role. But even then, hurt by his huge loss in the popular vote, Trump insisted that voter fraud was a massive problem, and made the ludicrous claim that he would’ve won the popular vote without it. His Republican appointees have been in charge of the Justice Department for more than three years now, and they’ve been on the hunt for mass voter fraud conspiracies. But they’ve never bought a case alleging a massive, wide-scale conspiracy to steal an election. Some of the voting cases they have brought have been pretty small potatoes.",
            "Vanita Gupta, the president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and the former head of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, said Wednesday that while some Republicans had spoken out to calm fears of massive voter fraud, that she wished more would do so.",
            "“Whether or not that happens in as broad a swath as one would hope, that remains to be seen. Obviously we’ve got the lessons of the last several years on that front,” Gupta said.",
            "Gupta also said it would be “important” for the Justice Department to put out a message about the integrity of the elections, but she doesn’t think that it will.",
            "“I am not optimistic right now given the attorney general’s prior comments sort of validating some of the president’s misinformation in interviews that he has given in the past couple weeks that he will be the voice of reason upholding basic democratic norms at this moment,” Gupta said.",
            "“Make no mistake: Our democracy is being tested in this election. This is a stress test of the ideals upon which this country was founded,” said Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf (D) on Wednesday. “And the basic rule of one person, one vote, that still carries, and it has to carry here.”",
            "The most important thing, Wolf said, “is that we have accurate results, even if that takes a little bit longer than we’re used to.”"

            "Jim Wright, a hardcore climate change denier and owner of an oil-field services company, is projected to win the race to be Texas’ next energy regulator, preserving the Republicans’ quarter-century hold on the Texas Railroad Commission and defeating a better-funded Democrat.",
            "The race for the open slot on the three-seat commission ― which, despite its name, oversees the Lone Star State’s vast oil, gas and mining industries ― had been widely seen as Democrats’ best chance to win a statewide election there in nearly three decades.",
            "Earlier this year, Wright defeated Ryan Sitton, the better-funded and respected Republican incumbent, in a surprise upset during the GOP primary. A relative unknown facing fines from the very commission he’ll now join ― as well as lawsuits accusing him of fraud ― Wright seemed like a prime target for Democratic challenger Chrysta Castañeda, an engineer and energy attorney who ran on curbing pollution that even big oil and gas giants support regulating.",
            "Her moderate, technocratic approach won endorsements from major metro daily newspapers in Texas and a last-minute $2.6 million campaign infusion from billionaire donor Michael Bloomberg. But that wasn’t enough to sway voters in a state that remains a Republican stronghold, particularly when fewer voters than at any point in recent history are casting ballots for candidates from both parties.",
            "With 92% of the vote counted, Wright had a 10-point lead over Castañeda by Wednesday.",
            "“I don’t think voters are looking for somebody who is going to take a really adversarial stance toward the industry,” said Gabriel Collins, the Baker Botts Fellow in energy and environmental regulatory affairs at Rice University in Houston. “What most voters probably want is to try to get somebody who they think is going to be a referee to call a fair game and is not too close to industry, nor too close to environmental pressure groups.”",
            "Voters certainly got the latter in Wright.",
            "Not only has Wright claimed he’s unconvinced by the scientific reality that fossil fuel emissions are causing climate change, he told an oil industry podcast last month that “solar, wind and all those” actually “harm the environment worse” than natural gas. Moreover, he said, renewables are only “good when technology is there to make sure they’re good.”",
            "“Today, I don’t think the technology truly exists. It was an idea. It caught on and hey, we’re going to save the planet because our icebergs aren’t going to melt anymore. You haven’t convinced me at all of that,” Wright said on the podcast “Digital Wildcatters.” “I don’t see the research that proves that. Again, my own theory is, I think the Earth continues to evolve just like we have for millions of years, and we’re gonna go through different times.”",
            "During the campaign, Castañeda zeroed in on flaring ― the process by which oil drillers burn off excess methane, a super-potent greenhouse gas, from wells ― as the key policy area where she’d push for change. Texas flares nearly as much gas each year as all of its households consume, wasting some $750 million worth of the fuel in the state’s Permian Basin in 2018 alone.",
            "Flaring worldwide contributes about 1% of the man-made carbon dioxide emissions causing climate change. And recent studies using satellites have found that emissions of unburned methane over the Permian Basin, which stretches from West Texas to eastern New Mexico, are significantly higher than what the Environmental Protection Agency estimates ― suggesting more is leaking from wells and pipelines than previously understood.",
            "Industry giants such as Exxon Mobil Corp., Royal Dutch Shell and BP have called for increased regulation of methane, and invested in equipment to capture gas and plug leaks. But smaller drillers, particularly those owned by private equity firms that took risky bets before oil prices plummeted this year, have less incentive to make those changes.",
            "“You’re getting investor pressure on the oil industry itself so the oil industry wants to change,” said Marianne Kah, the former chief economist at drilling giant ConocoPhillips, who now serves on the advisory board of Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy. “The biggest problem is the smallest players who don’t want to do these things... and even though the majors are making the investment to try to stop flaring, without regulation you don’t stop this.”",
            "The Trump administration rescinded federal rules on methane emissions in August. Wright is unlikely to support a new crackdown on flaring.",
            "“I’m not saying that that flaring doesn’t have some impact, but does it have the true impact that you see in media today? I don’t believe that,” he said the podcast. “Can you tell me of any exact research that really says that flaring is actually harming our atmosphere and any worse than emissions from a car, or anything else that they’re claiming is making changes to our climate that we see today?”",
            "The other two Republican commissioners largely share Wright’s views. In 2018, Commissioner Wayne Christian wrote an op-ed arguing that the “science on climate change is not settled.” Commissioner Christi Craddock has routinely railed against regulations on greenhouse gases, and called attempts to connect 2016 flooding in Texas and Louisiana to climate change an “incredibly inappropriate appeal” to “emotions on behalf of the climate agenda.”",
            "“The people on the commission are climate change deniers,” said Gunnar Schade, an associate professor of atmospheric science at Texas A&M University. “Some express it in ways others would not. But they’re all essentially in agreement.”"

            "“Home for the Holidays” must be the most relatable movie ever made about Thanksgiving. It has a turkey, a parade, an eccentric aunt, a gay brother, men playing football in the yard, in-laws who detest each other and multiple familial meltdowns. Jodie Foster’s film — released 25 years ago, on Nov. 3, 1995 — applies an unsentimental lens to the very American celebration while still managing to feel sweet, sympathetic and funny. It’s also quintessentially ’90s: a starry but intimate mid-budget dramedy released by a major studio (Paramount Pictures) that has become something of a cult classic in the intervening years.",
            "“Holidays” was Foster’s second directorial outing, following 1991’s “Little Man Tate.” She cast Holly Hunter as Claudia Larson, an art restorer and single mom who has just been laid off from her museum job. Heading home to Baltimore for a prototypical Thanksgiving gathering hosted by her parents (Anne Bancroft and Charles Durning), she is thrilled to spend time with her wily brother (Robert Downey Jr.) and less thrilled to see her bitter sister (Cynthia Stevenson) who never left home. Over dinner and various other happenings, the Larson family comes close to imploding. Also on hand for the antics are Dylan McDermott, Geraldine Chaplin, Claire Danes, Steve Guttenberg and David Strathairn.",
            "Foster’s career behind the camera began with a segment of the 1985 horror anthology “Stephen King’s Golden Tales” and went on to include the movies “The Beaver” and “Money Monster,” as well as episodes of “House of Cards,” “Orange Is the New Black” and “Black Mirror.” But “Home for the Holidays” is easily her most distinctive directing effort thanks to a stylish kineticism that accentuates the script’s humor.",
            "Last week, Foster called me to discuss the film’s development, shutting down the set because Downey Jr. was “speaking in tongues,” wanting to make something that appealed to people in their 30s, and why she wishes she’d directed more movies.",
            "I’m glad you were interested in chatting about “Home for the Holidays.” That must mean you have a fondness for this movie.",
            "Oh, I love that film. It was an amazing experience. It was sort of cathartic for me, you know? We developed it from the short story and an earlier script, and so the process of creating it was really about downloading all of our lives and thoughts and feelings about being in our 30s and looking at our families, going home for the holidays. It even has a very personal resonance to me.",
            "Looking back on it, where were you in your life and your career when you started working on the film?",
            "Let’s see. It was just before I did “Contact.” I did not have children yet. I was 30, probably. 31, 32? I was running my company and I had already won both Oscars, so I was wanting to direct movies that felt like personal stories and that reflected my life in some way. I feel like “Little Man Tate,” “Home for the Holidays” and “The Beaver,” in a weird way, even though they were all written by different authors and they were about totally different subjects, for me, in my life, they’re sort of a trilogy.",
            "“Little Man Tate” was, in some ways, really autobiographical themes about being a child that was prodigious. I don’t know that I was a child prodigy, but I was prodigious. [It was about] coming to terms with that and being different, kind of coming of age. “Home for the Holidays” was really about that very particular time in your life when you’re 30 and you’re still kind of attached to your parents and your family. You still feel like a child. You feel infantilized by them, and you have this very particular search for meaning that happens in your 30s: “Did I choose this life? Is this the life that I want? Where am I headed?” I think all three of those movies — “The Beaver,” as well — are about people in spiritual crisis. They’re people who are undergoing a kind of life assessment and are changing or making these transitions.",
            "What changed about the movie in the course of your work with, or independent from, W.D. Richter, who wrote the first draft of the script?",
            "Well, lots of things are different. It just deepened. I mean, the original idea was 36 hours over the course of a Thanksgiving meal. It was just like a bunch of messy anecdotes. I love him, but he really enjoys the kind of structureless thing. We really structured it. The brother character was very different. I think that in the original short story and in the original script, he was really just the crazy brother. There weren’t as many deep, emotional questions.",
            "I love that character because he’s sort of ahead of his time. He’s gay in a matter-of-fact way. The movie doesn’t give him some big, dramatic coming-out moment or subject him to any of the AIDS panic that was common at the time. Did you recognize that you were doing something a little progressive there?",
            "Originally, the brother was not gay. That was not part of the story, and it was not part of the original script, so that was something that we brought in. We wanted to create a real character. I think that’s what’s so powerful, and why it’s before its time is because it really is just based in the real world that we live in. These are people that are our brothers and our sisters. It never occurred to me to want to create a kind of victim story, or even a coming-out story. For me, at 30 years old, that felt kind of beside the point. It wasn’t about his acceptance of himself; it was about having to go home to a family when you already have a family. People that live in some subset groups — whether it’s gay people, whether it’s progressives, as opposed to going home for your conservative friends, or maybe you don’t live in a religious way but your parents are religious — your friends are your family, and that is very true of my generation. Our family was more the people that we got stuck in the elevator with that we didn’t choose.",
            "Absolutely. When you were putting “Home for the Holidays” together, were you looking at or thinking about any other movies as influences?",
            "Let’s see. I kind of never do that, and I work a little bit differently than most directors do that way. Look, I was a huge movie fan and I have a lot of references. Like, that’s all I ever did as a child. That was my film school, going to see movies with my mom, especially foreign films. But interestingly, when I prep for a movie and when I think about a movie, I never do that process consciously in the beginning. I try to stay away from that because I want the film to have its own feeling. That being said, we talked a lot about [John] Cassavetes. We talked a lot about that overlapping energy that was going on in scenes, the cacophony, really, of what a Cassavetes movie could be. We said we wanted that feeling, but we really wanted a structure. I was clear that I didn’t want to be left with a feeling that it was just an anecdote.",
            "Oh, I was realizing, the one thing that people do mention about the Robert Downey Jr. character was the wedding. One of the plot points that we brought in was that he had gotten married and he didn’t invite his sister. And it was something that he had done on a beach, alone, with 20 of his friends. It was this moment that, to him, was profound and meaningful, and he didn’t bring his family into that equation because of a number of reasons. Obviously, in the era of gay marriage and the era of this time in our history, “Home for the Holidays” kind of stands out as a movie that was talking about gay marriage before anybody was talking about gay marriage. That gay family had to form privately on its own because society and culture did not allow that.",
            "And I love that you show just a little glimpse of what that family looks like in the cutaway when Tommy is on the phone with the friends who have gathered in his absence. You do get a little snapshot of just how fun and beautiful that is for him.",
            "Yeah, I mean, there was a theme that was running for me that’s a personal theme that runs through a lot of my work and a lot of things that I think about, which is my whole life has been on camera and been documented. A lot of people feel like, “Oh, it’s on camera, so that means I know you.” And the truth is that some of the most important moments of my real life, my private life, there were no cameras. There were no trophies. There were no million-dollar checks. They slip through your fingers. The most impactful moments are moments that you shared between another person and the two of you are the only people who know that it happened. You are the only two that can recall that memory or that experience, and so in the film, the father is constantly saying, “Well, did you get a picture?” He’s always taking pictures like he wants to freeze something and say, “This happened. This is real. I know because I got a picture of it.”",
            "And the end [when Durning’s character is watching old home movies] is something that really happened during shooting. In the end, I said, “I really want to go through and let the audience see what those moments were that were only shared by two people.” We’re going to have the audience experience that the way the characters are experiencing that. And when we let the audience into that moment where, let’s say, Holly Hunter and her daughter are floating, looking at fish and they’re holding hands and they’re not talking but they’re pointing at fish, that moment is talked about during the course of the film. It’s alluded to as this kind of cementing, bonding thing that her daughter can remind her of that gets her through everything. And then when we go back, the camera is under water and we see that moment. We’re privy to something that is off the books. I really, really wanted to talk about that experience.",
            "Did you ever consider casting yourself in the Holly Hunter role? People often say the two of you look alike.",
            "Well, that’s funny. No, I never did. I’d done “Little Man Tate” and had directed myself, and I said at the time, “Oh, I never want to do that again.” I’m much happier just directing. I at least wanted to have the experience of just directing but not acting. It’s a much better experience.",
            "Robert Downey Jr. spoke about “Home for the Holidays” recently. He was on David Letterman’s Netflix show, and he was talking about that time of his life, mostly in the context of his current sobriety. Because he was inebriated during the production, he joked that his performance is “the most relaxed performance in the history of cinema.” He also said you told him, “Well, looks like you’re getting away with it on this one. I wouldn’t try that again because we’re kind of a forgiving group.” What do you remember about that exchange and the whole experience with him?",
            "Well, I guess that’s the gist of it, but I don’t think that’s exactly how that conversation sounded. I love Rob, and we’ve continued to be friends. In fact, his wife, Susan Downey, did a movie with me — we produced a movie together, and I just love her. She really is one of my best friends, so I do see him a lot and I’m so proud of him for everything that he is, always was and that he continues to be. He’s just a wonderful man. He’s kind. He’s a sprite. He has this crazy mind. He’s just an amazing person, and so talented.",
            "As I said to him then, and as I say to him now, “No matter what it was that you were going through, you never disappointed me. And I have to be clear about that, even though you were killing yourself.” I was forever grateful for what he brought to that movie. He was 100% present, as far as I was concerned. He was there, and he brought a character that was rich and that was messed up and that was in pain and suffering. I think you could feel that underneath all of his bravado and his rapier wit. You could feel that, underneath, somebody was suffering. So yes, as the director, I can’t say I took advantage, but his pain is onscreen. In some ways, it was good for the movie.",
            "What I said to him on that particular day — and I’ve talked to him about this before — where he came to set and was speaking in tongues and I couldn’t understand a word he said, but he thought he was making sense? And then 20 minutes went by, and then suddenly he actually started speaking English? I shut down the set. I said, “You know what? We’re all going to go home. We’re on time, on schedule. In fact, we’re under schedule. We’re all going to go home. Robert? Come with me.” And I sat him down. He was making sense, and he was like, “Yeah? Hey. What’s going on? What’s up?” And I said, “So far, you are on a barstool, and you have managed to not fall off the barstool. It’s possible that you’re going to find a way to prop yourself up, whatever toothpicks it takes to prop yourself up. But I’m afraid for you. And now may not be the time, but I am afraid for you.” That’s the part he doesn’t remember. [His family] intervened at the end. The last day of shooting, we knew that it was coming. His family said, “We’re going to do an intervention on him after the shoot.” And they did. He’s had other interventions after that, but I did feel like that was his first step toward him really taking consciousness. We loved him. He was a member of the family, and the lovely Charles Durning really, like, sat him down and talked to him about where he was headed. He was supported. But it definitely was an odd time.",
            "I wonder if, on some small subconscious level — and this, I’m sure, is hard for you to speak to, or even for him to speak to — the specific blend of pain and humor that his character experiences eventually helped him through that moment when he was experiencing an intervention.",
            "I hope so. At the same time, it was his work to do. And he did really hard work. I mean, he really did the hard work. But obviously he had to fall off. He had to fall off the stool in order to really understand and grasp his sobriety. And that’s something that happened after us. But all I know is that we love him. He was really surrounded by people who cared about him.",
            "Also, as the director, I wanted what he was bringing to the table. Some people talk about that performance and say, “Wow, he’s so crazy in that movie, right?” There were some improvs in the movie. There’s one where he’s driving his sister. Dylan McDermott’s in the back seat, and [Downey Jr.] just keeps going off. He does this monologue where he’s describing what came out of his friend’s nose, and everybody’s getting grossed out and trying to get him to stop, but he can’t stop. He’s like, “This goobery this, and there was a ferret,” just all of these images. And he went on for five minutes.",
            "And it’s just a total improv?",
            "Totally improv. The only thing that I said to him is, “When you hit this particular mark, I want you to put on the brake and stop.” That was it. It’s one take. It goes for minutes and minutes and minutes, and he keeps talking about “the piss, the goop, and the this and the that and the ferret.” And then when he gets to the mark, he has to say something offensive to her that makes her go, “Oh, that’s it, I’m out.” And it all had to be timed. So this is the part that’s not Cassavetes, right? We never knew what he was going to say. He got to the part just before he had to slam on the brakes, and he said, “That looks like something that would have flown out of your uterus,” and at that, she’s like, “No, that’s it!” So he had this amazing ability to contribute this stream-of-consciousness insanity that was witty. I have no idea where he pulled these images from, but then also to be aware enough to stop on a dime, with a mark, I mean, that’s an amazing talent.",
            "The movie is crawling with good performances, and the MVP in my book is Anne Bancroft playing the melodramatic, chain-smoking, busybody mom. What was it like to direct someone of her stature in such an over-the-top role?",
            "I loved Anne so much. God I loved her. She’s just so amazing, because she looks so elegant. She’s this beautiful, elegant, statuesque woman, and yet she is really more like the character that she was playing. She’s mouthy and crazy, and so it was just wonderful to see her find that role, to really allow herself to explore that. You know, she loves wearing a wig, and she just loved all that stuff. But she also worked differently than a lot of the other actors. The thing about Anne is that she’s really meticulous, and she really wanted to know everything. She wanted to know every mark, every inflection. She wanted everything to be planned and prepared. And I love that about her, but I also wanted to loosen her up. I wanted to let her be off guard.",
            "I’m usually somebody who plans a lot, and with Anne, I kind of pretended that I didn’t know. So she’d ask me very specific questions like, “Where is it going to be? And when am I going to do this? And when am I going to do that?” And I’d be like, “I don’t know,” just to kind of destabilize her a little bit. And I think that that contributed to this kind of frenetic quality, of somebody who’s trying to keep it all together but nobody is participating in her plan.",
            "That’s an interesting technique as a director. How did she respond when you would just softly dismiss her questions?",
            "Well, it made her a little nutty, and I think it contributed to the character. I mean, I just adore her. We really adored each other. Everybody in the cast was amazing, including Claire Danes, who’s in there for all of five minutes. It was just such a good experience for her.",
            "You also have Geraldine Chaplin as the kooky, kind of pitiful aunt. Did folks pry her for stories about her father during the shoot?",
            "No, actually. There wasn’t a lot of that. And she’s had such a big life, such an amazing life. The cool thing about Geraldine in that movie is just that Geraldine couldn’t be more opposite than that character. Geraldine was young. I mean, I say she was young. Maybe 50. But she was playing a real kooky, perhaps-bordering-on-dementia, almost grandmother figure in some ways. It took a minute to get her wardrobe and stuff together. At first, we came with an idea of what she might look like. Then we did all of her wardrobe, and then we all looked at each other and we were like, “I don’t know, I don’t think that’s it.” And the costume designer completely redid hers, so we put a Jamaican Rasta hat on her.",
            "What kind of stuff was she wearing before?",
            "I think she was too grandmotherly or something. I think it allowed Geraldine to be much more of a dichotomy. It was just about refining, to make sure that she had lots of different things that almost didn’t go together.",
            "That’s an apt way to describe it. Is it true that you guys cooked 64 turkeys for the dinner scene?",
            "It is, and it’s also true that nobody eats in the dinner scene, which was crazy. It was something that I insisted on because I had this idea that the only Thanksgiving dinner that we would see eaten would be the one that was in the kitchen between Holly Hunter and Robert Downey Jr. To me, that was sort of important. Now, looking back and being 58 years old instead of 30, I wish I could smack myself a little bit and go, “Wait a minute! Why didn’t we get any shots of the dining room? Of mouths just eating the awful pieces of stuffing and turkey and things like that?” So, if there’s one thing that I would revisit about the film, I think it was that I wish that I hadn’t been so stuck in an idea and maybe gotten footage of people eating all those turkeys.",
            "What did you think of the movie’s reception? It just barely made its budget back at the box office, and it’s become much more appreciated over time. But on paper, it wasn’t a giant hit.",
            "Right. Well, look, as a director or even as an actor, I always say to myself, “I got to make a movie!” That in itself is a really, really rare reward. I think people don’t even realize how difficult it is to get a movie off the ground, and certainly to be able to say “I made a movie” is just such an honor. So, how much the movie made is really none of my business, I always say. The thing about the film was that because it was released by a major [studio] — by Paramount — I think there was some anticipation that it needed to be this big movie, but the truth of it is, it had always been a small family film. I never saw it as, “Oh, wow, we need to make hundreds of millions of dollars.” But I think we always knew it was a perennial. We always knew that it was a film that eventually people would buy on DVD, and we hoped that they would watch over and over again as time went on. So, as far as I’m concerned, that’s great.",
            "Hollywood makes so many movies with Halloween and Christmas sensibilities, but there really aren’t very many that are specifically about Thanksgiving. Often movies will pass through one Thanksgiving scene, but rarely is it the centerpiece of the film. Do you have any theories about why Thanksgiving isn’t a more common movie subject?",
            "Well, Thanksgiving isn’t an international movie subject, because they don’t have Thanksgiving in other places. It’s really just a domestic thing. But I love it, and it’s a big part of my life. We have a number of questions growing up as Americans. We think, first of all, “What the hell are we celebrating? What is Thanksgiving anyway?” It’s a total lie, right? And then, if you really prod people, they don’t even know what it represents. For most people, it’s really not about Indians and all of that. It’s really about a day where hundreds of thousands of people get on airplanes to go meet up with their family, and they only have very few days to do it. So it’s incredibly stressful, and it’s this enforced familial love.",
            "One of the reasons why I think that it wasn’t as commercially viable was that it was a movie for 30-year-olds. If you were older, I think you were annoyed and resentful that somebody would make fun of your treasured holiday. And if you were too young, if you were in your 20s, you couldn’t really relate to worrying about the meaning of life and whether your parents were getting old. it was a very specific relevance for me at that time, and for most people that saw it.",
            "I think you’re right about that. Does anything stand out from the last day of shooting, or maybe the wrap party, if you guys had one?",
            "Gosh, let me think. Oh, I remember our wrap party. And I remember dancing. One of the things that we did when the movie came out was I had rented a house on the beach. I had a Thanksgiving dinner made for all the cast, and that was really amazing. It was really cute because Robert brought his little boy.",
            "I don’t know about you, but for me, when I was younger, Thanksgiving was about having to go be with my family. But then I made my own family, and the first time that I had Thanksgiving alone with just my wife and my kids, and we were in New York, it was like the best Thanksgiving I’d ever had because I got to reinvent it. It’s like I got to mess up the tradition and say, “No, we’re going to do it my way.” We bought a whole bunch of things from Whole Foods, and we carted the Thanksgiving in the stroller and we brought it home. There’s something really special about making the tradition ours. I have a new lease on it. And so I understand older people who say, “Wait a minute. Why are you making this movie making fun of my holiday?”",
            "You didn’t direct another movie until “The Beaver” in 2011. Why such a long gap between the two?",
            "So many reasons. I wish I had directed more movies in those years. One, I acted a lot, but I also had two kids. And I couldn’t get stuff off the ground. I had “Flora Plum,” which I almost got off the ground. It was with Russell Crowe and Claire Danes. And two weeks before shooting, we got shut down because Russell had an accident. Then he couldn’t be in the movie because it’s about circus performers in the ’30s. And then we were going to get it recast, but then there was going to be a strike. Then it all fell apart. I wish I’d made more movies as a director in those years. I definitely kick myself about it. But I did a whole bunch of other things. But I was really hungry to be a director, and I just either couldn’t find the movies that were right or I couldn’t get them off the ground.",
            "We’re privileged to be able to say that this has started changing in the course of the past 10 years, but at the time, there weren’t many female directors. But was that less of a problem for you because you already had a foot in the industry?",
            "Well, I definitely had a leg up. People in the industry knew me. In some ways, I was a prodigal daughter. The old men who gave me my first opportunity were like my grandpas. They loved me, and they were like, “We know her. She can do it.” So, obviously I had an opportunity that lots of other women didn’t have, having been in the industry already. But look, I grew up in the film business where I never saw another woman. When I was growing up, sometimes there would be a script supervisor or maybe a hair or makeup person, but other than that? There were no other women ever on set. It’s changed a lot. The one area that didn’t change was directing. Directing, for all sorts of psychological reasons, was really the last frontier of sexism, really. And I really feel like we’re at a new point, and it’s exciting to see more new voices.",

But QAnon largely lost at the polls, with 26 of the 28 QAnon-backing Republicans (including three write-in candidates) facing defeat in the general election, many of them losing by 40% or 50% margins.",
            "Even with QAnon flaming out, one of the conspiracy cult’s most recognizable faces and loudest voices will be striding the halls of Congress next year: Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia. And Lauren Boebert, who didn’t get nearly as much pre-election publicity, pulled out an early-morning win in Colorado.",
            "The QAnon movement pushes an unhinged conspiracy theory that Democratic powerbrokers, media bigwigs and Hollywood elites are engaged in child trafficking and drink a chemical harvested from the blood of children they imprison in satanic torture dungeons. That so many QAnon candidates made it this far is a worrying sign of what might yet come. Thanks to social media, the movement continues to spread, and not just in America but around the world.",
            "Most of these candidates won primaries in congressional races that were not competitive for Republicans, and thus they did not face a powerful, party-backed candidate. Accordingly, they got blown out in the general election. Lauren Witzke, a Republican, was pummeled in her race for Senate in Delaware against Democratic incumbent Chris Coons. Witzke not only endorsed QAnon and publicly welcomed its followers into the GOP but also helped a crew of far-right political subversives try to embroil Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, in the conspiracy by smearing him with child abuse accusations.",
            "Shiva Ayyadurai was another pro-QAnon Republican Senate candidate who went down to defeat, in his case in Massachusetts. In September, Ayyadurai lost the GOP primary but launched a write-in campaign, for which he solicited QAnon support on Twitter. The far-right outreach mirrored Ayyadurai’s 2017 bid for Senate, when he asked notorious alt-right extremist and Holocaust denier Chuck Johnson to “do a massive air strike from multiple media outlets across the Alt-Right community (you, gateway pundit, Mike Cernovich, etc.)” to promote his candidacy, according to an email Ayyadurai sent Johnson that HuffPost obtained. Ayyadurai has also been photographed partying at an event organized by “Pizzagate” pusher Mike Cernovich alongside Jason Kessler, the white nationalist who organized the deadly Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, and Jeff Giesea, a white nationalist funder who has worked closely with Cernovich.",
            "But Greene, who appears to be a full-fledged far-right extremist, will be seated in the 117th Congress. A racist, anti-Semite and Islamophobe linked to white supremacists and anti-government militias, Greene cruised to victory in the general election, essentially running unopposed in Georgia’s heavily white, Republican and gerrymandered 14th District after her extremist followers terrified her opponent into dropping out of the race.",
            "The wealthy gun-toting Greene, who co-owns a construction company started by her father, received endorsements from ultraconservative Trump-aligned members of Congress such as Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) and Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) ― himself an associate of Holocaust deniers and far-right extremists. Greene was also embraced by President Donald Trump and took money from a political action committee connected to former Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), Trump’s chief of staff.",
            "She promoted her campaign by posting pictures of herself online holding an assault weapon, in one instance next to photos of Democratic Reps. Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Facebook considered the post an incitement to violence and took it down. Greene also talked about socialists and “cultural Marxists” tearing America apart. She said Black people should look at Confederate monuments as symbols of progress. She called George Soros, who is a Jewish Holocaust survivor, a Nazi collaborator.",
            "But it was her devotion to the amorphous ever-mutating glob of conspiracy theories known as QAnon, which Greene embraced in 2017, that received the most attention. QAnon is based on the belief that a prophetic government official known only as “Q” has inside knowledge about a secret “deep state” plot against Trump, who is revered as a god-like figure waging a holy war against his enemies.",
            "The movement started with Q leaving cryptic posts on neo-Nazi-infested internet message boards. It metastasized from there. Some QAnoners now think, for example, that a COVID-19 vaccine will be used for mind control. Or that the disease can be cured by drinking an industrial-strength wood pulp bleach.",
            "“QAnon really preys on people with mental health issues,” Travis View, a conspiracy theory researcher and the host of the “QAnon Anonymous” podcast, told HuffPost this summer.",

            "Accusations of child abuse have a long, gruesome ― and politically useful ― tradition in Western history to demonize out-groups and justify violence against their members. Since the Middle Ages, Jews have often been the target of “blood libel,” which refers to a notorious and false allegation that Jews murder Christian children and use their blood for baking Passover matzah or other nefarious purposes. Riddled with anti-Semitism, QAnon offers a bizarro world update of this ancient hatred. As Talia Lavin, a journalist who covers far-right extremism, explained in The New Republic in September, “The fixation on Soros — an echo of mainstream Republican claims that the Hungarian Jew is the potential orchestrator of a ‘coup’ and a perennial funder of political opposition ― is particularly hysterical and violent.”",
            "The FBI considers QAnon a potential domestic terrorism threat. Adherents of the conspiracy movement long for a Judgment Day-style authoritarian reckoning called “The Storm,” in which they fantasize the military will take out Trump’s foes, with deadly force if necessary. Until then, some have been taking matters into their own hands. QAnoners have staged an armored truck standoff at the Hoover Dam, stormed homeless camps with rifles in search of nonexistent sex traffickers, allegedly killed a Gambino family crime boss, allegedly tried to kidnap a child from protective custody and occupied a factory they suspected was a child trafficking hub. One cultist drove hundreds of miles armed with a bushel of knives and a plan to “take out” Joe Biden.",
            "Trump has refused to disavow QAnon, instead driving the conspiracy movement deeper into the fabric of the Republican Party. In the months leading up to the election, the president, his family members and his campaign proxies courted QAnon and the movement’s army of “digital soldiers” for electoral help. Just before Election Day, Fox News hosts and contributors and right-wing influencers on Twitter promoted a pro-Trump video created by a QAnon extremist.",
            "Greene didn’t need the boost. But Boebert, a Republican running for Congress in Colorado’s 3rd District who went up against Democrat Diane Mitsch Bush, a retired sociology professor and former state lawmaker, may have benefited from her party’s pro-QAnon spin in her win.",
            "In May, Boebert, a restaurateur and gun rights advocate, appeared on two online shows hosted by QAnon supporters and said that she was “very familiar” with the conspiracy movement and that she hoped it “is real.” If it is, she said, “then it can be really great for our country.”",

            "Scores of pickups bristling with “Make America great again” signs and flags swarmed the Biden bus caravan on a busy Texas interstate Friday. One of the trucks was videotaped colliding with a vehicle in the caravan to force it out of its lane. The campaign subsequently canceled events because of safety fears. Biden had not been on the campaign bus.",
            "Credit for the collision was posted on Eliazar Cisnernos’s Facebook page (which has since been deleted): “That was me slamming that fucker ... hell yea.”",
            "President Donald Trump has hailed the harassing drivers as “patriots.” Cisneros retweeted Trump’s message “I love Texas” over a video of the highway confrontation.",
            "The FBI has launched an investigation into the freeway intimidation.",
            "Later comments on Cisneros’s page said that he “reacted” to the other vehicle in the Trump train confrontation, and included a laughing emoji response to a commenter’s suggestion he get an “All Lives Splatter” sign showing a truck plowing through pedestrians.",
            "The posts on Cisneros’s Twitter account also included a sarcastic welcome to the campaign caravan after the collision on Twitter, offering “sausage, leg quarters ... and 35 in[ch] tires.”",

            "He told KENS5-TV then that he was driving around town “waving my flags and showing support for my president,” and wanted the protesters to “get off the street, get on the sidewalk.”",
            "He drove slowly, and no one was injured. Demonstrators yelled at him and accused him of putting their lives at risk.",
            "Cisneros could not be reached for comment. The FBI did not respond to a HuffPost request for comment on Cisneros.",
            "Cisneros was also featured in a local TV report in June patrolling the streets of San Antonio with an automatic weapon, saying he was trying to protect the city from protesters.",
            "Asked then when he would use his firearm, he told San Antonio’s WOAI-TV that he and his partner would “push” vandals off, but “once bricks start flying or being threatened with our lives, yeah.”"

            "Sir Thomas Sean Connery, the iconic Scottish actor and Hollywood legend who made a name for himself as the cinema’s first James Bond, has died at the age of 90, his publicist confirmed to HuffPost.",
            "Connery died in his sleep on Friday night, his family said.",
            "Before he was “Bond, James Bond,” Connery was just another kid in a working-class neighborhood in Fountainbridge, Scotland. Born on Aug. 25, 1930, to Joe and Euphamia Connery, “Tommy” ― as he was nicknamed ― spent his first years sleeping in a drawer, as his parents were unable to afford a crib.",
            "“My background was harsh,” Connery has acknowledged. “We were poor, but I never knew how poor till years after.”",
            "“It sounds strange to say it now,” he recalled in an interview with The Scottish Sun, “but we never realized we lacked anything!”",
            "His father worked at a nearby mill, and Connery began working at a young age to help support himself and his family. He began delivering milk at the age of 9 (incidentally, he picked up smoking at about the same age), toting bottles from house to house via horse-drawn cart. At the age of 13, as World War II raged, Connery dropped out of school to work full time and earn his keep at home.",
            "“From the time I started working at 13, I always paid my share of the rent, and the attitude at home was the prevalent one in Scotland ― you make your own bed and so you have to lie on it,” he said in a 1965 interview with Playboy. “I didn’t ask for advice and I didn’t get it. I had to make it on my own or not at all.”",
            "Connery joined the Royal Navy three years later, working as an armorer. Though he signed on for a seven-year stint in the navy, he was discharged after only three, sidelined due to a persistent stomach ulcer.",
            "Following his discharge from the navy, Connery scraped by doing random jobs, working stints as a bricklayer, lifeguard and coffin polisher. He also spent hours at the gym and posed as a nude model from time to time at the Edinburgh College of Art.",
            "Connery’s first acting job came only after his bodybuilding pursuits led him to a Mr. Universe competition in London in 1953. He placed third at the competition, and while there, a fellow bodybuilder mentioned auditions were being held for the play “South Pacific.”",
            "Despite having virtually no experience, Sean decided to go for it, and was awarded a small role.",
            "“I’d no experience whatever [at acting] and hadn’t even been on a stage before, but it turned out to be one of my more intelligent moves,” he told Playboy in 1965.",
            "In his new gig, Connery earned £12 a week playing Sergeant Waters, a member of the chorus. He’d lied about his acting abilities during the audition and immersed himself in literature to make up for his shortcomings, reading everything from George Bernard Shaw and Shakespeare to “War and Peace” and James Joyce.",
            "“I read them all,” Connery recalled in a later interview. “I went to the libraries in every town up and down Britain.” At the same time, he began reading aloud into a tape-recorder, playing the tapes back to himself in an attempt to refine his thick Scottish accent.",
            "“I loved him because he had this twinkle all the time … he’s a great, great character,” Millicent Martin, one of his co-stars in “South Pacific,” said. “The only thing was, nobody could understand a word Sean was saying.”",
            "Slowly, and with much hard work, Connery overcame the hurdles ― and his indecipherable accent. Following “South Pacific,” he picked up parts in “Another Time, Another Place” in 1958 and “Anna Christie” in 1957, where he met his first wife, Australian actress Diane Cilento, whom he married in 1962.",
            "The marriage ended in 1973, and Cilento later said he had been physically abusive. Connery once told Playboy he didn’t think “there is anything particularly wrong about hitting a woman.”",
            "Connery remarried in 1975 to Tunisian-born French artist Micheline Roquebrune, whom he’d met during a golf tournament in Morocco in 1970.",
            "In 1962, to the apparent surprise of both industry insiders and Connery himself, he earned the part of Secret Agent 007 in the film version of Ian Fleming’s 1958 novel, “Dr. No.” Although not the first Bond book, it was the first to be made into a movie.",
            "Many skeptics believed Connery had been miscast in the role (including Fleming himself, who described the Scotsman as more of “an overgrown stunt-man” than Bond material), a sentiment Connery didn’t go out of his way to dispute.",
            "“Before I got the part, I might have agreed with them,” he told Playboy. “If you had asked any casting director who would be the sort of man to cast as Bond, an Eton-bred Englishman, the last person into the box would have been me, a working-class Scotsman. And I didn’t particularly have the face for it; at 16, I looked 30.”",
            "Most of Fleming’s choices for the role were either too expensive (in the case of Cary Grant) or turned the part down; some believed the entire “James Bond” concept would flop and wasn’t worth the risk.",
            "But audiences said yes to “Dr. No.” Connery’s performance helped nurture a box-office hit, justifying the production of four more Bond films in quick succession, in which Connery played the suave, martini-loving British spy.",
            "In addition to 1962′s “Dr. No,” Connery starred in “From Russia with Love” (1963), “Goldfinger” (1964), “Thunderball” (1965), and “You Only Live Twice” (1967). After a brief hiatus, he returned for a role in “Diamonds are Forever” (1971) before retiring from the Bond series with “Never Say Never Again” (1983).",
            "Successful as the James Bond series had become, Connery was loathe to stay part of it for too long. He welcomed the paychecks, but didn’t want to become a commodity synonymous with the franchise ― especially as the series made increasingly more use of death-defying stunts.",
            "“There are a lot of things I did before Bond ― like playing the classics on stage ― that don’t seem to get publicized. So you see,” he told Playboy, “this Bond image is a problem in a way and a bit of a bore, but one has just got to live with it.”",
            "“I’m not into hardware, rockets and extraordinary guns that can blow 50 people away at once,” he told “Entertainment Tonight” in a 1995 interview. “I have no real interest in that, it’s what really got me out of the Bond films — they all went in the same direction. It’s a personal thing.”",
            "He had good reason: In addition to putting him through scenes that required he swim underwater with sharks, directors once strapped Connery to a table in “Goldfinger” for a hair-raising scene in which a “laser” nearly cut him in half.",
            "Lacking real lasers, a crew member armed with an acetylene torch crouched under the table to create a laser-like effect instead, stopping just three inches shy of cutting into the terrified actor’s groin.",
            "Once, he actually did get hurt. During preparations for “Never Say Never Again,” Connery recruited Steven Seagal to help him train for a scene involving martial arts. “I got a little cocky because I thought I knew what I was doing,” he told Jay Leno in 1996, “and he broke my wrist.”",
            "Following the Bond series, Connery played a master swordsman in “Highlander” and a Franciscan friar in “The Name of the Rose,” both released in 1986. A year later, Connery took on the affect of Jim Malone in the mobster thriller “The Untouchables,” for which he won both an Oscar and a Golden Globe for best supporting actor.",
            "Connery was nominated again for a Golden Globe in 1989, this time receiving a best supporting actor nod for his role as Professor Henry Jones in the classic “Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.” (Incidentally, that was the same year People Magazine deemed him the “sexiest man alive.” When he learned of the award, Connery quipped: “Well there aren’t many sexy dead men, are there?”)",
            "Just one year after Indiana Jones, Connery played an integral part in yet another instant classic, “The Hunt For Red October.” In the movie he portrayed a Soviet submarine captain named Marko Ramius who piloted a stealth submarine in a high-stakes game of nuclear-armed, Cold War-era chess with the U.S. Navy.",
            "His career continued with “Rising Sun” in 1993, “The Rock” in 1996, “Entrapment” in 1999, “Finding Forrester” in 2000, and “The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen” in 2003.",
            "During that time, Connery was also frequently lampooned on the repeating Saturday Night Live sketch “Celebrity Jeopardy,” where he was presented as a hilariously crude prankster by actor Darrell Hammond.",
            "Connery retired from acting after “The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,” a decision he stood by in a 2010 interview with the Scotsman after dealing with assorted health problems. Though directors flirted with the idea of asking Connery to play a role in the rebooted Bond movies featuring Daniel Craig, they ultimately decided against it.",
            "Despite his numerous achievements on the screen, Connery ― always fiercely, proudly Scottish ― said his biggest honor came in 1999, when he helped open the Scottish Parliament. Connery, who attended the ceremony in Edinburgh wearing full Highland dress, called it the “most important day of his life.”",
            "“Today is a momentous day for Scotland,” he told reporters. “We’ve waited 300 years for this, and it can’t be more momentous than that.”",
            "So deep was his love for Scotland that he reportedly was passed over for knighthood in 1997 due to British concerns over his nationalism. At the time, the BBC notes he’d been donating £4,800 a month to the Scottish National Party and supported an independent Scotland.",
            "Those concerns apparently abated. In July 2000 ― once again, wearing Highland dress ― Connery knelt before the Queen at a ceremony in Scotland and became “Sir Sean.”",
            "“It’s one of the proudest days of my life,” Connery said after the ceremony. “It means a great deal for it to happen in Scotland.”",
            "In April 2011, at the age of 80, Connery announced he’d decided to withdraw from making public appearances, telling The Scotsman he intended to spend more time on the golf course instead.",
            "True to his word, following the decision, Connery ventured into the public eye far less, though he did make a regular habit of attending the U.S. Open and accompanying Roquebrune out.",
            "Connery is survived by Roquebrune and by his sons Jason and Stephane.",
            "In 1996, during his acceptance speech for the Golden Globe lifetime achievement award, Connery reflected on his career and told the applauding audience:",
            "I’ve made a lot of films, some of which I’ve forgotten, and some of which I’ve tried to forget. But in the course of this strange thing we call a career, I’ve traveled to scores of exotic places, I’ve met many interesting people, kissed dozens of beautiful women, and have actually been very well paid for it, and I am most grateful."

            "“Even in our 20’s when we were on American Idol together I could tell that she’d had a challenging life, and that not that many people had been kind to her along the way,” Guarini wrote. “But I’ll never forget the day that her idol, Stevie Nicks, sent her flowers with a card that said, ‘You are the Gypsy that I was. ...’ Nikki was on cloud nine and the joy and excitement that radiated from her was infectious.”",

            "The massive taxpayer-funded collection of news outlets under the U.S. Agency for Global Media is supposed to be a nonpartisan booster of information and American ideals abroad. But over the past six months, President Donald Trump’s handpicked leader, Michael Pack, has dramatically reshaped the agency — to promote not news or democracy but the president himself.",
            "Pack announced last week that he was “rescinding” the firewall between the agency’s political leaders and its newsrooms. The agency employs hundreds of journalists who work for Voice of America, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, the Middle East Broadcasting Networks, Radio Free Asia, the Office of Cuba Broadcasting and other organizations.",
            "Many correspondents are among the few sources of reliable news for people living in the world’s most repressive societies, places where press freedom is a dream and rulers rarely face real public scrutiny.",
            "Now Trump and his appointee want to make their work more vulnerable to political whims.",
            "Pack argued in a statement Monday that he should be able to take actions such as blocking stories to check what he views as “biased reporting.” The result is that an $800 million dollar news operation with major influence on global opinion is in disarray and vulnerable to exploitation just ahead of a presidential election that Trump is already undermining with unfounded allegations of fraud and corruption.",
            "For a president who is clear that he doesn’t see winning the most votes or even counting all of them as his path to reelection, the biggest priority over the next week is messaging: Persuading people that any outcome in which he does not win is illegitimate.",
            "The agency is not permitted to target Americans with its journalism. But it can help shape the international conversation about the likely election chaos in the U.S., affecting the calculus of foreign officials and governments that Trump administration officials said the president is counting on to help him retain power.",
            "The Republican-held Senate confirmed Pack — a conservative filmmaker who once railed against liberal “indoctrination” on campuses — to head the agency in June, soon after Trump and the White House began publicly berating VOA for not hewing to the administration’s line that the devastating effects of the coronavirus were due to China and not Trump’s own failed strategy.",
            "Since then, Pack’s team has accused a longtime correspondent of anti-Trump bias and ousted veteran officials while hiring people such as a former conservative radio host who once called House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) a Nazi.",
            "Other agency leaders pushed editors to highlight damage caused by Black Lives Matter protests and told reporters that Twitter behavior disparaging the president could harm their jobs.",
            "Pack’s aides dug around in trash cans for signs of employees’ disloyalty, ran content promoting Ivanka Trump and Vice President Mike Pence and denied visa renewals to dozens of foreign journalists.",
            "It would be very difficult for the president to convert a taxpayer-funded news outlet entirely into Radio Trump without congressional approval. But lawmakers, experts and journalists themselves are terrified about the damage Pack could do to the agency’s professionalism and credibility ― both in the post-election period and in the long run, even if he is ultimately removed by a President Joe Biden next year.",
            "Pack has already signaled one of his priorities is not original reporting but the renewal of VOA editorials, the part of USAGM that is intended to directly communicate the views of the U.S. government. In recent months, these editorials have put an enormous emphasis on religious liberty above other human rights issues.",
            "Meanwhile, BBGWatch, a website run by current and former USAGM staff, has become increasingly aggressive in pushing a pro-Trump line.",
            "The attempted removal of the firewall suggested that even broader changes lie ahead, putting journalists on edge as they wonder if the future will involve restrictions on their reporting.",
            "“The action seems to send a very clear message to the newsroom,” said an employee with a USAGM-supported network who spoke to HuffPost on condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution. “Fall in line or else.”",
            "A USAGM spokesperson denied that Pack aimed to instill political loyalty to Trump or to promote propaganda.",
            "“When [Pack] served at the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, he sought to bring objectivity and balance to its programming. He fully intends to do the same with USAGM’s networks in order to ensure that they adhere to their mission statements and maintain their professional journalistic standards and principles,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to HuffPost.",
            "Pack’s shake-up has chilling parallels in other nations. For hard-right political forces worldwide, a top goal is reshaping independent media organizations to amplify their own message and reduce the risk of reporting that can challenge their power. In Poland, for instance, the ruling Law and Justice party quickly turned the country’s state media into a mouthpiece that now spreads disinformation and targets party enemies.",
            "“If USAGM becomes sort of Fox [News] international, which I fear it will, or a sort of [Steve] Bannon news on steroids, then basically we will have replicated the information space that we tried to resist in Eastern Europe,” said Jay Tolson, a former news director for Radio Free Europe.",

            "Trump nominated Pack in June 2018. But top Democrats and a handful of Republicans held up his confirmation in the Senate over concerns that he would harm the agency.",
            "Pack rejected offers to be briefed by existing leaders at the agency and by outside analysts of its work, such as Martha Bayles, a Boston College expert on American public diplomacy who has known him for years.",
            "“When he was first nominated, … I felt relieved,” Bayles later wrote in The American Interest. She now sees the beginnings of “a nightmare.”",
            "Right-wing activists pressured the Senate to move Pack forward, particularly after former agency chief John Lansing left the post last September. They argued the president’s nominee deserved a vote and that a new leader was needed to clean up the agency, which they believed too often took what they viewed as the liberal bent of mainstream media and was vulnerable to foreign influence.",
            "Pack and his supporters received an unexpected boost this spring when Trump began alleging that the VOA was unfair to the U.S. and overly sympathetic to Beijing, picking up a complaint that his former adviser Bannon, a long-time Pack associate, had promoted for years.",
            "The White House on April 10 issued a statement claiming the agency “spends your money to promote foreign propaganda,” citing its coverage of a Chinese light show to celebrate the end of the coronavirus-related lockdown in Wuhan. Days later, the president called the agency out during a briefing on the pandemic: “What things they say are disgusting toward our country,” Trump said.",
            "By the end of the month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told employees to ignore interview requests from VOA because of the White House’s view of the agency, according to an email later obtained and published by the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University.",
            "Faced with clear intent to challenge USAGM’s journalistic independence, Pack and his supporters avoided challenging Trump and instead saw an opportunity.",
            "“It was unusual when the president sort of expressed his views on VOA in a press conference,” said Katrina Lantos Swett of the Lantos Foundation, a longtime human rights advocate who is one of the few Washington establishment figures to welcome Pack. “I think that certainly raised the profile of the quieter battle that was going on, and it may have had an impact in sort of coalescing Republican votes.”",
            "A USAGM spokesperson told HuffPost that Pack found Trump’s remark “absolutely appropriate, for he is also firmly on the side of reform.”",
            "In early May, Trump personally called Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky to tell him pushing Pack through was a priority. The Senate approved him 58-38 on June 4 ― as Pack’s opponents noted that he was under investigation by the District of Columbia attorney general over allegations he had illegally funded his private film company with nonprofit donor funds. (That probe is ongoing.)",
            "Pack’s installation caused immediate turmoil at USAGM. Within days, the agency’s various branches were left rudderless, as some leaders resigned and Pack fired four others, including two Republicans nominated by Trump. By the following month, both parties were raising the alarm.",
            "“Regardless of the issues at [the agency] that might be addressed during your tenure, the credibility and independence of these networks, as required by law, is critical for audiences overseas living under repressive regimes, the network’s brave journalists who often come under threat for their work, and the future of U.S. broadcasting,” seven senators, four of them Republicans, wrote in a letter to Pack in July. “As the United States faces global challenges, … it cannot afford to invest in an enterprise that denigrates its own journalists and staff to the satisfaction of dictators and despots, nor can it be one that fails to live up to its promise of providing access to a free and independent press.”",
            "After The Massacre",
            "Pack’s mass firing, dubbed a “Wednesday night massacre” by a former official, was the first sign the agency’s leader might have a darker agenda ― that he wasn’t incompetent or uncertain but rather committed to dramatic and potentially dangerous changes.",
            "“The radios certainly have their problems. This is not the way to fix them. This is going to do exactly the opposite,” said Gregory Feifer, a former senior correspondent for Radio Free Europe.",
            "Other worrying signs about Pack piled up quickly.",
            "In one of his few interviews after taking office, with the conspiratorial pro-Trump newspaper Epoch Times, Pack warned that he had other employees in his sights. “Obviously, there are some bad actors who need to be pushed aside,” he said. Elsewhere, he parroted Trump’s depiction of America’s bureaucracy as a self-interested, anti-democratic “deep state” and praised Bannon, who sought “the deconstruction of the administrative state.”",
            "Bannon began publicly boasting that Pack would “clean house” at the agency and redirect it to echo Trump’s narrative about the evils of China. The two men worked together during Pack’s time making documentaries ― a period in which he was clear that ideology guided his work.",
            "With regard to Pack’s most recent production for PBS, a documentary on conservative Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, a watchdog for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting determined that he violated the government-funded organization’s standards by featuring only Thomas’ view of his controversial career without seeking additional perspectives or opposing opinions. (The USAGM spokesperson declined to respond to that claim, instead citing praise for Pack’s work by outlets such as The New York Times.)",
            "“A little morsel” like the Bannon link should not be seen as the sum total of someone like Pack, Swett told HuffPost. “I know that he is eager to sort of mend fences and reassure those who have expressed concerns. … His background is probably quite a bit broader and much less sort of ideological than perhaps some of the coverage would indicate.”",
            "But a New York Post op-ed in which Pack described his goals focused on the go-to grievances of Trump’s Republican Party rather than outreach to skeptics. He criticized the reaction to his mass firing of agency heads as “over the top,” accused his critics of McCarthyism for noting his connection to Bannon and argued his firing of Republicans showed he was not biased.",
            "“Powerful forces were and remain deeply committed to the status quo at the agency I now lead,” Pack wrote.",
            "Pack has continued to signal that he sees the White House as a far more important constituency than his own staff or audience. He’s fixated on efforts to identify and publicize apparent anti-Trump bias among employees, such as probing employees who produced a video Pack’s team considered pro-Biden and investigating VOA White House correspondent Steve Herman, who was already threatened by Vice President Mike Pence’s staff before Pack took over the agency.",
            "“He’s trying to find one incident and examples he can show that he is improving the content,” a person familiar with the Biden video incident told Politico.",
            "Pack’s open challenge to the firewall between political leaders and journalists is the most alarming development yet.",
            "“It is unclear why CEO Pack is opposed to journalistic objectivity,” Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said the next day. “Fortunately, the requirement that [the agency’s] broadcasts be objective and conform with the highest professional standards in broadcast journalism is mandated in statute. Mr. Pack may be able to repeal a regulation, but he cannot repeal the law.”",
            "‘Hard Days’",
            "For agency staff with far less power and few ways to respond to Pack’s allegations, the past few months have been nightmarish.",
            "“These are hard days, depressing days. … It’s not a comfortable environment because you don’t know what is next,” said a journalist at Voice of America, one of the outlets now under Pack’s purview, who requested anonymity to protect their position.",
            "A person with knowledge of internal conversations among managers at the agency told HuffPost they have “no indication” of Pack’s plans for permanent new leaders for the news outlets. (“These positions are a priority, and a comprehensive search is underway to find the most qualified individuals to lead these important networks and grantees,” a USAGM spokesperson told HuffPost.)",
            "Pack’s denial of visa renewals for reporters has been especially wrenching, prompting a letter from high-profile agency employees. He’s carried out the policy anyway, causing at least 15 journalists to prepare to leave the U.S. already.",
            "He justified his decision not to renew visas for VOA journalists by suggesting there are security lapses in the vetting process for them while refusing to provide additional details or examples.",
            "But at a House of Representatives hearing on Sept. 24, former agency figures told lawmakers that Pack cut off visas for dozens of journalists to match Trump’s hard line on immigration.",
            "By publicly suggesting that those U.S. government employees could be foreign spies posing as reporters, Pack was “basically writing a press release” that autocrats such as Russia’s Vladimir Putin could use to harm journalists, said Jamie Fly, a former adviser to GOP Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who ran the agency’s Radio Free Europe arm before Pack fired him via email days after entering the job.",
            "Pack skipped the hearing, defying a congressional subpoena.",
            "Denying visa renewals is a life-and-death proposition: Sometimes just associating with the media agencies is enough for reporters or their family members to be targeted, former officials told HuffPost. Staff members have previously been abducted from their homes or detained while visiting relatives, the former officials said.",
            "“Anybody who knows any of these organizations knows dozens and dozens of examples like that,” said Jeffrey Gedmin, a former president of RFE/RL. “We owe these journalists our support and our appreciation and our loyalty. They’re not pieces of an auto engine being manufactured in a plant. They’re human beings.”",
            "Dangerous Implications",
            "Some of USAGM’s problems predate Pack. Many experts and agency staff members question a move by a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers and then-President Barack Obama in 2016 to centralize a significant amount of power in the CEO position Pack now holds. Having authority delegated was helpful, and policymakers opted for an easy apparent fix instead of understanding systemic problems in agency morale and operations, they believed.",
            "“You really need to meet the kind of people who are working for the system ― there are bad ones but there are a lot of good ones ― and not just stay in Washington and feed off of the very narrow and rather misguided debate that occurs,” said Bayles, the scholar, who opposed the CEO change. Officials at the agency told HuffPost that no matter who was elected in 2016, the risk to their work would have been higher than before.",
            "A Voice of America employee told HuffPost that Pack was correct to note unhappiness among agency staff, saying that under past leadership, “there was a wall ― you were in the same building but very hard to reach.”",
            "The employee requested anonymity to avoid retribution.",
            "That hasn’t improved under Pack, however. Instead, agency employees are under tight scrutiny and anxious about holding onto their jobs as they wonder what the CEO may institute next.",
            "“One thing for Mr. Pack is to listen to [journalists] and give them the opportunity to express themselves on … how to improve. That would be my humble suggestion,” the VOA employee said.",
            "Asked about Pack’s effect on his staffers’ spirits, the USAGM spokesperson said, “Every action that he takes, as he has said previously, is intended to improve not only USAGM’s reputation and effectiveness but also employee morale.”",
            "In addition to raising alarm among staff, some of Pack’s moves have put the agency in legal jeopardy.",
            "Last month, a District of Columbia judge declared that Pack broke the law when he took control of the Open Technology Fund, an offshoot of Radio Free Asia that works on internet freedom tools for people in autocratic societies, and fired its bipartisan board.",
            "The State Department’s inspector general and congressional committees are investigating a whistleblower report from six former top officials that claims Pack illegally tried to divert funds and check agency employees’ voting histories.",
            "And Pack’s changes may hurt USAGM outlets’ standing with social media platforms and foreign governments deciding whether to add a label to them that indicates they are affiliated with the U.S. government. These agencies have largely resisted such designations in the past, but a change in perception or structure could give an opening to those who want to delegitimize independent reporting. Russia’s federal communications agency has already introduced a draft order that would demand RFE/RL and VOA list themselves as “foreign agents” at the start of every report.",
            "Another concern is that Pack may simply downsize the agencies’ mission and personnel in the name of efficiency or removing red tape, weakening their ability to operate and provide news coverage.",
            "This could undo decades of work bolstering the reputation of the agencies as trusted sources of political developments in the U.S. and other nations.",
            "Supporters of USAGM like to compare the agencies to the British Broadcasting Corporation, but they worry that if their credibility is dismantled, they may instead resemble the Kremlin-owned outlet RT.",
            "“It shouldn’t be turned into a government mouthpiece,” the VOA journalist told HuffPost."

            "The verdict was returned at the High Court on Monday, after a three-week trial in July, during which Depp and Heard both gave evidence.",
            "In his ruling, Mr. Justice Nicol dismissed the “Pirates Of The Caribbean” star’s claim, saying NGN had proved what was in the article to be “substantially true.”",

            "During the case — which has been referred to as the biggest English libel trial of the 21st century — the court heard evidence from Depp and Heard, along with friends and relatives of the couple, and several former and current employees.",

        "articleContent": [
            "For the past several years, pundits who forecast the Oscar race have scanned their crystal balls and attempted to divine the number of Netflix exclusives likely to collect Best Picture nods. So far, three movies have succeeded: “Roma” in 2019, then “Marriage Story” and “The Irishman” in 2020. None won, but their inclusion signaled that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences had overcome the reluctance it once showed in granting streaming titles the same dignity afforded to theatrical releases. In fact, when the most recent round of nominations was announced in January, Netflix earned more than any old-school studio.",
            "The trend continues. Immediately after “Mank,” a dense biopic about “Citizen Kane” scribe Herman Mankiewicz, screened for press virtually on Thursday, The New York Times pondered whether it’s destined to be “Netflix’s first Best Picture winner.” Deadline said, “We can thank ‘Mank’ for just igniting this year’s weird Oscar race.”",
            "It was always inevitable that Netflix’s awards tally would tick upward. The same goes for Hulu, Amazon and their myriad competitors. With Hollywood’s traditional studios prioritizing big-budget franchises that don’t appeal to prestige sensibilities, streaming platforms are becoming go-to vessels for the original, star-driven films that attract Oscar esteem.",
            "Still, I don’t think many anticipated the swift ascent these companies will see as the current derby unfolds. When the nominations are announced on March 15, there’s a decent chance that more than half of the available slots will belong to streaming services.",
            "At first glance, maybe we can attribute that shift to the ongoing pandemic, which has delayed many movies until at least 2021 in hopes that multiplexes can function without COVID-19 restrictions. Academy Award bylaws normally require a one-week commercial theatrical run for a film to qualify, meaning Netflix had to secure exhibition from independent venues. But because of the pandemic, the academy has temporarily deemed streaming exclusives eligible without a big-screen bow. (As of now, that stipulation is set to expire when theaters across the country reopen.)",
            "While it’s true there have been fewer theatrical releases during this highly abnormal season, streaming outlets were already bankrolling plenty of top-tier contenders before any bylaws got amended. Despite what the coronavirus has wrought, Netflix and its ilk were almost guaranteed to make off with more nominations than ever before. Even newcomers like Apple TV+ and Disney+ have ponies in the race.",
            "Netflix boasts five indisputable Best Picture candidates, each with a starry cast and a celebrated director: David Fincher’s aforementioned “Mank,” Aaron Sorkin’s “The Trial of the Chicago 7,” Spike Lee’s “Da 5 Bloods,” George C. Wolfe’s “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom” and Ron Howard’s “Hillbilly Elegy.”",
            "The streaming service could collect additional accolades for the relationship weeper “Pieces of a Woman” (featuring Vanessa Kirby, Shia LaBeouf and Ellen Burstyn), the immigrant drama “The Life Ahead” (Sophia Loren), the sugary Broadway adaptation “The Prom” (Meryl Streep and Nicole Kidman) and the arty psychodrama “I’m Thinking of Ending Things” (Jessie Buckley, Toni Collette and a script by “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind” champ Charlie Kaufman). Sight unseen, it’s unclear whether “The Midnight Sky” — an apocalyptic sci-fi thriller directed by and starring George Clooney — is a viable Oscar player or more of a “Bird Box”-style crowd-pleaser.",
            "Netflix first proved its Oscar bona fides in the documentary field, garnering its inaugural nomination for 2013’s “The Square,” a chronicle of Egypt’s sociopolitical uprising. (This year, “Crip Camp: A Disability Revolution,” “Dick Johnson Is Dead” and “Athlete A” are poised to keep Netflix’s documentary momentum alive.) Throughout the early 2010s, common wisdom within the industry suggested that academy voters were unwilling to glorify Netflix — an ever-growing threat to the theatrical marketplace — in the prestigious acting, directing, and screenplay categories, and especially not Best Picture.",
            "With time, what seemed like a long road to parity became more like a short turnpike. Netflix found creative ways to give its movies brief theatrical stints, and its rivals followed suit. Netflix hired experienced awards-season publicists to steer multimillion-dollar campaigns. Hulu did the same. In 2018, the World War II-era racial drama “Mudbound” cracked Best Supporting Actress and Best Adapted Screenplay, confirming that a new era had begun. The following year, the sensitive black-and-white memoir “Roma” made the Best Picture roster despite a contentious rollout; its beloved maestro, Alfonso Cuarón, won Best Director. More recently, Netflix notched the ultimate distribution workaround by purchasing famed theaters in New York City and Los Angeles.",
            "Come March, Netflix may monopolize the Best Picture shortlist, which contains between five and 10 nominees.",
            "At least one other slot will almost surely belong to Regina King’s well-received directorial debut “One Night in Miami,” which Amazon Studios acquired back in July. Bursting with historical import, “Miami” depicts the friendship among Malcolm X (portrayed by Kingsley Ben-Adir), Sam Cooke (Leslie Odom Jr.), Cassius Clay (Eli Goree) and Jim Brown (Aldis Hodge) as the quartet convene on an evening in 1964.",
            "Additional Amazon contenders include “Borat Subsequent Moviefilm,” the Rachel Brosnahan crime caper “I’m Your Woman,” the political documentary “All In: The Fight for Democracy” and the poignant prison-system documentary “Time.” Riz Ahmed could land a Best Actor nod for his committed performance as a sober drummer losing his hearing in “Sound of Metal,” which Amazon acquired at last year’s Toronto International Film Festival.",
            "Hulu, meanwhile, has the popular “Groundhog Day” riff “Palm Springs,” which might hit a home run at the Golden Globes and in the Oscars’ comedy-friendly screenplay province. “I Am Greta,” a forthcoming profile of the young climate-change activist Greta Thunberg, seems like an obvious challenger in the stacked Best Documentary Feature contest.",
            "Chatter about the streaming ascendance has, in previous years, focused on Hulu, Amazon and Netflix, but we now have more sources to take into account. Disney+, which is less than a year old, announced in October that Pixar’s “Soul” will forgo domestic theaters and premiere digitally on Christmas Day. That’s a big deal, given Pixar’s impressive track record at the box office. “Soul” would mark the animation subsidiary’s third Best Picture nomination (the others are “Up” and “Toy Story 3”) and lend Disney+ significant awards-season credentials right out the gate.",
            "Apple TV+, which also launched last year, has “On the Rocks,” one of the first films in its partnership with trendy indie studio A24. The melancholic father-daughter comedy could earn nods for Bill Murray and writer/director Sofia Coppola, whose 2003 gem “Lost in Translation” won her Best Original Screenplay. That same corporate partnership also resulted in the masterful documentary “Boys State,” acquired for a hefty sum at Sundance in January.",
            "Even HBO Max, launched in May, could crack the nominations thanks to “On the Record,” a controversial exposé about hip-hop impresario Russell Simmons’ alleged sexual misconduct that other companies opted not to purchase after its Sundance premiere.",
            "All told, streaming services’ inroads in the Oscar ecosystem set a precedent that’s likely to linger after theaters resume business as usual. Returning to our non-coronavirus normal isn’t imminent, and this is one of many “new normals” that will inform the future awaiting us on the other side.",
            "An industry accustomed to debating the health of the theatrical business model will now face a season dominated by the disruptors it once protested. There are, of course, traditional pacesetters in the conversation, too, namely Searchlight Pictures’ “Nomadland,” Sony Pictures Classics’ “The Father” and “French Exit,” A24’s “Minari,” Focus Features’ “Promising Young Woman” and “Never Rarely Sometimes Always,” and Warner Bros.’ “Tenet.” But going forward, the academy will have a harder time limiting the streaming proliferation as more and more consumers associate these newer platforms with distinguished entertainment. What was once a question mark is now a reality."

            "If you’re a frequent shopper at one of CVS’s 10,000 U.S. locations, you’re familiar with the extended whine of the cash register as it spews out a seemingly endless scroll consisting mainly of coupons. People use the Twitter hashtag #CVSreceipts to post pictures holding up receipts as tall as they are after buying one or two items from the store. Late night host Jimmy Kimmel obsesses about CVS receipts on his show and once asked President Barack Obama to do something about them.",
            "The average CVS receipt is 2.5 feet long, according to research from the environmental nonprofit Green America — and many stretch more than 5 or 6 feet. Most end up in the trash.",
            "In 2017 Green America launched its Skip the Slip campaign to pressure retailers to reduce waste from paper receipts. CVS quickly emerged as a key target.",
            "“There were already a lot of folks really eager to see CVS take action to reduce its waste from thermal paper because its receipts were so, for lack of a better term, meme-worthy,” said Beth Porter, Green America’s climate and recycling director.",
            "Thousands signed a petition urging CVS to do something about its wasteful receipts, and the company agreed to work with Green America on a plan.",
            "CVS says it shortened the length of its receipts and enrolled more than 1 million people in its digital receipt program last year by prompting customers to opt in at checkout and encouraging online signups. As a result, the company saved 48 million yards of receipt paper. That’s about 27,000 miles. The circumference of the Earth is 25,000 miles.",
            "Though receipts represent less than 1% of the paper used in the U.S., the environmental cost is far from negligible. Green America estimates that 3 million trees and nearly 9 billion gallons of water are used to make receipts every year in this country, and the process emits as much greenhouse gas as 400,000 cars. All for scraps of paper that people often throw out or lose almost immediately.",
            "Most receipt printers use heat instead of ink, which requires paper with a heat-sensitive thermal coating. That vast majority of the time, this coating is made with bisphenol A (BPA) or bisphenol S (BPS), two chemicals commonly found in plastic, which are known endocrine disruptors. While there’s a lack of conclusive data on how these chemicals affect human health, animal studies show that BPA can impact fertility and neural development and increase the risk of some cancers. BPS is used as an alternative to BPA, but research suggests it has the same hazardous potential.",
            "People are exposed to BPA from countless sources every day; research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has found that 93% of people have traces of the chemical in their urine. It can leach from food containers into food, which is why many plastic bottles are marketed as BPA-free and manufacturers are barred from using BPA in baby bottles. It can also rub off on your fingers when you handle receipts. For most people that’s just one of who-knows-how-many minor exposures — but people who work in retail handing out receipts all day may have 30% more BPA in their systems. The European Union banned BPA in thermal paper at the start of this year.",
            "The presence of BPA and BPS in receipts also complicates recycling. Technically, thermal paper receipts — with their telltale sheen of coating — are recyclable just like any other paper. But because of the bisphenol content, many cities consider the shiny strips contaminants in the recycling stream.",
            "The majority of BPA and BPS is washed off in the paper recycling process, but small amounts remain in the fibers that are then used to make recycled-paper products, such as toilet paper. The rest ends up in wastewater, and it’s unclear how much is filtered out and how the remainder might impact the environment.",
            "Getting companies to stop using BPA and BPS in their receipts is one of Green America’s goals. There are phenol-free thermal papers, but many companies haven’t gone through the process of finding new suppliers and switching. (The paper can be more expensive, too.)",
            "“From our perspective, with so many available alternatives to BPA and BPS receipts, we think it’s far better to err on the side of caution to prevent that potential exposure to employees during the handling of receipts, and of course any environmental impacts from the disposal process,” said Porter.",
            "CVS removed BPS from its receipts last year, “to increase their recyclability,” a company spokesperson said.",
            "But it also makes sense to just not print so many receipts in the first place. That can be achieved by store associates simply asking customers if they want one, and by offering digital receipts. Not everyone is into digital receipts, though. When Green America surveyed consumers, 89% said it would be good for stores to offer receipts via email or app, but 42% said they prefer paper receipts. Many don’t want to give out their email addresses, for instance, or deal with receipts in their inbox. A third of people said they want a paper receipt in case they are stopped by store security.",
            "The pandemic — during which touching anything in a public space feels, for many, at best icky and at worst dangerous — may be helping move things in a digital direction. Citing analysis from Grand View Research, Green America says companies are projected to use 252,000 tons of thermal paper by the end of 2020, a decrease of 10% from the year before.",
            "Of the 35 companies Green America has been tracking, CVS is one of only five that offer both BPA- and BPS-free receipts and digital receipt options. (Others include Ben & Jerry’s and Target.) Fifteen companies — Walgreens, Burger King, Aldi and Chipotle among them — offer neither.",
            "The organization is talking to several of the companies on its receipt practices scorecard about switching papers and going digital, as well as other ways to lessen their environmental footprint — such as using recycled paper in marketing materials and cutting down on paper use overall.",
            "“Skip the Slip has really been an opportunity to not only tackle the unnecessary waste of resources on these items that many people are no longer finding much use for, but also to talk about other areas of a company’s impacts,” said Porter.",
            "Thousands of miles of receipts down. Many more to go.",

            "Four years ago, Donald Trump fashioned himself a president for union workers. But once he occupied the White House, Trump only made life harder for organized labor ― through the Supreme Court, through the National Labor Relations Board and through executive orders.",
            "With former Vice President Joe Biden leading Trump in polls in the final days of the race, unions are phone-banking and canvassing hard in hopes of putting a Democrat back in the White House. There are many things a Biden administration could do to help reverse the downward trajectory of labor unions in the U.S., especially as the pandemic makes clear how little leverage most Americans have over their working conditions.",
            "How much influence Biden could have depends on who controls the Senate, and whether the filibuster limits what they can do via legislation. But even if Republicans remain in control of the upper chamber, Biden could reshape the landscape for labor organizing and strengthen his party’s political base in the process.",
            "A More Labor-Friendly NLRB",
            "One big step a Biden administration could take is reshaping the National Labor Relations Board to the benefit of workers rather than employers.",
            "The five-member NLRB referees disputes between unions and corporations, and the GOP majority Trump installed has routinely ruled in favor of the latter. They have made it harder for certain workers to join unions and bargain collectively in the workplace, from fast-food restaurants to university campuses.",
            "One of the first steps the Trump-shaped NLRB took was to undo worker-friendly reforms made during the Obama administration, such as streamlining union elections so that employers have less time to interfere. The GOP-led board drew plaudits from employer groups and lawsuits from unions.",
            "Board members serve five-year terms and must be approved by the Senate; there is currently one vacancy, leaving a 3-1 Republican majority. A President Biden could flip the board to Democratic control within his first term, and his appointees could reverse the corporate-friendly precedents of the Trump era. They could also go back further if they chose to. Unions would have much less to fear in taking their quarrels with employers before the board.",
            "Still, worker-friendly boards under previous Democratic presidents have done little to stop the shrinking footprint of organized labor. The union membership rate in the U.S. has fallen steadily for decades; now a mere 1 in 10 workers belongs to a labor union, the lowest share since the Labor Department started tracking it in 1983. And besides, a subsequent Republican-led board can easily undo the rulings that help more workers unionize.",
            "The Power Of The Federal Purse",
            "Labor leaders say a Biden administration would have to do more than Democratic presidents have done in the past, including Biden’s old boss, Barack Obama, to give workers a greater voice in their workplaces.",
            "One powerful tool at the president’s disposal is federal procurement. Companies that contract with the government have to abide by certain rules if they want to keep government business. Obama used executive orders to raise working standards and the minimum wage among federal contractors. But he did so well into his second term, and as soon as Trump won, Republicans were able to use procedural maneuvers to undo some of that work.",
            "The new president could help unions by requiring employers who accept federal dollars to stay neutral in union campaigns. Such a stipulation would infuriate Republicans and business groups, and make it more likely certain workers would unionize. Biden could do such moves unilaterally.",
            "“Biden does not have to wait,” said Joseph Geevarghese, executive director of Our Revolution, the progressive political group that grew out of Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-Vt.) 2016 presidential run. “We don’t have to fix the filibuster for him to be bold on this issue.”",
            "Mary Kay Henry, president of the Service Employees International Union, said she believes states accepting federal money should have to allow collective bargaining to state-funded home-care workers, for example. That could grow union representation in red states that have resisted the concept.",
            "“That’s a way to change the system,” Henry said. “We can make it easier for workers to join together and bargain.”",
            "Henry acknowledged that the Obama-Biden team was slow to embrace the idea of using procurement power to affect workplaces, but she’s confident a Biden administration would move more quickly this time.",
            "“It took too long in that previous administration to figure it out,” she said. “And now that they figured it out, it’s much easier to imagine getting it done.”",
            "Although Trump made changing U.S. trade policy a hallmark of his 2016 candidacy, his tenure has done little to revive U.S. manufacturing and bring jobs that were offshored back to the country. Owen Herrnstadt, chief of staff to the president of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, said Trump has been fixated on tariffs and lacks a broader vision for stemming the loss of jobs to other countries.",
            "Herrnstadt’s union represents workers at manufacturers like Boeing and Harley-Davidson. Even though Biden has supported the kind of trade deals that unions have opposed in the past, Herrnstadt said there’s a lot to like in Biden’s manufacturing plan, like his proposal to eliminate tax incentives that unions say encourage sending jobs overseas.",
            "“What’s refreshing about the Biden manufacturing plan is that it realizes this is something that calls for a comprehensive policy and strategy,” Herrnstadt said.",
            "A Shot At Sweeping Labor Law Reform",
            "But a Biden presidency could boost unions in a potentially historic way if Democrats take control of the Senate. The Democratic-controlled House has already passed a bill known as the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, or PRO Act. If enacted, it would mark the biggest overhaul of labor law since the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947, which paved the way for “right to work” laws and restricted the ability of workers to strike and boycott.",
            "Among other measures, the PRO Act would ban right-to-work laws that are now on the books in a majority of states; reinvigorate the power to strike and boycott; and increase penalties on employers for union-busting.",
            "Business groups that oppose unions fear the significant changes the law would bring about. Just this week, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) was warning GOP supporters that a Democratic takeover of the Senate would lead to the repeal of Taft-Hartley.",
            "Herrnstadt said the law would help tilt the scales back toward workers when it comes to collective bargaining. Research shows that corporate America has ramped up its resistance to unions over the years, often hiring anti-union consultants to dissuade workers from organizing. The punishments for breaking the law are very weak.",
            "“There needs to be a drastic change in the way policy has been implemented by the government,” Herrnstadt said. “The PRO Act would go a very long way to restoring those rights.”",
            "The PRO Act stands virtually no chance of passing so long as Republicans can filibuster it and require a 60-vote threshold. That’s why progressive worker groups like the Communications Workers of America union have steered their support toward Democratic candidates who say they’re willing to blow up the filibuster. But even if Democrats took the Senate and a President Biden were willing to do so, passage would by no means be a sure thing.",
            "The last time Democrats held all the levers of power, including a Senate supermajority, they failed to pass landmark labor law reform with the Employee Free Choice Act in 2009 and 2010, in large part due to a lack of support among moderate Democrats. Resistance from centrists within the party could easily doom major labor legislation again.",
            "D. Taylor, president of the hospitality union Unite Here, said the PRO Act “has to get passed.” But even if Democrats win the White House and Senate and push the legislation through, he still sees major roadblocks for unions because of the way Trump has shaped the judiciary.",
            "“I think that the Trump judicial branch will do everything in their power to thwart the rights of workers,” Taylor said.",
            "The conservative Supreme Court of recent years has posed a serious threat to unions. The 5-4 decision handed down in Janus v. AFSCME in 2018 effectively made the entire U.S. public sector “right to work,” allowing employees to stop paying fees to unions that still must bargain on their behalf. The replacement of the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg with Justice Amy Coney Barrett cements a 6-3 conservative majority, making further rulings against unions and workers highly likely for years to come.",
            "Taylor said favorable legislation and policy toward unions will only do so much, especially if it gets stymied in court. He said, “We have to view our model as the 1930s” ― a time when New Deal policy set the stage for union growth, but labor capitalized through the aggressive organizing of new workers.",
            "“We have to do mobilization, work actions and strikes,” Taylor said. “I don’t think corporate America is going to change.”",
            "Correction: This story incorrectly stated that the PRO Act allowed workers to unionize through “card check.” In fact, the bill would only allow that in very specific circumstances.",

Wolinsky, now 43, has spinal muscular atrophy, and was attending Rotary Sunshine Camp in Rush, New York, a free summer camp for kids with neuromuscular disabilities sponsored by the Muscular Dystrophy Association. The 70-year-old organization is the nation’s most prominent nonprofit for people with neuromuscular disabilities.",
            "Wolinsky went to MDA camp for most of her childhood and loved it. But there was one aspect about camp she felt “icky” about.",
            "Every year, her MDA summer camp set up a “media day” in which a camera crew would film disabled campers and later use some of the footage in its famed telethon, “The Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day Telethon” — the MDA’s annual fundraising extravaganza.",
            "“They never filmed us looking like happy kids,” Wolinsky told HuffPost via Zoom. “They always zeroed in on us getting carried out of the pool with our asses hanging out or with drool.”",
            "By the time she was a teenager, she had had enough of it.",
            "“I was furious. And I was like, ‘I don’t want to participate,’” Wolinsky recalled.",
            "“The Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day Telethon” was a pop culture phenomenon hosted by Lewis until he made his final appearance in 2010. It aired every Labor Day weekend from 1966 to 2014 and raised nearly $2 billion during its run to fund research, clinics and summer camps for people with neuromuscular disabilities across the country. The star-studded event would feature a flurry of celebrities like Jennifer Aniston, Dolly Parton, Ray Charles, Betty White and Jerry Seinfeld. It also showcased kids with neuromuscular disabilities.",
            "Some of these children would appear live on the telethon, and a select group of these kids would earn the special title of “MDA Poster Child,” more commonly known as a “Jerry’s Kid” by 1976. Other children with neuromuscular disabilities were also featured in filmed footage that would air on the telethon, which Wolinsky said was sourced from MDA camps.",
            "But regardless of whether a child appeared live or was filmed, they were always portrayed the same way, according to Wolinsky — “sick or weak.”",
            "Wolinsky certainly didn’t see herself that way, and neither did her fellow campers. So, one day, they organized a boycott.",
            "“We all put up our middle fingers every time the cameras came around,” she said. “We wore ‘Protest’ buttons. We ran away from the cameras. They couldn’t get any footage. The cameramen were really upset and were trying to guilt us into doing stuff. But we were openly shutting them down left and right.”",
            "She remembers, however, there was at least one camper who was willing to talk on camera.",
            "“I had a friend who put blood makeup on his face. He was really into [the band] Kiss, and he dressed up all Kiss-like and told the cameramen, ‘I’ll do an interview,’” Wolinsky, who is now the president of NMD United — a nonprofit organization composed of adults living with neuromuscular disabilities that offers aid and support to their disabled adult peers — recounted her friend using a spooky voice.",
            "Wolinsky noted that at the time — in the early 1990s before Google and social media were easy ways to gauge information — she was completely unaware that her instinct to protest the telethon wasn’t exactly a unique response.",
            "“We didn’t realize there were all these adults that were actually organizing protests [against the MDA telethon],” she said. “Like, going to MDA’s headquarters and protesting, and putting out articles and stories.”",
            "Last weekend, the MDA brought the telethon back for the first time in six years. The organization partnered with comedian Kevin Hart’s Help From the Hart Charity to create a “reimagined” version of its famed fundraiser, called “The MDA Kevin Hart Kids Telethon.” It was Hart’s first major hosting turn since he resigned as emcee of the 2018 Oscars amid controversy over past homophobic tweets. Despite its efforts to depict disabled people in a more positive light, many disabled people HuffPost spoke to said the telethon still fell short and can’t be separated from its demoralizing and exploitative past.",

            "The news last September that the MDA would be bringing its telethon back incited major backlash in the disability community. Many disabled people had long criticized the Lewis-era telethon for its demeaning and pitying portrayals of kids with neuromuscular disabilities. They said the telethon and its host contributed to damaging stereotypes that have helped shape society’s unfair attitudes toward people with disabilities.",
            "And despite assurances from the MDA that the new telethon would be “updated” and crafted with the input of people with neuromuscular disabilities, many disabled people felt that the telethon could never be fully removed from its painful legacy.",

            "Two weeks ago, Dominick Evans, a filmmaker, movie and TV consultant, disabled activist and former MDA poster child, organized a protest on Twitter against the upcoming revamped fundraiser with the hashtag #EndTheTelethon. Disabled people used the hashtag to express their distrust of the MDA and share stories about how the old telethon negatively affected their lives.",
            "Andraéa LaVant, who has spinal muscular atrophy type two and is the founder of a disability-focused strategy and communications firm, told HuffPost via Zoom that she was involved with the MDA from about age 6 to middle school.",
            "Though she and her family weren’t “deeply involved” in the telethon, she did appear on the show via her local news station in Louisville, Kentucky. LaVant, who serves on the board of NMD United and was the impact producer for Netflix’s documentary “Crip Camp,” told HuffPost that she absorbed the message that she was “less than.”",
            "“[The telethon was] essentially saying, that we came into this world, or somewhere along the way, you’ve become broken,” LaVant said. “You are less than and you are not valuable the same way that an ‘able-bodied’ or ‘non-disabled’ person is.”",
            "The telethon also portrayed many of its young participants as being at imminent risk of dying ― a message some internalized ― to encourage the public to donate money to fund research and a cure.",
            "This message and tactic had a very specific translation to her as a kid, said LaVant.",
            "“You’re just wondering if you’re going to die, to be honest with you,” she said.",
            "Evans, who is queer, trans and non-binary, became a poster child for the MDA at the age of 10. They were instructed to use this donate-or-kids-will-die fear tactic to raise funds when they appeared on the telethon, they told HuffPost over the phone.",
            "“They’d tell me, ‘Everybody loves you! If at 3 a.m. and nobody’s calling, can you put out a heartfelt plea?’” Evans recalled. “And I would get up there and say, ‘Please let me have a life. I’m 10, don’t let me die. Can you please donate? You’re going to let me be able to go to college and get married and have babies.’”",
            "Like with LaVant, this negative messaging as a child messed with Evans’ head.",
            "“I internalized it. I believed I needed to be pitied,” Evans said. “I believed I was less. That’s why every day until I was in my 20s, I was suicidal.”",
            "How The MDA Tried To Fix It",
            "In response to the criticism the MDA has received over the years, Lynn O’Connor Vos, president and CEO of MDA, said in a press release ahead of the new telethon that the organization’s updated version would be “firmly dedicated to ensuring that the neuromuscular disease community is accurately portrayed and celebrated in all of the programming with our community advisory committee providing counsel, and having representation on the Telethon production team and as part of the writing process.”",
            "“Three years ago, our organization brought on new leadership,” the MDA told HuffPost in an emailed statement. “To adapt and update our approach, protocols and structure so that we could ensure that our programs and offerings meet the needs of all members of our community.”",
            "The statement added, “We regret that anyone feels disrespected by incidents that may have occurred in the past.”",
            "Former MDA board member Christopher Rosa, who has limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, was part of a volunteer advisory task force of adults with neuromuscular disabilities that the MDA consulted with for its new telethon.",
            "The group, which consisted of “six to eight” disabled adults, was formed to help ensure the messaging in the revamped telethon “reflects the true, authentic voices of the families that we serve,” Rosa told HuffPost via Zoom.",
            "This group advised the production and creative teams to make sure the messaging around the show “acknowledged the very real difficulties of living day to day with a neuromuscular disease,” according to Rosa.",
            "He added, “But at the same time, articulating the experience of people with neuromuscular disease in the way that we see ourselves, and in the most empowering terms.”",
            "The Reimagined Telethon",
            "On Saturday, “The MDA Kevin Hart Kids Telethon,” aired live on YouTube at 8 p.m. ET for two hours and raised $10.5 million, per the MDA.",
            "It featured celebrities like comedian Loni Love, musician Fat Joe and actor Leslie Mann answering phones and cracking irreverent jokes, as well as taped segments from stars including Michael B. Jordan, Cindy Crawford and David Beckham.",
            "Though the new telethon was in some ways significantly different from its predecessors, some disabled people said it still missed the mark.",
            "Wolinsky called the fundraiser “just plain strange” and an event that was “completely missing some major opportunities to address significant issues facing our community.”",
            "Dan Levy, best known for comedy series “Schitt’s Creek,” also taped a segment for the telethon. Some in the disability community expressed their disappointment that he appeared in the fundraiser, especially since he crafted so many authentic and touching storylines about the LGBTQ community in his beloved series.",
            "Levy’s segment acted as an introduction for “classic moments from telethons past,” a montage of old footage from the Lewis-era event ― something that could be seen as strange choice given the heavy criticism past telethons received from many in the disability community.",
            "Wolinsky shared with HuffPost a self-made “MDA Telethon Bingo Card” with each square filled in with predictions about potentially offensive things she thought might happen in the new telethon. Two of the squares on the card read, “Jerry’s legacy is highlighted” and “Old telethon montage.”",
            "Another controversial decision was featuring Bryan Cranston in a taped segment in which he wished the telethon a happy 70th birthday. In 2019, the “Breaking Bad” star received backlash from the disability community when he starred as a quadriplegic in the movie “Upside” (co-starring Hart), with critics noting there are very few film roles for actors who are wheelchair users.",
            "Like past telethons, the fundraiser also included a lot of kids with neuromuscular disabilities. The new event avoided blatantly offensive “half-human” language or suggestions that all the kids participating were going to die if viewers didn’t donate. But it still perpetuated harmful ways of viewing disabled people, disabled critics said.",
            "The MDA did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment on criticisms about the new telethon after it aired.",
            "The kids each had a brief taped introductory segment, and then Hart would interview them. The children and young adults described things they enjoyed doing, like creating art, skiing, swimming, joining a choir or LARPing society, watching Marvel movies or living on a college campus. Hart made remarks that he was “very impressed” by their interests and activities and said they inspired him to “feel all warm inside.”",
            "Though Hart’s sentiments about these kids may have seemed empowering to some, he was using language that disability activists have long said is laden with ableism, a term that describes discrimination against disabled people.",
            "“The language used at the ‘MDA Kevin Hart Kids Telethon’ evolved from pushing the false narrative that kids with [neuromuscular disabilities] are dying to a continued ableist rhetoric that we’re somehow inspirational for simply living our lives,” Kendra Scalia, a health care policy analyst, disability advocate and former MDA poster child told HuffPost via Twitter.",
            "“Having a job we’re passionate about isn’t inspirational,” she said. “Enjoying hobbies like video gaming, skiing or art isn’t inspirational. Going to college and having a full class schedule plus extracurricular activities isn’t inspirational. These are everyday activities that people do. MDA’s message is that —because we’re disabled — the mundane becomes inspirational. That’s ableism.”",
            "Scalia, who is also an NMD United board member, noted that non-disabled “doctors, family members, social workers” who were featured in the telethon for supporting disabled people were frequently referred to as “heroes,” and called that “ableist” as well.",
            "“People helping others can be heroes, yes,” she wrote to HuffPost. “But people helping disabled people are not heroes just because we’re disabled. We’re ‘inspirational’ to MDA but if you noticed, not a single disabled person was ever billed as a ‘hero’. That’s ableism.”",
            "The telethon also highlighted a few disabled adults. One was model and activist Jillian Mercado, who appeared in a sketch that included Jack Black shoving his crotch and butt into the camera wearing some very sheer underwear.",
            "“Jack Black got down to his skivvies, in front of the only disabled adult performer they had. WTF?” Evans wrote to HuffPost via Twitter. “Why is that funny?”",
            "The other disabled adults who were prominently featured included Rosa (the former MDA board member who spoke to HuffPost), and a disabled college student identified only as Gabrielle. Both appeared for a chat with Hart, who didn’t really explain who they were — aside from giving their first names and calling them “advocates” — to the viewers.",
            "Gabrielle spoke to Hart about “Hill Day,” which she described as an “annual event that the MDA has” in which disabled people get to speak to “our congressmen and women and our representatives.” She said she spoke to Rand Paul and Mitch McConnell about accessibility issues.",
            "This moment really stuck out to Steve Way, who has muscular dystrophy and is an actor on the Hulu’s “Ramy.” It showed that the telethon “still failed to address the fundamental problems disabled Americans face,” he said.",
            "“Like when [Gabrielle] said that her senator is Mitch McConnell,” said Way, who was heavily involved with the MDA as a kid, told HuffPost in an email. “You can’t do that without also mentioning that he’s hellbent on cutting our Medicaid.”",
            "Not every disabled person HuffPost spoke to panned the reimagined telethon.",
            "Elizabeth Denehie, 47, who has facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, is “probably one of the rare ones that is not anti-telethon,” she told HuffPost via email.",
            "“As a teen and [young adult] I spent every Labor Day working the telethon, all 21 hours straight. We all knew the telethon was a way to get the money in by pandering to what ‘sells,’ which is sad stories about children. We also all had an understanding and joked about how once we reached 21 and aged out of summer camp we were no longer needed by MDA.”",
            "She criticized disabled people who protest the telethon, saying that the money it has raised over the years has led to medications that have improved their quality of life.",
            "“Too many disabled people out there think the entire world is out to discriminate against them,” Denehie said. “Or need to label everything ‘ableism or ablest’ and that is just not the case.”",
            "Way said this year’s telethon “was better and less inspiration porn-y than previous years,” but added that it still had issues.",
            "“I thought that they should have featured more adults who are teachers, lawyers, doctors, etc. while highlighting the accessibility barriers they encounter every day. But the MDA would never do that because it would be considered ‘too political.’”"

        "articleContent": [
            "Each year, scientists look to the Southern Hemisphere to get a clue as to how flu season up north might play out. The flu season below the equator, which typically runs June through August, gives us an idea of which strains are circulating and how intense the Northern Hemisphere’s flu season, which usually sees an uptick around early November, could be.",
            "This year, the Southern Hemisphere saw a historically inactive flu season with “virtually no influenza circulation,” according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
            "The reason for this, infectious disease experts say, lies in how similarly COVID-19 and the flu are transmitted and, therefore, prevented. The viruses primarily spread in the same ways. Thanks to all the precautions in place for the coronavirus — like mask-wearing, physical distancing, school closures and teleworking — the flu never really struck this year down under, compared to previous flu seasons.",
            "But there are also some key differences in how the viruses spread. And knowing them could help you prevent the transmission of both and also make it easier to determine which one you have if you do get sick.",
            "Here’s how the transmission modes of the two illnesses compare:",
            "Both spread primarily through respiratory droplets.",
            "The main way COVID-19 spreads from person to person is thought to be through large respiratory droplets expelled from an infected person when they exhale, sneeze, cough, etc. If another person inhales enough of those droplets, there’s a solid chance they’ll get sick, too. That’s quite similar to the flu.",
            "Heidi Zapata, a Yale Medicine infectious disease doctor, said influenza spreads primarily through “tiny spitballs that are generated when we talk, laugh, sneeze, cough, sing.” So a face mask — which has been shown to reduce the respiratory droplets a person expels into the surrounding air and potentially inhales — should lower your risk for the flu just as it does with COVID-19.",
            "Airborne transmission is also a player in both illnesses.",
            "There’s evidence of airborne transmission with COVID-19, in which minuscule droplets containing pieces of the virus hang in the air for hours, mainly in poorly ventilated indoor spaces. Unlike the larger droplets that hit the ground within six feet of the person expelling them, these tiny aerosols can travel much farther than six feet indoors.",
            "Elizabeth McGraw, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics at Penn State University, said the same has been observed with influenza. A 2018 study of the flu found that simply breathing can generate infectious aerosols that can remain suspended in the air. “It’s the same for the flu ― there’s also potential for it to spread that way,” McGraw said.",
            "Superspreader events can occur with both.",
            "During the coronavirus pandemic, several COVID-19 superspreader events have been reported where an infected person transmitted the virus to others. First, there was the choir practice in Washington state. There was also the wedding in Maine and the Rose Garden gathering at the White House.",
            "The flu can also have superspreader events, noted Linsey Marr, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Virginia Tech who studies airborne viruses.",
            "Marr said the most famous superspreader example of the flu dates back to 1977 when an Alaska Airlines flight was delayed on the runway for three hours. During that time, the plane’s ventilation system was off, and within 72 hours of the flight, 72% of the passengers got sick with the flu. The outbreak was ultimately linked back to one individual who had boarded with the infection.",
            "“That incident kind of led to greater acceptance of the idea that the flu transmitted through the air,” Marr said.",
            "However, we’ll likely see more superspreader events with COVID-19 because the population has less immunity to the disease, meaning more people in any given room are likely more susceptible to contracting COVID-19 than the flu.",
            "There’s likely more asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic spread with COVID-19.",
            "In recent weeks, we’ve learned that approximately 40% to 50% of people infected with COVID-19 have no symptoms yet are contagious, and could be largely responsible for spreading the virus without knowing it.",
            "There’s also a five- to six-day pre-symptomatic period with COVID-19 during which people are thought to be highly contagious, Zapata said.",
            "The flu also spreads via asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission. Estimates suggest that 50% of seasonal flu cases may be asymptomatic.",
            "But there are also key differences between the two illnesses in this area: Where COVID-19 has a lengthy incubation period that can last up to 14 days, the flu’s incubation period is short. Most people begin exhibiting symptoms within three days of contracting influenza, so the window when people can pre-symptomatically spread the virus is much smaller, according to McGraw.",
            "In addition, with the flu, “the viral load, the amount of virus that people carry in their bodies, doesn’t peak until after the symptoms start, so by then hopefully they’re isolating, they feel bad, they’re not out in public,” Marr said.",
            "Because of all this, pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic spread are much more common with COVID-19 than the flu.",
            "A person with COVID-19 usually spreads it to more people.",
            "In general, someone sick with the flu will spread it to an average of 1 to 1.3 other individuals, according to Marr. It varies depending on the type of strain going around (for example, with 2009’s H1N1 strain, there was little population immunity so the flu zipped through communities).",
            "COVID-19 generally spreads to more people, with each infected person passing it to an average of 2 to 2.5 others. In some cases, a person can spread the virus to 10 or more people; other times it’s less.",
            "Marr noted that this isn’t due to the nature of the coronavirus itself but rather to the lack of immunity in the population ― and whether people are taking protective measures, like wearing masks, in the face of a new virus.",
            "“Many of them will have past exposure to flu and have some antibodies that will protect them, so even if they did get exposed, then they’re less likely to get sick. Whereas, COVID, there’s less of that immunity,” McGraw said.",
            "It’s worth noting that epidemiologists are still investigating whether some people may have some immunity to COVID-19 from previous infections with other coronaviruses that cause the common cold.",
            "Both viruses can linger on common surfaces.",
            "Though it was originally thought that surfaces played a huge role in the spread of COVID-19 (driving many of us to wipe down every bag, box and piece of mail), epidemiologists now say surface contamination doesn’t pose a huge risk.",
            "That said, it’s not zero risk. Marr noted that lab experiments have shown both coronavirus and influenza viruses can survive for a while on certain surfaces. So in theory, if enough of the virus is deposited on a surface, someone could touch the surface, pick up enough of the virus and transfer it to their eyes, nose or mouth.",
            "“Surfaces are a potential route. We know it is for the flu,” McGraw said. “I would encourage people to wash their hands and not touch their face and try to keep surfaces clean in shared areas.”",
            "Experts are still learning about COVID-19. The information in this story is what was known or available as of publication, but guidance can change as scientists discover more about the virus. Please check the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the most updated recommendations."

        "articleContent": [
            "Back in March, as COVID-19 swept the world and rendered hand sanitizer a daily necessity, hand-cleaning devotees took to social media to give voice to a commonly undiscussed aspect of the product ― its smell.",
            "They’re still wondering. “Why does all the hand sanitizer smell like tequila now?” asked a Twitter user in September. “Tequila-scented hand sanitizer has got to be the first thing outlawed in 2021,” wrote another.",
            "The aroma could be attributed to the spirit industry’s shift to producing hand sanitizer in the early days of the pandemic. Back in March, in an effort to bolster the surging demand for hand sanitizer, distilleries stepped up to make the product.",
            "Take Philip McDaniel, CEO of Florida-based St. Augustine Distillery, who realized he could help confront a national crisis pretty early on.",
            "“We were fighting a war against this thing and there was no hand sanitizer,” McDaniel recalled. “I started researching and realized we can make this stuff internally ― so we started doing it.”",
            "To make any sort of liquor, spirit companies begin with distilled alcohol, which is ethanol. Ethanol also happens to be the primary ingredient in hand sanitizer, a fact that positioned the liquor industry to enter the disinfectant market.",
            "By definition, ethanol is an organic chemical compound that is colorless and, although boasting a characteristic odor, shouldn’t smell like any specific spirit. Which is to say that if your hand sanitizer smells like tequila, bourbon or vodka, it’s not because the products share ingredients. It’s because the company selling you the disinfectant may not be following proper production procedures.",
            "But let’s start from the beginning.",
            "How liquor brands got into the sanitizer business",
            "McDaniel’s decision to shift to hand sanitizer production was typical of the spirit industry’s response to the pandemic. As companies like Purell faced an unprecedented surge in demand that depleted inventory, distillers like McDaniel swept in to fight the shortage and made a few bucks doing so.",
            "It made sense for two reasons. First, as restaurants and bars were forced to shut down, distillers had to contend with major market losses. On the other hand, these same distillers enjoyed relatively easy access to the ingredients needed to create hand sanitizer, especially ethanol.",
            "Once the government realized that the hand sanitizer shortage was going to be a real problem and that companies usually devoted to other pursuits had the ability to ease the scarcity, it rushed regulations surrounding the new endeavors.",
            "The government embraced the spirit industry’s moves, McDaniel explained, and focused on requirements for “a really safe formula.”",
            "That formula is found in the Food and Drug Administration’s official ”Temporary Policy for Preparation of Certain Alcohol-Based Hand Sanitizer Products During the Public Health Emergency (COVID-19).″ It specifies ethanol or United States pharmacopeia-grade isopropyl alcohol, plus glycerol or food chemical codex, hydrogen peroxide and sterile water.",
            "If your sanitizer smells like liquor, it may not be completely up to standard",
            "The type of ethanol used in hand sanitizers is government-regulated, with the FDA solely permitting alcohol “produced using fermentation and distillation processes typically used for consumable goods, and that is made in a facility used for producing consumable foods.” The product must be an aqueous solution and not a “gel, foam or aerosol spray.” The packaging has to seal in a way that prevents evaporation of the ingredients.",
            "McDaniel, whose company no longer makes sanitizer, explained that the distilled alcohol that was the basis of his usual product is basically “a sugar source that has been converted to ethanol or alcohol through a process of fermentation.”",
            "Distillers found themselves able to easily and swiftly create hand sanitizer with the FDA-specified ingredients.",
            "“Basically, you’re taking the neutral spirit that you use to make [vodka or tequila or another spirit] and you use it as your basis to make hand sanitizer,” McDaniel explained. “It’s called neutral because it’s neutral of color, it’s neutral of flavor and it’s neutral of taste. Technically, it should have zero” aroma.",
            "It’s important to note that the FDA directive states that hand sanitizer producers should not “add other active or inactive ingredients, such as ingredients to improve the smell or taste, due to the risk of accidental ingestion in children.” The policy adds: “Different or additional ingredients may impact the quality and potency of the product.”",
            "Yet, as a barrage of complaints on Twitter suggests, some of the products we’ve been stuffing into our bags, homes and cars do smell faintly like tequila. How is that possible?",
            "McDaniel said the smell could only have two explanations: “Whoever is doing that is either not making it according to the FDA formula or they’re going through a totally different approval process [by which] you have to get a license. It’s a more intense process.”",
            "FDA spokesperson Jeremy Kahn explained that there have been three ways to produce and market hand sanitizer since the start of the pandemic. The first involves following the temporary FDA policy. The second method is to comply with 1994 regulations for over-the-counter topical antiseptics. The third option is to submit a new drug application.",
            "Hand sanitizer produced by manufacturers following instructions laid out in the FDA’s temporary policy should not have any sort of odor, Kahn said. If they do, they are not up to standard.",
            "“Firms that wish to market a hand sanitizer with a scent would not be able to market their product under the temporary policies,” Kahn explained.",
            "Fragrant hand sanitizers have either been marketed since before COVID-19 under the 1994 rules for topical antiseptics, or they don’t comply with the FDA’s guidance, Kahn said.",
            "Distilleries have largely stepped away from the sanitizing business",
            "“At the beginning, there was all this demand and no supply,” recalled McDaniel. “You could make it, charge for some, give some away and you were doing good.”",
            "That changed around June or July, he said, when existing manufacturers like Purell and Johnson & Johnson “came back with a vengeance” with output that caught up with the roaring demand. “They turned their factories on 24/7 and they were pumping out the product,” he added.",
            "McDaniel said he’s done with hand sanitizer, for now. “We jumped in to do it because we wanted to help save our community and keep people safe,” he said.",
            "The best way to use hand sanitizer",
            "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a thorough guide for using hand sanitizer. It points out that alcohol-based sanitizers “can quickly reduce the number of microbes on hands in some situations,” but they do not eliminate all types of toxins (think heavy metals and pesticides) and may not work on extremely dirty or greasy hands. That is to say that soap and water are the best hand-washing option. But if that’s not available, opt for a sanitizer that boasts at least 60% alcohol.",
            "The CDC suggests applying the sanitizer to the palm of one hand, rubbing it all over the surfaces of both hands and waiting for it to dry. That process is the same whether you’re using a scented or fragrance-free version of the product.",
            "Experts are still learning about COVID-19. The information in this story is what was known or available as of publication, but guidance can change as scientists discover more about the virus. Please check the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the most updated recommendations."

            "PHILADELPHIA (AP) — The family of a Black man killed by Philadelphia police officers in a shooting caught on video had called for an ambulance to get him help with a mental health crisis, not for police intervention, their lawyer said.",
            "Police said Walter Wallace Jr., 27, was wielding a knife and ignored orders to drop the weapon before officers fired shots Monday afternoon. But his parents said Tuesday night that officers knew their son was in a mental health crisis because they had been to the family’s house three times on Monday.",
            "Cathy Wallace, his mother, said one of the times, “they stood there and laughed at us.”",
            "The Wallace family’s attorney, Shaka Johnson, said the man’s wife, Dominique Wallace, is pregnant and is scheduled to have labor induced Wednesday. Johnson said Wallace had nine children — two briefly spoke at a news conference late Tuesday, along with Walter Wallace’s mother and father.",
            "“When you come to a scene where somebody is in a mental crisis, and the only tool you have to deal with it is a gun ... where are the proper tools for the job?” Johnson said, arguing that Philadelphia police officers are not properly trained to handle mental health crises. Johnson said Wallace’s brother had called 911 to request medical assistance and ambulance.",
            "About 500 people had gathered at a West Philadelphia park Tuesday night and began marching through the neighborhood, chanting. There were sporadic reports of arrests in other areas of the city Tuesday night around 9 p.m.",
            "Video showed people streaming into stores and stealing goods as they left on the opposite side of the city from where Wallace was shot. The Philadelphia Office of Emergency Management tweeted around 9:30 p.m. Tuesday, cautioning residents in eastern Philadelphia to remain indoors.",
            "In Washington, the White House issued a statement just before 1 a.m. Wednesday asserting that the unrest was another consequence of “Liberal Democrats’ war against the police” and that the Trump administration “stands proudly with law enforcement, and stands ready, upon request, to deploy any and all Federal resources to end these riots.”",
            "“Law enforcement is an incredibly dangerous occupation, and thousands of officers have given their lives in the line of duty,” said the statement from press secretary Kayleigh McEnany. “All lethal force incidents must be fully investigated. The facts must be followed wherever they lead to ensure fair and just results. In America, we resolve conflicts through the courts and the justice system. We can never allow mob rule.”",
            "Philadelphia officials had anticipated a second night of unrest Tuesday, after Philadelphia police arrested more than 90 people during protests and unrest that began Monday and spread into the early morning hours of Tuesday, sometimes turning into violent confrontations with police. Police were stationing extra officers on business corridors in west Philadelphia and elsewhere in preparation.",
            "A Pennsylvania National Guard spokesperson told The Philadelphia Inquirer earlier Tuesday that several hundred guardsmen were expected to arrive in the city within 24 to 48 hours.",
            "Police had previously said 30 officers were injured in the Monday night unrest, most of them hit with thrown objects like bricks. One officer was still hospitalized Tuesday with a broken leg after being purposely run over by a pickup truck, police said.",
            "Throughout the day Tuesday, state and local officials called for transparency and a thorough investigation, including the release of body camera footage from the two officers who fired their weapons.",
            "Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said at a news conference Tuesday that she was still reviewing when and what information would be released to the public. The officers had not been interviewed as of Tuesday afternoon, she said. Neither had a Taser or similar device at the time of the shooting, Outlaw said, noting the department had previously asked for funding to equip more officers with those devices.",
            "Outlaw said the officers’ names and other identifying information, including their race, would be withheld until the department could be sure releasing the information would not pose a threat to their safety. The officers were taken off street duty during the investigation.",
            "Police officials said they could not confirm what information had been given to the responding officers, whether they were told about a possible mental illness or how many calls they had received for help at Wallace’s address Monday. Chief Police Inspector Frank Vanore confirmed that police had received a call before the fatal encounter Monday about a man screaming and saying that he was armed with a knife.",
            "The two officers each fired at least seven rounds — at least 14 total shots — but Vanore could not say how many times Wallace, 27, was struck.",
            "Wallace’s father, Walter Wallace Sr. said Tuesday night that he is haunted by the way his son was “butchered.”",
            "“It’s in my mind. I can’t even sleep at night. I can’t even close my eyes,” he said.",
            "In video filmed by a bystander and posted on social media, officers yell for Wallace to drop a knife. In the video, Wallace’s mother and at least one man follow Wallace, trying to get him to listen to officers, as he briskly walks across the street and between cars.",
            "Wallace advanced toward the officers, who then fired several times, said police spokesperson Officer Tanya Little. Wallace’s mother screams and throws something at an officer after her son is shot and falls to the ground.",
            "The video does not make it clear whether he was in fact holding a knife, but witnesses said he was. Police would not confirm any details about the weapon Wallace was alleged to be holding Tuesday, saying it is still part of the open investigation.",
            "Wallace was hit in the shoulder and chest, Little said. One officer drove him to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead a short time later, she said.",
            "During Monday’s unrest, police cars and dumpsters were set on fire as officers struggled to contain the crowds. More than a dozen officers, many with batons in hand, formed a line as they ran down 52nd Street, dispersing most of the crowd.",
            "In at least one video posted to social media, an officer can be seen appearing to arrest a young Black woman. A white officer wrestles the woman to the ground, lying with his back against her, and punches her repeatedly.",
            "A request for comment or details about the incident was not returned by police Tuesday. A District Attorney’s office spokesperson urged people with concerns about misconduct or crime during the protest to report those issues to the office’s special investigations unit.",
            "The 52nd Street corridor was also the site of protests against police brutality at the end of May, after George Floyd was killed by Minneapolis police. Those protests have been the subject of City Council hearings, with protesters describing harsh and unnecessary tactics, including tear gas and projectiles fired by police."

            "Hugh Nini and Neal Treadwell don’t mind if readers come away from their new coffee table book, “Loving: A Photographic History of Men in Love, 1850s ― 1950s,” with more questions than answers. In fact, that’s exactly as they intended.",
            "Released Oct. 14 to coincide with LGBTQ History Month, the 330-page tome is a stirring collection of male couples engaged in varying stages of intimacy, from flirtatious glances and tender embraces to full-on passionate kisses.",
            "To anyone who’s visited Provincetown, Massachusetts, or Palm Springs, California, in recent years, these photographs may seem commonplace or even banal. It’s only when one considers the centurylong timespan in which the images were captured that their daring and subversive nature is apparent.",
            "Nini and Treadwell, a married New York couple, began collecting photos of male twosomes after spotting a snapshot of two men embracing and gazing at one another, circa 1920, in an antique shop in Texas 20 years ago.",
            "Over the next two decades, the couple traveled across the U.S. and Europe, poring through estate sales and flea markets in what they describe as a “rescue mission” of sorts. Together, they accumulated more than 2,800 photos, including some from Australia, Japan and Latvia.",
            "The turning point, they said, came when they discovered a photograph ― estimated to date to around 1900, that showed two men holding up a handmade sign that reads: “Not married, but willing to be.”",
            "Describing that photo as a “bold and prescient” declaration of same-sex love from more than 100 years ago, Nini and Treadwell said they began to feel a sense of obligation to share such images with those whose concept of the queer community is firmly rooted in the present.",
            "“It’s easy to fall into despair and think that love exists only in movies, books or Shakespearean plays,” the couple told HuffPost said in an email. “In ‘Loving,’ we see that male couples found each other despite the headwinds of society, world wars, pandemics and economic ruin. They’re a perfect metaphor for where we are today.”",
            "“We hope that our book will reinforce, renew or instill for the first time the belief that love is real and worth fighting for,” they added.",
            "The discourse around LGBTQ relationships would, of course, begin to shift with the 1969 Stonewall uprising, historically seen as the advent of the modern LGBTQ rights movement and 19 years after the most recent photograph in “Loving” was taken. In 2003, the Supreme Court invalidated sodomy laws in 13 U.S. states, decriminalizing same-sex relationships across the country.",
            "Before releasing “Loving,” Nini and Treadwell had to consider the fact that they could be inadvertently outing men who may not have identified, or did not feel comfortable identifying, as LGBTQ during their lifetimes. With that in mind, they said they chose to present the photographs in a straightforward fashion, without any written declarations as to the sexuality of their subjects.",
            "“Our photos only show that these couples were in love,” they said. “We don’t claim to know [the sexuality] of any of the subjects in our collection. ... As far as we know, it’s never been illegal for two men, or two women anywhere in the world to be in love with each other.”",
            "Since its Oct. 14 release, “Loving: A Photographic History of Men in Love” has been met with near-universal praise. The book has garnered accolades from Rolling Stone, The Guardian and The Washington Post, among other outlets.",
            "And by sharing their collection, Nini and Treadwell said they hope to shine a “beacon of light” on the LGBTQ community ― members of which have been disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.",
            "“This book seems to be acting as a life preserver in some ways,” they said. “It’s something beautiful and unexpected. Love and beauty have, lately, been in too short a supply. Right now, we’re all searching for light.”"

I spoke better Spanish and Portuguese that night than I have since, you know what I mean?”",

            "BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Spain declared a second nationwide state of emergency Sunday and ordered an overnight curfew across the country in hopes of stemming a resurgence in coronavirus infections, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said.",
            "The Socialist leader told the nation in a televised address that the extraordinary measure will go into effect on Sunday night.",
            "Sánchez said that his government is using the state of emergency to impose an 11 p.m.-6 a.m. nationwide curfew, except in the Canary Islands.",
            "Spain’s 19 regional leaders will have authority to set different hours for the curfew as long as they are stricter, close regional borders to travel and limit gatherings to six people who don’t live together, the prime minister said.",
            "“The reality is that Europe and Spain are immersed in a second wave of the pandemic,” Sánchez said after meeting with his Cabinet.",
            "The leader added that he would ask Parliament this week to extend the state of emergency for six months, until May.",
            "Sánchez’s government said Saturday night that a majority of Spain’s regional leaders have agreed to a new state of emergency and the meeting Sunday was to study its terms.",
            "The state of emergency gives the national government extraordinary powers, including the ability to temporarily restrict basic freedoms guaranteed in Spain’s Constitution such as the right to free movement.",
            "However, objections have been growing in Spain over how new increased restrictions are being imposed, recently leading to protests in the streets of the capital, Madrid, creating doubts as to whether new stricter rules will be followed.",
            "“People are sick of the pandemic, in general, and of the restrictions, more specifically,” said Marina Velasco, a reporter for HuffPost Spain, based in Madrid. “People are so tired of the virus that they no longer pay so much attention to the new measures. The main fear now is Christmas time: what will happen? Will we be able to travel and stay with the family?”",
            "Velasco added that there is also growing confusion over how the rules are being implemented between different regions: “People are linking the ‘state of alarm’ to a ‘lockdown,’ as it happened in March, but this time is not the same. The new state of alarm also gives freedom to Spain’s regional governments to apply different measures and restrictions, which creates further confusion over the rules.”",
            "Spain’s government has already declared two state of emergencies during the pandemic. The first was declared in March to apply a strict home confinement across the nation, close stores and recruit private industry for the national public health fight. It was lifted in June after reigning in the contagion rate and saving hospitals from collapse.",
            "The second went into effect for two weeks in Madrid to force the capital’s reluctant regional leaders to impose travel limits on residents to slow down an outbreak in which new infections were growing exponentially. It lasted until Saturday.",
            "Spanish Health Minister Salvador Illa has said his agency and regional health officials were studying how to apply nightly curfews, perhaps like the 9 p.m. ones already in place in France’s major cities.",
            "The state of emergency would make it easier for authorities to take swift action, avoiding having to get many of the restrictions approved by a judge. Some judges have rejected efforts to limit movement in certain regions, causing confusion among the public.",
            "Government officials on all levels were reticent to impose another complete home lockdown and industry shutdown, given the weakened state of Spain’s economy, which has plunged into a recession and seen its unemployment rolls skyrocket in recent months.",
            "Spain this week became the first European country to surpass 1 million officially recorded COVID-19 cases. But Sánchez admitted Friday in a nationally televised address that the true figure could be more than 3 million, due to gaps in testing and other factors.",
            "Despite the rising infections, polls suggest support is holding for Sanchez, although trust in the prime minister is at just 29%.",
            "Spain on Friday reported almost 20,000 new daily cases and 231 more deaths, taking the country’s death toll in the pandemic to 34,752."

            "“Self-care is not a massage or a manicure,” Brown noted. “It’s putting boundaries and limits on your behavior like a parent would.”",
            "That may look like eliminating interactions with a racist relative, for example, or making hard decisions about some people in your life. That may be turning off your computer at the end of the workday, even if you think you have more you can do. It might be turning down an important invite, even if it means disappointing someone.",
            "Brown added that it’s also important to note that self-care is not toxic positivity, which he defined as avoiding what you’re actually feeling for the sake of being positive. Acknowledging your feelings is now a vital, critical component of self-care ― even if it’s unpleasant. “If you don’t reveal it, you can’t heal it,” he said.",
            "Practicing self-care in 2020 also means self-preservation, Andre said. It goes beyond nurturing or self-soothing; it’s a matter of survival, particularly for Black people and people of color.",
            "“Some people really feel like they’re at the end of their ropes right now, and that their lives are being compromised,” Andre added, noting that because of that, the way people take care of themselves now is radically different.",
            "That was the case for Margo Gabriel, a writer from Boston who recently moved to Lisbon, Portugal. The racial injustice in the U.S. was affecting her daily life and making it extremely difficult to focus on her work. Without the ability to travel, cook for loved ones or visit museums this year — all previous forms of self-care for Gabriel — her mental health started suffering.",
            "“What I have learned in 2020 is that self-preservation is paramount to the stability of my mental health,” she said. “My move abroad is the greatest act of self-preservation I could have done in my life.”",
            "Some Ways To Protect Your Mental Health Right Now",
            "Self-care no longer looks like the millennial pink, relaxing version we’ve been sold. This radical version may be harder or more uncomfortable, but experts say it’s also essential to living right now. Some people may feel like they need to take more drastic measures to protect their mental health; there are also a few other meaningful and radical steps we can all take more immediately.",
            "Here’s what practicing self-care can look like in 2020:",
            "Identifying and acknowledging your feelings.",
            "You can’t begin to take care of yourself until you accept where you’re at. That’s why Andre encourages her clients to write down all the different emotions they’re having — from fear and rage to sadness and desperation.",
            "“Once you identify and acknowledge your feelings, you can start figuring out what to do with them,” she said. “Would you like to make peace with that feeling? Would you like to change it? What’s connected to this emotion in your environment?”",
            "Asking these questions can help you determine what you need to move forward.",
            "Limiting your social media and news consumption.",
            "Part of self-care is acknowledging your personal limits. If you feel overwhelmed, anxious or sick to your stomach after reading the news, limit what, when and how much information you take in. Even if that means deleting an app.",
            "Aisha R. Shabazz, a therapist based in New Jersey, said she’s needed to overhaul how she uses her devices now. “I don’t consume as much social media as I used to because of the insidious posts related to the brutality of BIPOC,” she said.",
            "You may feel guilty if you’re not checking the news multiple times a day, but it doesn’t mean you don’t care or you’re not involved, Scott added. “It simply means you’re prioritizing your mental health.”",
            "Recognizing when your emotions need extra attention.",
            "Conditions like stress, anxiety and grief can all manifest in your body, Scott said.",
            "That’s why it’s important to take note of how your body and brain are functioning. If you’re dealing with regular migraines, back pain, nausea or restless sleep, for example, you may be experiencing mental health issues, Scott said.",
            "“If you lack motivation, have feelings of hopelessness and helplessness, experience obsessive worry or fear leaving your home, it could be beneficial to talk to someone,” she said.",
            "You can join a virtual or local support group through Mental Health America, or look into affordable therapy options. Other great resources for finding mental health help and a community include Psychology Today, Therapy For Black Girls, Therapy For Black Men, Brown Girl Therapy and Open Path Psychotherapy Collective.",
            "Advocating for real change.",
            "Protesting safely, voting, calling senators and sharing information can all be forms of activism that help improve your mental health. Not only is it a way to feel a level of control in this extremely uncertain year, but it can also lead to positive change.",
            "Hieu Le, who works at the Sierra Club in Washington, D.C., said part of his self-care practice has been dedicating time to text and phone banking in battleground states.",
            "“By speaking to voters 10 to 15 hours a week, I have been able to have conversations with thousands of people where we discuss our own personal issues,” he said. “Through this, I’ve been able to find collective solidarity and see that I’m not alone.”",
            "Saying no.",
            "That said, the key here is to look after yourself. Channeling energy into activism is critical, but know your limits. It doesn’t make you a bad person to take some time off.",
            "“You cannot pour from an empty cup,” Scott said. “You have to be OK in order to help other people.”",
            "Finding joy where you can.",
            "Joy is not the same thing as happiness. “Happiness comes from people, places, things and events, but joy is an inside job,” Brown said. “Happiness says ‘because of,’ joy says ‘in spite of.’”",
            "Gabriel is doing this following her move abroad. In addition to connecting with a group of fellow Black folks doing the same, she has also been journaling more often and spending more time outside, all of which have had a marked positive effect on her mental well-being.",
            "Cultivating joy is about understanding who you are and what you need. It can be as simple as writing in a daily gratitude journal or spending time with loved ones. However, it can also be a long-term pursuit that involves therapy, community or activism.",
            "“Joy is the resistance,” Brown said. “We may have a larger burden to carry to make sure everyone’s voices are heard right now, but we are so much more resilient than we give ourselves credit for.”"

            "Sanderson added: “Your clients are no longer Upper East Side socialites, able to sue at the slightest offense to their personal sensitivities.” They are “public officials” due to a “gross act of nepotism” when Donald Trump made them both White House advisers.",
            "Americans “have the right to discuss and criticize their public officials freely,” Sanderson schools Kasowitz, citing a Supreme Court ruling defending even “vehement, caustic and ... unpleasantly sharp attacks” of government officials.",
            "In addition, the attack ads are “entirely accurate,” Sanderson noted. Kasowitz had claimed that Kushner never said, as the billboard notes, that it’s “their problem” that New Yorkers are suffering from COVID-19.",
            "Vanity Fair reported in September that Kushner had complained that New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) didn’t plead hard enough with the White House to get coronavirus protective gear for his state. “His people are going to suffer and that’s their problem,” Kushner is quoted as saying in the article.",
            "Kasowitz also insisted that Ivanka Trump “never made the gesture” on the ad which shows her smiling over the COVID-19 death toll.",
            "Sanderson pointed out that the ad utilized a Twitter photo in which Ivanka posed with a can of Goya beans in July after the company CEO praised her dad. Huckstering for Goya violated federal ethics rules for a White House official, he added.",
            "Ivanka Trump’s “bruised self-image does not change the fact that this billboard accurately depicts her support of a federal response that has utterly failed to prevent an unmitigated tragedy for the United States,” Sanderson snapped.",
            "The Lincoln Project is looking forward to deposing all relevant witnesses and a courtroom confrontation, so “sue if you must,” Sanderson challenged.",
            "Kasowitz has yet to respond. Critics have noted that the lawsuit threat has likely drawn millions more viewers to the ad online.",

            "James Randi, a magician who later challenged spoon benders, mind readers and faith healers with such voracity that he became regarded as the country’s foremost skeptic, has died, his foundation announced. He was 92.",
            "The James Randi Educational Foundation confirmed the death, saying simply that its founder succumbed to “age-related causes” on Tuesday.",
            "Entertainer, genius, debunker, atheist ̶ Randi was them all. He began gaining attention not long after dropping out of high school to join the carnival. As the Amazing Randi, he escaped from a locked coffin submerged in water and from a straitjacket as he dangled over Niagara Falls.",
            "Magical as his feats seemed, Randi concluded his shows around the globe with a simple statement, insisting no otherworldly powers were at play.",
            "“Everything you have seen here is tricks,” he would say. “There is nothing supernatural involved.”",
            "The magician’s transparency gave a glimpse of what would become his longest-running act, as the country’s skeptic-in-chief. In that role, his first widely seen exploit was also his most enduring.",
            "On a 1972 episode of “The Tonight Show,” he helped Johnny Carson set up Uri Geller, the Israeli performer who claimed to bend spoons with his mind. Randi ensured the spoons and other props were kept from Geller’s hands until showtime to prevent any tampering.",
            "The result was an agonizing 22 minutes in which Geller was unable to perform any tricks.",
            "Randi had bushy white eyebrows and beard, a bald head, and gold-rimmed glasses, and bounced his 5-foot-6 (1.6 meter) frame energetically, even in his final years. He sought to disprove not just those who read palms and minds, but chiropractors, homeopaths and others he saw as predators seeking innocent people’s money.",
            "Randi targeted those he saw as frauds with a tenacity and dedication he admitted was an obsession. His efforts were reminiscent of those of his great predecessor Harry Houdini, who devoted large portions of his time to debunking spiritualists and their seances.",
            "“I see people being swindled every day by medical quackery, frauds of every sort, psychics and their hot lines, people who claim to be able to find lost children or to help them invest their money,” Randi told The Associated Press in 1998. “I know they are being swindled because I know the methods being used.”",
            "Once, awaiting the chance to sift through the trash of a faith healer, Randi spent days in his car, eating Twinkies and drinking Pepsi.",
            "“I suffer from this obsession that I have something important to do,” he explained in a 2007 interview with The AP.",
            "There were other coups for Randi: He once showed the messages television faith healer Peter Popoff claimed to be getting from God about his audience were actually coming from his wife through an earpiece. But the vast majority of those he aimed to show were frauds were lesser known, lured to prove their abilities by the James Randi Educational Foundation.",
            "Through that organization, Randi was guardian of a $1 million prize he promised to give anyone who could prove either their own supernatural powers or the presence of a supernatural being.",
            "His loudest detractors said they didn’t believe the money even existed, but Randi had the bank documentation. No one ever came close to collecting.",
            "Randi gave up the day-to-day operation of his foundation in 2009 and retired in 2015.",
            "Born Randall James Hamilton Zwinge in Toronto on Aug. 7, 1928, Randi ̶ known by everyone simply by that surname ̶ had a nagging desire to question from a young age. Academically, he said he was bored in school and teachers acknowledged he was prodigy far ahead of his peers. He never earned a high school diploma or went to college but in 1986 was awarded a prestigious MacArthur fellowship, often known simply as a “genius grant.”",
            "He spoke with certainty. While he said he never really questioned his beliefs, he acknowledged there was always a chance he was wrong.",
            "“I am probably right. But I’m always only probably right,” he said. “Absolutes are very hard to find.”",
            "For all the analysis Randi put into seemingly everything, he still found delight in observing magic he knew was a stunt or watching a film that was just fantasy. He talked about the crushing feelings of watching a friend die and spoke of the magic of love. In 2010, he announced he was gay. In 2013, he married his longtime partner, Deyvi Pena, at a ceremony in Washington, D.C. He was the subject of a 2014 documentary, “An Honest Liar.”",
            "Penn Jillette, a magician in the mold of Randi, mourned his friend on Twitter on Wednesday night, writing: “We will never forget that without Randi, there would not be Penn & Teller. It’s really that simple.”",
            "Randi said he couldn’t help feeling angry that his targets always seemed to perform escape acts of their own, continuing to win new followers and earn checks he said were cashed at reality’s expense. He wanted to see frauds punished, but he recognized most people wanted to believe.",
            "“The true believers,” he said, “will not pay any attention to evidence that does not show that they believe to be untrue.”",
            "It was frustrating to Randi and fueled an underlying anger toward those he labeled frauds. When he let his displeasure slip out, though, it often was mixed with wit, as when asked about his final wishes and how he’d like his ashes disposed.",
            "“My best friend is instructed to throw them in Uri Geller’s eyes,” he said. “I’d like him to get an eyeful of my ashes. I think that would be appropriate.”",

            "The Republican executive of a company that manufactures medical masks said Tuesday that he will vote for Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, due to President Donald Trump’s “politicized” response to the coronavirus crisis.",
            "Mike Bowen ― executive vice president of Texas-based Prestige Ameritech, the largest producer of N95 masks and respirators in the U.S. ― said in a statement to HuffPost that Trump’s handling of the pandemic has “greatly increased death and suffering in America.”",
            "“President Trump downplayed the virus, missed opportunities, and wasted precious time,” Bowen said in his statement. “He has also politicized the wearing of masks. ... The man has politicized a life-saving medical device and has teased people for wearing it!”",
            "“Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed ‘genius’ who prefers his own magical thinking to the advice of experts and scientists,” Bowen continued, adding: “The next time that there is a scientifically minded Republican presidential candidate, I will vote for her or him. This time, however, there is only one scientifically minded person in the race. That person is Joe Biden.”",
            "Bowen, who describes himself as a lifelong Republican, testified before Congress in May that the country’s dependence on foreign masks had been a national security risk for several years.",
            "During that same hearing, Dr. Rick Bright, the former director of the U.S. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), testified that Bowen had warned federal officials as early as January that the country faced a mask shortage.",
            "Bright served as director of BARDA for nearly four years until, in his words, he was ousted in April for objecting to pressure from Trump administration officials who wanted the agency to invest in unproven COVID-19 drugs and vaccines.",
            "“I’ll never forget the emails I received from Mike Bowen indicating that our mask supply, our N95 respirator supply, was completely decimated,” Bright testified. “And he said, ‘We’re in deep shit. The world is. And we need to act.’ ... We were already behind the ball.”",
            "Bowen appears in the newly released documentary “Totally Under Control,” which examines the Trump administration’s response to the pandemic.",
            "“Around 2005, all of the major mask makers left the country,” Bowen says in the film. “It put the U.S. mask supply in the hands of foreign control and could be subject to diversion during the pandemic. And that’s what I’ve been warning about for years.”",
            "He added: “I voted for Donald Trump. I thought, you know, if I contact enough people in the administration somebody ― one of these people ― is going to look at this and say, ‘Hey, this is a problem. Maybe we ought to call this guy.’ And no, I couldn’t get any ― I didn’t get any response there.”",
            "As of Wednesday, the U.S. continued to lead the world in confirmed coronavirus cases and deaths. Nationwide, there have been more than 8.2 million cases and at least 221,000 deaths, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.",

            "One of the president’s most dangerous attacks on civil rights and free speech is getting relatively little attention amid the firestorm of news as Election Day approaches.\n",
            "In an executive order and a series of administrative actions issued over the past month and a half, the Trump administration effectively banned diversity and inclusion training in the federal workforce and at any company or entity that contracts with the government or receives federal funding, a huge swath of American businesses and universities, covering millions of workers and students.",
            "As part of the administration’s continued efforts to effectively ban anti-racism training, the Labor Department announced Wednesday it would begin collecting information on diversity training from contractors (Verizon, which owns HuffPost, is one such company) as a way of policing the way diversity is discussed within private companies.",
            "The president ironically claims to be doing this in the name of equality. The administration says these trainings are un-American propaganda, claiming that learning about the history of race in the United States teaches the language of hate.\n",
            "But diversity training is standard corporate practice, meant to encourage workers of all backgrounds to treat each other fairly. As the Me Too movement began, there was a shift to focus on sexual harassment education. These days, companies are increasingly concentrating on racism.\n",
            "In the case of diversity training, the White House is basing its opinion on the findings of one conservative activist, Christopher Rufo, who has appeared on Fox News and written for the New York Post and Wall Street Journal.\n",
            "The word Orwellian is thrown around quite a bit in the Donald Trump era, but the doublespeak in this order stunned the lawyers, executives, activists and academics who have pushed for diversity, inclusion and equality for decades.\n",
            "The order is the bureaucratic equivalent of telling white supremacists to “Stand back and stand by,” or of claiming there were “very fine people” on both sides of a deadly neo-Nazi rally and counterprotest in Virginia.",
            "“This is far more serious than a lot of people think,” said Kimberlé Crenshaw, a law professor at UCLA and Columbia Law School, and an early pioneer of the academic theories now under attack from the administration. “This is no minor thing. This is an effort to put the weight of the federal government behind ideas that say anti-racism is racist itself.”\n",
            "Crenshaw and others view the administration’s moves as a direct attack on their right to share thoughts and ideas. At least one person called the order fascist. They’re a huge and powerful move by the White House to curb the right of workers, businesses and universities to discuss one of the most pivotal issues in the United States: racism.\n",
            "It’s a clear assault on free speech, in the name of equality, against efforts to learn about equality.\n",
            "“When a society is moving to authoritarianism, it goes after the ideas. It goes after speech,” Crenshaw said.\n",
            "The administration’s actions are a way of opposing the reckoning with race that’s taken place around the country in the wake of the murder of George Floyd, a Black man who died after a white police officer knelt on his neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds on May 25, a killing that stunned the nation.\n",
            "The NAACP Legal Defense Fund told HuffPost it is weighing legal action against the Trump administration.",
            "“This is an extraordinary and alarming act by our federal government and our president,” said Jin Hee Lee, the fund’s deputy director of litigation. “The order is using the power of the federal government to essentially censor and police the actual thoughts and ideas and perspectives of not only federal employees and the U.S. military but also federal contractors that are private entities and grant recipients.”",
            "Timeline Of The Attack",
            "The crackdown on diversity training began in September and has escalated over just the past few weeks.\n",
            "The White House put out its order to ban diversity training, or what it called “divisive, anti-American propaganda,” on Sept. 4, just two days after Rufo appeared on Tucker Carlson’s Fox News show and directly appealed to the White House to ban such seminars, calling them dangerous and “terrifying.”\n",
            "In the executive order, the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget directed all federal agencies to cease funding such training, as it is “contrary to all we stand for as Americans and should have no place in the Federal government.”\n",
            "The memo even identified specific terms that could not be used, including “critical race theory” and “white privilege,” or any other teaching that would suggest the “United States is an inherently racist or evil country.”\n",
            "Trump tweeted the news the next day: “This is a sickness that cannot be allowed to continue. Please report any sightings so we can quickly extinguish!” The conservative press and Republican lawmakers, including Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, quickly got in line. “Marxist-influenced nonsense that is racially divisive,” Hawley said. “If you didn’t know better, if you read this stuff, you’d think it was put out by some white nationalist. It’s unbelievable.”\n",
            "The Congressional Black Caucus and other groups of lawmakers of color quickly responded, saying the administration was “trying to sweep our nation’s history of racism under the rug.”\n",
            "Less than two weeks later, on Sept. 17, Trump broadened his attack to include The New York Times’s 1619 Project and seemingly any kind of study of history that examines race in America. “Critical race theory, the 1619 Project, and the crusade against American history is toxic propaganda,” the president said. “An ideological poison that, if not removed, will dissolve the civic bonds that tie us together.”\n",
            "Then on Sept. 22, the administration went further, issuing the “Executive Order on Combating Race and Sex Stereotyping,” which extended the ban to any training that promotes race or sex stereotyping or scapegoating in the military; at any company with federal contracts, which could include such behemoths as Microsoft and Boeing; and any organization that gets federal grants, which would include universities around the country.",
            "Incredibly, the order claims its actions are in the name of equality. “The President, and his Administration, are fully committed to the fair and equal treatment of all individuals in the United States.”\n",
            "But the administration is shutting down training meant to facilitate understanding, equity and belonging in the workplace.\n",
            "On Oct. 4, the White House went further still, ordering all agencies to suspend diversity training until they are deemed to be in line with the president’s order.\n",
            "The Labor Department has even set up a hotline that workers can call to complain about diversity training.\n",
            "The Damage Is Already Done",
            "Though Rufo, Hawley and others are calling this training Marxist, the capitalists of Corporate America actually seem to like diversity training. Not only because it feels like the right thing to do and it helps foster a welcoming atmosphere for women and people of color, but also because it’s a relatively simple way to deal with the hard issues of racial and sex discrimination.\n",
            "A few years ago, for example, Sephora convened a one-day diversity training after a well-known R&B artist said she was racially profiled at one of the makeup store’s retail outlets.",
            "This week, the traditionally conservative U.S. Chamber of Commerce signed on to a letter to the president from more than 150 business and nonprofit organizations asking Trump to withdraw his executive order.\n",
            "“The [order] is already having a broadly chilling effect on legitimate and valuable D&I training companies use to foster inclusive workplaces, help with talent recruitment, and remain competitive in a country with a wide range of different cultures,” the letter says, noting that the order is ambiguous as to what is and isn’t permissible to discuss in these trainings.\n",
            "There are growing reports that because of the order companies are increasingly wary of continuing with diversity efforts. A few businesses have put programs on hold.\n",
            "The order has a possibly even more harmful effect on universities, especially public institutions loath to risk federal money during a severe recession.\n",
            "The University of Iowa and Texas State University have put programs on ice. John A. Logan College in Illinois canceled its programming, including a talk by an anthropology professor about his own Latino identity.\n",
            "A screening of the movie “Malcolm X” and a planned talk was reportedly canceled at a military nonprofit.\n",
            "Last month, the White House canceled a training on racism and public health at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is currently grappling with the coronavirus pandemic that has disproportionately affected Black and Latino people. The death rate for Black people from COVID-19 is twice that of white people; the rate of infections among Latinos is nearly three times higher than for non-Latino whites. (These are current examples of systemic racism, which Rufo and Trump and other conservatives claim is not real.)\n",
            "Diversity Training Was Hardly Radical, Until Now\n",
            "What’s particularly startling is that diversity training in the workplace is hardly radical stuff. At least not until now. If anything, these efforts have long been criticized as something companies do instead of actually hiring more people of color and women.\n",
            "These trainings have exploded in popularity since the summer, when millions took to the streets to protest police brutality. Companies at the time spoke up, too, asserting that Black lives matter; they doubled down on these kinds of trainings as a way to show their commitment to the cause. Diversity consultants said business was booming.\n",
            "Businesses wanted to find a way to acknowledge what their employees of color were going through in a way that was constructive.",
            "“We knew there was a lot of trauma in the nation and among our employees. We know individuals don’t leave that pain and confusion at the door when we come to work,” Lorraine Cole, director of the Office of Minority and Women Inclusion at the Treasury Department, told a congressional subcommittee in September, explaining why she helped put together an online seminar on racism in June for some federal workers.",
            "“We knew it was important for us to address these issues, not only as a compassionate activity but as an important business decision. We know that this can affect productivity.”",
            "The webinar on June 24 was viewed by 8,500 federal employees and was a pretty open and, at times, moving conversation about race, Floyd’s murder and the experiences of Black Americans in the United States.\n",
            "Notably, it was moderated by Rodney Hood, chairman of the National Credit Union Administration, a Trump appointee and the first African American ever appointed to lead a federal banking agency. He spoke candidly about his experiences with racism in the financial industry.\n",
            "A few weeks later, in mid-July, Rufo, the conservative activist, wrote about the event for his blog, condemning it. The next day, July 17, he wrote about it again, for the New York Post, and also appeared on Laura Ingraham’s Fox News show. (He appeared on her show again this week.)\n",
            "Things settled down a bit as the story circulated on conservative websites. Then on Sept. 2, Rufo appeared on Tucker Carlson’s Fox News show.",
            "On air, Rufo called for the White House to outright ban diversity training.\n",
            "Two days later, the White House put out its first order banning diversity training in federal agencies.",
            "Anatomy Of The Backlash",
            "The conservative media and Rufo appear to believe diversity training is radical and somehow racist and anti-white. In part that’s because they cherry-pick examples to distort meaning.\n",
            "Take the June webinar for federal employees. Critics of the event appear most incensed over not what was discussed but about the text of a supplemental resource guide given to attendees afterward.",
            "Rufo has portrayed the guide as some sort of directive, but really it’s just resources for those who want to learn more: a link to Ta-Nehisi Coates’ seminal Atlantic article “The Case for Reparations,” and oral histories about the civil rights movement. There was also information for people of color looking for counseling or other support during a traumatic time.\n",
            "What got conservatives worked up is a description and link to the work of Robin DiAngelo, the author of “White Fragility: Why It’s So Hard for White People to Talk About Racism,” which hit the bestseller list this summer, as more Americans were buying books about race, and has been criticized among both liberals and conservatives.",
            "The manual links to a video of DiAngelo on YouTube, and there is text next to that link that says: “She discusses the roots of White supremacy, of which she asserts virtually all White people, regardless of how ‘woke’ they are, contribute to racism.”\n",
            "That last clause of that passage has been repeated and replayed in the conservative press as evidence that diversity training teaches people they are racist.\n",
            "Again, that’s not what is happening. For the most part in anti-racism training, Americans are being taught history and sharing their personal experiences with racism in hopes of furthering understanding of why racism persists today and how they fit into that history.\n",
            "“I can tell you definitively that the kind of training Howard and I do is not centered in hating white people,” said Johnnetta Cole, who took part in the conversation that day with the well-regarded diversity consultant Howard Ross on the webinar. Cole is the president emerita of Spelman and Bennett colleges, and president and board chair of the National Council of Negro Women. She’s done consulting work for years.\n",
            "“It is not centered in hating white people. It is centered in trying to understand the current state of our country and how, 401 years ago, language was created. Systems were invented. Policies were made that explained why it was all right to brutally, inhumanely enslave Black people for the economic good of some white folk,” she said.\n",
            "Cole, who is 84 and grew up in the Deep South in the Jim Crow era, characterized the crackdown on diversity training as deep denial of the reality of systemic racism in the United States.\n",
            "“Denial is perhaps among the most dangerous reactions to reality,” she said. “When systemic racism is denied. How will we ever move beyond it?”\n",
            "Twisting The Study Of Critical Race Theory",
            "In his writing and on Fox News, Rufo particularly went after something called critical race theory, which he mischaracterizes as the idea that the U.S. and white people are racist and evil, a line of argument picked up in the conservative press and elsewhere.\n",
            "In fact, critical race theory is a line of legal scholarship that for decades has sought to understand why structural racism persists in the U.S. despite laws on the books ensuring equality and prohibiting discrimination.\n",
            "Why is there a racial wealth gap? Why are Black mortality rates higher than white mortality rates and life expectancy lower? Why is K-12 education still so segregated?\n",
            "Crenshaw, an early pioneer in the field, (she also coined the term “intersectionality”) calls it a framework through which to view history and the law in the U.S. Through the prism of the theory, you might ask, “Why do we still have a society in which it’s predictable who is going to occupy the CEO’s office and who’s going to clean it?” she said. “It’s a way of thinking about race that challenges the idea that we can do away with racial inequality by not paying attention to race at all.”",
            "Typically these aren’t ideas that come up in corporate diversity training. Though, after this summer, more workplaces were open to discussing the roots of inequality and racism in the United States.\n",
            "Some backlash was inevitable, though the fact that it’s coming from the White House was not.\n",
            "The executive order reflects the deepest fears that some white folks have when it comes to diversity, equity and inclusion training, said Evelyn Carter, managing director at Paradigm, a diversity consulting business. (She said the company already lost one client in the wake of Trump’s order.)\n",
            "“Our general stance is that the executive order is meant to sow confusion that will make people pause and wonder if they should keep going,” Carter said. “It is essentially propaganda, and I’m concerned what this means in terms of a descent into fascism.”\n",
            "Oftentimes discussions of racism can bring up a lot of anxiety for those groups in the majority; in this country that’s white people, Carter said. That fear looms large especially for those who have little experience talking about these issues.\n",
            "There’s an underlying fear that conversations about racism will “belie their egalitarian self-concept,” as researchers from the University of Virginia and Northwestern explain in a 2012 paper in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology.\n",
            "In plain terms, they’re afraid that they’ll appear racist if they talk about racism.\n",
            "That fear can trigger defensiveness, anger and lashing out. White people might feel like it’s unfair to have to even hear about discrimination.\n",
            "By shutting down the conversation on race inside the government and within companies and universities, Trump’s order caves to that fear and lets aggrieved and scared white people off the hook.\n",
            "“This is a way to say, if you feel angry that you are being forced to consider a different perspective or being made to feel your identity is being privileged, then we are going to protect you,” Carter said.\n",
            "The executive order and the conservative talk about how anti-racism training is racist are also clearly examples of the backlash against the growing conversation about race in America that’s been taking place since the summer amid protests over the police killing of George Floyd. There’s also a growing fear that more white people are joining the fight against racism.\n",
            "Crenshaw said it’s absolutely necessary to keep the conversation going, as she has in her work for more than 40 years. The idea is to continually work to perfect the American experiment ― and the notion that all people are created equal.\n",
            "“It’s part of what it means to be a part of a society that had a flawed start,” she said. “It’s not easy work to do.”"

        "articleContent": [
            "Another day, another show about murderous intrigue.",
            "“The Undoing” premieres Sunday on HBO, giving Nicole Kidman another prestige project from the network behind the similarly themed “Big Little Lies.” This time Kidman plays Grace Fraser, a wealthy Manhattan therapist who finds her polished lifestyle suddenly unraveling when her husband (Hugh Grant) is accused of killing his paramour Elena (Matilda De Angelis).",
            "Reviews of the six-episode limited series have been mixed, with IndieWire calling it “misguided” and Vulture deeming it “seductive.” But with such star power (Donald Sutherland, Lily Rabe, Noah Jupe and Édgar Ramírez round out the supporting cast), there must be something worthwhile in “The Undoing.”",
            "To find out, HuffPost reporters Leigh Blickley and Matthew Jacobs fired up a few episodes and chatted about their findings.",
            "The Bottom Line",
            "“The Undoing” isn’t fresh enough to constitute must-see TV, but it has plenty of allure, including twisty cliffhangers, a chilly atmosphere and a few exemplary performances.",
            "Cast And Characters",
            "Matthew Jacobs: “The Undoing” couldn’t be more indicative of TV in the early 2020s: two certified movie stars uniting for the sort of pulpy literary adaptation that 25 years ago would have lit up the box office. It’s wealth porn, murder mystery and domestic-discord noir. I was hooked after one episode. What’d you think?",
            "Leigh Blickley: Couldn’t agree more. Give me a thriller set in pre-COVID New York City and I’m all yours. “The Undoing” grabbed my attention the minute Nicole Kidman brushed her teeth in a flowing bathrobe while walking through an enormous, wallpaper-adorned Upper East Side brownstone. The glamour. The predictable terror. It’s also unreal to me that Kidman and Hugh Grant have never worked together before. What a treat for us.",
            "MJ: I suppose “rich people on the verge of a breakdown” has always been Kidman’s specialty (see: “Eyes Wide Shut,” “The Others,” “Birth”), which means David E. Kelley is keeping an entire subgenre alive. Kidman and Grant get equal billing, but it’s really her show, spotty American accent and all. In “Big Little Lies,” her best scenes occurred during therapy sessions. In “The Undoing,” she’s the therapist — arguably not a great one, but that’s another matter — yet that doesn’t provide Grace any detailed understanding of her husband’s behavior. I’ve seen three episodes, and I’m worried the show is too familiar (messy affairs, class disparities) to pull off a real surprise in the end. But I’ll certainly stick around to find out.",
            "LB: Thank you for calling out Kidman’s accent, which perplexed me at times. Grant, luckily, gets to stick with his British brogue playing her husband, respected pediatric oncologist Jonathan Fraser, who seems as dedicated to his family as he is to his relentless job. Yet Jonathan carries some dark secrets ― secrets that blow up the Frasers’ seemingly idyllic life.",
            "Just Another Whodunnit?",
            "LB: “The Undoing” is based on Jean Hanff Korelitz’s novel “You Should Have Known,” which I have not read but might dip into now that I’ve become wrapped up in this story. Have you read it, Matt?",
            "MJ: I haven’t, and I was intrigued when I saw a recent Vulture story call the show “more of a whodunnit than the novel.” That tweak also seems indicative of the Peak TV era. (Or have we already graduated to Post-Peak TV? I can’t keep up.) Maximized intrigue is what keeps people coming back for more, or so networks think. To get a green light, you need cliffhangers. It can be a bit exhausting, but I found the thriller aspects of this show far more absorbing than some of the similar programming we’ve seen this year. I’m thinking of “Little Fires Everywhere,” “Ratched” and the latest “Fargo” season.",
            "LB: Yes, when I went into the series, I was honestly set to give up after an episode or two due to my expectations surrounding these types of series recently. (How many more murder mysteries and/or crime shows do we need, truly?) But I ended up absorbed by Kelley and director Susanne Bier’s storytelling and the way they unravel the psychological states of these characters. Bier zooms all the way in, literally and figuratively, with each passing glance. Her distinct style of filmmaking (“The Night Manager,” “Bird Box”) definitely grabs you.",
            "I also found myself feeling for, and believing, almost all of the men in Grace’s life ― whether that’s Jonathan, their teenage son Henry (played by Noah Jupe) or Grace’s utterly rich and intense socialite father Franklin (Donald Sutherland). The study of these men intrigued me alongside, of course, the analysis of Grace herself ― a therapist who seemingly “should have known” of her husband’s sociopathic tendencies.",
            "MJ: Yes, and the fact that it’s set at a fancy private school seems pretty typical, too. There’s even a high-class charity event at the center, just like there was in “Big Little Lies.” (That show had a lot more humor, though.) But I like the relationship between Grace and Henry, who is mature for his age and forced to confront the complexities of his father’s wrongdoings. How much should Grace tell him? How much can he handle?",
            "Having seen more episodes, what do you make of Elena’s murder? It’s the inciting incident, leading to flashbacks of what came before. The show gives Elena an exoticism that’s both enticing and troubling. She’s a vaguely bisexual, working-class artist whose presence makes the tony Upper East Side moms uncomfortable. But she’s dead and can no longer speak for herself, especially if the back half of the season is just a courtroom drama.",
            "LB: Elena’s introduction is immediately telling ― as a viewer, you can sense she’s at the center of this story from her first closeup. Actress Matilda De Angelis brings a mystery to the character. As we discover more about her following her death, Elena’s enigmatic energy becomes more clear. The mother of two was in a love quadruple of sorts with her husband Fernando (Ismael Cruz Córdova), Jonathan and Grace, all of whom are confused about their feelings for her. This adds to the whodunnit aspect of the series as true intentions start to untangle. Is Jonathan really a killer? Was Grace involved in any way? Did jealousy lead Fernando to murder? Then, of course, supporting players like Henry and Franklin, as well as a lawyer (Noma Dumezweni) and a detective (Édgar Ramírez), muddle everything even more.",
            "Highs And Lows",
            "MJ: To that end, I wonder if “The Undoing” would have been better as a movie. The gradual pacing is going to turn some folks off, and for me, it made Elena seem like even more of a cipher than she’s meant to be. The show is at its best when focused on Grace and her inner circle, yet the whole thing hinges on this inscrutable dead woman whose key trait was living in a different ZIP code. Maybe I’m just a sucker for Noah Jupe, arguably the greatest child actor working today, who carries a ton of weight in the show and holds his own opposite Kidman.",
            "LB: Ever since I saw Jupe in “Wonder,” I’ve been such a fan of his. “A Quiet Place,” “Honey Boy,” “Ford v. Ferrari” — he’s been a solid standout over the years. But you’re right. “The Undoing” has its strengths as a series but could’ve, and maybe should’ve, just been a movie. After all, it’s all said and done in six episodes. Two and a half hours would’ve sufficed?",
            "MJ: And now we’ve pinpointed the problem of Peak TV. Still, the schadenfreude of seeing the 1% unravel hasn’t gone away, and Kidman is reliably great.",
            "So, Should You Watch It?",
            "LB: I must say that out of all the shows I’ve devoured lately, this one really stuck with me. The prep school world of New York’s elite is so enticing, especially when murder is mixed in. And with COVID delays impacting the TV space, a visionary limited series just hits the spot. Plus, Kidman delivers, as does Grant, who’s lately had an impressive run of projects (“Paddington 2” forever).",
            "MJ: There’s a chilliness to Bier’s approach that is undeniably effective. I’m not sure the series can rise above its “rich people problems” trappings, but I’m on board for the journey anyway.",

            "WASHINGTON ― If Donald Trump seems more desperate than most incumbents about the coming election, he may have good reason: Presidents do not typically have to worry about going to prison if they lose.",
            "But Trump’s activities in recent years ― from paying hush money to a porn star to his claiming of a massive tax refund to obstructing an investigation into his campaign’s ties to Russia ― combined with a ticking statute of limitations clock potentially make Election Day far more consequential for him than it had been for his predecessors.",
            "If Trump wins a second term, the time limit for starting a prosecution would run out in the next four years for a number of those activities, given Justice Department guidelines not to prosecute a sitting president. If Trump loses, indictments could quickly follow.",
            "“Winning this election for him is not an option. It’s a necessity,” said Michael Cohen, Trump’s former personal lawyer and “fixer” who was sentenced for, among other charges, arranging illegal payments to keep women he’d had affairs with from speaking out before the 2016 election.",
            "“He knows that if his tax returns are revealed that he and his children ― Don Jr., Ivanka, Eric ― and others will be charged with a host of criminal tax issues, which will not only cost him his freedom but his entire business,” Cohen said.",
            "Neither the White House nor the Trump campaign responded to HuffPost queries for this report.",
            "Trump was already described as “Individual-1” in Cohen’s prosecution. With a five-year statute of limitations for many federal crimes, the clock would run out on the hush money cases in late 2021.",
            "Daniel Goldman, a former federal prosecutor who a year ago served as the lead lawyer in the House’s impeachment of Trump, said an ex-President Trump in 2021 could also face charges of bribery for his commutation of aide Roger Stone’s prison sentence as well as extortion charges for his attempts to coerce Ukraine into smearing his political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden. Trump was impeached for that but was permitted by Republicans in the Senate to remain in office.",
            "“There’s so much criminality here,” said Nick Ackerman, a former federal prosecutor and, prior to that, a prosecutor in the task force created to investigate President Richard Nixon for the 1972 Watergate break-in and subsequent cover-up.",
            "Any federal tax or bank fraud Trump may have committed in the first three years of his first term would likely be beyond the reach of prosecutors if they have to wait until the end of a second term in January 2025. A similar fate could befall Trump’s work to throttle special counsel Robert Mueller’s 2017-2019 investigation into Russia’s work to help Trump win the last presidential campaign.",
            "“Again, it would lapse in a second term,” Ackerman said.",

            "“We’re mindful that as a state actor, our office cannot investigate a president for any official acts and that we cannot prosecute a president while in office,” said Carey Dunne, general counsel for the Manhattan district attorney’s office during oral arguments in May.",
            "The possibility of prosecution and incarceration may explain Trump’s apparent mania in recent months, with repeated use and, at times, abuse of the powers of his office to aid his reelection.",
            "In spring, a mailing to every household in the country from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about the coronavirus prominently included Trump’s name, even though he had spent months downplaying the virus, at one point even calling it a hoax. When the Treasury Department sent out $1,200 relief checks to Americans, those also included Trump’s name.",
            "More recently, Trump has resisted warnings from public health experts to curtail large gatherings by resuming a frantic schedule of the campaign rallies that he believes are key to winning on Nov. 3. He has again started downplaying the virus and insisting ― against all evidence ― that the pandemic is all but over.",
            "And on Tuesday, he added to his baseless claims of “corruption” against Democratic opponent Biden by calling on Attorney General William Barr to open an investigation. “We’ve got to get the attorney general to act. He’s got to act, and he’s got to act fast,” Trump said during a lengthy interview with Fox News. “This is major corruption, and this has to be known about before the election.”",
            "America has a history of treating presidential losers poorly, essentially stamping a giant capital “L” on their foreheads. Democrat Jimmy Carter was scorned, even by many Democrats, after losing in 1980 to Ronald Reagan. Republican Bob Dole, a longtime senator, was left to making self-deprecating television commercials after losing in 1996 to incumbent Bill Clinton.",
            "But though they and others faced ignominy, they never had to worry about the possibility of years of imprisonment in the event of a loss.",
            "The sole possible precedent in American politics is that of Republican Nixon, who resigned from office in 1974 after GOP senators made it clear they would not save him if articles of impeachment regarding his role in the Watergate scandal made it to their chamber. Gerald Ford, who had been appointed Nixon’s vice president in 1973 after the resignation of Spiro Agnew following his indictment for bribery, issued Nixon a blanket pardon just 30 days after assuming the presidency. “I cannot prolong the bad dreams that continue to reopen a chapter that is closed,” Ford said in a taped 10-minute Oval Office speech.",
            "Similarly, just because Trump could face criminal charges does not mean he necessarily will.",
            "Biden, who has run on the theme of bringing the country together and “healing” after Trump’s years in office, in May committed in an MSNBC interview not to pardon Trump but said he would not direct his attorney general to do anything one way or the other. “It is not something the president is entitled to do, to direct a prosecution or decide to drop a case,” Biden said.",
            "Others, though, including Republicans, say it is critical to bringing back a sense of normalcy that a president as openly and regularly lawless as Trump be held to account.",
            "“The integrity of our constitutional republic depends on holding our elected leaders accountable. Trump is no exception,” said Rick Tyler, a GOP consultant who worked on Texas Sen. Ted Cruz’s 2016 bid for president.",

And I was determined not to insert myself in their lives until Doug and I had established we were in this for the long haul. Children need consistency; I didn’t want to insert myself into their lives as a temporary fixture because I didn’t want to disappoint them. There’s nothing worse than disappointing a child.”",

            "“When the day finally came, I had butterflies in my stomach. The plan was to go to a seafood hut off the Pacific Coast Highway called the Reel Inn, a favorite of the kids. On my way to meet Doug, I picked up a tin of cookies and tied a ribbon in a bow around them. I took a few deep breaths. I was excited, and I was nervous. I rehearsed what I would say. Would the kids think the cookies were really nice or really weird? Was the ribbon too much?”",
            "On Her Relationship With Doug’s Ex-Wife",
            "“To know Cole and Ella is to know that their mother Kerstin is an incredible mother. Kerstin and I hit it off ourselves and are dear friends. She and I became a duo of cheerleaders in the bleachers at Ella’s swim meets and basketball games, often to Ella’s embarrassment. We sometimes joke that our modern family is almost a little too functional.”",

The thing about blended families — if everyone approaches it in the way that there’s plenty of love to share, then it works. And we have plenty of love to share within our extended family.”",
            "On Her Stepkids",

            "On Balancing Work And Family",
            "“I sought the advice of my female colleagues in the Senate. And it was Maggie Hassan, the senator from New Hampshire, who offered me some sage wisdom. ‘Our kids love us for who we are and the sacrifices we make,’ she said. ‘They get it.’ I believe you don’t have to be a U.S. senator or a candidate for president of the United States for that to ring true. Time is precious, and so many of us understand the struggle to seek balance.”",
            "On Supporting All Families",
            "“That’s one of the things [Joe Biden and I] have in common. My children don’t call me stepmom, they call me Momala. We’re a very modern family. Their mom is a close friend of mine. ... Joe and I have a similar feeling that really is how we approach leadership: family in every version that it comes.”"

            "Another Borat movie shouldn’t exist. Not because “Borat Subsequent Moviefilm: Delivery of Prodigious Bribe to American Regime for Make Benefit Once Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan” is bad, but because Sacha Baron Cohen’s infamous troublemaker seems too recognizable to pull off the same stunts he did in 2006. Back then, Borat and his boxy gray suit (or was it blue?) were anonymous enough to trick unsuspecting locals into showing how much intolerance they were willing to tolerate. The entire thing was a litmus test for participants and moviegoers alike, a study in offensive stereotypes weaponized to provoke reactions. The joke was on us, and it was too specific to repeat.",
            "And yet here we are.",
            "Premiering Friday on Amazon Prime Video, “Borat Subsequent Moviefilm” resurrects its titular Kazakh journalist to confront the seismic changes the United States has undergone in the intervening years. Borat’s latest mission? To deliver a gift to someone in Donald Trump’s inner circle — he decides it’ll be “ladies’ man” Mike Pence — so America will consider Kazakhstan an ally. Even though Trump peddles some of the same prejudices, Borat can’t present the souvenir directly to the president because of that one time he defecated outside a Trump tower. The “souvenir” turns out to be his 15-year-old daughter, Tutar (hilarious 24-year-old newcomer Maria Bakalova), who is trained to believe that women belong in cages and who is described as “too old” for Rudy Giuliani.",
            "The question any Borat fan (or nonfan) wants to know is whether the sequel is funny, to which I respond in the affirmative. Baron Cohen’s quick-witted fish-out-of-water humor still excels, for the most part, and at times it can feel particularly pointed given America’s current condition. En route to a conservative convention where Pence will downplay COVID-19 concerns, Borat visits a social media influencer who touts the “sugar baby” lifestyle, a dress saleswoman who cracks up when Borat asks where he can find the “‘no means yes’ section,” a cosmetic surgeon who offers to give Tutar a nose job and breast augmentation for $22,000, and a pair of macho conspiracy theorists who blame the coronavirus on Bill Clinton. The somewhat cruel tension derived from duping people who don’t know they’re part of a mockumentary is still entertaining. Borat circumnavigates the fame monster by dressing incognito.",
            "But for all of Baron Cohen’s insensitive posturing, these movies contain a surprisingly humanistic through line. Entering scenarios with Americans who believe he really is just some foreign reporter with a garbled accent, Baron Cohen lets racists be racist and misogynists be misogynistic. But he also encounters a handful of folks who do nothing of the sort. In the first “Borat” film, he found a group of Alabamans who patiently explained rudimentary restroom etiquette despite his coarse antics. In “Subsequent Moviefilm,” he meets two sweet Jewish ladies who embrace him even though he is wearing a long plastic nose and talons. When he leaves Tutar in the care of a babysitter, she shows genuine interest in the girl’s wellbeing and teaches her that women have rights.",
            "Sometimes these encouraging exchanges get lost in the “Borat” discourse, especially given how many lawsuits arose after the original became a commercial smash. But they’re even more important this time around, partly because the everyday bigotry coursing through the film feels far less novel than it did circa 2006. Baron Cohen’s jokes hinge on the idea that America does not recognize its own provincialism, but that has been the subtext of late-night quips, John Oliver gags and viral tweets for the past four years. It’s not surprising to see a crowd cheer as Borat sings off-key about how Barack Obama should go to jail. What is surprising is that Borat returns to the babysitter’s home later in the movie, after COVID-19 has spread, and she still takes the time to show him compassion when she doesn’t have to.",
            "Humanism aside, we have to talk about one scene in particular: the one with Giuliani. Maybe you’ve already heard about it. Late in the film, Tutar poses as a very bad television journalist who lands an interview with a very willing Giuliani. She goads him into flirting (not that it takes much effort) and eventually asks if he’d like to have a drink with her in a nearby bedroom. There, she encourages him to untuck his shirt, and suddenly his hand is reaching inside his pants, until Borat bursts in and interrupts. It is a damning moment for Giuliani, who appears oblivious to his own creepiness.",
            "That moment explains the ethos of “Borat Subsequent Moviefilm.” Baron Cohen aims higher with his targets than he did before, clearly anxious to explore Trump-era sensibilities as our prelude to the 2020 election comes to a close. His non-“Borat” work has been spotty, but this particular iteration of his satire still has a lot to say for anyone mature enough to grasp it. Even when the material isn’t as fresh and sophisticated as it was 14 years ago, there’s an ingenuity to what Baron Cohen is doing. And if nothing else, his commitment to the bit is impressive. Apparently, he spent five days in character while quarantining with the conspiracy theorists.",
            "Comedy’s drastically changed intuitions about what will pass muster are another reason a “Borat” sequel seemed unlikely. Mainstream movies — the kind that once would get nationwide multiplex releases, at least — are now designed to be as inoffensive as possible. Yet here’s one trafficking in humor that is nakedly anti-Semitic, jingoistic, racist, homophobic and/or misogynistic. I’m shocked a major corporation was willing to back Baron Cohen’s shamelessness, which can be so easily misinterpreted. Then again, COVID-19 theater closures aside, it’s telling that Fox — the studio behind the original, since acquired by toothless Disney — had nothing to do with the new film’s existence. A streaming service less reliant on box-office figures picked up the torch instead. Of course.",
            "Directed by Jason Woliner, whose credits include sitcom “Parks and Recreation” and popular Adult Swim farces, “Borat Subsequent Moviefilm” defies a lot of what Hollywood wants from its comedies in the age of social media backlash. But what I keep coming back to is the fact that Borat does (sort of) learn how to be a better person by the sequel’s end. It’s not preachy or overly contrived, nor is it wildly unique. But it’s a necessary evolution for a character who is finally realizing that he’s not the king of the castle."

            "“David Byrne’s American Utopia” begins with Byrne alone onstage, crooning about different parts of the human brain. Bathed in a soft blue glow, he sits at a table, barefoot, for a few minutes. Byrne first rises when another person emerges from behind the shimmering backdrop. Seconds later, someone else steps forward. They join him in song, at one point leaning on each other like conjoined twins. Together, the three of them — Byrne and his principal support — set the tone for the show, gliding across the stage with outstretched arms, their movements welcoming the audience to something both intimate and grand.",
            "Those two dancer/singer/expressionist extraordinaires are Chris Giarmo and Tendayi Kuumba. Without them, “American Utopia” wouldn’t be what it is. The filmed version of Byrne’s concert, directed by Spike Lee and newly available on HBO, makes that abundantly clear. Giarmo and Kuumba often flank Byrne, wearing cerulean eyeshadow and loud red lipstick. Lee’s camera makes them part of the main attraction.",
            "That egalitarian approach reflects the spirit of Byrne’s show, which toured the world in 2018 and set up shop on Broadway in 2019. Through his solo work and with the Talking Heads, Byrne has always made music that speaks to everyday concerns. Between songs in “American Utopia,” his pithy monologues address the everyday concerns of today: fascistic governments, voter turnout, television and unwanted houseguests. His singers, dancers and musicians, all of whom performed live without a backing track, are part of an interconnected whole. They aren’t just a garnish meant to direct attention to the headliner.",
            "Because Giarmo and Kuumba have such a memorable presence in “American Utopia,” I spoke to the two of them via Zoom about what it was like to be part of the production, the surprising makeup advice they received from Lee and celebrity guests they spotted in the crowd.",
            "Getting Started",
            "Giarmo and Kuumba came to “American Utopia” through two very different routes, but what appealed to both was Byrne’s desire to address the state of the nation. Giarmo had worked with Byrne before, serving as assistant choreographer on the tour that accompanied his 2008 album “Everything That Happens Will Happen Today.” During those rehearsals, Giarmo mentioned he was the captain of his high school color-guard team, so when Byrne mounted his color-guard-esque 2016 show “Contemporary Color,” he again enlisted Giarmo’s help. Kuumba, on the other hand, had never met Byrne. She replaced another performer during the tour. Whatever stage the cast graced, they did so without shoes.",
            "Giarmo: I emailed David Byrne and said, “I hear you’re looking for backup singers that can dance. I’m free.” But of course that email was after working with him for 10 years on various things. He said, “Would you also be willing to be dance captain?” I said, “Sure, let’s do it.”",
            "Kuumba: I was coming from another tour and I got off the plane and turned my phone on and had an email from David that said, “Hi, would you like to join my show?” Honestly, I had to google to say, “Is this real?” First I thought it was spam because, if you know David and his personality, which I appreciate so much, the email was written majority in all lowercase letters. Long story short, Lizzy Dement is the assistant choreographer to [lead choreographer Annie-B Parson]. We worked together on a different piece, “Electric Lucifer.” They were looking for someone that could be a vocalist and a mover. I basically had about two weeks to rearrange my whole schedule and learn all 24 songs, both for festivals and for theaters, which are very different.",
            "Giarmo: We all just came together and figured it out. There was a lot of trust and a lot of freedom, I think, in how we put it all together initially.",
            "Kuumba: We’re movers and dancers anyways, so I’m comfortable without shoes all the time. To me, it seems so normal. I’m like, “I’m barefoot all the time, just as life and profession.”",
            "Giarmo: I would say it’s maybe the first time I’ve really gotten a pedicure to make sure my feet look good. I’ve never been filmed that close-up. But Annie-B Parson, her company, Big Dance Theater, I’ve performed with them since 2005, and I’ve never worn shoes in any of those shows. Maybe for Broadway that’s weird, but it’s actually kind of the norm in the dance world, generally.",
            "They Dance Like This",
            "The choreography is another extension of Byrne’s democratic vision for the show. He wanted the movement to be naturalistic. Some of it can seem deceptively accessible, like something you or I could replicate at home. For Giarmo and Kuumba, “deceptive” is the key word.",
            "Giarmo: The thing I think you’re responding to is that the kinesphere is really small. Kinesphere is what space your body takes up. A big high kick is a big kinesphere. I won’t speak for Annie-B, but I know she’s said this about dance before: Her fascination with dance is this catharsis of, “Everyone has a body.” So when we see a body onstage moving, whether or not we can do that movement in that way, we have something in us that responds to that and is like, “I feel that.” I think using pedestrian movement just means taking formal movement that seems like it’s naturalistic or something that people would just do normally, like a normal gesture, but formally warping that and modifying it and making it something else, elevating it. You could look at it and say, “Oh, I could do that.” There’s something I think that’s actually welcoming and inviting.",
            "Kuumba: I definitely came with being a mover and touring with dance companies that are rooted in very big movement. When coming into this work, I got approached many times like, “Oh this must be a piece of cake for you.” I’m like, “You know, you would think that.” I think part of that is shaped specifically from Annie-B and knowing David. It is shaped in a way so that it does look accessible because we’re not the only two that are dancing. The rest of the band is moving as well, and they’re not all technically movers, as well as David. We all have to be able to complement each other.",
            "Giarmo: As someone that has done it for so long, I would say that there are fully dances that you can do. Please, do the “Naïve Melody” dance with us. Easy-peasy, it’s going to be fine. I will also say if you try to do some of the other dances with us, you’re going to lose your goddamn mind. There’s some stuff that looks very easy but is really hard.",
            "Kuumba: It lives in the body — how, even if something looks small, it actually can sometimes be that much more strenuous or that much more complex because the work it takes to make it look small on a big stage actually requires a lot more than you would think.",
            "Giarmo: Even before the tour began, there was so much discussion and creative work with David just from a technological perspective. Formally, this is like something nobody’s ever seen before, but technologically, it’s also that. Every single person had in-ear monitors with their own individual mix. I think there was something like 90 wireless mic channels overall. Every musician is wireless. Everything is live. The lighting is also this crazy high-tech thing. It’s a system called BlackTrax where we each have RFID sensors sewn into our suits, and so all the lights have cameras that can track them.",
            "Finding The Politics In ‘Utopia’",
            "A lot of Byrne’s music uses surreal imagery to address the passage of time and the way individualism haunts humanity. “Once in a Lifetime,” arguably Talking Heads’ most famous song, is about experiencing life on autopilot, while “I Should Watch TV,” a soaring rock anthem he recorded with St. Vincent, finds Byrne turning to the boob tube “to know what folks were thinking.”",
            "During “American Utopia,” Byrne made the political subtext more overt (though never preachy). He points out that many of his musicians are immigrants and announces voter-registration tables in the theater’s lobby. But the most powerful moment comes toward the show’s end, when Byrne and his band cover “Hell You Talmbout,” a Janelle Monáe protest chant that lists the names of Black Americans killed by police violence. Byrne saw Monáe perform the song at the Women’s March on Washington in 2017 and asked her permission before including it.",
            "Kuumba: When I first was asked to be a part of the show, seeing that David decided to do this song was the reason that I said yes. Because one, I’m a Black woman and I am consistently being aware of who I work with and why and how and in what capacity and the many ways I’m representing myself and my community and having artistic integrity. For an older white man to put this in his work when he does not have to necessarily, to not have to be accountable for these things, for him to take that choice and not only just implement it in the show, but continuously implement this from day one was the main reason why I said yes. I was like, “OK, I can fuck with this.”",
            "Giarmo: We did modify it almost everywhere we went around the world. We added names and we changed names depending on where we were, which is really unfortunate. In America, you could pretty much find an unarmed Black person that was murdered by the police in almost every place that we toured. It was a really interesting experience. We had a lot of discussions about it on the bus at the beginning when we were on the road: where it is in the show, how it works with the show. It was a really experiential process for us. On the road, it was our last encore. It was the final song.",
            "Kuumba: I felt like with this song specifically and with Broadway, my mom had an understanding because we had some confusions when we first went to Broadway [where they performed “Talmbout” earlier in the setlist]. Like, “No, this is supposed to be the last song. When did the switch come around?” But as we know, it’s Broadway, the Great White Way, and we’re down the street from “Lion King” and “Frozen.” My mom was just summing it up as, “It seems that he’s taking this approach and is trying to bring us through to the other side of leaving with hope.” I think on tour it was a really wonderful way of ending it because it’s very easy to get into this euphoric mindset when you go to a concert and leave feeling on cloud nine to escape your reality. Since we’re living in this home on Broadway, I think you can’t necessarily throw mud on everybody and walk away and come back the next day over and over again. In the realistic world that we live in, we know we have to hold hands and walk people through difficult moments. I think that David took it upon himself to find a way of how to come out on the other side with “One Fine Day” and “Road to Nowhere.” We’re still on a road to nowhere, but we can do this together.",
            "GIarmo: It’s a really important message that a lot of his audience might not hear coming from someone that doesn’t look like them. David has this privilege and opportunity to maybe reach an older, white audience that wouldn’t find Janelle Monáe on their own.",
            "Enter Spike Lee",
            "To preserve “American Utopia,” Byrne called upon Lee, who has previously filmed a Luciano Pavarotti benefit concert, “The Original Kings of Comedy” and the Broadway musical “Passing Strange.” Byrne told The New York Times he sought out Lee because of the director’s visual flair and willingness to confront social issues. Lee didn’t merely record the show, though. He immersed himself in it so the final product would feel as dynamic as possible. (Lee had to live up to the legacy of “Stop Making Sense,” the beloved Talking Heads concert film directed by the great Jonathan Demme.) So he set up overhead cameras, plotted out meticulous angles that emphasize the performers’ movements and captured the show multiple times alongside cinematographer Ellen Kuras (“Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind”). By then, the magic of the experience was evident to everyone involved.",
            "Giarmo: I think it’s always great to talk about how long things take. Spike did come and see our show 20 times before he filmed it. He is a genius, clearly, but he also saw it 20 times. It’s a lot of work.",
            "Kuumba: Aside from him filming the live show once, we did extra shots with a limited audience and he was really trying to get these close-cut angles that he may have felt really passionate about. It felt like we were all understanding it more once we kept going through the process of the motions. There were some actual conversations of specific angles that were being caught. I know that bird’s-eye-view angle is very beautiful and important, especially for “Burning Down the House,” to capture these beautiful formations that we do.",
            "Giarmo: Spike Lee did tell me to wear red lipstick. I’d been doing a nudy pink. He said that wasn’t enough. It was a really exciting surprise to get that note. He was like, “I need you to have fire-engine red, FDNY red, and I need the nails to match.” I’m a drag queen, so a matte red lip is a tricky lip, for all your readers out there that may not understand the nuances. Especially a liquid lipstick. You’ve got to make sure you have the right brand, the right finish, one that’s going to last through the show. I had to experiment for a couple performances to make sure that it was the right one.",
            "Kuumba: You would always see his glasses peeking over the edge of the stage in the corner. Like, “What is that? Oh, Spike.”",
            "Giarmo: The icing on the damn cake was when Mavis Staples came and saw our show. Then after the show, she was just hanging out and started singing and a bunch of us just sang “Slippery People” with Mavis Staples.",
            "Kuumba: Sometimes you just get surprised and you look at each other onstage like, “Is that who I think it is?” Bette Midler fucked my mind.",
            "Giarmo: She had a turban and sunglasses. Seeing the film, I was thrilled to see all of the little tidbits, for lack of a better term, like the musical-theater cheesiness that we bring. I will say, at least for me, when I knew that Bette Midler was in the audience, I kicked that up a couple of octaves.",
            "Kuumba: Michelle Obama came. I don’t think we knew until that day, though. You’ve got to know for security reasons. Sometimes it’s a really nice surprise and you just ham it up a little bit.",
            "Giarmo: I think maybe on most Broadway shows there’s more of a fourth wall where the actors don’t look [at the audience]. We’re used to these concerts where it’s all about looking at people and connecting to individuals. On Broadway, we just did the same thing. It’s so funny. You’re looking into people’s eyes and encouraging them. At first I think people were scared. Or, “You can see me? What?” But no, you’re here too. It’s cool. Come on.",
            "Kuumba: “Once in a Lifetime,” one moment that hit me was just from touring. I remember one show, this one kid just bawling his eyes out in the front row. It just gives such a sense of freedom onstage. We’re just shifting and moving through each other’s space, jumping and dancing with everybody in the audience. There were some really emotional moments that I captured every time we sang that song that I saw in specific audience members. And I always love to connect with other fellow Black women in the crowd that jump up and sing with me. It’s like I’m a stake in a part of this history, and it feels sweet.",

They work by turning water that’s been mixed with essential oils into vapor. Nebulizing diffusers don’t use water, and instead use air to shoot the essential oils out as a mist. Evaporative diffusers, commonly known as reed diffusers, use small reed sticks to absorb the oil and emit the scent. Heat diffusers use an open flame or electricity to melt wax, similar to how melted candle wax gives off scent.",

            "If you vote in person during the Nov. 3 presidential election, you may be asked to fill out a provisional ballot. Provisional ballots, also called affidavit ballots, are given to a voter when a question arises about that person’s eligibility.",
            "Such a situation may occur if your name does not appear on the voter rolls, or if you did not bring proper identification, or, in some states, if you received a mail-in ballot but are trying to vote in person instead.",
            "Provisional ballots, which are specially marked, are intended to prevent disenfranchisement. If election officials later determine that a person who cast a provisional ballot is in fact eligible, their provisional ballot is counted just like a normal one.",
            "“The point of provisional ballots is to be able to give voters who think that a mistake was made [about their eligibility] the opportunity to cast a ballot that will count, while at the same time giving elections administrators a chance to look at their records and make an assessment on whether there was eligibility,” said Myrna Pérez, director of the New York-based Brennan Center’s Voting Rights and Elections Program.",
            "With so many people being sent or requesting mail-in ballots in 2020, Pérez said she expects to see a higher number of provisional ballots cast than usual. In some states, if you originally requested or automatically received a mailed ballot but later decide you want to vote in person, you may be given a provisional ballot so officials can check that you aren’t voting twice.",
            "In New Jersey, for example, changing your mind and voting in person will require casting a provisional ballot that will be counted once officials determine you have not already mailed your previous one.",
            "The most common reasons provisional ballots are rejected",
            "The top two reasons provisional ballots end up not counting are because a person wasn’t registered in the state (40.2%) or because they were registered but voted in the wrong precinct or jurisdiction (24.3%), according to a 2018 Election Administration and Voting Survey.",
            "In at least 19 states, your provisional ballot will be partially counted if you vote in the wrong precinct. This means your vote will count toward races in which you would have been eligible to vote regardless of precinct, such as a federal offices, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
            "States have varying timeframes for how quickly they process provisional ballots after Election Day, but the ultimate decision on your vote should not be a mystery. You have the right to get an explanation in writing from your local election official for how to check if your provisional ballot was counted.",
            "“You are supposed to be given a piece of paper that tells you how you find out if your provisional ballot was counted, or whether it was counted and what notice and opportunities you have,” Pérez said. “Not everybody gives [voters] the form.”",
            "Pérez said you should not wait for your state’s canvassing deadline to follow up, especially if you need to take further action before your vote can be counted. Sometimes, for example, people who forgot to bring ID on Election Day will need to verify their identity at a local elections office in order for their provisional ballot to count.",
            "“If it were my vote, I would call the very next day,” Pérez said. “I’d call the election office, I would tell them, ’This is what I did. What do I need to do? Where do I get to bring my information? Anything I felt like I didn’t understand, I would be on top of the very next day.”",
            "Not every state does provisional ballots, but some do A LOT.",
            "Under the 2002 Help America Vote Act, states are required to give registered voters the option of casting provisional ballots if their eligibility is in question. This isn’t necessary in states that have same-day voter registration, like Idaho, Minnesota and New Hampshire. Nor is the option pertinent in North Dakota, where simply being an official state resident automatically allows one to vote.",
            "In the 2016 presidential election, two-thirds of all provisional ballots were cast in just a handful of states: California (which accounted for more than half of those issued), Arizona, New York and Ohio, according to the Election Assistance Commission.",

            "California",
            "Some of the common reasons for getting a provisional ballot include:",
            "You moved but did not update your voter registration record to reflect it.\nYour name does not appear on the list of registered voters and the eligibility to vote cannot be verified at the polling place.\nYour name, unless it is a changed surname, or address is different than what is listed on the roster lists.\nYou did not surrender a received vote-by-mail ballot and the precinct board, vote center election board, or elections official cannot verify if you have returned your voted vote-by-mail ballot.",
            "You can look up the number to call to check your provisional ballot by county.",
            "New York",

            "Don’t count yourself out of the voting process, though. “If you believe that you are eligible, you can still vote,” as New York City’s Board of Elections emphasizes. “Ask for an affidavit ballot. After the election, the Board of Elections... will check its records and your vote will be counted if you are indeed eligible to vote and are at the correct poll site.”",

            "If you do not bring proof of your identity when you cast your provisional ballot, you must appear in person at your local board of elections headquarters to provide ID within seven days so your vote can be counted, according to the Ohio Secretary of State’s explainer."

            "“Vestis facit virum,” wrote Catholic priest and social critic Erasmus in Latin during the Middle Ages, arguing that “clothes make the man.” The adage rings even truer in the era of social media influencers and constant streaming, during which highly calibrated and staged photos make the rounds in the blink of an eye. Images depicting folks in carefully curated outfits and scenarios have an immediate and lasting impact, directly imbuing the photographed clothes with deep meaning.",
            "Few current-day women’s sartorial choices have been dissected more than those of first lady Melania Trump, whose politics we can only assume given her marriage to President Donald Trump, but haven’t heard her ever really discuss. So opaque is Melania Trump as a person and so thirsty for information is the public that the first lady’s clothes have represented her assumed political stance, in many cases. But what is she saying? And, perhaps most important, is she even saying anything at all with her clothing?",
            "“I think she stands for herself and nothing more than that,” New York University professor and media historian Moya Luckett told HuffPost. “I think she stands for an upwardly mobile immigrant from Eastern Europe who has become incredibly powerful but, with that, has not become as visible as she might like.”",
            "“Is it sillier to acknowledge the strategy behind appearance, or to pretend such influences don’t exist?” wrote fashion director and chief fashion critic for The New York Times Vanessa Friedman back in 2017, when discussing Melania’s style. The question, rhetorically presented to a public both constantly critiquing Melania Trump’s outfits and Friedman’s own critiques of them, is followed by the writer’s explanation of the first lady’s unique position. “In the current White House, it is Melania whose clothes may be the most telling,” Friedman wrote. “Not because she is a woman, but because since the election she has rarely spoken, retreating to her penthouse in New York.”",
            "“I think first ladies are kind of like the royal family in that they often don’t speak,” Luckett said. “Instead, their clothes make the statement for them, but those statements don’t just come from, ‘I happen to like this dress’ but branding, marketing, stylists and communications experts [are involved].”",
            "For Melania, that team is currently headed by freelance designer and consultant Hervé Pierre, who works as her de facto stylist. In 2017, he designed the first lady’s gown for the inaugural balls — a white off-shoulder dress with a high slit and a red silk belt around it — and still works with her today (he also designed clothes for the previous three first ladies).",
            "Praised for its elegance, the above mentioned outfit joins a roster of others that seem to define her personal style — which may overall be considered chic and coastal elite, a product of her life in New York prior to her arrival inside the White House.",
            "Some examples include the flowy white Dior dress she donned while unveiling the White House Christmas decorations in November 2017 ...",
            "... The eye-catching Celine knee-length dress she debuted on a diplomatic trip to Ghana in October of 2018 ...",
            "... The $3,500 Loro Piana one-piece jumpsuit we saw while she was visiting Tokyo’s Digital Art Museum alongside Japan’s former first lady Akie Abe in May 2019 ...",
            "... And what she wore while visiting the Korean War Memorial in June of this year: a $1,300 Rosetta Getty dress with white leather Manolo Blahnik stilettos.",
            "Criticism Of The First Lady’s Style",
            "Some of the first lady’s choices, though, have not been spared criticism.",
            "Take her four-country solo trip to Africa in 2018, for example, when she was photographed wearing a pith helmet in Kenya, a fashion choice that led to a barrage of criticisms given the hat’s racist history. Donned by European colonial armies in both Asia and Africa toward the end of the 19th century and eventually sported by Westerners in the tropics, the pith helmet reminds many of colonial oppression. Following a slew of condemnations, Melania Trump stated in an interview: “I wish people would focus on what I do and not what I wear.”",
            "Back in 2019, Pierre told WWD that his client’s fashion choices are not meant to “subliminally cast political messages.” His statement was in reaction to the public’s scrutiny of a Burberry dress — a British brand — she wore at Trump’s second State of the Union speech, which was delivered while Brexit negotiations made headlines across Europe and the United States. “It has nothing to do with England or Brexit,” Pierre said. “If I would have to think of all these things when I look at dresses and outfits, I would lose my mind.”",
            "Luckett begs to differ: “I don’t think anyone in that position and degree of power and visibility could possibly not be surrounded by advisors who are very aware that every item of clothing makes a statement,” she said.",
            "Another fashion selection that drew nearly hysteric denunciations was the first lady’s decision to not wear a headscarf while visiting Saudi Arabia, a country where women are legally and religiously required to cover their hair in public.",
            "Then there were the sky-high (and beautiful) stilettos that she was seen in while boarding a plane to Texas to survey the devastation caused by Hurricane Harvey. Although the first lady changed into sneakers before de-boarding, critics found her high-fashion footwear selection to be at odds with the sentiments elicited by Hurricane Harvey and a potential impediment when actually carrying out her official task once in Texas.",
            "It’s important to note that, at least at the start of her husband’s presidency, a lot of designers — a group that tends to be more progressive than not — simply refused to dress Trump’s wife. Since then, she’s donned the likes of Gabriela Hearst, known for her sustainable clothing, and Gucci, also associated with a progressive agenda.",
            "But in what will likely be the fashion selection connected to her legacy, Melania wore a now-infamous Zara jacket in June 2018 while visiting a detention center for migrant children on the border. “I Really Don’t Care, Do U?” read the back of the coat. The outfit was condemned for its supposed immigration-related remarks, while others noted it was one of the few affordable items the first lady donned during her role in the White House.",
            "Whether you’re a staunch supporter of the first lady’s style selections or an ardent fault-finder, one thing is certain: clothes elicit reactions, provoke thoughts and tug at one’s heartstrings. But that, perhaps, says more about us — a captive audience — than about the first lady herself."

            "Nearly four years after her breakout song became synonymous with women’s rights, MILCK is tackling another topical issue through music.",
            "Last week, the Los Angeles-based singer-songwriter unveiled the music video for her latest track, “Somebody’s Beloved,” a collaboration with British artist Bipolar Sunshine. The emotional clip, directed by Malik Martin and viewable above, follows a Black woman as she spends the day with her young daughter.",
            "Together, the pair enjoy breakfast and create placards for a demonstration against racial inequality. By the video’s conclusion, however, it’s revealed that the woman’s act of protest is rooted in personal trauma.",
            "MILCK, whose real name is Connie Lim, told HuffPost she hopes “Somebody’s Beloved” can “soften the vitriol that is coursing through the veins of our society” at a politically divisive moment for the U.S. and the world at large. She said she was inspired to write the song after reading an interview with Breonna Taylor’s mother, Tamika Palmer.",
            "Taylor, a Kentucky medical worker who was shot dead by police in March during a botched raid on her home, has come to be seen as an emblematic figure in the Black Lives Matter movement. After delving into Palmer’s words about her daughter, MILCK said, “the verses started pouring out of me.”",
            "“I knew the subject matter I was writing about was bigger than me, and as an Asian American woman who grew up with privilege, I may have some major blind spots,” she explained. “However, I want to show up and learn. If I do it imperfectly, I can learn, because I think it’s better than not showing up at all.”",
            "“Somebody’s Beloved” is being released in partnership with Tom Shadyac’s Tennessee-based nonprofit, One Family Memphis. For MILCK, however, artistry and advocacy work have always been intertwined. In 2015, she wrote and recorded “Quiet,” reflecting her experience with sexual abuse as a teen. The track broke into the cultural stratosphere two years later when she performed it live with 26 female a cappella singers at the inaugural Women’s March in Washington, D.C., one day after President Donald Trump’s inauguration.",
            "FIlmmaker Alma Har’el captured the “Quiet” performance for posterity, later uploading the video footage to Twitter. The clip was then shared by Emma Watson and Debra Messing, among other stars. Since then, it’s also been covered by performers around the world.",
            "In 2018, MILCK included the song on “This Is Not the End,” her debut EP for Atlantic Records. Her latest EP, “Into Gold,” featured five “healing anthems for the human spirit,” including “If I Ruled the World,” the lyric video for which was featured on HuffPost in February.",
            "Though MILCK hoped to promote “Into Gold” by hitting the road and performing live, the reality of 2020 forced her to make other plans. Forced to self-isolate amid the COVID-19 pandemic, she opted instead to return to the recording studio.",
            "“Letting go of the need to create has actually helped me create,” she said.",
            "And just as “Quiet” inadvertently marked the start of the Trump era, MILCK is hopeful that “Somebody’s Beloved” will be a harbinger of new leadership. Still, she’s reminded that “there is a lot more work to be done” regardless of the results of the 2020 election.",
            "“This is a marathon,” she said. “Fortunately [and] unfortunately, we will have to defend our democracy for the rest of each of our lives.”"

            "Right fielder Manuel Margot squeezed Aledmys Diaz’s flyball in his glove for the final out and fireworks burst overhead as the Rays began to celebrate the AL pennant in an NL ballpark, a byproduct of the pandemic-shortened season.",
            "“If you don’t know the name by now, they better learn them, because we’ve we got some boys who can play,” said Kiermaier, the Rays’ longest-tenured player.",
            "That would start with Arozarena, who set a rookie record with his seventh home run — a two-run shot in the first — and was chosen ALCS MVP.",
            "“Randy Arozarena, I don’t have any words to describe what he’s done, what he’s meant to us this postseason,” manager Kevin Cash said. “For him to have a bat in his hand with an opportunity for a big home run, really, I think it settled a lot of people in the dugout. It certainly did me.”",
            "Arozarena, a relative unknown before the postseason, has brought power and some serious dance moves to the Rays.",
            "“I wouldn’t say I was chasing MVP, but I was just trying to do everything for the team, anything to allow us to win,” the 25-year-old left fielder said through a translator.",
            "Arozarena did Cristiano Ronaldo’s famous goal celebration after his homer and again after receiving the MVP. Eight nights earlier, he threw down a breakdancing move to win a dance-off with Brett Phillips while the Rays celebrated their AL Division Series win against the New York Yankees.",
            "Tampa Bay’s only other World Series appearance was in 2008, when it lost to the Philadelphia Phillies in five games.",

            "The Rays also kept the Astros from becoming the first team to win a pennant with a losing regular-season record (29-31).",
            "The loss ended Houston’s first season since its sign-stealing scandal was revealed. The Astros were viewed by many fans as villains for their role in the cheating scandal en route to the 2017 title against the Dodgers, a scam that eventually cost manager AJ Hinch and general manager Jeff Luhnow their jobs.",
            "Under new manager Dusty Baker, the Astros were trying to reach the World Series for the third time in four seasons. They lost Game 7 to Washington last year.",

This team is a bunch of fighters with a tremendous amount of perseverance and fortitude. One thing is for sure. We’ll be back in this position next year.”",
            "Mike Zunino homered and drove in two runs for the Rays, who avoided the ignominy of joining the 2004 New York Yankees, who took a 3-0 lead in the ALCS and lost four straight to the Red Sox. Boston went on to win its first World Series in 86 seasons.",

            "Until he started showing his October power, Arozarena was best known for a gaffe he committed while with the St. Louis Cardinals last postseason.

He signed with Tampa Bay as a free agent before the 2019 season and won the wild card game at Oakland last year. The Rays were then eliminated by the Astros in the ALDS.",

            "On March 20, 2018, President Donald Trump sat beside Saudi crown prince Muhammed bin Salman at the White House and lifted a giant map that said Saudi weapons purchases would support jobs in “key” states — including Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida and Ohio, all of which were crucial to Trump’s 2016 election victory.",
            "“Saudi Arabia has been a very great friend and a big purchaser of equipment … but if you look, in terms of dollars, $3 billion, $533 million, $525 million — that’s peanuts for you. You should have increased it,” Trump said to the prince, who was (and still is) overseeing a military campaign in Yemen that has deployed U.S. weaponry to commit scores of alleged war crimes.",
            "Trump has used his job as commander-in-chief to be America’s arms-dealer-in-chief in a way no other president has since Dwight Eisenhower, as he prepared to leave the presidency, warned in early 1961 of the military-industrial complex’s political influence. Trump’s posture makes sense personally ― this is a man who regularly fantasizes about violence, usually toward foreigners ― and he and his advisers see it as politically useful, too. The president has repeatedly appeared at weapons production facilities in swing states, promoted the head of Lockheed Martin using White House resources, appointed defense industry employees to top government jobs in an unprecedented way and expanded the Pentagon’s budget to near-historic highs ― a guarantee of future income for companies like Lockheed and Boeing.",
            "Trump is “on steroids in terms of promoting arms sales for his own political benefit,” said William Hartung, a scholar at the Center for International Policy who has tracked the defense industry for decades. “It’s a targeted strategy to get benefits from workers in key states.”",
            "In courting the billion-dollar industry, Trump has trampled on moral considerations about how buyers like the Saudis misuse American weapons, ethical concerns about conflicts of interest and even part of his own political message, the deceptive claim that he is a peace candidate. He justifies his policy by citing job growth, but data from Hartung, a prominent analyst, shows he exaggerates the impact. And Trump has made clear that a major motivation for his defense strategy is the possible electoral benefit it could have.",
            "Next month’s election will show if the bargain was worth it. As of now, it looks like Trump’s bet didn’t pay off ― for him, at least. Campaign contribution records, analysts in swing states and polls suggest arms dealers have given the president no significant political boost. The defense contractors, meanwhile, are expected to continue getting richer, as they have in a dramatic way under Trump.",
            "Playing Corporate Favorites",
            "Trump has thrice chosen the person who decides how the Defense Department spends its gigantic budget. Each time, he has tapped someone from a business that wants those Pentagon dollars. Mark Esper, the current defense secretary, worked for Raytheon; his predecessor, Pat Shanahan, for Boeing; and Trump’s first appointee, Jim Mattis, for General Dynamics, which reappointed him to its board soon after he left the administration.",
            "Of the senior officials serving under Esper, almost half have connections to military contractors, per the Project on Government Oversight. The administration is now rapidly trying to fill more Pentagon jobs under the guidance of a former Trump campaign worker, Foreign Policy magazine recently revealed ― prioritizing political reasons and loyalty to Trump in choosing people who could help craft policy even under a Joe Biden presidency.",
            "Such personnel choices are hugely important for defense companies’ profit margins and risk creating corruption or the impression of it. Watchdog groups argue Trump’s handling of the hiring process is more evidence that lawmakers and future presidents must institute rules to limit the reach of military contractors and other special interests.",
            "“Given the hundreds of conflicts of interest flouting the rule of law in the Trump administration, certainly these issues have gotten that much more attention and are that much more salient now than they were four years ago,” said Aaron Scherb, the director of legislative affairs at Common Cause, a nonpartisan good-government group.",
            "The theoretical dangers of Trump’s approach became a reality last year, when a former employee for the weapons producer Raytheon used his job at the State Department to advocate for a rare emergency declaration allowing the Saudis and their partner the United Arab Emirates to buy $8 billion in arms ― including $2 billion in Raytheon products ― despite congressional objections. As other department employees warned that Saudi Arabia was defying U.S. pressure to behave less brutally in Yemen, former lobbyist Charles Faulkner led a unit that urged Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to give the kingdom more weapons. Pompeo pushed out Faulkner soon afterward, and earlier this year, the State Department’s inspector general criticized the process behind the emergency declaration for the arms.",
            "Even Trump administration officials not clearly connected to the defense industry have shown an interest in moves that benefit it. In 2017, White House economic advisor Peter Navarro pressured Republican lawmakers to permit exports to Saudi Arabia and Jared Kushner, the president’s counselor and son-in-law, personally spoke with Lockheed Martin’s chief to iron out a sale to the kingdom, The New York Times found.",
            "When Congress gave the Pentagon $1 billion to develop medical supplies as part of this year’s coronavirus relief package, most of the money went to defense contractors for projects like jet engine parts instead, a Washington Post investigation showed.",
            "“It’s a very close relationship and there’s no kind of sense that they’re supposed to be regulating these people,” Hartung said. “It’s more like they’re allies, standing shoulder to shoulder.”",
            "Seeking Payback",
            "In June 2019, Lockheed Martin announced that it would close a facility that manufactures helicopters in Coatesville, Pennsylvania, and employs more than 450 people. Days later, Trump tweeted that he had asked the company’s then-chief executive, Marillyn Hewson, to keep the plant open. And by July 10, Lockheed said it would do so ― attributing the decision to Trump.",
            "The president has frequently claimed credit for jobs in the defense industry, highlighting the impact on manufacturing in swing states rather than employees like Washington lobbyists, whose numbers have also grown as he has expanded the Pentagon’s budget. Lockheed has helped him in his messaging: In one instance in Wisconsin, Hewson announced she was adding at least 45 new positions at a plant directly after Trump spoke there, saying his tax cuts for corporations made that possible.",
            "Trump is pursuing a strategy that the arms industry uses to insulate itself from political criticism. “They’ve reached their tentacles into every state and many congressional districts,” Scherb of Common Cause said. That makes it hard for elected officials to question their operations or Pentagon spending generally without looking like they are harming their local economy.",
            "Rep. Chrissy Houlahan, a Democrat who represents Coatesville, welcomed Lockheed’s change of course, though she warned, “This decision is a temporary reprieve. … I am concerned that Lockheed Martin and [its subsidiary] Sikorsky are playing politics with the livelihoods of people in my community.”",
            "The political benefit for Trump, though, remains in question, given that as president he has a broad set of responsibilities and is judged in different ways.",
            "“Do I think it’s important to keep jobs? Absolutely,” said Marcel Groen, a former Pennsylvania Democratic party chair. “And I think we need to thank the congresswoman and thank the president for it. But it doesn’t change my views and I don’t think it changes most people’s in terms of the state of the nation.”",
            "With polls showing that Trump’s disastrous response to the health pandemic dominates voters’ thoughts and Biden sustaining a lead in surveys of most swing states, his argument on defense industry jobs seems like a minor factor in this election.",
            "Hartung of the Center for International Policy drew a parallel to President George H.W. Bush, who during his 1992 reelection campaign promoted plans for Taiwan and Saudi Arabia to purchase fighter jets produced in Missouri and Texas. Bush announced the decisions at events at the General Dynamics facility in Fort Worth, Texas, and the McDonnell Douglas plant in St. Louis that made the planes. That November, as Bill Clinton defeated him, he lost Missouri by the highest margin of any Republican in almost 30 years and won Texas by a slimmer margin than had become the norm for a GOP presidential candidate.",
            "Checking The Receipts",
            "The defense industry can’t control whether voters buy Trump’s arguments about his relationship with it. But it could, if it wanted to, try to help him politically in a more direct way: by donating to his reelection campaign and allied efforts.",
            "Yet arms manufacturers aren’t reciprocating Trump’s affection. A HuffPost review of Federal Election Commission records showed that top figures and groups at major industry organizations like the National Defense Industrial Association and the Aerospace Industries Association and at Lockheed, Trump’s favorite defense firm, are donating this cycle much as they normally do: giving to both sides of the political aisle, with a slight preference to the party currently wielding the most power, which for now is Republicans. (The few notable exceptions include the chairman of the NDIA’s board, Arnold Punaro, who has given more than $58,000 to Trump and others in the GOP.)",
            "Data from the Center for Responsive Politics shows that’s the case for contributions from the next three biggest groups of defense industry donors after Lockheed’s employees.",
            "One smaller defense company, AshBritt Environmental, did donate $500,000 to a political action committee supporting Trump ― prompting a complaint from the Campaign Legal Center, which noted that businesses that take federal dollars are not allowed to make campaign contributions. Its founder told ProPublica he meant to make a personal donation.",
            "For weapons producers, backing both parties makes sense. The military budget will have increased 29% under Trump by the end of the current fiscal year, per the White House Office of Management and Budget. Biden has said he doesn’t see cuts as “inevitable” if he is elected, and his circle of advisers includes many from the national security world who have worked closely with ― and in many cases worked for ― the defense industry.",
            "And arms manufacturers are “busy pursuing their own interests” in other ways, like trying to get a piece of additional government stimulus legislation, Hartung said ― an effort that’s underway as the Pentagon’s inspector general investigates how defense contractors got so much of the first coronavirus relief package.",
            "Meanwhile, defense contractors continue to have an outsize effect on the way policies are designed in Washington through less political means. A recent report from the Center for International Policy found that such companies have given at least $1 billion to the nation’s most influential think tanks since 2014 ― potentially spending taxpayer money to influence public opinion. They have also found less obvious ways to maintain support from powerful people, like running the databases that many congressional offices use to connect with constituents, Scherb of Common Cause said.",
            "“This goes into a much bigger systemic issue about big money in politics and the role of corporations versus the role of Americans,” Scherb said.",
            "Given its reach, the defense industry has little reason to appear overtly partisan. Instead, it’s projecting confidence despite the generally dreary state of the global economy: Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun has said he expects similar approaches from either winner of the election, arguing even greater Democratic control and the rise of less conventional lawmakers isn’t a huge concern.",
            "In short, whoever is in the White House, arms dealers tend to do just fine."

            "Various theories were floated about the photos (mostly that they were a PR setup), but Chalamet set the record straight in a GQ profile published on Thursday.",

            "By this point in the pandemic, we’ve figured out how to properly wash our hands, clean our homes and do laundry. But what about the “dry clean only” clothes in our closets that can’t be tossed into the washing machine? Would dry cleaning sanitize these items against COVID-19?",
            "First, you need to know a bit about how the dry cleaning process works. The term “dry cleaning” is something of a misnomer, as your clothes do get wet ― just not with water. Instead, a chemical solvent, most commonly perchloroethylene, is used to clean garments. (Green dry cleaners may use liquid carbon dioxide, a silicone-based solvent or a wet cleaning method instead.)",
            "After that, the garments may be ironed, steamed or pressed. Turns out, it’s the higher temperatures used during these processes — not chemical cleaning solvents — that are capable of killing the virus, said Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious diseases doctor and professor of medicine at University of California, San Francisco.",
            "“The high level of heat used in pressing and ironing during the dry cleaning process is pretty reliable,” he said. “The virus hates heat.”",
            "So is dry cleaning better at sanitizing than doing laundry at home?",
            "Based on current research about fabric and COVID-19, there’s no indication that one method is better than the other, as long as your laundry reaches a high enough temperature. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, flu viruses are killed by heat above 167 degrees Fahrenheit. Studies of the coronavirus recommend 20 minutes above 140 degrees. Residential hot water can reach 130 degrees or higher.",
            "“There isn’t evidence that dry cleaning is more or less effective at killing the coronavirus compared to washing in the washing machine,” said Melissa Perry, professor and chair of environmental and occupational health at The George Washington University’s Milken Institute School of Public Health.",
            "In other words, you don’t need to spring for professional dry cleaning on items you wouldn’t normally dry clean.",
            "“Dry cleaning can be used for dry clean-only materials, whereas regular laundering is sufficient for washable garments and bedding,” Perry said.",
            "When doing laundry at home, the CDC website says you can “launder items as appropriate in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.” But it recommends using the warmest water the fabric will allow and drying the items completely.",
            "“A normal wash cycle, combined with the use of a deep-cleaning detergent, is sufficient for everyday cleaning in healthy households and also very effective for killing respiratory viruses that cause colds, flu and COVID-19,” microbiologist Kelly Reynolds, a professor and department chair at the University of Arizona, told Futurity.org, noting that higher water temperatures generally kill more germs.",
            "If someone in your household is sick, however, you should take extra precautions when doing their laundry. Wear disposable gloves when handling their dirty clothes or linens, avoid shaking them out (you don’t want to disperse the virus) and wash your hands afterward. You can also machine-dry clothes on the high heat setting for added protection.",
            "“When cleaning garments at home, one can also increase the efficiency of killing the virus by using bleach in the cleaning process when garments allow bleach,” said Diana Ceballos, assistant professor at the Boston University School of Public Health.",
            "Do I need to dry clean clothes more often during COVID-19?",
            "It depends, Chin-Hong said. “Certainly if the [garment] belongs to a family member who has recently been diagnosed with COVID, I would prioritize this to be dry cleaned as soon as you can,” he said. “Otherwise, it may be a good idea to dry clean these items if back from a vacation or travel. Or, if used in a potentially risky environment as an essential worker — like in health care — you could have them cleaned more frequently.”",
            "But if you’re not sick and have no known exposure to the virus, then there’s no need to make extra trips to the dry cleaner.",
            "“Dry cleaning as usual to maintain the cleanliness of the garment is sound practice and there is currently no evidence to suggest more dry cleaning than usual is necessary,” Perry said.",
            "How worried should I be about the coronavirus on my clothes?",
            "At this point, not very. The primary way the virus spreads is through close person-to-person contact and through the air. While transmission via surfaces is possible, it’s less common. And soft surfaces, like fabric, are thought to be less hospitable to the virus than hard ones.",
            "“There is generally very low risk that the virus can live for a long time on clothing or bedding unless someone has recently coughed on it with a lot of respiratory secretions,” Chin-Hong said. “Viruses probably live for one to two days on fabric, compared to five to seven days on cold hard surfaces like doorknobs and faucets. [The virus] is not a great aficionado of soft and porous surfaces like most clothing.”",
            "You’re more likely to contract COVID-19 by congregating with unmasked patrons inside the dry cleaning establishment than you would be from the clothes themselves, Chin-Hong said.",
            "“Don’t forget the three Ws: wear your mask, wash your hands and watch your distance!” he said.",
            "Experts are still learning about COVID-19. The information in this story is what was known or available as of publication, but guidance can change as scientists discover more about the virus. Please check the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the most updated recommendations."

            "Hollywood is struggling this year, to say the least, but no one can claim there aren’t great movies coming out. Video-on-demand platforms (iTunes, Amazon Prime Video and cable systems) and streaming services (Netflix, Hulu and an ever-expanding roster of competitors) have debuted a wealth of worthy titles in recent months, and October brings three new comedies as lovely as anything that would open in theaters around this time of the year. Hit play from your couch on “Shithouse,” “The Forty-Year-Old Version” and “Kajillionaire.” Here’s more on each.",
            "“Shithouse”",
            "The romantic comedy is only dead if you don’t know where to look. In theory, this sad-boy rendition sounds ill-fated. A mopey college freshman starts to find his mojo after a girl takes an interest in him? Hm. But “Shithouse” transcends every assumption I had. Its protagonist, Alex (Cooper Raiff), is something of a rarity: a straight guy who is in touch with his emotions and unashamed at their display yet uninterested in wielding them as a sympathy card. Simply put, he’s homesick, struggling to adjust to university culture while everyone around him seems to have friends and a social calendar. He is nothing if not sympathetic and hopelessly charming. When we first see Alex, his stuffed wolf is giving him advice, via droll subtitles, on how to bond with his party-animal roommate (Logan Miller).",
            "When unsavory circumstances force him to sleep in the lounge of his dorm building for a night, his devil-may-care RA (Dylan Gelula, a beguiling new talent who shined in “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt” and “Support the Girls”) strikes up a conversation. She is the first real connection he has made since leaving home, and the two of them soon find themselves strolling around campus, joining a casual softball game, burying a dead turtle and talking about life. Most of the movie unfolds across 48 hours, but its tempo is too patient to feel like a whirlwind. In essence, “Shithouse” is a sweet, amusing snapshot of a kid who mistakes his emotions for naïveté when in reality they reflect maturity.",
            "I’ve buried the lede somewhat, partly because I am stunned that Raiff, who is only 23, wrote and directed this film with such a sharp eye for the intricacies of conversation. (Plus he had the audacity to name his debut movie “Shithouse.”) It’s not that he’s doing anything brand new here — you’ll catch shades of “Before Sunrise” and the short-lived TV gem “Undeclared” — but Raiff writes dialogue that is blissfully imperfect: jumbly and full of stops and starts, the way a lonely, introspective young adult might actually talk. (Highlight: an unexpected exchange about “13 Going on 30” in which Alex exclaims, “You’re talking about Jennifer Garner right now! She was awesome in that movie.”) Alex is a nice guy without becoming one of those too-good-to-be-true fictional paragons, and Raiff has a natural gift for accentuating the character’s uneasiness. Even with a coda that’s tidy and rushed, “Shithouse” is lovely.",
            "“Shithouse” is now available on video on demand.\n\n",
            "“The Forty-Year-Old Version”",
            "So you landed some kind of “30 under 30” honor, heralded for your skills and your youth. But then another decade passes, and no one is paying attention to those skills anymore. What next?",
            "That is, more or less, the story of Radha Blank, a New York City actor and playwright who worked like hell to mount the dozen productions she wrote while enrolled in the Public Theater’s prestigious workshop for budding dramatists. Her career wasn’t taking off, maybe because, as a Black woman, she refused to script the so-called poverty porn that white gatekeepers are willing to greenlight. But now Blank is getting her second act — her revenge, even. She wrote, directed and stars in “The Forty-Year-Old Version,” a semi-autobiographical account of her experiences.",
            "Shot on black-and-white 35-millimeter film with a tenderness that resembles Spike Lee’s “She’s Gotta Have It” and Woody Allen’s “Manhattan,” the whip-smart comedy finds Blank portra a version of herself. Radha (the character) is still toiling away at her stagecraft, teaching high school theater to pay the rent and enduring inane feedback from a producer (Reed Birney) about how her Harlem-set play can more directly address racial gentrification. An expert wordsmith, Radha starts channeling her foibles through rap lyrics. She’s pretty good at it. Linking up with a smooth beat master (Oswin Benjamin) who encourages her to lay down tracks, Radha might start a second chapter as a hip-hop queen. (Emphasis on “might.”)",
            "“The Forty-Year-Old Version,” the title of which is an obvious spin on Judd Apatow’s 2005 megahit “The 40-Year-Old Virgin,” is enough to make anyone wonder why so few in Hollywood or the New York theater ecosystem noticed Blank before now. She has an expressive face and a knack for comic timing that reveals deeper, subtler feelings. The film also displays a warmth that, like the plays Radha wants to write, don’t hew to cliched ideas about how someone who looks like Blank should express herself. The grayscale cinematography can be a tad muddy at times, but the story Blank is telling is so winsome, it doesn’t matter.",
            "“The Forty-Year-Old Version” is now streaming on Netflix.",
            "“Kajillionaire”",
            "Miranda July is an acquired taste. Her brand of whimsy is, to say the least, not for everyone. But if naysayers return to her movies a second time, adjusted to her peculiar wavelength, I think they’ll discover that July’s flights of fancy are more grounded than they might seem. “Kajillionaire,” her third feature, is certainly her most accessible work yet, a hilarious and humane portrait of three Los Angeles grifters who have an unusual way of approaching the world.",
            "A deep-voiced Evan Rachel Wood plays Old Dolio — and just wait until you find out why that’s her name. Richard Jenkins and Debra Winger are her parents, weirdos who execute low-rent scams as both income and lifestyle. They’ll rob P.O. boxes, trade gift certificates for cash and trick a dying man into writing them a check, but they won’t teach Old Dolio anything about functional society. When the trio attempt a sham involving airport luggage, they recruit a perpetually cheerful “Ocean’s 11” enthusiast (MVP Gina Rodriguez, a hoot) whose arrival shows Old Dolio just how abnormal her existence has been.",
            "“Kajillionaire” is about many things: flouting the norms of capitalism, surviving without parental affection, failing to understand yourself because you don’t have a sense of how humans behave. July packs on the quirk, only to dissolve it in the movie’s back half for something incredibly meaningful but no less strange. Her previous films, 2005’s “Me and You and Everyone We Know” and 2011’s “The Future,” were more fantastical in nature, but all three contain a simmering rage that’s softened by their utter hilarity. Operating with a bigger budget and bigger stars, “Kajillionaire” is July at her most earthbound, even if that earth involves eccentrics you’d otherwise dread spending time with.",

            "A law firm that previously employed President Donald Trump’s interior secretary and has multiple clients in the U.S. fossil fuel sector continued to represent Saudi Arabia through an oil price war that devastated U.S. oil drillers earlier this year.",
            "Since 2016, the government of Saudi Arabia has paid Colorado-based lobbying giant Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck more than $6.7 million to represent its interests in Washington, according to data from the nonprofit Center for Responsive Politics.",
            "In April, HuffPost reported on the firm’s lucrative relationship with Saudi Arabia as the kingdom and Russia flooded the market with cheap oil. But it was unclear at the time if BHFS retained the Saudi government as a client into 2020.",
            "New regulatory filings to the Department of Justice now confirm that BHFS not only represented the kingdom through a standoff that rocked domestic producers, but that its work for the kingdom early this year included lobbying specifically on oil and gas issues.",
            "Prior to joining the Trump administration in August 2017, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt was an attorney and shareholder at BHFS, where he lobbied on behalf of fossil fuel, mining and agricultural interests that are now benefiting from the administration’s aggressive environmental rollbacks. After Trump’s election, the law firm publicly touted its “significant relationships” with “those who will steer the incoming Trump administration.”",
            "In the years since, it has seen its revenues from lobbying the Interior Department balloon as fossil fuel and other industries attempt to sway an agency at the heart of the Trump administration’s so-called “energy dominance” agenda and now run by one of the firm’s former partners.",
            "According to a Sept. 30 filing, Martha “Mimi” Burke, a policy adviser at BHFS, met with Rep. Angie Craig (D-Minn.) on May 7 to discuss a flotilla of some two dozen Saudi oil tankers that began arriving at U.S. shores early that month, loaded with more than 40 million barrels of crude oil.",
            "The tankers, which the Saudis launched beginning in late March as part of the price battle, added to the woes of domestic producers as they struggled to stay afloat amid a historic oversupply of oil and a steep decline in global demand due to the coronavirus pandemic. At least two U.S. drilling companies, Whiting Petroleum Corp. and Diamond Offshore Drilling, cited the price war in announcing bankruptcy in April.",
            "Along with the Saudi government, lobbying disclosure data shows BHFS continues to represent several oil and gas interests that the Saudi-led market crash affected. The firm’s domestic clients include, among others, the American Petroleum Institute, the leading trade association of the U.S. oil and gas industry; Oklahoma-based natural gas company WPX Energy, which late last month merged with Devon Energy; and Texas oil exploration and production company Hunt Consolidated.",
            "Jayson O’Neill, project director at Western Values Project, a left-leaning public lands and oil industry watchdog group, accused BHFS of “playing both sides of the ledger to make as much money as possible.”",
            "It is surprising “that neither the President nor the [Interior] Secretary seems to mind that his old lobby shop’s efforts are derailing Trump’s energy dominance fantasy by allowing excess crude to be dumped into domestic markets, further depressing prices,” he said.",
            "Neither BHFS nor the Saudi Embassy in Washington responded to HuffPost’s requests for comment. Craig’s office also did not respond.",
            "Burke, who spent more than two decades working in Saudi Arabia’s embassy in Washington before joining BHFS as a lobbyist in 2017, also met between May and June with Reps. Chrissy Houlahan (D-Penn.), Dan Kildee (D-Mich.) and Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) to lobby on bipartisan legislation that aimed to prevent the 14-member Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, better known as OPEC, from coordinating production and setting prices.",
            "As Reuters reported, Saudi Arabia threatened in April to sell its oil in currencies other than the dollar if Congress passed the bill, aptly named the No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act, or NOPEC. First introduced in 2000 but never enacted, the bill would allow for the cartel to be prosecuted under antitrust laws.",
            "The Saudi-Russian oil battle and coronavirus pandemic upended an American fossil fuel sector that had enjoyed a comfortable three years under Trump. As oil prices plummeted in March, domestic producers and Republican lawmakers turned to the administration that’s proven itself a loyal ally of fossil fuels. BHFS client API, which represents hundreds of members in the oil and gas sector, requested regulatory relief in a letter to the White House.",
            "In a pair of letters in late March and early April, more than 70 members of Congress, mostly Republicans who have received large donations from the fossil fuel industry over their political careers, called on the Trump administration to throw oil a lifeline by reducing or eliminating royalties ― payments that oil and gas companies make to the federal government to extract oil and gas from public lands and waters.",
            "And more than a dozen Republican senators sent a letter to de facto Saudi ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in mid-March urging him to stabilize the turbulent market. When the Saudi government stayed its course, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), one of the letter’s signees, accused the kingdom of “engaging in economic warfare against the United States” in an effort to “drive a bunch of American producers out of business.”",
            "In early April, Saudi Arabia and Russia agreed to cut oil production, bringing an end to the price war after a month. The announcement came roughly a week after Trump told Crown Prince Mohammed by phone that failing to end the standoff would likely result in Congress passing legislation to withdraw all U.S. troops and missile defense systems from Saudi Arabia, Reuters reported.",
            "Republican Sens. Kevin Cramer (N.D.) and Dan Sullivan (Alaska) introduced that legislation, dubbed the “Strained Partnership Act,” on March 24.",
            "In BHFS’ latest filing under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, Ari Zimmerman, one of several employees who lobbies on behalf of the Saudi government, reported meeting with a staffer in Cramer’s office to discuss the bill the following day, on March 25. A spokesman for Cramer told HuffPost that while Zimmerman did reach out to his office and provide information, neither the senator nor any staffer met with him in person.",
            "Zimmerman’s effort appears to have done little to deter Cramer from publicly slamming the kingdom.",
            "“Saudi Arabia has shown indifference, if not malintent, for American energy producers during its feud with Russia,” he said in a March 27 statement, a little less than two weeks before the two countries struck a deal to cut production. “These are not the actions of a supposed ally or friend, and they will not be tolerated.”"

            "The new spending comes as Trump returns to his Doral course, next to the Miami airport, on Thursday evening ― a visit that drives his total golf costs to $148 million in taxpayer dollars during his nearly 45 months in office. Of that, some $941,000 alone has gone to golf cart rental for the Secret Service agents who must protect him. The vast majority, though, represents the cost of flying Air Force One and the assorted cargo planes that transport the vehicles in his motorcade.",
            "Trump’s stay at Doral through Friday morning ― which will send at least several thousand taxpayer dollars into his own cash registers ― will raise to 279 the number of days he has spent at one of his own courses since becoming president, despite having promised during his last campaign that he would not have any time to golf if he won.",
            "“I just want to stay in the White House and work my ass off,” he said at a February 2016 rally.",
            "Trump is hosting a fundraiser for his campaign and the Republican National Committee on Thursday evening prior to participating in an NBC televised town hall event in downtown Miami. The reception, with tickets costing as much as $100,000 per couple, will allow Trump to funnel tens of thousands of donor dollars into his own pocket through room rental and catering fees.",
            "The agreement to rent carts from Sunshine Golf Cars in Delray Beach, Florida, was finalized on Sept. 22 and runs through May 31, 2021. Capitol Golf Cars, meanwhile, received a contract extension to provide carts at Trump’s golf course in Sterling, Virginia, for $7,500 on Sept. 23 and also got a $1,000 payment on June 3.",
            "The Secret Service, citing its policy not to discuss measures to protect the president or others in its care, declined to comment.",
            "However, an official familiar with the contracts said the South Florida one can be canceled at any time, in the event Trump loses and is no longer president come Jan. 20, 2021. The $7,500 to Capitol Golf Cars was for one additional month of rentals, the official said, while the earlier $1,000 was to repair one cart that was damaged when agents using it to secure a position in some woods at the golf course hit a log or tree.",
            "Although he frequently criticized predecessor Barack Obama for playing too much golf, Trump has played on 2½ times as many days as Obama did through the same point in his first term, and Trump’s golf outings have cost in total more than four times as much as Obama’s. The significantly higher expenses are due to Trump’s insistence on playing at his own resorts, while Obama played most of his rounds at military bases within short motorcade rides of the White House."

            "For months now, people have been toting around hand sanitizer and slathering it on anytime they touch a shared surface or object in public. We all know that hand sanitizer can help kill germs (including SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19), but there may be some major errors we’re making when applying the product.",
            "“There is no doubt that hand sanitizers are a convenient and handy resource to assist in mitigating the spread of infectious disease. However, it is not a ‘cure all,’” said K.C. Rondello, an epidemiologist and clinical associate professor at Adelphi University’s College of Nursing and Public Health. “There are many limitations to its use, so consumers must be aware of these caveats in order to utilize hand sanitizers in the most effective way.”",
            "Here are a few hand sanitizer mistakes and tips on how to course-correct, according to experts:",
            "1. You’re using the wrong kind of sanitizer",
            "Not all hand sanitizers are created equal. Rondello recommended using sanitizers that “contain at least 60% ethyl alcohol or 70% isopropyl alcohol” since those most effectively eliminate germs.",
            "You should also read the label of the product to determine if its active ingredients kill bacteria, viruses, both or neither, he said.",
            "“Using a product that is only bactericidal may give you a false sense of security, as it provides no protection from viral pathogens like SARS-CoV-2,” Rondello told HuffPost, adding that some products, such as baby wipes, may not even be antimicrobial at all. “They may have some use in deodorizing and removing visible soil, but they will not have a meaningful effect on SARS-CoV-2.”",
            "Avoid brands that contain methanol, which “can be toxic when absorbed through the skin or ingested,” said Makeda Robinson, a virologist who has studied the Zika virus, MERS and now SARS-CoV-2.",
            "And make sure to check if your hand sanitizer is on the list of brands that have been recalled by the Food and Drug Administration.",
            "2. You’re not using your sanitizer for long enough",
            "You know how you should be washing your hands for a full 20 seconds, enough for you to hum through the “Happy Birthday” song twice from start to finish? Well, you should also be doing this to some degree when you’re applying hand sanitizer as well, said Aaron Glatt, chair of the Department of Medicine and chief of infectious diseases at Mount Sinai South Nassau in Oceanside, New York.",
            "You should rub sanitizer into your hands for 20 to 30 seconds and make sure to “rub it in until it’s all gone,” Glatt told HuffPost.",
            "3. You’re using too little",
            "Not using enough hand sanitizer could mean that you are not successfully cleansing, Glatt said.",
            "People often think that getting excess product off the spout or even just using a small droplet is fine. In reality, “you should push out roughly the size of a quarter or a nickel,” the epidemiologist said.",
            "For those larger pump containers that are frequently found by the cash registers in stores, Glatt said a full push down on the pump should be sufficient.",
            "4. You’re not getting every area of your hands",
            "Any part of your hands that you leave unsanitized can carry particles of the virus. So even if you only touched something with one finger, you should always properly sanitize your whole hands — front to back — to be safe.",
            "For example, say you pick up a pen between two fingers and sign a credit card receipt. Don’t just rub hand sanitizer around on those fingers. Cover your whole hands, including fingers and fingernails. In fact, you should “scratch your palms while still wet to get some product under the nails,” said Charles Bailey, the medical director for infection prevention at St. Joseph Hospital and Mission Hospital in Orange County, California.",
            "5. You’re not storing it correctly",
            "“You should follow the manufacturer’s instructions in terms of the temperature it’s supposed to be kept at,” Glatt said of hand sanitizer, noting that the wrong temperature can affect a product’s potency. “You don’t put it in the refrigerator, and you don’t put it out in the sun.”",
            "Griffith Hsu, senior medical adviser for the medical supply company Medivico, added that products “must be stored below 105 degrees, as heat can destabilize the sanitizer and render them ineffective.”",
            "6. You’re not sanitizing before eating",
            "You may clean your hands after picking up a carryout bag, but what about before you dig into the meal once you get home?",
            "When it comes to hand sanitizing, how often you do it is very important. Glatt’s rule of thumb is that if you’re going to put your hands near your mouth, be safe and sanitize again.",
            "“I tell people, ‘Think about what you just touched. Would you be willing to put your hands in your mouth? Touch food? If not, then clean your hands again,’” he said.",
            "7. You’re not being careful around candles or flames",
            "“Consumers need to be aware that, as sanitizers are alcohol-based, they are flammable,” Hsu told HuffPost. “There have been reports of consumers suffering burns because of hand sanitizer use and open flame exposure, like cigarette lighters.”",
            "After using a sanitizer, you should allow some time for the alcohol to evaporate, he added. And, as a general rule, avoid open flames for at least 30 minutes after application.",
            "8. You’re sanitizing when your hands are covered in dirt or grease",
            "If your hands are dirty or greasy, the hand sanitizer may not have sufficient contact with the skin to do its job.",
            "“This may lead you to feeling you’re protected when in fact you are not,” Rondello said.",
            "If your hands are visibly dirty, you should always opt to wash them with soap and water first.",
            "“Keep in mind that hand sanitizer is a good alternative when you are in a situation where you can’t wash your hands or your hands are not visibly dirty,” Robinson said. “However, it is not a blanket replacement for using soap and water, which is the best and most efficient way to clean dirty hands.”",
            "If you are near a sink and also carrying hand sanitizer, using soap and water for 20 seconds should be the preferred method.",
            "“The act of scrubbing with soap and water physically removes germs from the surface of the skin,” Rondello said. “Additionally, the friction created when drying your hands with a paper towel also helps by physically removing pathogens on the surface — an advantage lost when using hand sanitizer.”",
            "9. You’re not allowing the product to dry",
            "It’s important to not wipe your hands before the sanitizer dries.",
            "“Attempting to accelerate the drying process with a towel is going to limit the sanitizer’s effectiveness since you are removing it before it has had a chance to do its job,” Rondello said.",
            "He added that all sanitizers and disinfectants require a certain amount of contact time with a surface in order for them to kill the pathogens they are intended for.",
            "“Removing them prematurely may dry your hands more quickly, but it may also render the sanitizer ineffective — giving you the impression that you’re protected when you’re not,” he said.",
            "10. You’re overdoing it",
            "While this won’t necessarily harm the hand sanitizer’s effectiveness, it could leave you with chapped hands.",
            "“Hand sanitizers kill not only bad bacteria but also good bacteria, which can irritate the skin,” said Nikhil Bhayani, an infectious disease specialist with Texas Health Resources in Arlington, Texas. “People should moisturize their hands immediately after use, preferably with a cream.”",
            "“If skin irritation is developing, change products rather than decrease the amount of product used or the time spent applying or rubbing in,” Bailey added.",
            "11. You’re making your own sanitizer",
            "Panic purchases early in the pandemic led to a lot of people trying their hand at making their own sanitizers. Don’t rely on this method to keep you germ-free.",
            "“Experts advise against it,” Bhayani said. “It’s easy to mistakenly create a mixture that’s not strong enough to kill germs.”",
            "12. You’re not sanitizing other items you are frequently touching",
            "Sanitizing your hands but forgetting to sanitize your credit card, keys or phone could leave you open to infection, said Kristin Hughes, an emergency physician based in Chicago. This behavior could cause cross-contamination.",
            "“I recommend putting the hand sanitizer on any high-touch items that you are carrying with you at the time of sanitizing,” Hughes said.",
            "13. You’re not checking the expiration date",
            "It might seem simple, but checking the expiration date is important because the active ingredients in hand sanitizer will degrade over time, Rondello said.",
            "“If you choose to use an expired product you have on hand because a newer one isn’t available at the time, know that it is likely not as effective as when it was manufactured ― so you are rolling the dice on whether you are protected or not,” Rondello said. “Bottom line: It’s better than nothing, but you want to replace it with fresh hand sanitizer as soon as you can.”",

            "The northern Peru birding route winds inland from the country’s arid Pacific coast, through lowland forests and scrubland dotted with cacti, over the Andes Mountains to the Utcubamba River valley. In a tiny patch of cloud forest, 7,000 feet up along the valley’s eastern slopes, lives the elusive marvelous spatuletail, perhaps the most spectacular hummingbird in the world, and one of the rarest.",
            "Weighing as much as a pair of pennies and measuring 10 to 15 centimeters long, the male has a head crested in brilliant blue feathers, its throat a burst of iridescent turquoise. More than half the bird’s length is devoted to two extravagant tail feathers — slender appendages that splay dramatically outward and terminate in flashy violet disks, or spatules, like decorative fans.",
            "Constantino Aucca, a longtime conservationist, has been guiding bird-watchers in Peru for more than 30 years. In the 1990s, he would often bring tourists to this remote area near the town of Pomacochas, the only place on Earth to catch a glimpse of the spatuletail hummingbird.",
            "But he could see that the birds’ already limited habitat range (less than 3,400 square miles, by one estimate) was getting smaller. Many of the local people raised cattle and they would chop down or set fires to trees to make way for grazing, sometimes destroying 20 acres of forest for just one or two cows.",
            "Fearing for the future of the endangered marvelous spatuletail, Aucca set out to convince the community to protect and revitalize their degraded mountain landscape. Now, 20 years later, the preservation scheme he created, the first of its kind in Peru, is a thriving example of how reforestation, improved agricultural practices, and a culture of conservation can protect habitat for wild animals while also benefiting the people who live among them.",
            "“It serves as a model of what successful conservation looks like,” said Daniel Lebbin, vice president of threatened species at the American Bird Conservancy.",
            "Autumn is migration season for birds in North America. Some, like the Canada warbler, have flown thousands of miles to winter in the towering alders of the Andean forests around Pomacochas. These trees weren’t here when Aucca was leading birding trips a few decades ago. Now, standing 50 feet tall and bustling with avian life, they are a testament to the work of Aucca and the Association of Andean Ecosystems (ECOAN), the conservation nonprofit he co-founded — along with ABC and other organizations — to establish a protected area and rehabilitate the weakened landscape.",
            "When Aucca, who lives in the city of Cuzco, more than 900 miles from Pomacochas, first proposed the idea of a nature reserve in the area, in 2003, people there laughed at him, asking why he wanted to protect land that wouldn’t even grow grass.",
            "“I came for one bird,” he told them.",
            "The locals were skeptical. They didn’t believe anyone would attempt to regrow the blighted forest just for one tiny bird, or stick around long enough to do so.",
            "At the time, Aucca said, international nongovernmental organizations lamented the way communities were destroying wildlife habitats, yet they resisted engaging those communities in their conservation efforts, seeing that as social work, not conservation.",
            "Aucca disagreed. He thought it was vital to work with people who lived in the area, to get them invested, and to ensure they benefited as well.",
            "Proponents of community-based conservation argue efforts to protect biodiversity are more successful when their goals align with those of the local people, and when those people are actively involved.",
            "“It is a fundamental strategy for conservation to involve local people,” said Mariana Montoya, director of the Wildlife Conservation Society in Peru. “Conservation should be done that way — not just working with or for communities, conservation must be done by communities.”",
            "Aucca asked the residents of Pomacochas what they wanted in exchange for letting him reserve a parcel of land for conservation, and they said trees that would provide shade for their cows.",
            "He told them: “This will provide food, trees, money and happiness.”",
            "It took time to gain the locals’ trust. To reforest the area, ECOAN set up a tree nursery nearby. At first, Aucca had to pay landowners to let him plant seedlings on their property. But local leaders, including a farmer named Santos Montenegro who was particularly adept at spotting spatuletails on his property, helped spread an understanding of why restoring and protecting the habitat was good not just for animals, but for the community — including improving pastureland and prohibiting development that could pollute watersheds.",
            "Eventually, people came around to volunteer their land for reforesting. Between 2005 and 2006, ECOAN planted 11,000 native trees for the marvelous spatuletail and other species.",
            "“We have to involve the community in the subject of conservation so that people stop habits that are bad for the environment, like burning the forests every year,” Montenegro told HuffPost.",
            "Enlisting ABC as a partner and financial backer, in 2005 Aucca convinced the community and a private landowner to grant them an ecological easement — a form of legally recognized protection, and the first of its kind in Peru — on about 80 acres of land. It was there, years earlier, he saw the incredible sight of three male spatuletails dancing around a bush bursting with blue flowers. The community still owned the land but agreed to limit its use to conservation activities and allow ECOAN to establish the Huembo hummingbird reserve and a small lodge for visitors (with money from another organization). All tourism profits would be evenly distributed among community members. Aucca hired Montenegro and his family to manage the property.",
            "For a long time, the marvelous spatuletail was difficult to find. Now, birding sites herald Huembo as a “paradise” for the endangered birds, where visitors can catch a glimpse of them, along with a dozen other hummingbird species, simply by sitting for an hour by the park’s bird feeders.",
            "(Tourism doesn’t bring in as much money as they’d like — especially since the start of the pandemic — so Montenegro and ECOAN’s director of conservation and development, Adrian Torres, plan to start selling coffee Montenegro grows in a small shade plantation on the reserve. The packages will be emblazoned with an image of the marvelous spatuletail.)",
            "ECOAN and the American Bird Conservancy are working to develop a comprehensive monitoring system to track the species’ numbers and to see how the birds are taking to the new forest growth. Huembo is tiny as reserves go (even with the addition of 17 acres in 2013), and though it doesn’t take much to provide for a bird the size of a pingpong ball with antennae, the reserve alone can’t protect the entire population, said ABC’s Lebbin.",
            "What’s more important, he stressed, is that the culture of conservation has spread beyond the reserve’s boundaries — exemplifying what Robert Horwich, founder of the nonprofit Community Conservation, called “conservation contagion.”",
            "“A big part of the success is changing the community’s relationship with the bird,” Lebbin said. “We’re seeing widespread awareness and care. Inside and outside of Huembo, people are planting species they know the bird feeds on.”",
            "Conservation awareness has been spreading throughout Peru, Montoya said, with community initiatives to protect natural resources sprouting up over the last 20 years — many started by the communities themselves. Even very small projects can have important effects, creating networks of conservation, prompting new efforts in nearby communities, and acting as ecological “stepping stones” connecting disparate conservation areas.",
            "“This is important because national protected areas or even regional protected areas really can’t conserve everything,” she explained. Vitally, she added, community and privately owned reserves are managed with and by local residents, and benefit their lives and livelihoods.",
            "Montenegro said the people of Pomacochas are very happy with ECOAN’s tree nursery because it has enabled them to create living fences around their properties (saving the cost of building fences) and practice a silvopasture program, which combines managed forest and pastureland. That results in healthier soil, shade for grazing livestock, fruit and — after a decade or two of growth — timber that community members can use or sell. Some people are now growing vegetables among the alders, which enrich the soil with nitrogen.",
            "“The people keep planting,” Montenegro said. “There are no other institutions doing this reforestation work. ECOAN keeps going, and the people are happy.”",
            "Due in part to seeing the successful reforestation in Pomacochas, people around the region have asked ECOAN to help them designate land for ecological protection and revitalize natural habitats. The organization has planted 600,000 trees and bushes around Huembo and close to 1 million in other communities in northern Peru.",
            "Torres — who sports a tattoo of the marvelous spatuletail on his right arm — is working with small community initiatives along the northern birding route to help them learn to manage their forests, set up feeders and run responsible ecotourism operations. He aims for the small stretch of road near Pomacochas to be known, one day, as the Hummingbird Route.",

            "Amy Coney Barrett is a conservative. She’s also a Roman Catholic. If, as expected, Senate Republicans confirm her as President Donald Trump’s nominee to fill the seat of late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, it could represent an enormous victory for conservatives. It would further solidify Republican control of the judicial branch and pose an impediment to Democratic rule, even if Democrats seize control of both the legislative and executive branches in just three weeks.",
            "With so much on the line ― including the future of the Affordable Care Act, reproductive health care and LGBTQ rights ― some media coverage has examined Barrett’s religious beliefs and practices, exploring whether her deep faith would dictate the outcome of cases that might come before her in court.",
            "Barrett has lived her life largely within Catholic environments. Until Trump nominated her to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit in 2017, she was a professor at Notre Dame Law School, where she spoke at events held by student groups that opposed abortion rights and signed a newspaper advertisement opposing “abortion on demand.”",
            "In Barrett’s confirmation hearing so far this week, Democrats have largely avoided questions directly related to Barrett’s faith. Republicans have signaled that they’re ready to pounce on any such lines of questioning, and a botched question from Sen. Dianne Feinstein during Barrett’s 2017 confirmation hearing ― in which the California Democrat said “the dogma lives loudly within” Barrett ― has since become a rallying cry for Catholic conservatives.",
            "Catholic social teaching encompasses a wide range of issues in the political realm. But in modern political history, often due to the choices of the church’s leadership in America, the enormously broad scope of Catholic social teaching is often boiled down to a single political issue: the legal status of abortion.",
            "I spoke with Stephen Schneck, a former professor at the Catholic University of America whom I covered during my time as an editor for the student newspaper. Schneck is a former director of the Institute for Policy Research & Catholic Studies (previously known as the Life Cycle Institute), and he was on the White House Council for Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships during former President Barack Obama’s administration. Schneck is supporting former Vice President Joe Biden in the 2020 election and serves as the national co-chair of Catholics for Biden.",
            "We discussed Catholic social teaching, how the church’s messaging has shifted under Pope Francis, the history of anti-Catholicism in American political life, and how he thinks Democrats should approach (or avoid) issues pertaining to Barrett’s faith.",
            "One thing you said [in 2009] that stuck with me is that there’s nothing like Catholic social teaching that makes both Republicans and Democrats cranky. We know that Catholic social teaching on abortion has been an issue for Catholic Democrats going back decades, so maybe for readers you could explain some of those Catholic social teachings that make Republicans cranky.",
            "It’s a long list. Care for creation — in other words, you know, ecological concerns about climate change and so forth. The death penalty. Under Pope Francis, the Catechism itself has been changed so that Catholics are no longer allowed to support the death penalty.",
            "Where do I go? The criticisms that Catholic social teaching has really launched for decades ― from Rerum Novarum [“Of Revolutionary Change” (1891)] to Quadragesimo Anno [“In the 40th Year” (1931)] to some of the most recent statements by Pope Francis ― challenging the nature of the capitalist economic order.",
            "We could talk about the fact that at least since the end of the 19th century, the Catholic Church has insisted on the importance of labor unions and the ability to organize labor in all sorts of circumstances in every country, and so on and so forth.",
            "We could talk about [how] policymaking should be preferencing the needs of the most oppressed, the poorest, the most vulnerable people. These things should be at the top of our list when we’re thinking about public policy needs. Every public policy should be assessed from our concern for the poorest and most vulnerable and most marginalized populations. And on and on.",
            "It’s a really, really long list, and I’m not even beginning to scratch the surface. The absolute right to health care. The idea that leaders should be servants rather than masters. I don’t know where to begin, it’s a long list.",
            "Given the importance of all those issues, how did we get to a place where, you know, so many Catholics and so many Americans see the criminalization of abortion as the only issue of importance to the church?",
            "Actually, I don’t think that’s true. It’s difficult to say who counts as the church here, but if you look at the bishops’ guide for plumbing consciences before an election year ― their so-called Faithful Citizenship guide that came out several years ago but which has been refreshed several times ― it’s quite clear that Catholics are supposed to be thinking about all these issues and not just abortion.",
            "And I think if you look at the numbers, the polling on Catholics across the United States, you see that Catholics are concerned about the economy and Catholics are concerned about health care. Catholics are concerned about all of the things that other Americans are concerned about as well. It’s too bad that they’re often ― by both the left and the right ― somehow treated as single-issue voters.",
            "Do you think that the American bishops have devoted too much time to the issue of abortion at the expense of these key Catholic social teaching issues?",
            "It’s not my place to actually criticize our bishops, but I would say that if you look at what bishops around the world apart from the United States are talking about in terms of public policy in their communities, it seems that in the United States, in comparison, our bishops talk about abortion much more than, say, the bishops in Asia or the bishops in Latin America or the bishops in Africa or the bishops in Europe.",
            "I think that just shows some peculiarities about the church in the United States ... and the polarized politics of the United States.",
            "How much does the makeup of the population of American Catholics influence what the bishops are doing in the United States compared to in other countries? American Catholics are, at this point in time in history, generally speaking, more economically advantaged than the populations in other countries that are primarily Catholic.",
            "Catholics in the United States have been so thoroughly assimilated into American culture that, I would say for the vast majority of American Catholics, they look at politics through partisan lenses and their Catholic faith actually doesn’t weigh very much.",
            "It’s a chicken-or-egg argument. Are right-wing Catholics in the United States focused on abortion because it’s an issue for the Republican Party, or are they focused on abortion because it’s an issue for the Catholic Church? And similarly, we could say just the reverse. Are left-leaning Catholics in the United States interested in topics like capital punishment because they’re driven by the concerns of their church, or are they more driven by the politics of the Democratic Party?",
            "I think that these are legitimate questions. But I think that’s really what’s distinctive about Catholics in America — that we have become so assimilated in American culture and society that, by and large, if you look at polling of American Catholics, on any issue, it pretty much mirrors that of the general population.",
            "I think this is something worthy of a lot more research, but it sure seems to me that we’re driven more by our domestic kind of American outlook ― whether it’s Republican or Democrat, blue state or red state ― than we’re driven by the actual church teachings on these issues.",
            "Given what you said about assimilation of American Catholics, I was wondering if you could speak to the history of anti-Catholicism in American politics. It was obviously this major issue for the late President John F. Kennedy 60 years ago, but it seems like we’re in a much different place now.",
            "Well the history, of course, is a dark one, and anti-Catholicism goes back much before the American founding. Many of these founders and framers whose original writings and original canon [Barrett] wants to decipher were profoundly anti-Catholic.",
            "It goes way back. We could talk through the 19th century about the know-nothings and “no Irish need apply” and all of the derogatory names for various Irish immigrant populations that came to the United States, or whether it’s Italians or Poles or whatever. It’s a long, long list.",
            "Sometimes, it was very prominent. John F. Kennedy faced real, overt prejudice because of his Catholic faith, particularly in the American South and places like West Virginia, but not just there. That prejudice was in Oregon, that prejudice was all over.",
            "One of the great triumphs of his presidency in a sense was to kind of normalize being a Catholic in the United States. We are citizens, too. We are part of the country too. Kennedy opened the way for people like Amy Coney Barrett and Joe Biden to be pursuing the offices that they’re pursuing right now.",
            "How do you think the racial makeup of American Catholics influenced that? Obviously, the population of Hispanic and Latinx Catholics has expanded greatly in recent years. But overall, despite Catholics’ rich history in the civil rights era, the percentage of Black Catholics is much smaller than the general U.S. population. How did that help in terms of integration and assimilation into the American political scene?",
            "It’s complicated. There’s a great book, for example, about how the Irish became white, which even though it’s talking about an ethnic group, it kind of gives you a sense of how, for a while, Catholics too were often viewed in if not overtly racial terms, in cognitive racial terms. Italians were presented as swarthy, and Irish were presented as ruddy. So there was kind of a racial dimension to the concerns about Catholics, too.",
            "But no doubt it helped for Catholics with assimilation that Catholics’ skin color looked a lot like English skin color, looked a lot like the skin color of white Anglo-Saxon Protestants, so their assimilation was quite a bit easier as a result.",
            "It’s interesting to note places where there are large Black Catholic populations, like Louisiana and a few other places in the country. These were places that during Reconstruction time there was a way in which Black Catholics could practice their faith, and the church accommodated that. But the racial history involved in all of this is very complicated and has lots of little dark chapters.",
            "So let’s talk about Judge Amy Coney Barrett. What have you made so far of media coverage of her faith?",
            "I have to say I was disappointed initially. It seemed as if — and, you know, the Huffington Post is somewhat responsible for this, too — it seemed as if there was an effort to sensationalize her faith practices, and I thought that was beyond the pale. And, of course, your more conservative media outlets also sort of seized on her faith but used it as a way to create zingers against the left. So I’ve been disappointed that her faith has been kind of objectified and dragged into the political arena by both Republicans and Democrats.",
            "As the Constitution makes clear, there can be no religious tests for public office in the United States. And so those questions, I think, are properly out of bounds, and that kind of sensationalizing just really, really has no place. But it has occurred. And it’s occurring today as I listen to several Republican senators. Even though the Democrats haven’t said a word about Judge Barrett’s faith, nevertheless, they’re bringing out those zingers that the Republican right brought up several weeks ago.",
            "“Handmaiden,” for example, in Catholicism is a term of respect, like a servant of God. Is that what you’re sort of referring to in some of those instances?",
            "You and I both know this really well, Ryan. The Magnificat begins with Mary describing herself as a handmaiden of the Lord. That sort of leadership is something that is very important for understanding how authority flows through Catholic theology.",
            "So how do non-Catholic Democrats and the media — how do you think they should walk that line in terms of discussing Judge Barrett’s faith, you know, both critically and respectfully while also exploring issues of how it could affect the greater American public through her judicial rulings?",
            "I think her faith is out of bounds, personally. And I would counsel all sides, whether it’s a Republican questioning her about whether her Catholic faith would affect her rulings on the death penalty or a Democrat questioning whether her Catholic faith would affect her rulings on abortion, I think all of those things are out of bounds and should not be asked.",
            "I think that the questioning should stick with the judge’s record and with the judge’s writings. I think it’s perfectly appropriate to explore her judicial philosophy and the sources of her judicial philosophy, her textualism and originalist approach to a jurisprudence. I think those are perfectly legitimate topics. But religion, I think, is not appropriate. We should not be exploring her religious beliefs.",
            "There’s been a considerable shift in Francis’ papacy on issues such as climate change and poverty ― some things you’ve mentioned before. Do you think that shift has translated as much to the United States? Do you think the American bishops are speaking out as vocally as Pope Francis has on those issues?",
            "I’d say that Pope Francis is at the vanguard of this turn of the church toward becoming a church of and by and for the poor. That’s Pope Francis. In the appointment of new bishops to the United States, I’m just seeing tremendous appointments that are bringing that message to the United States.",
            "But it’s going to take a while. Just as we see Pope Francis struggling to transform the Curia, the church in the United States is going to be a struggle to turn around. You don’t turn the Titanic on a dime, and I think that is in a sense what we’re looking at here. Lots of bishops aren’t completely on board with Pope Francis and still have some hesitation about some of the directions that he’s going, and I don’t think that’s going to go away anytime soon.",
            "But I’m tremendously encouraged and feeling a great deal of hope based on recent efforts by our bishops. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops ― and especially its social justice office ― has really done such a good job in bringing much more openness and appreciation of Pope Francis.",
            "In terms of social justice, we see that brought up in terms of “social justice warriors” being used as this thing against the left, but talk about the importance of social justice to Catholicism.",
            "Not just Catholicism, but I think Christianity. For me, the one passage in all of Scripture that kind of is at the heart of my faith is that passage at the beginning of the Gospel where Jesus has gone back to his hometown and returns to his home temple. He puts his hand out and draws out a scroll, and it’s a scroll from Isaiah. He reads it and the scroll, if you remember, Ryan, explains that the Redeemer will come to bring good news to the poor, to heal the blind and the lame, and to proclaim a jubilee for the Lord. That’s Jesus himself saying that, and then he goes on to say to his disciples that are around him, you are witnessing the manifestation of this right now.",
            "That’s ultimately what I think Christianity is about. There’s much more that we’ve added and that I certainly affirm about Christianity, but it’s that bringing the good news to the poor. That is the heart and soul, I think, about what Christianity is all about, as Jesus himself seems to say in that passage. So for me, you can’t separate social justice from Christianity. It is Christianity.",
            "I’m just somehow often surprised and shocked when Christians focus wrongly, I think, or overmuch on things that were added later, or interpretations that have been glossed on at the expense of grasping, you know, the really deep social justice message of the Gospels.",
            "Switching back to the issue of abortion, I was hoping for non-Catholic readers if you could sort of explain what Catholic teaching is on the issue of abortion. Obviously Catholics believe it is morally wrong, but does the church’s position necessitate that you advocate for abortion’s immediate criminalization, or is advocating for public policy [like a stronger social safety net] that reduces the number of abortions a laudable short-term goal for Catholics?",
            "The church’s position, of course, is that abortion is morally wrong. It’s defined as an intrinsic evil, which means that it’s always wrong and wrong in itself, in the same way that lying is always wrong and wrong in itself.",
            "There’s nothing in moral theology that says how we’re supposed to deal with this in public life. So there’s nothing in moral theology that says we have to overturn Roe v. Wade. There’s nothing in moral theology that says we have to vote for this candidate or that candidate, that’s just not there.",
            "What is there is it’s wrong and that we have an obligation to try to, in public life, find ways to minimize it, just as we should find ways to minimize lying or minimize theft or whatever. We have an onus on us to do that sort of thing. So we have a prudential capacity from God to figure out, well, what’s the best way to achieve that end? Some people, including a good number of church leaders in the United States, have decided that the best way right now to deal with this is to try to overturn Roe v. Wade, change the law that allows it, and perhaps to criminalize either people who receive it or people who provide it, or some combination of the two.",
            "Within the realm of prudential reason in this regard, that could all be fine, too. But that needn’t be the only way in which we approach. And I have to say frankly that my approach, and this is based on practicality ― and I’m applying my prudential wisdom here as effectively as I can ― it seems to me clearly that the rate of abortion in the United States goes down when women have access to health care both for themselves and their children, when there’s adequate nutrition, [when] — I think this is very important — when housing is available to at-risk women, when education and jobs are available, and on and on and on.",
            "In other words, we’re talking about social justice policies for the most part, and those kind of policies are associated, I think, clearly with decline in the number of abortions. So at the end of the Obama administration, the abortion numbers in the United States dropped to before what they were in 1973, what they were when Roe v. Wade became law of the land.",
            "There are countries in the world where abortion is illegal, but nevertheless the rate of illegal abortions is higher than the abortion rate in the United States. So there’s no guarantee that overturning Roe v. Wade or criminalizing abortion in the United States is actually going to make this horrible thing go away.",
            "Politicians in the United States that make such a big deal about ending abortion, in fact, never do, even when they control the presidency, both houses of Congress and the Supreme Court, as we see recently. I really have the suspicion that for a lot of these politicians, they’re really not all that interested in trying to actually end it.",
            "A major component of Catholic moral teaching is that the ends don’t justify the means, and I was curious if you sort of saw that in any way as applicable to the current posture of most of the pro-life movement: when you have, essentially, the thought of using the judicial system to implement policies supported by a minority of Americans through, potentially, means of deception ― hiding what your true views are or coating them in a legal posture ― to bring about the end of Roe v. Wade.",
            "I hadn’t thought about it in those terms, but I think you’re onto something. I don’t think I would put it in that way, but that seems right.",
            "Given Catholic social teaching on contraception, what do you think the church can do to advocate for social policies that would reduce the number of abortions?",
            "A good number of social justice policies work to reduce the number of abortions. There’s quite a bit of that going on — everything from, you know, paid family leave to helping the poor and health care for all. These are all positions that the church has advocated, and I think continuing to advocate for those is exactly where we’re going to have the greatest success in reducing numbers.",
            "Vice President Joe Biden has spoken a lot about how his Catholic faith has informed his views, and I was curious, first of all, of what you think that says about the state of Catholics in America where you have Biden’s Catholicism being touted by this political campaign. And second of all, would you like to see Catholic Democrats speak more frankly about how their faith has informed their own moral and political views?",
            "It’s funny, I’m from a generation of Catholics that thought we needed to kind of keep our faith quiet, “walk humbly with your God” sort of thing, and not lift it up like a battle flag, and to a certain extent I think I still am. I think we should be inspired by our faith. I think that our faith should inform our conscience. I don’t think we should weaponize our faith in politics.",
            "That said, I’ve met Joe Biden a number of times in pretty private situations and I can attest his faith is real, and it’s something that matters to him and does inform his conscience.",
            "The fact that you had somebody like Lou Holtz calling Biden a CINO ― Catholic in name only ― or even worse, President Trump saying that Joe Biden would be against God and against religion and against the Bible, I think given that sort of effort to suggest that Biden and people like Biden can’t be true Catholics, I think it’s utterly appropriate for the Biden campaign to be talking about the candidate’s faith, and I’m happy to talk about it myself.",
            "Lastly, Pope Francis, the first Jesuit pope, came out with this recent encyclical. What kind of message do you think he’s sending to American Catholics, particularly given the timing of its release?",
            "I think the timing is just the timing. I don’t think the pope intended for an October surprise. But the message, though, I think there is a kind of sense that ― not just for America, but the developed countries generally are a target for this message ― the real thrust of Fratelli Tutti is against radical individualism, coupled with economic materialism. In the pope’s mind, the world is in desperate need ― and he thinks that the COVID crisis brings this out so clearly ― of solidarity, of community. We need to find ways to overcome our polarization and overcome the economic self-interest and overcome the radical individualism, all the things that are separating us from one another and kind of forcing us into solipsistic, relativistic worlds of our own imagination.",
            "These things need to be resisted and we need to find a way back to community, to belonging together, to togetherness, to unity. Not just as a nation. Not only does America need to find a way to overcome its polarizations and its divisions and its self-interest and so forth and come together, but really the pope is saying all of the developed worlds are being torn apart by these structural sins, and we need to overcome them and find solidarity, real fraternity, real community, the kind of community where we recognize within each other the face of God.",
            "This conversation has been edited for length and clarity."

            "Neel Kashkari is not a radical. He began his career at the Treasury Department under President George W. Bush and ran for governor of California in 2014 as a Republican, promising to cut taxes, “wasteful spending” and “welfare.” Kashkari lost that race badly, but earned plaudits from big-name conservatives like former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (R), who hailed him as “an ideas guy” capable of “unleashing the power of the market to create good jobs.”",
            "Kashkari, who also worked at Goldman Sachs and helped administer the 2008 bank bailouts, is now president of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve, a man respected on Wall Street and welcomed by producers at CNBC. But these days he doesn’t talk much about the virtues of the self-correcting market. He’s focused instead on the power of the public sector, and has transformed himself into an outspoken advocate of aggressive deficit spending.",
            "“There are enormous consequences if we just let things go,” Kashkari told CNBC viewers on Wednesday. “Whatever Congress can do with the executive branch ― come together aggressively to put money in the hands of people who have lost their jobs and to support small businesses so that we don’t have this continuing wave of bankruptcies across the economy ― it’s just vital that they move quickly.”",
            "This would have been an extraordinary message to hear from a Republican official a few years ago. Throughout Barack Obama’s presidency, the GOP warned that the accumulation of government debt was a menace to future generations and a threat to near-term economic stability. Even Democrats were worried. Obama himself called on the government to tighten its belt in his 2010 State of the Union address, a message his administration reinforced throughout the year, even with the unemployment rate hovering near double-digits.",
            "Since March, however, Congress has appropriated $3 trillion to fight the coronavirus crash ― more than triple the size of Obama’s 2009 stimulus package ― and authorized trillions more in Federal Reserve lending.",
            "Kashkari, like most economists these days, sees the current economic decay as a far more serious problem than all of this spending. Job creation has slowed to a trickle since federal aid payments ended in July, and new layoffs continue to flow at levels that were very recently unthinkable. Last week, 840,000 people lost their jobs. Prior to the pandemic, the single worst week for job losses ever had been 695,000. Under conditions like these, witholding fiscal relief would court catastrophe.",
            "Kashkari is just as conservative on economic policy as he’s ever been. But what it means to be a conservative intellectual is changing. When he calls for aggressive federal economic management, Kashkari is not so much giving ground to the left as giving voice to an emerging bipartisan consensus from the respectable, cuff-linked political center. Under this view, people in a democracy may disagree on just how debt and deficits should accrue, but deficits themselves are a normal feature of a functioning polity, not a dire threat to economic health.",
            "The change in the intellectual wind has been unmistakable. Economists who spent the George W. Bush and Obama years warning of a looming national bankruptcy now shrug off debt levels unseen in living memory. An influential new conservative think tank called American Compass has dedicated its existence to flouting the Republican economic orthodoxy of the past two decades. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, a veteran of the George H.W. Bush White House with impeccable fiscal conservative credentials, urged lawmakers this week to pass another stimulus bill.",
            "Liberals are moving in the same direction. In January 2019, Clinton and Obama administration alums Jason Furman and Lawrence Summers published an essay in Foreign Affairs titled, “Who’s Afraid of Budget Deficits?” Bernie Sanders adviser Stephanie Kelton’s new book ”The Deficit Myth” is a New York Times bestseller. Everyone on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” seems to take the economic wisdom of further stimulus legislation for granted, and the public agrees. According to a September poll commissioned by the Financial Times and the Peterson Institute, 91% of Americans want to see Congress pass another stimulus package.",
            "“Any sensible policy is going to have us racking up the deficit for a long time,” Harvard economist Ken Rogoff told The New York Times in May. “If we go up another $10 trillion, I wouldn’t even blink at that now.” Back in 2011, then-Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) was holding up Rogoff’s research on the perils of national debt to call for massive, immediate budget cuts.",
            "Over the past three decades, deficit hawks have issued several different warnings about the dangers of government debt, none of which have come to pass. High debt levels haven’t forced interest rates up to punishing levels. They haven’t sparked inflation, and they haven’t ignited a financial crisis. A large existing debt burden hasn’t even constrained the government’s ability to combat an unforeseen calamity, as demonstrated by the trillions of dollars in coronavirus relief this year.",
            "In a sharp departure from the Obama years, nobody in Washington even questions whether this year’s relief has worked. Lonely opponents of government spending now rely increasingly on ideological objections about the proper role of government, instead of questioning the technical efficiency of government action.",
            "“What about true capitalism?” CNBC’s Joe Kernen asked Kashkari on Wednesday. “What about … not debasing our currency, holding the line on money-printing and not letting Congress get totally profligate? What about letting the chips fall where they may?”",
            "“It’s an interesting theoretical concept,” Kashkari replied. “It’s like letting the forest fire just rage. Let it burn and eventually it will burn itself out and meanwhile, all the animals are all dead.”",
            "But Congress has been slow to adjust to this changing intellectual terrain. One of the first orders of business for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) when Democrats regained the House majority in 2019 was to pass a rule requiring that all new legislation be fully paid for with either spending cuts or tax increases.",
            "It was a symbolic measure, and Congress has waived the requirement for its coronavirus relief. But the symbolism mattered, and the House majority’s commitment to its anti-debt principles created a great deal of trouble when lawmakers were crafting their initial response to the coronavirus crash this spring.",
            "During the early pandemic relief talks, Pelosi killed an effort to provide universal payments to American families, citing fiscal responsibility, and insisted on more carefully “targeted” relief to families who needed it more. Later, as Democrats were putting forward a proposal for a second stimulus, she shot down a proposal for new automatic stabilizers ― relief payments that kick in whenever economic conditions cross a certain threshold, without need for fresh negotiations in Congress. Pelosi told the press that automatic stabilizers were a good idea, but they resulted in a higher budget “score” and made the Democratic plan look more expensive.",
            "Over the past few weeks, of course, Pelosi has discarded her old concerns about the debt. In negotiations with the Trump administration, she has been demanding hundreds of billions of dollars in additional spending to top up a proposal from Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin that already includes trillions of dollars in fresh relief.",
            "On Friday, the White House signaled it was ready to accept a deal ― a chaotic reversal from its position on Tuesday, when Trump called off relief talks until after the election. If the president maintains his current stimulus-friendly course, his chief obstacle will be the Republican-controlled Senate, where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and most of his caucus have abruptly decided that deficits are now a pressing problem.",
            "Republican senators of course did not voice these debt worries when they approved trillions of dollars in tax cuts for the wealthy in 2017, or when they funneled federal dollars to large corporations in March. Once it was clear that the rich had for the most part been rescued from the coronavirus crash, Capitol Hill Republicans have been content to declare victory and cite the deficit to justify inaction.",
            "McConnell may bend to the new deficit-friendly intellectual consensus, or he may not. With Trump plummeting in the polls, Republicans do not feel the same sense of loyalty to him that they did throughout most of his presidency. And the short-term political value to Republicans from a new bill is limited, since it will take time for the money to move through the system. The public almost certainly won’t feel much relief before Election Day.",
            "But whatever McConnell decides, the intellectual legitimacy of the Senate’s current fiscal agenda is in tatters.

            "Season 2, however, details his demise from adored public defender to monstrous megalomaniac as he grapples with his decisions. Homelander, reeling from the death of Stillwell, falls for the new Seven supe Stormfront (Aya Cash), who ropes him into her wicked ways and uses the Vought platform to push sadistic ideals and a racist agenda.",
            "In the Season 2 finale, Homelander loses his girlfriend, his son and the rest of his humanity all at once.",
            "Starr hopped on the phone from his quarantined film set in Bulgaria to break down the wrath of Homelander and the madness to come.",
            "“The Boys” was in the top 10 for streaming, according to Nielsen data, which is so exciting. You defeated Netflix!",
            "It’s incredible. I mean, Netflix is a behemoth. It’s The Beast. There’s nothing quite like it in terms of scale, and so to be seriously competing with that is\nphenomenal. I think everyone is pretty blown away and very appreciative to our extremely enthusiastic and passionate fans. There wouldn’t be a show without them. Everyone is really very grateful for all the fans that have given us, already, so much support.",
            "Season 1 was so stellar, and it surprised a lot of people. So how was it to come back for a second season and try to re-create that feeling? Was it nerve-wracking to live up to what you guys accomplished the first go-around?",
            "It’s funny, I’m really conscious of that because, unfortunately, it’s a common occurrence ― that difficult second-album syndrome. I know that shows may have a decent first season and then try and go bigger instead of going deeper. And that’s the key, is rather than trying to make the world bigger and more expansive and more fancy and all that, you really have to go deeper with the characters and really lock into what it is people respond to, which is character-driven story.",
            "“The Boys” is really self-assured and has a real self-confidence about it that you want out of a show ― it grows and develops and really plays with identity. So my hat goes off to Eric [Kripke]. He’s the God of the show and he was very conscious of Season 2 coming out and being good, and he fulfilled that wish. We all have a debt of gratitude to him.",
            "Like you mentioned, the show does go bigger ― it’s ultra satirical, still violent, still grotesque ― but fans get to go deeper with these characters.",
            "The only lie Eric’s ever told me is, “We’re going to go deeper, we’re not going to get bigger.” But if there’s a 50-foot prosthetic whale on a beach in Toronto, you definitely haven’t gotten smaller. Somehow, he pulled it off. Kudos to him.",
            "I think that’s why fans respond to the show is that shock value ― the giant whale, the exploding heads, the blood, all that milk.",
            "Yeah, I think you’re right. But with, you know, French film, which has borderline real sex and full-frontal nudity, there’s a shock value in certain things that does seem like shock for the sake of shock. If you actually look at the shocking moments in “The Boys,” and as far as I’m concerned this is why they work, they all come from character-driven story. Like The Deep [Chace Crawford] riding the whale and then the speedboat slamming into the whale, The Deep turns up on the back of a whale really desperately trying to get back into The Seven. So while I do think there are shocking things in there, they’re motivated and protected by character and story.",
            "I totally get that. Like an obsession with milk, which is of course is a big part of Homelander’s troubled inner psyche.",
            "Exactly. This is the weakest character on the show ― he’s the strongest man and the weakest emotionally. That milk is just a reflection of the really lonely, sad, little boy that is in there somewhere; a little man desperately trying to hold on to the memory of something and someone that he didn’t realize he needed. He acted impetuously and got rid of [Madelyn Stillwell]. So, it’s funny watching a grown man drink breast milk, but it’s also comedy and tragedy, right? It’s such a desperate, needy, weak, tragic act. And it just happens to be insanely weird. [Laughs]",
            "What was your personal take on Homelander’s journey this season, from his mommy issues to his fatherhood journey and his relationship with Stormfront. There was a lot to dig into.",
            "It was much more challenging than I realized it was going to be when we set out, which is great because it means that we’re evolving the character in the right way. A lot of episodic TV can just be you build a character and then you put the character in a different situation every week and they solve the crime or whatever, but we kept digging into the character and putting him into new situations where he was forced to grow or adapt or change. From a personal point of view, I was really thrilled that we got to do that. Then from the character’s perspective, Season 1 was, in a way, Homelander’s emancipation, if you like. Eric uses the metaphor of, “He wants to become a producer on the show.” Homelander wanted more. He wanted to do more and he believed he had more to offer. When Stillwell was holding him back and manipulating him, he finally got fed up. He really, in a way, broke the shackles emotionally for himself and then killed her and released himself.",
            "Season 2 was very much dealing with the consequences of those actions, both externally and internally. He is extremely needy, emotionally like a child. He desperately craves connection and hates himself for it because that’s such a human need. His kryptonite, for lack of a better word, would be his own humanity and that weakness in himself. So Season 2 is all about him exploring that need and trying to come to terms with it and actually open up. I mean, he got a girlfriend!",
            "And he has a son.",
            "There’s a scene in Episode 8 that’s very hopeful. He’s trying to help his son, who gets freaked out by the crowd in the restaurant, and he shows genuine affection for this kid. It’s an intense personal journey for him this season, and it was really satisfying to play.",
            "Stormfront comes in and replaces Stillwell in terms of giving Homelander that female connection and someone to follow. What layer did their relationship add to his character, and how was it working with Aya Cash this season?",
            "Let me start with that because I can’t say enough about how great Aya is. One, she’s Jewish coming in to play a Nazi, which I thought Homelander was pretty bad in Season 1 and then Stormfront showed up and it was like, “Wow.” The character’s ideology, her philosophy, is just appalling. And little ol’ Aya Cash is probably one of the nicest humans that I’ve met, and it really tore her up having to say some of the things that the character believes. She was visibly upset. But she really went there and went for it, and people are loving to hate her.",
            "It’s really that character who helped the show tackle that idea of systemic racism and other social issues that are very relevant in our world right now.",
            "All of that stuff was written well in advance of 2020, you know? So we had no idea that it was going to dovetail quite so flushly. It really struck a chord. To even have a character like that on any show at any time is pretty bold and could go either way. People can receive it in a positive or very negative way. But to have it happen in 2020 with the race issues going on in America ― well, they’ve always been going on, but they’re seemingly, and hopefully positively, coming to a head ― it’s really been quite incredible to see the fan response. People, by and large, want that conversation not to be shut away and pushed back under the rug. The timing is just surreal, but I think they appreciate that there’s a show that’s actually putting it out there. A show that’s not pulling any punches when it comes to that stuff; that’s actually putting a foot forward and, unapologetically, making a statement about it.",
            "Similarly, the show spoke to the Me Too movement last season with everything that went on with Starlight [Erin Moriarty] and The Deep.",
            "Absolutely. And I do think that because of the fiscal and economic imperatives of television, there’s a lot of bean-counters who get very trepidatious before these shows come out when they take on this material. And I would credit Amazon for having the balls to actually back a show that is unapologetically making statements about issues that are relevant, current and, sadly, timeless ― and badly need to be exposed. These conversations need to be had. We get a fun show that actually has some purpose, which is about all you can ask for.",
            "The Season 2 finale was heartbreaking. Homelander’s son Ryan escapes his grasp and then tragically kills his mother and Billy Butcher’s wife, Becca, while trying to take out Stormfront. Man, what a scene.",
            "Ay ay ay. It’s funny because usually in scenes you’re so focused on what you’re doing and your take and trying to orchestrate it all, but I have to say\nKarl Urban [Billy Butcher], my fellow Kiwi, made me cry. I really got caught up in his performance. I thought that he was absolutely phenomenal.",
            "Like Homelander, Butcher shows so many signs of making a turn for the better, and then chooses the wrong path. Becca’s death will surely make him vulnerable.",
            "Yeah, there’s a tragedy in that. One good thing, going back to the social commentary and how we sort of navigate that, is there is no moral ambiguity on the show. If you’re a bad person, bad shit’s going to happen to you and there is a real sense of balance and justice. That’s why Stormfront meeting her demise was inevitable.",
            "Men in power often abuse their power and, expectedly, Homelander chooses power over family in the end.",
            "I mean, he emotionally buckled and his ego is titanic. I don’t know if there is ever going to be redemption for that guy. We’ll see.",
            "Season 3 is greenlit, but I’m sure production is a tricky thing right now. Do you have an idea of what’s to come?",
            "It is a very tricky time. I know that some time next year we will go back. I don’t know specifics about when. As far as storyline, I have no idea. That’s all kept very close to the writers’ chests, but I did ask Eric at the end of Season 2 because I was like, “Fuck. Where do we go with this character from here?” And he’s like, “I don’t want to give anything away, but the two words that will resonate for Homelander in Season 3 will be ‘homicidal maniac.’” I kind of thought we had done that, but if that’s to come, God help us.",
            "The last we see of Homelander he’s masturbating above the city, shouting, “I can do whatever the fuck I want.” It was truly something.",
            "Yeah ... that is definitely one of the stranger days I’ve had at work. It was definitely a very strange way to finish the season. Again, it’s a bizarre, shocking, wild-factor moment, but it’s actually incredibly sad. He’s so needy and so desperate.",
            "It sounds like Homelander definitely challenges you and pushes your limits as an actor.",
            "We got lucky with the creative team on a great collaboration right off the bat. It doesn’t work for everyone, but I’m not backwards about coming forward with ideas. I love getting really stuck into the character and trying to take as much ownership of it as I can. Thankfully, Eric is absolutely onboard with that and encouraging. He’s just such a great collaborator and, pretty much, if you talk to anyone else in the cast they would agree. It really instills a sense of confidence in the creative team to take risks and not be afraid to fail. It’s one of the assets of the show."

            "This week, millions of women struggled to manage their paying jobs while also doing the unpaid work of homeschooling, and about half of the nation’s children did not go to school in person. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump, fresh from a hospital stay for COVID-19 and back in his government-funded, well-staffed home, killed any plans for more pandemic relief ahead of the election.",
            "“I cried on the phone with my dad recently just talking about how impossible this is,” Marissa Maciel, a mother of two living in Northern California, told HuffPost in a lengthy email this week. “I have a partner at least, and a remote (mostly) job, and I am so stressed.”",
            "Like millions of other women across the country, Maciel said she is exhausted — struggling to work from home, while helping her children, one in elementary school and one in middle school, with remote learning. “We’ve basically become assistant teachers,” said Maciel, who is an administrator in higher education. “If I’m not helping with school or working on work, I’m doing chores.” There is somehow more laundry than ever before, she noted.",
            "From the start, the economic fallout of the pandemic has hit women harder than men. Women lost more jobs than men because industries dominated by women were the ones most impacted by the downturn — think hotels, restaurants, the travel sector, hair salons. One in five child care workers, almost all women, lost their jobs. Black and Latina women have suffered from the economic downturn the most.",
            "Then came the school closures. And many caretakers, primarily women, could not leave home to work, or even look for new jobs, because they had kids at home from school.",
            "“I expected it to be really bad,” Michael Madowitz, an economist at the progressive Center for American Progress who has been tracking women’s struggles in the workforce since the start of the pandemic. “It’s worse than I was ready for.”",
            "Unlike in every previous recession, the unemployment rate for women is higher than it is for men. In September, 865,000 women left the labor force, compared to 216,000 men, according to the Labor Department. That’s the highest number in history, with the exception of March, when lockdowns forced millions of men and women out of work. The percentage of women in the workforce, 55.6%, is as low now as it was in 1986.",
            "“Life has gotten so much harder at levels we couldn’t imagine,” said Daniella Knight, a Latina mother of three young children in Alexandria, Virginia, who shared her story Tuesday afternoon on a call with reporters hosted by the Center for American Progress.",
            "Even before COVID-19, Knight was familiar with the competing pressures of work and family. She was forced to quit a job, years ago, when she was pregnant with her first child because her boss refused to be flexible about her doctor’s appointments. After her second and third children were born, she was able to take only two weeks of paid leave.",
            "Still, she and her husband got by, working different shifts during the day to avoid spending money on child care they couldn’t afford. She had two part-time jobs — by day at a property management company, at night as a pediatric sleep specialist.",
            "With the pandemic, they were both working from home, struggling to help their children with remote school. Knight had to come into the office at the property firm at night to make it all work.",
            "“It was beyond exhausting. I was barely functioning on four to five hours of sleep,” said Knight, who is a member of the activist group Moms Rising. “It got very stressful.”",
            "When her kids’ school district announced that classes would be virtual again this September, she quit working. “It was not sustainable.”",
            "Madowitz believes this “child care shock” is what is driving women out of work now. Because women are the majority of the ones doing the care work at home, they’re the ones hurting from the virtual schooling, the erratic hybrid schedules, the child care center closures, etc.",
            "“This should be totally surprising to five people,” Madowitz said, ruefully.",
            "Meanwhile, women, still clinging to their paying jobs while taking on the overwhelming task of homeschooling their children, are on the edge of burnout. One in four professional women are considering leaving their jobs or downshifting their careers, according to a report released last week by McKinsey & Company and LeanIn.Org, the women’s advocacy group.",
            "And women are facing the same old gender bias that’s hurt mothers in the workforce for decades. Twice as many mothers say they’re afraid they’ll be penalized at work for having to handle child care issues at home, according to the survey, which polled 40,000 employees from 47 companies, and also conducted deeper conversations with 49 women.",
            "“You hear the same things over and over,” said Rachel Thomas, co-founder and president at Lean In. They report feeling exhausted, like they’re failing at everything, she said.",
            "“Women are being pushed to the brink,” Thomas said. And it’s not just because of increased responsibilities at home, but because of a longstanding bias: Women are typically judged more harshly at work, perceived as less committed and held to higher standards, she said.",
            "“It’s not business as usual and so a lot of the biases or pressures that women experience in the workplace are heightened right now and women are feeling it,” Thomas said.",
            "By the twisted logic of the COVID-19 economy, Stephanie, a 39-year-old mother of two living in Pittsburgh, is “lucky.” First, she still has a job, working as a senior manager at a behavioral health facility. And, she’s able to go to the office and leave her 11-year-old daughter at home to do remote learning, while her 19-year-old son is home.",
            "Stephanie, who asked that we not publish her last name to avoid retaliation at work, would prefer working from home to keep an eye on her daughter, but she believes she’ll be judged harshly by her superiors.",
            "The last time she asked to work remotely, her boss warned her that she’d better actually do work. “It was off-putting,” she said. “I’ve never again asked to work from home.”",
            "Worse, the policy at her office is that if you work from home, there must be someone else there dealing with child care. At the start of the pandemic, her employer had everyone sign a contract committing to this rule. It was crafted by the men in charge. “I just feel these decisions have been made without really taking into account how this is affecting mothers or men with children,” she said.",
            "Maciel, the mother in North California, said there are still a lot of people at work who expect her to do her job exactly as she had before. So she crafted an auto-reply for her email to reset expectations.",

            "It seems like every company is now pledging to tackle the climate crisis and do its bit to save the world ― while still selling you stuff, of course. At least a dozen major companies have made headlines this year announcing bold climate targets. In September alone, AT&T, Facebook, Walmart and Morgan Stanley all pledged to become carbon neutral within the next couple of decades.",
            "These are desperately needed commitments given government inaction on climate change, experts say. And they’re long overdue.",
            "“The public sector has failed to take as much leadership as many, many people think we need to take,” said Michael Vandenbergh, co-director of the Climate Change Research Network at Vanderbilt Law School. “I think these efforts, overall, are essential.”",
            "But it’s important, he added, to look behind the corporate-speak and dissect these initiatives to determine if they truly have teeth and to hold companies accountable for actually fulfilling their promises. In a sea of impressive-sounding pledges, each using slightly different language, it can be hard to tell what’s meaningful and what’s greenwashing. To try to decode what these pledges really mean, HuffPost asked climate experts to help guide us.",
            "What’s the main way companies plan to tackle climate change?",
            "The most common pledges set net-zero targets, sometimes described as going carbon neutral or climate neutral. What this usually means is that the company plans to address the problem of planet-heating emissions by offsetting its own emissions. Net-zero targets may focus on carbon emissions specifically or include all greenhouse gas emissions. (You often need to look at the fine print to determine which the company means.)",
            "To understand the net-zero approach, think of a bathtub where the water is running, and the tub starts to fill up. This represents the emissions a company is releasing. But then you open the drain and water starts to flow out. This represents the company taking steps to lower its climate impact. Net-zero is achieved when these two things ― filling the tub and draining it ― are balanced.",
            "For a company to reach net-zero, its own operations and its entire value chain (suppliers, manufacturers and so on) must not release more emissions into the atmosphere than they’re able to remove.",
            "Hundreds of companies around the world have set themselves net-zero targets ― from Molson Coors to Target, Ralph Lauren and even cigarette company Philip Morris International. Last month Facebook announced its aim to have net-zero carbon emissions from its operations, supply chain, employee commuting and business travel by 2030. Apple plans to be net-zero carbon by that same date, while Amazon hopes to be carbon neutral by 2040.",
            "Why we should be cautious about offsets.",
            "A company can offset its climate impact by using technology or nature-based solutions.",
            "There’s been a lot of hype around negative emissions technologies, which include sucking carbon out of the air and storing it deep underground, creating building materials from plants, and sequestering carbon in soil. The majority of these ideas, however, are still in the developmental stages, meaning their potential to deploy at scale has yet to be proven.",
            "Planting trees has a much more established climate benefit, but it still comes with caveats. “Forests are not necessarily a permanent carbon sink and climate change causes them to burn,” said Zdravka Tzankova, an associate professor at Vanderbilt University. “We will run out of [space on the] planet if every company decided to offset their emissions by having a nature-based solution of some sort.”",
            "All the experts agreed that relying solely on offsets is bad. These strategies definitely have a place, said John Sottong, senior associate at the World Resources Institute (WRI), but the companies are still releasing emissions into the atmosphere.",
            "“[Offsetting] is not automatically a bad thing,” agreed Bill Weihl, executive director of the grassroots campaign group ClimateVoice. “But if that is the bulk of how they are eliminating their impact in terms of emissions, I think that is a problem. We’re not going to offset our way out of this problem. We actually have to reduce emissions.”",
            "Are any companies actually trying to reduce their climate footprint?",
            "Rather than just balancing their climate impact, some companies are aiming to stop releasing CO2 altogether. This is called going “zero carbon.”",
            "If a company is “truly saying zero carbon and they really mean that, that means they’re not relying on offsets,” said Weihl.",
            "In September, Google promised to power its operations with entirely carbon-free energy by 2030.",
            "That same month, Walmart announced that it plans to reach zero carbon emissions across its operations by 2040 without relying on carbon offsets. To help achieve this goal, it aims to power its operations entirely with renewable energy by 2035 and switch over to electric transportation vehicles, including its long-haul trucks.",
            "Finally, there’s “carbon negative,” which means that companies are offsetting more than they’re emitting. The goal here is for the corporation not only to release fewer emissions but to help draw down the concentration of CO2 in our atmosphere to a safer level than it is currently.",
            "Microsoft ― which has been carbon neutral thanks to offsets since 2012 ― made waves when it announced in January that it would go carbon negative by 2030. By 2050, it said, it will remove enough carbon from the atmosphere to make up for all of its emissions released since it was founded in 1975. It plans to do this through decarbonization ― phasing out the use of fossil fuels ― as well as investing funds to help “accelerate the development” of new carbon reduction technology.",
            "Check whether a company is looking at all of its climate impacts.",
            "When assessing a corporate climate pledge, experts say one of the first things to look at is whether the company is talking about emissions just from its own direct operations (“scope 1” emissions), or if it’s also tackling the indirect emissions that come from generating the electricity it uses (“scope 2”), as well as all those other indirect emissions associated with the materials and services it uses (“scope 3”).",
            "For instance, if a grocery store chain has set a climate target, is it just running its stores with greater energy efficiency? Or has it promised to also power its shops and warehouses with clean energy? And beyond those scope 1 and 2 impacts, is it tackling the climate effects associated with producing the food it sells or the pollution caused by packaging and transporting that food?",
            "“For a lot of contemporary corporations, scope 3 emissions are actually the largest percentage of total emissions,” said Tzankova.",
            "Apple, for example, is promising to tackle scope 3 emissions by making its products and supply chain carbon neutral by 2030. To achieve this, it plans to source “low carbon aluminum” to make its phones and laptops, to use more and more recycled aluminum, and to prioritize suppliers who use hydropower, rather than coal, to run their facilities.",
            "By committing to reduce emissions along its supply chain, a company can have far-reaching impacts. “It’s pushing its commitment, its carbon reductions, all around the world, even absent an international agreement,” said Vandenbergh. “So that begins to change the incentives of manufacturers and ultimately countries.”",
            "Beware behind-the-scenes lobbying.",
            "There are lots of things that companies do that don’t show up in their climate commitments but that can have a huge impact on how the world faces the climate crisis. Namely, lobbying and public relations.",
            "Companies spent more than $2 billion lobbying against climate change legislation in the United States between 2000 and 2016, outspending the renewables industry and green groups 10 to 1. Many utility, transport and fossil fuel companies also have a long history of spreading climate denial through misleading marketing campaigns, hiring their own scientists to help spread doubt, and funding think tanks that disparage climate science.",
            "And it’s not just what individual companies are pushing, but also what the trade associations they belong to are doing. Major trade groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Legislative Exchange Council (better known as ALEC) have long sought to undermine climate action.",
            "Earlier this year, BP and Royal Dutch Shell publicly quit a handful of industry groups known to lobby against environmental regulations. However, as a HuffPost and Unearthed investigation recently revealed, both oil giants still remain members of several state and regional trade associations that have fought climate action.",
            "“It’s vital that companies decarbonize their own operations and their supply chain. But even more importantly, we need to decarbonize how society works,” said Weihl. To do this, he said, companies must “become really vigorous advocates for the kinds of public policy that can drive economy-wide, rapid decarbonization.”",
            "Experts agree that if companies truly want to fight climate change, they should also be advocating for governments to do more.",
            "In the past several years, more businesses have been calling on lawmakers to tighten states’ clean energy standards and to loosen power utilities’ stranglehold on options for cleaner electricity, according to Tzankova’s research. These companies include Procter & Gamble, Unilever, Ben & Jerry’s, Target, Apple and Microsoft.",
            "“Every company, regardless of what it does in its operations, has political influence. And using it to delay action, I would argue, is bad,” Weihl said. “Choosing not to use it is basically being complicit with the really loud, powerful voices that have been working to delay action for decades.”",
            "How skeptical should we be of fossil fuel companies setting climate targets?",
            "This is a “difficult one” said Sottong, “because you want them at the table, and you want them making serious commitments. [But] unless a fossil fuel company just comes out and says, ‘You know what, we’re just going to change our business model entirely,’ … then they’re going to fall short.”",
            "Fossil fuel companies that have climate targets but still plan to expand their production of fossil fuels are doing little more than leaning away from outright climate denial, Weihl argues. Ultimately, it’s a “delaying tactic.”",
            "BP, Shell and Total have all said they will reach net-zero by 2050, but none of them have committed to cutting their oil and gas output over the next decade. Instead, they will be relying on offsets to achieve net-zero within their own operations.",
            "Most experts agree that it’s good these companies have taken the first step in acknowledging something needs to be done. “But I don’t think we should be satisfied,” said Vandenbergh.",
            "“Ultimately, we need to see those companies developing business plans and becoming financially successful by doing something that doesn’t emit massive amounts of greenhouse gases,” he said.",
            "How can we tell if a company will stay committed to its goals?",
            "Experts say companies must be transparent about the steps they’re taking ― and the progress they’re making ― to achieve their goals. In addition to having a clear plan when announcing their targets, companies should release regular reports that outline what they’ve achieved so far and how much they’re emitting.",
            "Microsoft is a leader in this space. Not only does it publish its own annual sustainability reports, but it also shares its data with carbon disclosure nonprofit CDP to analyze independently.",
            "Partnering with other companies and nonprofits also shows a willingness to be held to account. In July, a group of corporations including Nike, Unilever, Starbucks, Danone, Microsoft and Mercedes-Benz launched the Transform to Net Zero initiative to share resources and strategies for achieving their targets.",
            "“Industry-NGO partnerships and similar types of ‘green clubs’ is a good sign,” said Tzankova. “It makes the commitment more public and builds an additional layer of accountability. Plus, it gives companies access to more and better resources and a network that can help with attainment of the more ambitious commitments.”",
            "It’s also a good sign, experts say, if companies have joined the Science Based Targets Initiative ― a collaboration among CDP, the United Nations Global Compact, WRI, the World Wide Fund for Nature and the We Mean Business Coalition ― which works to define best practices and offer guidance to companies looking to align their targets with the latest science on climate change. Currently, 992 companies are part of the group.",
            "That gives the companies’ commitment “credibility,” said Sottong, because it shows that they have studied their emission impacts and that experts have helped ensure “their targets are, indeed, aggressive enough.”",
            "“There will be laggards and there will be leaders,” said Weihl. “And the leaders need to go way faster than the average, if they can, to compensate for the laggards.”",
            "Some industries ― such as cement and steel production ― will move more slowly because the main strategy for decarbonizing them relies on technology like carbon capture and storage that is not available at scale yet.",
            "But we shouldn’t let the slow movers off the hook, said Vandenbergh. While we scrutinize all companies’ pledges and push them to do more, he said, “we want to make sure that we don’t direct all of our criticism and activism towards the firms that are trying to do the right thing or at least sticking their necks out by making commitments. … [Don’t] let the others just lie in the weeds and avoid scrutiny.”",

            "As nutrition information becomes more widely available and ingredient transparency is more widely demanded due to food allergies and sensitivities, people are continually stunned at the amount of empty, nutritionally deficient calories they’re consuming when they dine out or order delivery.",
            "But with a few easy fixes, you can hack your order and make it fit the ideal 1:1:2 ratio of carbs, protein and vegetables that professionals recommend.",
            "After all, when you bring your food home, you’re free to make additions, subtractions and substitutions however you please to make it more beneficially nutritious, no matter the type of cuisine you order.",
            "Let’s address some of the most common takeout and delivery cuisines you can easily make more nutritious.",
            "Strategize Your Sandwiches",
            "Every sandwich needs ― to borrow Ross Gellar’s term ― a “moist-maker.” For that reason, mayo is a must for many people. However, it’s a caloric bomb, especially if it’s slathered on with a heavy hand. The good news is, you have alternatives.",
            "When ordering a sandwich, ask the restaurant to leave off the mayo so you can finish dressing it at home with your own. Sandwiches without mayo will be less soggy when you receive them anyway.",
            "As registered dietician Casey McCoy reasons, “adding mayonnaise yourself allows you to choose how much goes on. If they do it for you, you may end up eating more than you normally would.”",
            "Another reason to sauce up at home? You can cut calories with canola oil mayonnaise or get on trend with avocado oil. However, McCoy recommends olive oil as “a better fat choice.”",
            "Aside from this simple swap, bringing a sandwich home also opens up a plethora of add-on and change-up choices, allowing you to deconstruct and customize it in the privacy of your own kitchen. There, no one will look at you askance if you take off a slice of bread to replace it with a few leaves of lettuce. And you won’t get any odd looks, either, for completely taking apart your sandwich and putting it on a bowl of salad greens. Both are great ways to increase your vegetable intake, the nutritional value of the meal, and inch up to that 2:1:1 ratio.",
            "Healthier Salad Hacks",
            "If a salad typically doesn’t fill you up, it’s easy to convert it into something substantial that’s still nutritious. Consider turning your salad into an overstuffed wrap using tortillas, lavash bread or pitas with better nutritional value than what is offered at most restaurants. Eschew the side of bread that usually accompanies a salad, and instead, look for whole grains, high fiber, higher protein and low sugar on the nutritional labels of home pantry staples.",
            "Another great tip for salads is to ask for the cheese and/or sweet toppings like dried fruits and nuts on the side. Although “these additions are a great choice for a salad to actually be satisfying and fill you up appropriately,” according to McCoy, getting the high-calorie ingredients on the side can help you personalize and control how much you’re consuming.",
            "For takeout, salad dressing is usually separated, so that’s one less ask you have to make. This allows you to use just enough so that your greens aren’t drowning in it. “Toss it in a big bowl at home while you add the dressing to make sure it’s well-dressed,” McCoy recommends, “or use some lemon for extra flavor instead of using more dressing.”",
            "Asian Takeout Additions",
            "It’s easy to increase the nutritional value of your Asian restaurant takeout when you order. For one, tofu is a nutritional superstar McCoy calls “a great and inexpensive source of protein that is very easily absorbed, and a rich source of isoflavones, which research has shown to have protective effects against cardiovascular disease and some cancers.”",
            "But even better, across the continent, vegetables feature heavily in most wok-fired dishes. Her pick is often Thai, which “tends to be a pretty healthy takeout pick because they have a lot of vegetable-heavy offerings.”",
            "You can also steam-crisp or stir-fry your own vegetables and then toss them in the sauce that came with your takeout. This can help re-proportion the dish to better fit the ideal ratio.",
            "Boosting your vegetable quotient with a quick homemade sauté works for many of the more indulgent noodle dishes, too. Matchstick vegetables like carrots, broccoli stalks, bell peppers and cabbage blend in well with lo mein, drunken noodles, chow fun, mei fun, yaki udon, and more. For no-cook, no-fuss toss-ins, bean sprouts can contribute a refreshing bite to heavier noodle mains, as can sliced snow peas or chopped sugar snaps. For soups, adding baby bok choy is actually quite traditional, or add Chinese or nappa cabbage or romaine lettuce (don’t knock it until you try it!).",
            "Finally, you can ask for brown rice instead of white. McCoy says “you’ll be adding fiber and nutrients that will make you feel more satisfied than refined grains like white rice.”",
            "Italian Updates",
            "Pizza is often considered a cheat food, but there are multiple ways to make it more nutritious.",
            "You know that slice is going to taste better after a few minutes in the toaster oven, so why not add some vegetables to it while you’re at it? Ordering a plain cheese pizza (or a vegetable one) gives you wiggle room to control your ratios. You can add grilled chicken, turkey pepperoni, turkey sausage, or sautéed and drained lean ground beef to make the proteins lean, or steam spinach or broccoli to toss on top of a white pizza and let them get toasty. Alternatively, zucchini is a nice add-on for red-sauce pies, and peppers, onions, and mushrooms are classics.",
            "“I like to order a Caesar salad with my pizza and/or add lots of vegetable toppings to it,” McCoy said. “It sounds simple, but romaine is higher in vitamin A, folate, and fiber than kale or spinach, and anchovies have omega-3s, while olive oil is a monounsaturated fat, both of which can reduce the risk of heart disease.”",
            "Caesar and other salads are typically on the menu at any Italian restaurant or pizza parlor, but what isn’t often advertised is that customers can usually request a side of steamed vegetables instead of the usual pasta side. This is typically some variation of a medley that may feature broccoli, zucchini, cauliflower, carrots and green beans. Sautéed or steamed broccoli, spinach and broccoli rabe are also often on offer, and they go better with marsala wine sauce dishes, française or piccata preps than clashingly sauced pasta.",
            "Latin American Twists",
            "Food from this corner of the world is also easy to make healthy when you order. Two effortless changes would be to request no cheese or sour cream on your dish. Instead, add your own pre-grated cheese at home — it typically comes in nonfat, part-skim, 2% or whole fat options, but McCoy suggests forgoing fat-free options for something 2% or more. “Your body needs fat,” cautions McCoy, “and fat-free isn’t as satisfying and may cause you to overeat later.”",
            "To substitute for the sour cream, 2% Greek yogurt is an easy edit that keeps the flavors and mouthfeel indulgent while introducing helpful live and active cultures to your gut flora as well as increasing protein.",
            "Establishments can often make other substitutions for you. Swapping white rice for brown, when available, is one of them. You can ask to swap rice for beans or request twice the peppers and onions in lieu of rice or in addition to it. Lettuce is also typically available, so just ask for it if you don’t want a whole side salad!",
            "When it comes to Mexican food like tacos, say “yes” to all the vegetable accompaniments: the pico de gallo, the charred green onions, the shredded cabbage or lettuce. In fact, while you’re at it, dice up some more fresh tomatoes for their many vitamins and minerals and chop up more cabbage at home to bury your taco filling in, adding fiber as well as a palate-cleanser for the salt and char. Consider it more of a side than an accent.",
            "You can also ask for corn tortillas instead of flour, which typically have far fewer calories. Corn is “less refined and contains more fiber,” than flour, McCoy said. Another alternative? Skip the tortillas entirely in dishes like fajitas, and turn them into rice and salad bowls.",
            "The same applies for other types of Latin American food: Get a side salad with your Cuban or medianoche sandwich; ask for grilled veggies instead of rice or beans; add versatile sautéed zucchini to your ropa vieja or arroz con pollo; put your roasted pork on a salad; ask for your crema on the side and save your sweet plantains for dessert.",
            "A Sweet Finish",
            "And what’s dinner out without dessert? You can slightly moderate your indulgence by asking the restaurant to pack your dessert plain, skipping the restaurant’s embellishments such as whipped cream, ice cream, caramel sauces, chocolate drizzles, and the like. Instead, add your own at home. Use frozen yogurt, light ice cream or lighter whipped cream. Choose reduced sugar, no-sugar-added or added-fiber jams or jellies for accent flavors. Or just go with some fresh fruit. When you’re finishing the dish in your own kitchen, the choice is entirely yours.",
            "As you can see, ordering in doesn’t mean having to leave your nutrition by the wayside. Go ahead and have that taco night, order the pizza after a busy day, call for Chinese, and get that dessert to split. You deserve it, and with these dietician-approved simple swaps and additions, you don’t even have to earn it."

            "At a town hall in Miami, the former vice president was asked about his plan for protecting abortion access in light of President Donald Trump’s nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court.",
            "“Number one, we don’t know exactly what she will do, though the expectation is that she will move to overrule Roe,” Biden said. “The only responsible response to that would be to pass legislation making Roe the law of the land. That’s what I would do.”",
            "With less than a month until Election Day, abortion rights have emerged as a central issue in the presidential race. Barrett, Trump’s pick to replace Ruth Bader Ginsburg, is a strict Catholic who signed a letter in 2006 calling for the end of “abortion on demand.” Many believe that if seated, she would vote to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision establishing the legal right to an abortion.",
            "Biden says on his website that in addition to codifying Roe into federal law, he would “reverse the Trump Administration and states’ all-out assault on women’s right to choose,” and use his Justice Department to stop state laws that violate the constitutional right to an abortion.",
            "Codifying Roe v. Wade is shorthand for passing a law that protects the right to choose. But without additional details, it is unclear exactly what that would look like at the federal level, said Noel León, a lawyer with the National Women’s Law Center. Biden did not immediately respond to a request for more information.",
            "“The Supreme Court has changed the way that the constitutional right to abortion operates over the years, as have lower courts, so it’s really hard to say,” she said. “What we hope he means is to pass explicit protections for people’s reproductive decision-making into law. The law would have to recognize that in order to realize that constitutional right to abortion, you have to be able to access it ― no matter where you live or what your income is.”",
            "Any attempt to codify Roe into law would also need to include efforts to overturn and repeal restrictions at the federal and state level, she added.",
            "“You can’t codify a right to abortion access without recognizing that there are a huge number of federal and state laws that make that right not real for people,” León said.",
            "If Roe is overturned, regulation of abortion would fall to the states. At least 10 states have laws on the books that would make abortion illegal immediately. Other states, such as Illinois and New York, have passed proactive bills protecting to the right to abortion even if Roe is repealed.",
            "As it is, access to abortion differs dramatically depending on where you live.",
            "Between 2011 and 2019, nearly 500 abortion restrictions were enacted in 33 states, according to the Guttmacher Institute, making it exponentially harder for patients to seek timely care. In six states, only one abortion clinic remains.",
            "“Reminder: Roe v. Wade *is* the law of the land and abortion is inaccessible or nearly so for many who want it,” said Robin Marty, author of “Handbook for a Post-Roe America,” in a tweet. “Yes it would be bad if it’s overturned, but promising to codify it isn’t enough. We deserve real policies that will make it available to everyone.”",
            "On Tuesday morning, Trump responded to Biden’s comments by falsely accusing him of supporting abortion until the time of birth.",
            "“Donald Trump is, again, intentionally spreading false information about abortion,” said Alexis McGill Johnson, president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund. “Trump has proven over and over again that he will say anything to stoke fear and rally his base. This disgusting, blatantly false rhetoric is part of his full-on assault on women’s access to care and the right to an abortion.”"

            "For most of her career, Sen. Kamala Harris (Calif.) has stuck to a practical, nondescript uniform, but one can glean a lot about the Democratic vice presidential nominee and her approach to politics by paying attention to her fashion choices.",
            "Harris’ signature look revolves around pairing dark, neutral pantsuits with softer items like round-neck blouses, pearl earrings and necklaces. It’s a go-to combination that has been consistent in her wardrobe for decades.",
            "Joseph Rosenfeld, an image consultant who has worked with politicians (but not Harris), calls this pairing “a wonderful strategy.” Rosenfeld told HuffPost, “When she is wearing [this pairing], she is really conveying not a mixed message but a complete message, which is, ‘I am friendly and approachable and supportive and I will listen.’ But it also simultaneously means, ‘I’m tough. I don’t have time to waste and we need to get things done.’”",
            "Hazel Clark, a professor of fashion studies at Parsons School of Design, told HuffPost, “One of the issues for women in the public eye is that they’re looked at with more scrutiny than their male counterparts; and not just for how they look but how much they’re spending on their wardrobe.”",
            "This could explain why it’s hard to pinpoint which designers the senator wears. Clark points to criticisms of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s (D-N.Y.) $300 haircut and Sarah Palin’s $180,000 campaign clothing budget in 2008 as examples of the type of attention Harris may be trying to avoid. “There’s a safety but there’s a personality there. She’s not going to dress outrageously.”",
            "Her preference for safe choices over outrageous ones also speaks to where she falls on the Democratic scale in comparison to her party mates. Costume designer Charlese Antoinette notes, “You’ll see Elizabeth Warren wearing bright colors and pop colors more than Kamala. As we know, Warren is a little bit more radical and liberal in her policies, rhetoric and thinking. I would say based on her colors and the lack of color that Kamala wears, she’s a lot more conservative of a Democrat.”",
            "Harris’ love of Chuck Taylors is well-documented, and Rosenfeld thinks adding the kicks to her powersuits “really shows she is a professional working woman on the go.” Harris has been adamant about seeking practical policies to support working parents ― particularly mothers ― such as adjusting school schedules to align with the typical workday and providing a six-month parental leave for every new parent. The suit and sneakers combo is a fashionable reflection of Harris’ political solidarity with the millions of working women who rock commuter-friendly shoes with their work uniforms.",
            "Last November, constituents saw a more relaxed Harris when she wore her signature suit and pearls to Mindy Kaling’s house, this time making herself at home as she removed the unbuttoned jacket to reveal a cozy sweater before the two cooked a traditional Indian dish. This past August, fans of the Verzuz online battle series got a deeper glimpse at Harris’ relaxed comfortable personality when the senator wore a Howard University sweatshirt during a surprise virtual cameo at the Brandy vs. Monica battle. Both appearances gave audiences a chance to see Harris as more than just a tough politician, but as their relatable masala dosa-making, R&B-loving auntie.",
            "But psychiatrist Rhonda Mattox doesn’t believe wardrobe itself is an effective tool to connect with voters, and that working too hard to emphasize her cultural background could hurt Harris’ campaign.",
            "“We as a country have tended to try to alienate people who stand out as it relates to their ethnicity,” Mattox said. “We have prioritized and valued and celebrated people who’ve blended. I think her message is on point. She is communicating the message that ‘I am going to represent EACH of you. EACH group in a way that is respectful and impactful to you. But I am not going to patronize you by dressing a certain way when I’m here and dressing a certain way when I’m there.’”",
            "Celebrity stylist Soneca Guadara agrees that a neutral wardrobe is a strong signal that Harris is here to work for all Americans, not just those she identifies with. Guadara said, “She wants to represent that she’s for everybody. If she’s showing too much of one ethnicity, people from other cultures may not feel represented. She keeps it neutral and classic.”",
            "As we inch closer to Election Day, current events have presented Harris with an opportunity to dress outside of her typical suits. In mid-September, the senator donned a white tee, dark denim jeans, a green jacket and Timberland boots to survey a burn site devastated by California wildfires. The look was reminiscent of ― but in stark contrast to ― Melania Trump’s infamous “I really don’t care, do you?” green Zara jacket, which she wore to a Texas detention center in June 2018.",
            "One accessory you’ll rarely see Harris without in 2020? A face mask. She’s a big proponent that everyone wears one to prevent the spread of COVID-19:",
            "Harris’ generally nondescript style has helped colleagues and constituents alike focus on her policies more than her appearance. As the past few years have shown, when it comes to the presidential ticket, voters aren’t exclusively interested in policy ― they’re invested in a top politician’s personality, as well. And fashion can go a long way to reflect that."

            "First it was China. Then it was “law and order.” Then it was taxes. Then it was “law and order” again. Then the Supreme Court. But it was never, ever the coronavirus pandemic.",
            "The last six months of President Donald Trump’s political life have consisted mostly of attempts to make something ― protests over a racist criminal justice system in American cities, a Supreme Court nomination, false suggestions that Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden will raise taxes on middle-class families ― other than the coronavirus pandemic matter. Those efforts have failed, and they have cost him nearly every conceivable political advantage.",
            "Now, the very event Republicans hoped would finally change the subject ― the nomination of conservative Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court ― appears to have resulted in the coronavirus spreading rapidly through the upper ranks of the Republican Party. The White House ignored public health guidelines at an event celebrating the nomination, placing attendees close together. Photos show a selection of the nation’s most prominent Republicans chatting freely while unmasked and indoors.",
            "Trump has consistently tried to ignore his governing responsibilities during the pandemic, suggesting states with lockdowns should be “liberated,” mocking the wearing of masks, hawking supposed miracle cures, undercutting his own medical advisers, failing to create a national testing strategy, outsourcing major decisions to states and playing only a minor role in negotiations with Congress over relief legislation.",
            "At the same time, his campaign has ignored the pandemic politically. Throughout July and August, Trump’s campaign did not air a single television ad mentioning the virus. In September, they aired just a handful. Mostly, these spots discuss how strong the economy was before the pandemic hit in March. Another ad promises the “finish line is approaching” in the “race for a vaccine.” (Most medical experts disagree.) The ads amounted to just 14% of the Trump campaign’s broadcast television spending last month.",
            "Trump’s decision to ignore the politics, governing and public health consequences of the pandemic harmed him politically well before his positive test result. But the events of the past week ― the collapse of a new round of economic talks, a debate in which he alienated voters with unscientific bluster, a spike in cases nationwide, and finally his own diagnosis ― crystalized how inextricable Trump’s mishandling of the virus is with the deep political hole he finds himself in.",
            "And that hole, to be clear, is deep. Biden has a clear and consistent lead in public surveys of crucial battleground states, with majorities saying they trust him more than Trump to deal with the pandemic. And time to persuade voters has nearly run out. Ballots are already in the hands of some voters in crucial states like North Carolina, Minnesota and Florida. The president will not be able to campaign in person for at least a week, and potentially longer.",
            "“Trump getting the virus is the latest data point in how profoundly serious this threat is, and how profoundly his response has failed on it,” said Jesse Ferguson, a Democratic strategist. “The White House’s personal handling of the response now matches their public policy handling of the response: dismissing experts and downplaying the threat even if it means more people get infected.”",
            "In many polls, voters still say they see Trump as a “stronger leader” than Biden. But now, some Republicans privately fear the imagery of Trump at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, with his aides and doctors providing the public with contradictory and confusing updates about his status, risks blunting that edge.",
            "In Tweets and video over the weekend, Trump tried to change the story again. On Saturday night, there was a video where Trump insisted he felt “much better.” On Sunday, there was another video, with Trump saying he “learned a lot about COVID.”",
            "“I learned it by really going to school,” Trump said. “This is the real school. This isn’t the ‘let’s read the book’ school, and I get it and I understand it, and it’s a very interesting thing and I’m going to be letting you know about it.”",
            "But if Trump had really learned something, his campaign was not showing it. On Saturday, the campaign hosted an event in Iowa where unmasked attendees mingled with the state’s governor. On Sunday morning, one of his top campaign advisers claimed Biden has “used the mask as a prop.”",
            "“They want to get life back to normal,” said Jason Miller, the campaign adviser, on ABC’s “This Week.” “You can’t just stay hidden in your basement the entire time.”",
            "Miller’s comments show the Trump campaign hasn’t learned its lesson. Voters, over and over in public polling, have made it clear they care more about public health than reopening the economy.",
            "Trump also continued to show his penchant for wishcasting and magical thinking. In his Saturday night video, he claimed new therapeutics he is taking to treat the virus were “miracles, if you want to know the truth.”",
            "“We have things happening that look like they’re miracles, coming down from God,” he continued.",
            "Trump also sent out a Twitter message declaring: “OUR GREAT USA WANTS & NEEDS STIMULUS. WORK TOGETHER AND GET IT DONE. Thank you!” But progress on a stimulus deal was stalled yet again last week, with Trump having largely outsourced the negotiations to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, and many Senate Republicans ― who may be susceptible to pressure from Trump ― are openly uninterested in further negotiations.",
            "Instead of talking about the virus, the Trump campaign has whiplashed from message to message. In July, 81% of the broadcast advertising dollars focused on promoting the president’s so-called law and order message, often with ads falsely suggesting Biden supports abolishing the police, according to data from Kantar/CMAG.",
            "That dropped drastically in August, when the campaign spent less than 2% of its budget on crime messaging and 74% on ads about taxes. It was only in September that it returned to coronavirus messaging, and even then spent just 14% of the budget on ads about the virus. Crime spots took up 41% of the campaign’s $52-million message, and ads on taxes took up 36%.",
            "The messaging from Trump personally has been even more scattered, often driven by personal grievances and whatever he’s seen on Fox News.",
            "“One message is always more effective than a dozen messages, and that was part of the problem Tuesday night,” said Alex Conant, a GOP strategist and partner at Firehouse Strategies, referring to Trump’s debate strategy. “Trump attacked Biden for being dumb, for being too liberal, for being in Washington too long and for having a kid who got in trouble. He hasn’t been able to find a message for people to latch on to.”",
            "In contrast, Biden’s message has been relentlessly focused on the virus, which he returned to again and again during the debate. The Biden campaign spent 96% of their broadcast television dollars on coronavirus ads in July, and 80% in August. In September, when broadcast television spending spiked dramatically to $110 million, 56% of Biden’s spending went to coronavirus ads.",
            "And the challenger is reaping the political rewards for his focus. While Biden’s polling lead over Trump is longstanding, the campaign’s single-minded focus on combatting the disease has improved his personal image. A new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released Sunday showed 43% of Americans had a positive opinion of Biden, while 41% had an unfavorable opinion ― an 8-point positive swing since August.",
            "The same poll showed just 39% of Americans had a favorable opinion of the president, while 55% had a negative opinion, a 4-point downturn from Trump’s standing in August.",

            "I’m being such a crappy parent right now, I told myself after the Zoom/Q-tip debacle. My older kid is comically bad at remote learning. My toddler is basically feral. I feel so depleted, all the time, and I know I’m not giving anyone — my kids, my husband, my boss, my friends — anything close to what I’d like.",
            "So now, with the new school year in full swing, I am on a new quest: learning to be truly OK with being an adequate (at best) parent.",
            "As the pandemic moves into what feels like its 167th month — and as parents have begun to really settle into an academic year unlike any other — now more than ever is the time for grace. We parents must cut ourselves slack, mental health experts say, and embrace the fact that being adequate is more than enough. We don’t have sufficient help. We don’t have enough time. More than 50 million parents have lost income during the COVID-19 pandemic, millions of parents have left their jobs because it’s their “best” option and parental burnout is rampant. And who knows how long this is going to continue?",
            "But developing self-compassion is surprisingly hard, particularly because it goes against so much of what we’ve been conditioned to expect of ourselves in this competitive, social media-saturated era of parenting. In my less secure moments, I’m certain there are scores of other parents who have figured out this whole parenting-during-COVID thing in a way I cannot.",
            "So I spoke with a person who literally wrote the book on the topic — psychologist Claire Nicogossian, a clinical assistant professor at Brown University and author of “Mama, You Are Enough: How to Create Calm, Joy and Confidence Within the Chaos of Motherhood” — about how parents can really, truly learn to be OK with simply being OK right now.",
            "1: Remind yourself that we are still in survival mode.",
            "Parents are all dealing with varying degrees of crisis: Some of us have no child care, we’ve lost jobs and our kids have no school. Others of us have help, our kids are decently settled into whatever school situation they’ve got and we’re not confronting personal health or financial crises. It’s still hard, all of it. Together, we are all in survival mode.",
            "Nicogossian often uses this metaphor in therapy: If you were swimming in an ocean and knew there were sharks all around you, you wouldn’t pause and ask yourself: Am I good swimmer? Am I doing this right? You’d put your head down and swim. You’d do what you needed to stay safe — and that’s it.",
            "It’s a good metaphor to have in mind in those moments when you find yourself spiraling, worried you’re failing to live up to your typical expectations in these truly insane times.",
            "2: Examine your standards",
            "Nicogossian then recommends spending some time thinking about where those typical expectations of yourself as a parent actually come from.",
            "“That’s super varied and variable, because none of us have the same experiences,” Nicogossian said. So carve out the time to think on it a bit. Like: Huh, why do I think XYZ is what should happen? Why do I think my family should be doing this particular thing? Personally, I realize I’m susceptible to self-doubt when I engage too much with local parenting forums. No matter what I read about, it always seems to end with me questioning the extent to which I’m being a horrible, neglectful parent by sending him into school two days a week.",
            "With a bit of digging, you might realize some of those standards and expectations are things you truly do not care about. Think about ways to cut down on some of the noise. Like unfollowing. Or not engaging in conversations about pandemic parenting with people who just don’t get how challenging it can be.",
            "3: Keep a time log",
            "Nicogossian’s final suggestion? For a few days, jot down how much one-on-one time you’ve given your kiddo — time when you have not been multitasking or barking at them to stick with remote learning or cleaning... or whatever.",
            "If you feel like maybe you could carve out five minutes a day to really give them that undivided attention, try it, Nicogossian urged. It could go a long way in helping you really make peace with being a good-enough parent right now — and could give kids, who’ve really been dealt a tough hand, the care and attention they’re craving.",
            "Then pat yourself on the back. You’ve fed them, kept them safe (to the best of your ability during a completely bonkers time) and even managed to hang out with them a bit. Adequate, indeed.",

            "Nemonte Nenquimo wore a bright crown of blue, yellow and red macaw feathers that, for the Waorani people of Ecuador, represent the power of women in the forest. But her suntanned face looked tired.",
            "It had been a whirlwind 48 hours since Time magazine named the 35-year-old Indigenous activist one of its 100 most influential people of 2020. Peering into her computer screen, she smiled and said this was her 26th media appearance, discussing her fight to protect 180,000 acres of virgin forest in northeast Ecuador from drilling, mining and logging.",
            "The spotlight is uncomfortable for Nenquimo. Indigenous people, she said, aren’t used to individual appearances; they always lead collectively. Their decisions and opinions are communal. Yet now she finds herself on the global stage representing not just her people, but all Indigenous peoples fighting deforestation, genocide and destruction around the world.",
            "Nenquimo, whose first name means “constellation,” was born into a tribe where both women and men serve as warriors. Her grandfather was a leader who defended what is now known as Yasuní National Park, one of the most biodiverse rainforests on Earth.",
            "HuffPost spoke to Nenquimo in Spanish about her activism. This interview, translated into English, has been edited and condensed for clarity.",
            "How did you learn that Time was including you on its annual list?",
            "I was working for the Coordinating Council of the Waorani Nation of Pastaza (Conconawep), which I lead. I’d been planning to have volunteers provide lectures in the territory because, during the pandemic, education has been abandoned, as there’s no internet or phone lines available for online learning. We were making plans, coordinating meetings, then I suddenly received the call.",
            "It made me feel that it was recognition for those who are already dead, but also for those who are alive and fighting. I felt very encouraged, I felt strengthened to continue fighting. We have lived free and happy. We don’t want any more contamination or death from disease. Our message is that capitalism destroys the whole planet; it contaminates, it extracts. They don’t realize that they are leaving nothing for future generations. We, the Indigenous people, know that we have to be the keepers, and we have always done it.",
            "How have Ecuador’s Indigenous communities fared in the pandemic?",
            "When the pandemic arrived, the Ecuadorian government didn’t respect the communities where the Waorani people live and didn’t stop the oil activities. This was the first time COVID-19 was transmitted and spread to other communities because, in Waorani culture, we are collective and collaborative. This caused the spread [of COVID-19].\n\nMen were sick, they were unable to go out hunting, they stayed in their hammocks shivering. Women were shaking in the hammocks with the children in their arms; they couldn’t go out to look for cassava, food; it was very difficult, very hard. But with the knowledge of the plants, they began to heal. Most of the grandparents were saved. As a leader, I was worried. I said, “nobody goes in and nobody goes out into the jungle,” but the virus came.",
            "I went to seek help, support from other organizations, because the Ministry of Public Health didn’t have that priority. In that attempt to help my people, I became infected and sick. I lost my sense of smell, I couldn’t taste, and I lost my memory. I was ill for about 14 days. I went into the jungle for eight days and came back healthy. Now my concern is the consequences of the disease.",
            "What has been the most frustrating moment of your work so far?",
            "The pandemic. It was something new. I had never felt weak or sick before, but I felt that I was going to die. I was breathless, had a high fever and chest pain. My throat felt swollen. I had to face the possibility of dying and not knowing who my daughter would stay with. It shattered me.",
            "You have said that you began to fight for the Waorani future with strength and rage. What was your awakening?",
            "When I was a child, my father used to tell me that my grandfather had a lot of love for the forest. That love was transmitted to me. The jungle has given me freedom, strength. I was shocked when I saw with my own eyes the impact of the oil companies on the territory of the Cofán and Siona brothers, and I listened to their testimonies. They didn’t know the consequences of the oil spills in the rivers; they bathed in that black water without knowing how that would affect them. I know of cases of children dying from it.\n\nThat gave me the courage to protect the 180,000 virgin acres that we have in the Waorani community of Pastaza. We don’t want a reoccurrence of the story that the northern brothers experienced.",
            "The actor Leonardo DiCaprio nominated you for the Time list. How did you two connect?",
            "Before becoming a leader, I founded the organization Ceibo Alliance with Indigenous people in Lago Agrio (in northern Ecuador’s Amazon), where the first contact with the oil company Chevron happened. … I was working on the creation of rainwater systems, solar panels, exchange of experiences, and made connections with other organizations that came to work in Lago Agrio. In 2017, DiCaprio invited me to a presentation by his foundation. I traveled to San Francisco, California, and I met him personally. He’s a good man, he has a good heart, and he supports us even through distance.\n\nI’ve seen how the monster of oil extraction has come to destroy life. Leo and I have talked about how the government does not respect our right to life, there is no support, what we do is for the life of our children. I hope that soon, he’ll come to visit the territory we preserve.",
            "Without government support, who finances the struggle for the forest?",
            "Small conservation groups have helped our organization raise money. Now we are looking for alternative ways to provide programs in the territory that focus on education and leadership. We will continue to look for resources to make alternative, sustainable economies. Most of the time, we don’t ask the government for help; when I do, they ignore us.",
            "Has this struggle involved risks in your life?",
            "Capitalism always wants to devour, to devastate. If we go out to defend our life, our home, it is a very dangerous risk. They realize that we go out to protect, and they can kill, discriminate. My family is very big. My grandfather had three wives, 20 children. In the territory, we are a large majority. I’m not the only one. I’m not afraid of dying. If I die, it’s for the sake of the future.",
            "Have you been threatened?",
            "I haven’t been threatened. But it’s a fact that women who protest have been annihilated all over the world.",
            "How has the forest changed since you were a child? What will it be like when your daughter is an adult?",
            "I don’t think anything has changed. Recently, I’ve seen only one change: There was a lot of rising water that has concerned me because it’s a consequence of climate change, of logging, of the imbalance of the planet. There are also very high temperatures in the Amazon, and that’s also linked to deforestation.\n\nIf we keep fighting collectively, the Earth will remain as such, full of animals, fish. If we don’t protect it, the forces of capitalism will come in and destroy us. The jungle will disappear."

            "The resolution, which passed by a vote of 371-18, was introduced in August by Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.) and Rep. Denver Riggleman (R-Va.) in response to an alarming rise in QAnon’s popularity.",
            "It “condemns QAnon and rejects the conspiracy theories it promotes,” encourages federal law enforcement agencies to focus on the movement and calls on intelligence agencies to investigate “any foreign support, assistance or online amplification QAnon receives.”",
            "The text of the resolution amounts to a withering takedown of the QAnon phenomenon, which is an ever-evolving collection of pro-Donald Trump conspiracy theories based on cryptic clues posted to message boards by an anonymous poster known as “Q” who claims to be a senior government official with inside knowledge of a globalist cabal of Satan-worshipping pedophiles waging war against the president.",
            "The resolution lists some of the crimes committed by QAnon believers:",
            "(1) a man arrested in 2018 for plotting to plant a bomb in the Illinois Capitol rotunda to make Americans aware of the “Pizzagate” conspiracy theory;\n(2) a man arrested in 2018 for using an armored car to block traffic on the Hoover Dam Bypass Bridge;\n(3) a man in Arizona arrested in 2019 for vandalizing a Catholic church;\n(4) a woman in Colorado arrested in 2019 for plotting an armed raid to kidnap her child, who had been taken from her custody;\n(5) a man charged with the murder of an organized crime boss in New York in 2019; and\n(6) a woman arrested in New York with a car full of knives after posting a video accusing Joe Biden of participating in child sex trafficking and threatening to kill him.",

            "Back then, the presidential election was too close to call. Florida’s vote was in question. Talk of hanging chads was inescapable. George W. Bush had a slight edge, Al Gore wanted a recount. The case Bush v. Gore made its way to the Supreme Court. And, along strictly partisan lines, the court’s five Republican-appointees stopped the recount and handed the election to Bush.",

You vote for your president, if you don’t like what they’re doing, you can vote them out.",
            "The Supreme Court is not supposed to be political. It’s supposed to interpret the laws. Of course people get appointed to the court and lean one way or the other. The idea was they were interpreting the laws in good faith, according to the Constitution.",
            "When they stopped Florida’s recount and effectively said your votes don’t matter, there’s no recourse. We can’t replace [the justices]. We can’t vote them out. They are lifetime appointments. They are acting as a political body and they are intervening in political processes.",
            "That was the point at which I felt that the government was fundamentally broken.",
            "At the time I didn’t appreciate how racialized that was. I just knew votes weren’t counted. Turns out, a disproportionate amount of the votes that were not counted were votes by Black people. That is the history of our country, trying to disenfranchise Black voters.",

            "I guess you can call me a naive white girl who was like, it works, it’s fair. Up until that point. To some degree. I knew there was voter suppression. I had volunteered in Illinois in graduate school at the polls. My role was to observe. The neighborhood was mostly white. A white person would show up and say their name, maybe show one piece of ID. They’d be given a ballot and they’d go vote. A Black person would show up and they were asked for multiple pieces of ID. They were asked what their profession was. They were basically subjected to an inquisition.",

The kind of challenges we’re facing like climate change, these are global, collective problems that we’re going to have to fight somehow in unison. If everybody progressive evacuates the U.S. I don’t know what that would look like.",

            "Do you regret leaving the U.S.?",
            "No. I am so glad that I’ve had the cross-cultural experience. That my children and my spouse and I have both citizenships and options. There’s lots of talk in my broader family that is American about leaving.",
            "With COVID-19, you guys did better up there than we’re doing.",
            "In Canada, there’s just a lot more trust and faith in government. I don’t think we’ve gotten to the point where the U.S. has gotten where we just don’t trust the government. Everything is political in the U.S.",
            "In Canada there’s still faith in science and scientists. The health minister, who is empowered in each province, is leading the response and calling the shots. They are medical experts.",
            "It would be like putting Dr. Anthony Fauci in charge of the U.S. response completely. And empowering him.",
            "Are there things you gained by leaving the U.S.?",
            "There’s a lot. One of the first things you notice is universal health care. That completely changes the game. The worth of human life has been elevated for everyone in a country where it’s seen as a human right to get health care. There’s no question that you will get it. It’s a collective effort in making that happen. It’s not an individual problem that you have a heart attack that you have to then pay for. Even a homeless person has health care. That changes the whole sort of feeling of humanity and togetherness and compassion. There’s kindness in the culture.",
            "Another one, of course relatedly, is guns. You don’t worry about sending your kids to school and thinking they’ll be shot up.",
            "Education is really different. There is a much stronger commitment to public education. All the universities are public. That also changes things. Instead of having this extreme hierarchy of universities, Ivy League or bust, they’re all good. Maybe none is as good as the very top 10 in the U.S., but none of them are really bad either. There’s excellence in all of them. And they’re affordable. The students that I’ve had [in Canada] are every bit as good as the students I had at Berkeley.",

            "Wanna get away (from 2020, from the country, from the universe)? Who doesn’t. For fans of frothy romantic comedies and fashion eye candy, Netflix has the perfectly timed autumn offering: “Emily in Paris,” an aptly named series featuring the holy union of creator Darren Starr and costume consultant Patricia Field. The show offers an escape into a world of power clashing and intoxicating love triangles at a time when many of us sorely need it.",
            "Emily (Lily Collins) is a rising associate at a Chicago marketing firm. Her boss Madeline (Kate Walsh), a worldly and sexually adventurous single woman who speaks fluent French, is on the cusp of realizing her lifelong dream of moving to Paris for a year. Madeline will be overseeing the merger between their firm and a French one they have recently acquired.",
            "Instead, Madeline pukes in a wastebasket. Yes, she is unexpectedly pregnant, and now Emily will be going to Paris in her stead. Emily doesn’t speak French, and she has a solid boyfriend in Chicago. But she informs him that they’ll be long-distance for a year and jets off to France without a backward glance. Once there, she joins the team at Savoir, the French firm she must integrate into her Chicago company’s workflow, begins snapping selfies of herself eating pastries, and befriends the sexy chef, Gabriel (Lucas Bravo), who lives below her.",
            "At Savoir, all is not quite well. Her new colleagues see her as provincial and frumpy, both obnoxiously work-obsessed and a professional liability. Her boss, Sylvie (Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu), is an older Frenchwoman, naturally glamorous and sophisticated, and she sees Emily as nothing but an annoyance. On the other hand, Emily seems to win male admirers wherever she goes ― clients, random men at cafés, and, of course, the sexy chef. She also quickly makes friends with women she encounters on the street ― Mindy (Ashley Park), a Chinese expat and nanny who has been disinherited by her zipper tycoon father, and Camille (Camille Razat), a stunning blonde gallerist. Together they drink wine at cafés, exchange naughty gossip about love interests, and attend glittering high-fashion events.",
            "This, of course, feels like a dispatch from another universe. The picture-perfect trip to Paris, complete with dark lipstick, beret-topped ensembles and spontaneous affaires with French semiotics professors, has never been more out of reach for the basic ― sorry, ringarde ― American woman. Travel restrictions, mask requirements, social distancing, and residence in a country rapidly sliding into authoritarian decline all conspire to make a carefree day spent wandering along the Seine with a croissant seem almost unimaginable.",
            "But does this make “Emily in Paris” awkwardly out of step with the current moment, or the ideal escapist confection? Emma Gray and Claire Fallon sat down to discuss whether the Lily Collins vehicle offers a refreshing taste of frivolity in a hellish time, or whether it’s as flat as day-old Champagne.",
            "The Bottom Line",
            "“Emily in Paris” is no “Sex and the City.” It has all of its predecessor’s frivolousness and capitalism, and none of its heart.",
            "The Rundown",
            "Claire: An American girl in Paris ― what could be a more seductive premise for a glossy, CW-style dramedy? The women of American TV all want to be in Paris, but they rarely seem to get there. There’s Lauren Conrad, the girl who didn’t go to Paris; there’s Rachel Green, the girl who didn’t get on the plane (to Paris). There’s Carrie Bradshaw, the girl who moved to Paris and was promptly chewed up and spat all the way back to New York. All of those women stayed in America at least in part for a boyfriend, though Carrie at least made an effort to actually make it in France (for a different boyfriend).",
            "That was then. It’s 2020, and we’ve made an enormous step forward: Emily actually moves to Paris, leaving her boyfriend behind in Chicago, and tries to make it there without him.",
            "Emma, Emily is put forward as our American feminist heroine. In fact, like you, she is outspoken about sexism in the media, has shiny dark hair and enviable eyebrows (I mean, it’s Lily Collins), and always has the perfect matte lip and statement jacket for any occasion. Did you identify with her? Is Emily a protagonist you could get behind?",
            "Emma: First of all, there has never been a greater compliment than “enviable eyebrows.” And I agree that Lily Collins has some great ones, so I will take it. Unfortunately, other than her A+ grooming and delightfully fantastical styling, there was very little about Emily that struck me as heroic or feminist. Truly, I should be the target audience for this show and for Emily as a character. I’m a middle-class white woman in her early 30s who grew up absolutely obsessed with “Sex and the City.” But despite my eternal problematic fave-ing of “SATC” and the much-maligned Carrie Bradshaw, I couldn’t help but wonder… Is Emily the most grating protagonist on television?",
            "Whereas Carrie Bradshaw was single and in her 30s when we meet her, and thus had spent more than a decade honing her (still questionable) professional talents and forming a close-knit group of women friends, Emily is a plucky white heroine who has very little work experience, very little experience being an independent person, and very few real obstacles set in front of her that make her worth rooting for. But despite these privileges, she walks around as though she is the authority on life, love and work. Mostly, I was annoyed. And I couldn’t tell if it was because of the sub-par acting or the sub-par character development or maybe just a combo of both. I also viscerally resented that every hot man she encountered on a Paris street fell in love with her, despite the fact that she had incredibly awkward energy and spoke no French.",
            "Claire, were you as disappointed by Emily as I was? And if so, how do you think she fits into the canon of romantic comedy protagonists?",
            "Claire: “Emily in Paris” is a bland title, so it came as no particular surprise that Emily herself is a bland character. She’s slender and so beautiful that it’s quite believable when, in one episode, a fashion executive mistakes her for a movie star. The show doesn’t even make an effort to quirk her up or give her a more relatable, girl-next-door roughness: she’s always immaculately coiffed and made-up, and garbed in effortfully eye-catching outfits. But there’s not much to the character, except for enormous amounts of self-confidence and the inexplicable ability to attract new friends and love interests on every street corner. Collins seems to be powering through her performance on sheer enthusiasm, delivering her lines and reactions with gusto if not much finesse. Combined with the character’s clearly intentional (but still irritating) American-style narcissism, the result is a bit exhausting. Whenever Sylvie told Emily to leave her alone, I found myself silently agreeing.",
            "In classic fish-out-of-water fashion, of course, Emily is meant to be changed by Paris. In one early episode, she tells a fellow account executive at Savoir, Luc, that he’s arrogant for criticizing American culture. “You came to Paris and you don’t speak French,” he retorts. “That is arrogant.” But in her new job at Savoir, she goes from success to success ― largely because of her unique American takes on things. She stresses social media gimmicks, which strike the Parisians as tacky, and is never hesitant to call her colleagues out on their sexism.",
            "In a rather half-hearted nod to the #MeToo movement ― and its French counterpart, #BalanceTonPorc (expose your pig) ― Emily brings a fragrance ad shoot to a crashing halt in order to explain that women in her demographic will find the concept offensive. Though her insights are ultimately rejected, they draw the attention, both professional and perhaps romantic, of the handsome perfumier, Antoine (William Abadie), who is married and having a longstanding affair with Emily’s boss, Sylvie. (Meanwhile, Emily mostly laughs off truly inappropriate behavior in and out of the workplace, including an incident in which she sleeps with a boy who turns out to be 17.)",
            "In another episode, Emily accidentally markets a feminine hygiene product by tweeting her outrage that the French word for “vagina” is a masculine noun; we even see the back of Brigitte Macron’s head as she retweets it approvingly. It’s a version of feminism that feels extremely 2015: at its heart, it’s just another way to sell stuff.",
            "Emma, what did you think of the depiction of Emily’s marketing career and Savoir? Advertising is obviously a foundational theme of the show.",
            "Emma: Look, I’m no marketing executive, so the people can feel free to tell me if I’m wrong, but I suspect that the way Savoir is depicted in the show is not quite reflective of what a career in marketing and advertising looks like in real life. Emily struts into Savoir as if all a master’s in marketing in the United States leaves you with is the ability to enthusiastically say “Social media! Social strategy!” over and over again until your product goes viral.",
            "The show felt like people trying to engage with the weirdness of current influencer culture and marketing, but just not really nailing it. The whole game of influencer marketing is subtlety ― like, if you scrolled by an ad in someone’s feed, it would take you a minute to realize it was an ad. This is what makes influencer advertising both so effective and so insidious. But nothing in “Emily in Paris” is subtle. Especially not her work. If I took the show at face value I would believe that a high-end designer could craft an entire collection in 10 hours by himself, that influencers go to events and film full advertisements mid-lunch, that an Instagram account blows up if you post 5 mediocre selfies paired with bad hashtag puns, and that sexual harassment is just par for the (hilarious!) course in French firms.",
            "I also want to talk about the way watching this show felt in a moment when we, as Americans, are quite literally banned from France. It certainly impacted the escapism of the project for me. How did you feel watching it?",
            "Claire: It’s a master’s in communications, Emma. Look, she’s qualified.",
            "To be candid, I don’t know that it did affect the escapism for me. A picturesque French getaway is out of reach for most American viewers at any time, especially one featuring so much couture and Champagne, and while I’ve been fortunate enough to visit Paris for a few days, my experience bore no resemblance to Emily’s. The show is more like a Disney ride than an actual trip abroad: a highly Americanized, sanitized, buffed-and-shined product that signifies “Paris” to its audience through the deployment of famous buildings and clichéd accessories (croissants, baguettes, berets). It really is as if the whole city is a pop-up installation designed for influencers, much like the Museum of Ice Cream or the luxury beds Emily has placed underneath Parisian landmarks for an Instagram campaign for one of Savoir’s clients.",
            "In that sense ― maybe I’m giving the show too much credit ― it does seem to capture that influencing life. The whole series is a testament to how American capitalist culture grinds up beauty, pleasure, and art and transforms them all into product. Everything is monetizable, and monetizability is everything. As Emily tells Luc, who is explaining the French philosophy of prioritizing life above work, “I enjoy work and accomplishment. It makes me happy!” Yuck! Imagine a less relatable sentiment right now.",
            "But speaking of Luc, let’s talk about Emily’s supporting cast. In addition to her Savoir frenemies and the hot chef downstairs, Emily befriends two random women on the street ― Mindy, a spunky Chinese zipper heiress and nanny who dreams of being a singer, and Camille, a gorgeous and sweet-natured gallerist who turns out to be Hot Chef’s girlfriend. Any standout characters or performances for you, Emma?",
            "Emma: I think you hit the nail on the head with the show’s meta-commentary on the absolute emptiness of American capitalism. However, I’m not sure that commentary was intentional.",
            "In terms of standout characters, I have to shout out to my girl Sylvie, Emily’s very French, very over it boss who has the appropriate level of disdain for Emily’s endless pluckiness and attitude of American exceptionalism. Maybe it’s the sexy accents, but the French actors charmed me far more than the American ones did, in general. Truthfully, I would far rather watch a show about Sylvie, a 40-something, unmarried, professional powerhouse, than about Emily, a 20-something who continuously fails up and has zero problems finding a partner other than the fact that too many men adore her. (But Gabriel, the Hot Chef, is indeed very hot.) Throughout the season, we see Emily struggle with trying to assert her value within the French marketing firm and try to fit in within Parisian society. But Emily is the consummate try hard. Her outfits, her work ideas, even her very sentences are hyper-calculated. It’s no wonder that Sylvie is dismissive and annoyed when she sees her lover/client Antoine, a married French perfumier, mooning over Emily and her trés ringard ideas.",
            "Maybe that’s part of why this show made me annoyed rather than vacantly delighted. Because, truthfully, I’m no snob when it comes to TV. I love me some screen-based candy and I love clothing and I love aspirational travel. But maybe I don’t like being so acutely aware that that is what I’m consuming? Or I want that candy to go down seamlessly rather than sticking in my throat? Or maybe it’s just the contrast between the casually oblivious American in Paris setup that the show portrays at a time when it’s never felt clearer just how dangerous American self-importance is?",
            "While I was watching “Emily In Paris,” I kept thinking about the Latin phrase, “panem et circenses,” or bread and circuses, referring to a steady diet of entertainment meant to keep the poor, oppressed masses docile. Little does Emily know that she’s mere months away from being in a months-long quarantine.",
            "Any final thoughts, Claire?",
            "Claire: Watching the whole show wasn’t exactly a punishment, but it was hard to ignore the many ways it fell short. The performances, across the board, are broad and stilted. The depiction of Paris is cartoonish. Mindy’s storyline, about reclaiming her dreams of singing stardom, is given too little space to develop and feels shoehorned in. And Emily’s repeated rhapsodies on the value of marketing made me want to sell all my possessions and move somewhere with no Netflix access.",
            "So, Should You Watch It?",
            "Emma: Look. Desperate COVID-19/election year times call for desperate measures. Like watching “Emily in Paris.” If you need something watchable but fairly bad, go for it. If not, feel free to skip.",
            "Claire: “Emily in Paris” is lucky that we aren’t likely to see a new episode of “The Bold Type” any time soon. There isn’t the usual profusion of new TV right now. Still, if you’re on the fence, I’d recommend going with a “Sex and the City” rerun instead."

            "But other voters ― both Democrats and Republicans ― are reluctant to cast their ballots by mail, their doubts fueled by President Donald Trump’s baseless claims that mail-in voting will lead to a “rigged” election and by some Democrats’ accusations that the newly installed postmaster general, Louis DeJoy, is plotting to sabotage the vote in favor of Trump.",
            "The stakes are high. If you’re voting in person on Nov. 3 — or early, your best bet to avoid crowds ― you’re very likely concerned about making sure your vote is counted.",
            "What should you do if you have to wait in line for hours to vote, like people did during Georgia’s primary election in June? What if the voting machines don’t work or poll workers give you incorrect information about casting your ballot?",
            "You’ve got questions, we’ve got answers.",

            "What if I go to my polling location and they say I’m not registered there?",
            "Avoid this issue altogether by making sure you’ve registered to vote at vote.org. While you’re at it, double-check that your address is correct. Do all of this prior to your state’s voter registration deadline. (For many states, that is Oct. 5.)",
            "You should also double-check your precinct location prior to voting, especially since COVID-19 may force some precincts to close or relocate, according to Cecilia Aguilera, a counsel at the Fair Elections Center, a national, nonpartisan voting rights and election reform organization.",
            "If you’re voting early, this is going to be less of an issue for you.",
            "“Many states that offer early voting allow voters to vote at any early voting center so that they don’t need to worry about voting at the wrong precinct,” Aguilera said.",
            "In many states, a photo ID is required to vote, so be sure to check your state’s voter ID laws here before hitting the polls.",
            "You can cast a provisional ballot if you vote at the wrong location on Election Day in most states. But given the many complications that can arise with provisional votes, requesting a provisional ballot should always be your last resort, said Leigh Chapman, the voting rights program director at the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.",
            "“If you vote with a provisional ballot, follow up with your local elections office to make sure that you provide the additional information to make sure your vote is counted,” she said.",
            "If you have any issues voting by mail or in person on or before Election Day, call the nonpartisan voter protection hotline at 1-866-OUR-VOTE. (1-866-687-8683).",
            "What if a polling place opens late or closes early, claims to have run out of ballots, or the machines break down?",
            "If you encounter any issues like this, contact the nonpartisan voter protection hotline immediately at 1-866-OUR-VOTE.",
            "“As a general rule, if a voter is in line at the time her polling place closes, they have a right to vote,” said Michelle Kanter Cohen, a senior counsel at the Fair Elections Center. “Otherwise, this is another area where early voting can help avoid issues. In the rare chance that an early voting site opens late, closes early, or runs out of ballots, thus preventing the voter from casting a ballot, they can return on another early voting day.”",
            "What if I have to stand in line for hours to cast my vote?",
            "Again, you can do your part to minimize lines now, weeks before Election Day, by voting early, whether you decide to vote in person or by mail.",
            "Still, if you are stuck in line on Election Day, bring a snack and stay in line!",
            "“As long as you are in line before the polls close and stay in line, you have the right to cast a ballot, even if that’s after the time the polls are scheduled to close,” said Molly McGrath, a voting rights campaign strategist at the American Civil Liberties Union.",
            "For those with disabilities worried about lines, many states have laws that allow voters with mobility issues or physical disabilities to move to the front of the line, according to Aguilera.",
            "“If someone has concerns about long lines, though, they should contact their local election officials ahead of time to determine their options,” she said. “They may be able to find out when the volume of voters tends to be lowest, and about other options like early voting or curbside voting. If a voter is in line by closing time, she has a right to vote.”",
            "What if a poll worker challenges my eligibility to vote?",
            "This is extremely rare. If you’re not able to prove your eligibility but believe you properly registered, you have the right to cast a provisional ballot, which will count once election officials determine your registration and eligibility. Generally, you should be fine if you verify your voting status, your address and your voting place.",
            "If you’re worried, you can bring your voter registration card and a document proving you live at the address listed on your registration, Kanter Cohen suggests. If you’re challenged, “call the election protection hotline,” preferably before leaving your polling place, she advised.",
            "What if I’m disabled and my polling place hasn’t provided adequate assistance?",
            "One in five people eligible to vote has a disability. The Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA, requires that voter registration and voting be accessible to people with disabilities and that poll workers assist voters with disabilities if they need help.",
            "“It’s worth noting that voters with disabilities are allowed to bring in the person of their choice to assist them at the polls (so long as that person is not their employer or an agent of their employer or an agent or officer of their union),” said McGrath. “They can also request reasonable accommodations from poll workers.”",
            "For more information on fair access to voting, contact the National Disability Rights Network-affiliated organization in your state.",
            "“Every state, jurisdiction and polling place [is] different, so this type of personalized assistance is going to be the most effective,” Chapman said.",
            "What if I encounter a poll-watcher who seems to be trying to intimidate voters?",
            "A poll watcher is a person appointed to observe the conduct of an election on behalf of a candidate, a political party or the proponents or opponents of a measure.",
            "But poll watchers are not supposed to interfere in the voting process, aside from reporting issues to polling place authorities and party officials. Anyone who tries to “intimidate, threaten, or coerce” individuals to interfere with their right to vote can face up to a year in prison under federal law against voter intimidation.",
            "Tell a poll worker if you feel intimidated and report the incident to your local election officials, whose offices will be open on Election Day. Also, call the nonpartisan voter protection hotline at 1-866-OUR-VOTE.",
            "What if I’m told I can’t cast my absentee ballot in person and should have mailed it?",
            "Chapman said that in most states, vote-by-mail ballots don’t always have to be mailed back. They can also be dropped off at a dropbox, at an early voting location, or at an in-person voting location on Election Day. To find a list of local election offices, you can search your state board of elections website or your state’s secretary of state website.",
            "What if I make a mistake on my ballot?",
            "Given how different this election will be logistically, it’s important to carefully read the instructions that come with your ballot prior to marking it.",
            "Many jurisdictions have a “cure” process wherein they contact a voter if their signature or ID is missing, does not match, or if there are other reasons for rejecting the ballot package, Aguilera said.",
            "But be your own fact-checker first.",
            "Before submitting a ballot, voters should “double- and triple-check that they have properly enclosed their ballots in any secrecy envelopes accompanying their ballot, sealed all envelopes, provided all of the required information, signed everywhere that they need to, and depending on their state, that they have a witness signature if it’s required there,” she said.",
            "If you make a mistake or have any questions, you can call and ask your local election official for a replacement ballot.",
            "“We are strongly encouraging all voters who plan to vote by mail to request their mail-in ballots now (if required by state law) and complete and submit their ballots as soon as they receive them so that they are received on time and any issues can be addressed before Election Day,” Aguilera said.",

            "Jason Alexander is famous for his beloved character George Costanza on “Seinfeld,” but the actor is also well-known (and despised) for his role as lawyer Philip Stuckey in the iconic 1990 film “Pretty Woman.”",
            "The actor was candid about the effect the role had on his life ― and why the film was originally a lot different than how it turned out ― during an appearance on the podcast “At Home With The Creative Coalition” with CEO Robin Bronk.",
            "“It was an odd way to meet a national audience because I was known around the world as the asshole that tried to rape Julia Roberts,” he said on the episode, which dropped Tuesday.",
            "“And so women hated me,” Alexander explained. “I would walk down the street and women would say mean things to me. I got punched many times, I got spit on by one woman ― it was a rough year.”\n\nThe “Seinfeld” alum also said that the film was actually supposed to be much different and much darker than the final product.",
            "“What many people don’t know is ‘Pretty Woman’ the script and ‘Pretty Woman’ the movie are similar, but they’re far from identical,” Alexander revealed on the podcast.",
            "“‘Pretty Woman’ the script was a pretty dark affair. It was more of a dramedy than a rom-com. And [director Garry Marshall] was executing a lot of that film out of his head and encouraging people to create moments that weren’t there and feelings that weren’t there,” Alexander added.\n\n“And I got onto the set the first day ― and it was a scene with Richard [Gere] ― and Richard had said to me in the makeup room, “Get ready, cause I don’t know what film we’re making here.”\n\nAlexander said he had a rough time going into filming because director Garry Marshall didn’t originally want him for the role.\n\n“I had auditioned for him. He was very sweet, and he basically said, ‘You’re too young, you’re too baby-faced, you’re too little,’ Alexander said, explaining that Marshall wanted other actors but “couldn’t make a deal” with any of them.",
            "Luckily, casting director Dianne Crittenden was keen on Alexander getting the role and repeatedly stuck her neck out for him.\n\n“She kept bringing me up and bringing me up to the point where Garry said, ‘If you say his name again I’m gonna fire you.’ And I got the part because they couldn’t make a deal with the actor they wanted and they were desperate ― the movie already started shooting ― and they didn’t have this character.”\n\nMarshall came around quickly on the first day of filming, Alexander said, and the rest is history.\n\nJulia Roberts has spoken about the film’s original gritty ending before, back when it was called “3,000” instead of “Pretty Woman.”\n\nIn the first iteration, Roberts told Variety, her character Vivian Ward was thrown out of a car in the end and a man “threw the money on top of her, as memory serves, and just drove away leaving her in some dirty alley.”\n\n“Thank god it fell apart,” she said."

        "articleContent": [
            "When “L.A.’s Finest” was dropped by NBC ahead of the 2018-19 season, it came as a shock. The “Bad Boys” offshoot featured two women of color ― Gabrielle Union and Jessica Alba ― leading a cop drama, something that was desperately missing from broadcast TV. And with movie stars as headliners, the Sony Pictures TV project, whose pilot reportedly cost around $12 million, had been a shoo-in for a primetime spot.",
            "But Sony refused to give up on the show, which eventually became the flagship series for original content on Spectrum, a channel available exclusively to subscribers of cable provider Spectrum on-demand and ad-free.",
            "“L.A.’s Finest” arrived in May 2019 and earned 3 million viewers for its first 13 episodes. Shortly after, it was greenlighted for Season 2, which debuted on Spectrum earlier this month.",
            "“We were originally an NBC pilot, but we got to rework the show for the Spectrum audience and live in a little more of a streaming world, which opened up the possibilities for stories for us to tell beyond the standard network cop procedural,” creator Brandon Margolis told HuffPost during an interview this month.",
            "For Margolis and co-creator Brandon Sonnier, that switch in tone comes very much in handy now as, amid coronavirus shutdowns and production delays, “L.A.’s Finest” has been picked up by Fox as a way to fill some Fall 2020 schedule space. The female-led cop drama has the chance to grab a new network audience when it airs Monday nights ahead of the Kim Cattrall-fronted pilot series “Filthy Rich.”",
            "Interestingly enough, this isn’t a one-off thing. A few of the major networks have acquired pre-released series as a way to expand their lineups. CBS is airing the fourth season of the Netflix-turned-Pop series “One Day at a Time,” as well as Spectrum’s anthology series “Manhunt: Deadly Games” and Season 1 of CBS All Access series “Star Trek: Discovery.” And The CW picked up CBS All Access’ psychological thriller “Tell Me a Story” and DC Universe’s “Swamp Thing.”",
            "Most of these shows have enough episodes banked to hold over at-home audiences while productions kick back into gear and new content rolls out.",
            "“I certainly would imagine that having two seasons’ worth of episodes already produced, that can fill up an entire season’s worth of airtime, was a big upswing for Fox in their decision to pick [‘L.A.‘s Finest’] up,” Margolis said, with Sonnier noting how ecstatic they are that unaware viewers will now get to see their work.",
            "“The Spectrum subscriber base came through for us and gave us the kind of viewership and numbers that said this could be successful on a larger platform with more eyeballs,” Sonnier said. “It’s so gratifying to now put it out there and let people experience the show who haven’t had the opportunity to do that.”",
            "Fellow picked-up series “One Day at a Time” has faced its fair share of ups and downs, as well. The critically acclaimed reboot of the classic Norman Lear sitcom ― which follows a Latino family helmed by single mom and veteran Penelope Alvarez (Justina Machado) ― was canceled by Netflix in 2019 after three seasons. Then, thankfully, it was saved by Viacom’s “Schitt’s Creek” network Pop TV amid outcry from fans. Now, it will air its latest six episodes on CBS beginning Oct. 5 as part of Viacom’s overall purchase of the series. (Viacom owns both Pop TV and CBS).",
            "“It’s a great opportunity,” co-showrunner Gloria Calderón Kellett told HuffPost. “I think it’s very smart for [networks] to go ahead and say, ‘You know what? Let’s partner and let’s give some of these shows a shot at more eyeballs.’ It’s kind of making lemonade out of lemons and we are the bearers of the benefits of that. We just hope that that means that it’ll give us a shot at continuing to make the show.”",
            "Both “One Day at a Time” and “L.A.’s Finest” have yet to be renewed by their primary networks, so a prime-time jolt to viewership might be the key to future seasons. If all goes well enough, Kellett, Margolis and Sonnier could even see the potential of CBS and Fox personally renewing their series.",
            "“Hopefully, we will do well on CBS and they will pick us up, and we can start our writers’ room back up and get back to it so that we can shoot in the new year,” Kellett, who produces “One Day at a Time” with co-creator Mike Royce, said.",
            "Margolis and Sonnier have similar aspirations.",
            "“You’re always hopeful that your show gets to life beyond the one episode you produce if you get to do a pilot or the one half-season if you get to a 13 order,” Sonnier said. “And here we are sitting on two seasons ready to roll out and we are absolutely hopeful that there will be the possibility of telling the story for as long as people are willing to give it a shot and and experience it with us.”",
            "The pressure is on in other ways, as well, as both series feature characters and storylines that are underrepresented on network television. Multi-camera comedy “One Day at a Time” follows a Cuban-American family as they grapple with racism, immigration laws, LGBTQ issues, post-traumatic stress disorder and veteran care. According to Kellett, it is the only Latino family show that will be on broadcast this fall. And “L.A.’s Finest” takes the police procedural and flips it on its head with two women who are just as skilled and complicated as any of their male counterparts.",
            "“As a white man who is writing a show about two women of color, authenticity to these characters is incredibly important to myself and to my partner Brandon,” Margolis said. “We need people who can represent different points of view than what we bring. If we want that show to really feel authentic and be real it starts with our leads. They’re very thoughtful about the things that their characters would say and do. And we have a great dynamic with them where they trust us to tell compelling stories and we trust them to bring the grounded authenticity to the character. It allows us to write these characters in an honest way and know that everybody’s intention is to make the most authentic experience possible.”",
            "Actors Alba and Union have spoken about their collaboration with Margolis and Sonnier, and the diverse crew that brings dynamic storylines to life. Union, however, does recognize that cop shows need to have “more accurate portrayals between the police and marginalized communities.”",
            "“We all have a lot of work to do if we’re going to tell truthful stories because, as it is right now, our show is pure fantasy, it’s pure escapism,” she told Meghan McCain on “The View” earlier this month. “It is not rooted in the reality that we’re seeing every day on the news.”",
            "For Kellett, she hopes “One Day at a Time” can act as a microcosm for what’s happening in the country right now.",
            "“We’re doing the work of trying to set straight the community out there in terms of knowing who we are as as Latino Americans in this country,” Kellett said. “This is also a family that has three different generations ― a young liberal (Isabella Gomez), a moderate of middle age (Machado) and a very traditional, conservative grandmother (Rita Moreno) ― all living under one roof, all having difficult conversations, but doing so in a loving manner and trying to find ways to coexist peacefully. So we’re hoping that it can be something that provides a little bit of laughter and joy to America.”",
            "If audiences flock toward network reruns of these picked-up series this fall, perhaps we’ll get to see some more honest storytelling in 2021.",
            "CORRECTION: This article previously misstated that “L.A.’s Finest” follows “Filthy Rich”; it airs before “Filthy Rich.”"

            "Go for a walk.",
            "“Being outside and in the fresh air can really clear your head,” said Hood. “Children have the freedom to run and shout without the confinement of the house which allows them to let off steam.”",

            "Kondo acknowledged that the COVID-19 pandemic has changed many people’s relationships with the spaces they inhabit and the value of tidying. Indeed, there have been countless stories of people using their time in quarantine to tackle long-overdue home improvement projects.",
            "“The increased time at home has motivated a lot of people to take inventory of their possessions and to reevaluate their relationship with them,” she said.",
            "Working from home has underscored the importance of having a calming workspace in the house, the tidying expert added.",
            "“I recommend making your workspace as tidy ― and as joyful ― as possible,” Kondo said. “No matter where you work, it’s important to create an environment that helps you focus. If you don’t have a home office, identify the items that are crucial to getting your work done and designate a clear spot for them ― a box or portable carrier will do.”",
            "“When it’s time to work, move all unrelated items off of your workspace and add one thing that sparks joy when you look at it,” she continued. “I always keep a crystal or small vase of fresh flowers on my desk.”",
            "She also advised doing something to mark the start of the work day in the morning. As part of her own routine, Kondo said she likes to strike a tuning fork and diffuse essential oils “to signal to my body that I’m switching gears.”",
            "Kondo hopes her tidying course will reach a new audience of people hoping to defeat clutter in their lives.",
            "“I’ve discovered over the years that people master the KonMari Method in different ways,” she said. “For many, my books were all the tidying instruction they needed! For others, my Netflix show ― featuring real-life stories of people tidying with me ― helped them through the process. This course is a great fit for people who enjoy learning through visual demonstration. I break the KonMari Method into lessons and am with you every step of the way.”"

            "If 2020 were the least bit normal, it would already be clear — more or less — which movies are the likeliest to win the Oscar for Best Picture. Instead, we hardly know what will open between now and then. Warner Bros. says “Dune” is holding on to its Dec. 18 release plan, but with the studio already weathering tepid earnings for Christopher Nolan’s “Tenet,” will another expensive sci-fi tentpole risk wading through the COVID-19 quicksand? Last week, Disney pushed Steven Spielberg’s “West Side Story” remake from December of this year to December of next year, clearly unwilling to forgo an awards-friendly multiplex blitz. That’s one major contender gone. Time will soon tell whether Universal Pictures will nix its Christmas Day strategy for the Tom Hanks drama “News of the World,” rendering the holiday calendar rather barren.",
            "The abnormality of this year’s awards season has become evident over the past few weeks as the Venice and Toronto film festivals staged skeletal versions of their usual hoopla. Along with Telluride, the other big Labor Day-adjacent gala, which was canceled altogether, Venice and Toronto act as annual springboards for Hollywood’s monthslong derby. Buoyed by festival fanfare, prognosticators tend to declare a Best Picture front-runner in early September, with only a few late-breaking titles left to screen for press. The whole chaotic scene — red carpets, crowd reactions, industry chatter, flashy parties — is part of what makes and breaks Oscar hopes. But Toronto went mostly virtual, limiting anyone’s ability to track individual movies’ momentum.",
            "And thus begins an awards season without much of an actual season.",
            "I know, I know: None of this really matters. We have far more pressing concerns than what movies come out in December. But awards season is a petri dish for America’s highs and lows. Through the entertainment business, we collect ideas about politics, technology, fashion, body image, race and economics. With the pandemic thrusting changes upon the entire establishment, this could be the year that prompts some of the overcooked Oscar electioneering to fade away. Voters may discover they didn’t need all those fancy luncheons and baby-kissing congregations and manufactured PR narratives about whose “turn” it is to win.",
            "There is much to gain and much to lose in 2020’s irregularity. Some of the lingering debates around awards had to be adjudicated to accommodate these strange times. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which oversees the Oscars, has hesitated to fully embrace the streaming era out of fear that it will erode the theatrical marketplace. For the upcoming race, however, the academy will deem any digital exclusive that was supposed to open in theaters eligible. The organization also extended the qualification deadline — usually Dec. 31 — to Feb. 28 and delayed the ceremony to April 25. That will make this the longest awards season in decades despite having fewer qualifiers than usual. A February debut would ordinarily extinguish a movie’s Oscar chances, but now it will be prime territory.",
            "One interesting effect? We could see the most nontraditional Oscar roster in history. It’s no secret that, despite ongoing diversity initiatives, the academy tends to favor “serious movies” made by white men with enough institutional support and mainstream appeal to mount multimillion-dollar crusades. (You can’t imagine how many times I’ve heard publicists representing small, idiosyncratic movies say, “We don’t have money for a real campaign, so we know we won’t get nominated.”) The recent “Moonlight” and “Parasite” wins suggest a brighter future for films that don’t fit the typical Hollywood mold, but nothing about the Oscars’ 9,412-member voting body is guaranteed. If forced to pick from a smaller pool, voters may find themselves drawn to genres and filmmakers they’d otherwise ignore.",
            "Red carpets are uncertain, too. No matter where COVID-19 stands come April, they probably won’t look anything like they have in the past since foot traffic would make social distancing hard to enforce. The Emmys, for one, conducted all pre-show interviews with nominees via Zoom: no flashbulbs, no spontaneous celebrity interactions to make the internet swoon, fewer designer gowns. But awards-show carpets — those bastions of glamour, controversy and superficiality — are unremarkable when transmitted through so many pixels. At the Golden Globes in 2018, many attendees wore black to protest sexual misconduct, and activists such as Me Too founder Tarana Burke and National Domestic Workers Alliance director Ai-jen Poo accompanied famous actors to the ceremony. Maybe you don’t appreciate well-dressed luminaries being handed a platform that drifts between speaking truth to power and building a lucrative personal brand, but there’d be no denying the impact of public figures banding together in person to rebuke the killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and countless other Black people.",
            "Something else we surrender without a standard awards season is a marker of time. With much of the country underemployed or working from home, hours and days can seem elastic. Certain customs that help us feel normal are disappearing. Awards season, however superfluous it may be, is a reliable phenomenon even for people who aren’t pop-culture buffs. Theaters in November and December are flooded with any given year’s best movies, followed by the Golden Globes and the Screen Actors Guild Awards in January. Part of our communal winter clockwork involves watching Oscar bait and judging celebrities’ attire.",
            "It’s not unreasonable to ask this awards season to set humbler precedents, to instate a tiny bit of the meritocracy that the Oscars pretend to be. It’s time to stifle the idea that horror performances aren’t worthy, that releasing a movie during the first half of the year is a death knell, that studios can game their way to Best Picture. A reduced slate is a bummer for moviegoers, but it also means Delroy Lindo won’t struggle as hard to get the Best Actor nomination he deserves for “Da 5 Bloods,” a Netflix title from June. It means that indie gems like “Never Rarely Sometimes Always” and “First Cow” could stand a chance, yielding career lifts for their acclaimed directors (Eliza Hittman and Kelly Reichardt, respectively). It means a quirky satire like “French Exit,” starring Michelle Pfeiffer, Lucas Hedges and a talking cat, might not be seen as just a niche comedy. It means we could get the most diverse nomination list in history, spotlighting “One Night in Miami,” the Aretha Franklin biopic “Respect” and “The United States vs. Billie Holiday,” to name a few.",
            "A hint of normalcy might be welcome right now, but that’s not on the table yet. So if nothing else, perhaps whatever new world emerges in our post-COVID haze will put to bed some of the basest awards-season habits. The show will go on, but it needn’t be a rerun."

            "As U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said last week, “The pandemic is a clear test of international cooperation – a test we have essentially failed.”",
            "There is a “disconnect between leadership and power,” he said, warning that in the 21st century’s interconnected world, “solidarity is self-interest,” and “if we fail to grasp that fact, everyone loses.”",
            "The first-ever virtual meeting of world leaders at the General Assembly, highlighted increasing tensions among major powers, the growing inequality between rich and poor countries, and the escalating difficulty of getting the U.N.’s 193 member nations to agree on major issues — let alone unite on reforms.",
            "Born out of the ashes of World War II with 50 members, the United Nations has since expanded dramatically. Seventy-five years after its founding nations signed the U.N. Charter in San Francisco and vowed “to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war,” conflicts continue to rage around a world beset by inequality, hunger and a massive climate crisis.",
            "“We could criticize the U.N. for this — but who are we really talking about, when we blame `the U.N.?’” Switzerland President Simonetta Sommaruga asked. “We are in fact talking about ourselves, because the U.N. is its member states. And it is often member states that stand in the way of the U.N.’s work.”",

            "For many leaders, the U.N.’s most important role is its convening power — bringing all nations together to talk ― but there are many frustrations about its rules, including requiring all 193 countries to agree on key documents such as the declaration commemorating the 75th anniversary, which took months of negotiations.",
            "The most contentious debate, which began in 1979 and has gone on for 40 years with no end in sight, is over reforming the Security Council, whose five permanent members reflect the international power structure at the end of World War II: the U.S., China, Russia, France and Britain. The council’s 10 other seats rotate among members who serve two-year terms.",
            "While there is widespread support for revamping the 15-member council to reflect current global realities, efforts have remained mired in national and regional rivalries.",
            "In 2005, deep divisions forced the General Assembly to shelve three rival resolutions on expansion.",
            "One sought permanent seats without veto power for Germany, Japan, Brazil and India on a 25-member council. A group of middle-ranking countries including Italy and Pakistan wanted a 25-member council with 10 new nonpermanent seats. And the African Union wanted a 26-member council with six additional permanent seats, including two for Africa with veto power, and five nonpermanent seats.",
            "That year, world leaders called for the early reform of the council so it would be “more broadly representative, efficient and transparent.”",
            "St. Lucia’s Prime Minister Allen Chastanet noted in his prerecorded address Saturday that the 15th anniversary of the summit where that was adopted was also being marked, and he joined other countries “in encouraging text-based negotiations so the reform efforts will be expedited.”",
            "India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked in his speech Saturday: “For how long will India be kept out of the decision-making structures of the United Nations?” With 1.3 billion people, he said, India is the world’s largest democracy, has 18% of the world’s population and is strongly committed “to maintain the relevance of this great institution.”",

            "Twenty years ago today, the Food and Drug Administration approved mifepristone, a drug used to terminate early pregnancies that held the promise of revolutionizing abortion care in the U.S.",
            "Colloquially called the abortion pill, mifepristone is taken in combination with another drug, misoprostol, and allows patients under 10 weeks pregnant to have an abortion in the privacy of their home, instead of inside an abortion clinic. Reproductive rights activists lobbying for the drug envisioned a future where women could have the pills prescribed by their primary physician and dispensed at their local pharmacy, transforming abortion into just another part of normal health care.",
            "And yet, in the year 2020, that vision has not come true.",
            "Rigorous research has shown that medication abortion is safe and effective, and over 3.7 million women have used it to end their pregnancies since its approval. These days, about 40% of abortions in the U.S. are done using medication. Still, mifepristone is still treated as a dangerous drug, over the objections of a growing chorus of medical organizations and Democratic lawmakers.",
            "Because mifepristone is subject to a special set of FDA restrictions known as a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS), medication abortion is highly regulated. In most cases, patients seeking the drugs must drive to their closest abortion clinic, which may be hours away depending on the state, to get the medicines.",
            "The coronavirus pandemic has brought into stark relief the consequences of the restrictions. Patients have been forced to travel long distances in violation of stay-at-home orders to obtain drugs that could easily be sent in the mail.",
            "In May, reproductive health care providers successfully sued the FDA to temporarily block the requirement that patients obtain medication abortion in-person during the pandemic. Currently, patients in some states are able to access medication abortion via telemedicine, though the Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to block the lower court ruling. At the same time, some anti-abortion rights Republican lawmakers, such as Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, are pushing to have the drug removed from the market entirely.",
            "To understand the history of medication abortion in the U.S., HuffPost spoke to Cynthia A. Pearson, executive director of the National Women’s Health Network, who campaigned for the abortion pill to be approved in the 1990s.",
            "You testified at the FDA meeting in 1996 where an advisory committee recommended the approval of medication abortion. What do you remember from that day?",
            "At the time, I was the policy advocacy director for my organization and I had been campaigning to get the pill to the U.S. for several years. The most visceral memory I have is the fear that the FDA staff felt about violence. I had been going to FDA meetings on all kinds of women’s health issues for years. Usually we would take the subway, walk through a parking lot, enter the FDA building and take the elevator down to a basement area to their conference rooms. It would be just another government meeting.",
            "This meeting was in a different, secured location. They were so concerned about safety that all of us who wanted to go to the meeting had to first park at a hotel and get screened before getting on the shuttle bus. Then we had to go through another set of federal marshals and get screened again before we could get into the room where the meeting was held. The FDA’s fear of violence wasn’t unjustified. There had been violent attacks against abortion providers and threats made against FDA officials. FDA spokespeople at that time were counseled not to use their names for fear of becoming targets. We knew we were going into this really fraught situation.",
            "At the time the committee voted in favor, I remember thinking, “We did it! We did it!” My heart raced. But then, almost immediately, things started to go off the rails. They started talking about restricting it to only doctors who already provide abortion, which undermines the whole idea of it becoming more available. The idea was that it could be prescribed by any physician.",
            "It took four years to finally get approved, and once it was, medication abortion was subject to a whole host of restrictions. What did you think when that happened?",
            "By that time, mifepristone had been approved in dozens of countries, used by millions of women and the safety record was already well known.",
            "I thought the restrictions would be gone in a couple of years. When I was talking with our contacts inside the FDA in 1996, the message was: Let’s keep it with trained abortion doctors right at the beginning and then there’ll be no complications, and then it’ll be okay to loosen the rules and let any doctor prescribe it because we’ll have it established that it’s safe.",
            "It was really short-sighted, the idea that avoiding complications would avoid a political backlash. There was always going to be a political backlash! People who oppose abortion oppose any kind of abortion, safe or not. They believe it’s wrong. It was a misguided strategy.",
            "In 2007, when the REMS program was begun, mifepristone was added to the list of drugs requiring special oversight. What impact did that have?",
            "If the original approval was an ankle bracelet, REMS was the prison. Nothing ever gets out of REMS. As a longtime women’s health activist, I’m not aware of any drug that has gotten out of REMS once it’s been put in, because it’s designed for dangerous drugs.",
            "REMS is not a bad program. It’s designed for drugs that have proven efficacy but have some pretty serious dangers. So guidance is needed to maximize the risk-benefit ratio. But mifepristone is not a dangerous drug.",
            "How does it make you feel, seeing medication abortion still regulated in such a strict way, after 20 years of evidence on its safety?",
            "It’s completely wrong. It’s medically unjustifiable and politically motivated and has been for 20 years. I have some empathy for people in the FDA who are buffeted by political stresses and strains and anti-abortion legislators. I understand that they get a lot of pressure. But in the end, we need them to do their job, and their job is to be honest about the drugs they regulate, regardless of whether it’s a vaccine, whether it’s abortion care, whether it’s chemotherapy, whether it’s obesity drugs. In this case, they’re not being intellectually honest with the world about the safety of the use of medication abortion.",
            "Tell me about your recent campaign to end the REMS on medication abortion.",
            "About a week after we all went home due to coronavirus, we started wondering, how are women going to get to the clinic? Dammit, we should just tell the FDA, they need to drop the REMS. Early in April we wrote a letter to the FDA commissioner signed by 83 organizations saying, drop it, drop it right now, drop it in a hurry because it’s urgent, and drop it forever because it’s a settled question, it is not needed to protect the safety of pregnant patients.",
            "I got no response, not even an acknowledgment that I sent the letter. I then asked for a meeting; no acknowledgment that I asked for a meeting.",
            "I’ve interacted with multiple commissioners appointed by Republicans and Democrats, and I’ve never, ever in all these years had an FDA commissioner’s office not even acknowledge that I sent a message or request for a meeting.",
            "We hope there will be a shift in the political climate that makes it clear to the FDA that they will be free to go by the science and their actions will be understood as being science-based. They might get political criticism, but they won’t be stopped or have their budget cut or leader muzzled or something like that.

            "The criminal justice system has historically failed survivors of sexual violence. And it’s easy to make that conclusion when reading the statistics: Three out of four sexual assaults are not reported to police, often for survivors’ fear of being victim-blamed. Out of the cases that are reported to police, 13% get referred to prosecutors. And only 7% of those cases lead to a felony conviction.",
            "But what if there was a better approach to getting justice for victims of sexual assault?",
            "Dr. Mary Koss, a Regents’ Professor at University of Arizona’s Mel and Enid Zuckerman College of Public Health, illustrates multiple justice alternatives in a new report released Friday, published by Data For Progress and the Justice Collaborative Institute. Currently, there are a very limited number of options for victims seeking justice, but by implementing restorative justice ― an alternative method to addressing harm by relying on community members instead of the criminal system ― survivors could have a say in what type of justice they’re seeking and how they receive it.",
            "“The criminal justice system is a pipeline, and it has leaks all along the way,” Koss told HuffPost, adding that only “a drop of consequence comes out.”",
            "Using restorative justice practices could fix that leaky pipeline, Koss said. Out of a survey of over 1,000 U.S. voters, 69% said they would support making mental health and trauma-related services available to survivors who choose not to report to police. Nearly 60% of all respondents supported reallocating funds from law enforcement to support financing those victim services.",
            "Last month, HuffPost spoke to more than a dozen survivors of sexual assault about the debate over defunding police. All of them said police usually ended up re-traumatizing them instead of helping them find justice. Many of the survivors said they’d like to see more restorative justice alternatives implemented in the current criminal system, telling HuffPost that many social services that could receive a reallocation of funding from downsized police budgets are the very types of services victims need when they report: mental health, addiction services and other trauma-informed social services.",
            "HuffPost spoke with Koss about alternative justice options beyond what our criminal system currently offers.",
            "Can you walk me through how the criminal justice system often fails sexual assault survivors?",
            "It starts with when victims make their first decision, which is, are they going to report to the police or not? And that often depends on how they believe they’re going to be treated. Police officers are people and they make their decisions based on the same grounds that many other people do: their response to sexual assault victims can be steeped in myths and stereotypes. They can be trained to be more sensitive, but their job is to get at the evidence. And it’s fairly hard to do that ― no matter how good your training is ― without being somewhat harsh.",
            "So if you look at the cases that police decide ― whether they just don’t have the resources to investigate or they, frankly, don’t believe the victim ― that pile will have too many minorities, too many people with substance abuse issues and too many people with mental illness problems.",
            "But it has to be recognized that police aren’t the only part of the criminal justice system. They’re just the beginning of it.",
            "Any case that survives police investigation goes to prosecutors, where they often apply those same perspectives or biases again. In addition, they think about: “Can we win this case in a courtroom?” Because if they can’t, they won’t waste their resources on it.",
            "When you put this all together, what we’ve got is an adversarial justice system, where the purpose of the system is to uncover the evidence, weigh the evidence, assign culpability and set punishment. The criminal justice system is woefully inadequate to address the crime of sexual assault.",
            "There’s been a lot of discussion around the movement to defund the police. Although sexual assault survivors have a spectrum of experiences with law enforcement, how would you approach the conversation around defunding the police in relation to alternative justice options for victims?",
            "If I had to put it in my words, it would be: Reallocate VAWA [Violence Against Women Act] money. Yes, I don’t think police should be working as social workers. But I don’t think that sexual assault survivors are asking police to work as social workers.",
            "Some of the VAWA money does go to police and it trickles down to the local policing level. I believe that money should be up for discussion about whether it’s being used in the best way. I got some of that money once and I had to go to a hearing and listen to who else was competing for it. One of the other proposals was to buy one of those great big riot vans and get it all tripped out. Luckily, there was the right person in the right place who said maybe we don’t need that tank and we could actually help some people who are working towards restorative justice.",
            "We have to take a look at the VAWA money. Where is it going? I don’t believe that the money for restorative justice should come from taking money solely away from police departments. The role police play in sexual assault, although it’s a critical gatekeeper function, is again just the first part of the system.",
            "How would a restorative justice option help fix our “adversarial” justice system?",
            "Restorative justice is also about holding people accountable. In the U.S., since we have such a high incarceration rate compared to the rest of the world, we think the only way to take crime seriously is to put people in prison. The process believes in holding people accountable in meaningful ways that are community based.",
            "The only thing I would like to emphasize is that not all wrongdoers are willing to take even the slightest bit of responsibility for what they did. And those people unfortunately can’t be dealt with in restorative justice, because restorative justice is for people who seek a process that helps.",
            "Would you say restorative justice is a more victim-centered approach?",
            "I’m having this internal struggle, because restorative justice doesn’t advertise itself as being victim-centered. It visualizes itself more as a triangle. The current adversarial justice system is seen as having basically one customer and that’s the defendant. And it’s the justice system’s job to put that person, if possible, in prison. The victim is not seen as a customer of the criminal justice system. So the victim doesn’t get good service necessarily because you’re not a customer. You’re just there as an assistant to do their job, observing their customer ― the defendant.",
            "Restorative justice was created to say that justice shouldn’t just focus on the wrongdoer, justice has to focus on the wrong as well as on the wrongdoer. Restorative justice is often illustrated as a triangle where it’s got victim, wrongdoer and community because you have to balance the needs of all three.",
            "It’s certainly better for victims: it gives them more choice, more control over the process, more flexibility to shape the process, and it provides them with a validating environment. There are many, many ways in which it is set up to be a better experience for victims. But it’s not set up that way at the expense of denying due process to the wrongdoer or at the expense of putting the community at risk from having unsafe people running around.",
            "I recently had a conversation with a sexual assault survivor for an article about defunding the police. She said something that’s really stuck with me: She initially chose not to report her abuser because she believed he would be sexually assaulted in prison, essentially reinforcing and perpetuating the very violence he perpetrated himself.",
            "Altruism of victims is important to note here. Oftentimes if people who are looking to hold their wrongdoer accountable were given a list of possible consequences, most would not select “I want this person to go to prison.” But unfortunately, we have a system set up that has a very limited menu.",
            "We don’t really have an alternative that’s available to sexual assault victims. Often this forces victims to take justice into their own hands by writing guys’ names on bathroom walls and keeping social media lists of fraternities that have rapists in them. Those are some of the ways people have struggled to find alternative systems of justice.",
            "What do you hope people take away from your report?",
            "We need to make sure we’ve connected or reconnected with the voices of the victims we are supposedly serving. We have to be prepared for the fact that justice is a luxury. If you’ve got money problems, food problems, housing problems, day care problems, transportation problems, employment problems, you can’t afford the luxury of justice. It’s not appealing to you. So when we are creating alternative justice options we have to think in that broader perspective.",

            "These cases could decide the election. They will determine how many ballots cast through the mail are either counted or invalidated because of minor errors made by the voter or delayed mail delivery. Even a relatively small number of ballots going uncounted could have major implications: The 2016 presidential contest was decided by just tens of thousands of votes across three states.",
            "Most elections don’t involve a litigation frenzy. But the pandemic, coupled with a U.S. Postal Service crippled by both the virus and new leadership, has driven both parties to the courts.",
            "Voting rights advocates and Democratic Party lawyers have sued in more than two dozen states seeking to ease or eliminate restrictions on absentee and mail-in voting practices. Republicans, led by President Donald Trump, have sued or intervened in 20 states trying to either maintain those restrictions or overturn newly enacted laws expanding absentee and mail-in voting rights.",
            "The question now is whether federal appeals courts, and ultimately the Supreme Court, will uphold lower court rulings that reduced barriers to counting ballots in the general election. In litigation during this year’s primary season, the Supreme Court and federal appeals courts routinely overturned lower court rulings that had loosened restrictions on voting absentee or by mail during the pandemic.",
            "“The federal judiciary is not being a great avenue for relief,” said Sylvia Albert, director of voting and elections at Common Cause, a nonpartisan nonprofit. “Some state courts have provided more. And that’s where you’ve seen more orders for expanded access.”",
            "These appeals are part of Trump and the Republican Party’s $20 million Protect the Vote litigation campaign. It flows from their belief that Trump has a better chance of winning the election if fewer votes are cast and counted, particularly those likely to be cast by groups who favor his opponent. The lawsuits are a more formal expression of Trump’s efforts to spread disinformation baselessly casting doubt on the validity of absentee balloting, whether mailed or delivered by hand.",
            "Trump also wants to seat a new justice before Election Day because he thinks “this will end up in the Supreme Court.” And he refuses to say that he’ll accept the results of the election or allow a peaceful transfer of power unless ballots favoring his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, are discounted.",

            "The outcome of the legal fights between Democrats and voting rights advocates on one side and Trump, Republicans and voting rights opponents on the other could determine how many ballots he will be able to get rid of.",
            "“My biggest risk is that we don’t win lawsuits,” Trump said in June. “We have many lawsuits going all over. And if we don’t win those lawsuits, I think — I think it puts the election at risk.”",
            "So far, Trump’s side has lost most of its latest legal battles, but Republicans are now appealing those rulings, including all the way up to the Supreme Court. These cases are likely to be decided before the Republican-controlled Senate votes on Trump’s next high court nominee.",
            "Over the last month, federal courts in Georgia and Wisconsin and state courts in Michigan and Pennsylvania lifted restrictions on absentee and mail-in voting that could be critical to ensuring voters aren’t disenfranchised due to conditions out of their control. The decisions in each state extended the ballot receipt deadline to allow ballots to count if they are received a few days after Nov. 3 so long as they were postmarked on or before Election Day.",
            "Mailed absentee ballots in Michigan that arrive up to 14 days after Nov. 3 will remain valid so long as they were postmarked at least one day before Election Day, according to the Sept. 18 ruling. That decision also lifted the restrictions that limited those assisting in returning an absentee ballot to family members, co-residents and election clerks; now allow anyone can help during the five days before Election Day. (A separate Sept. 17 decision lifted the state’s ban on free or discounted transportation to election sites.)",
            "In Wisconsin, absentee ballots postmarked by Nov. 3 will count if they arrive up to six days after Election Day under a Sept. 21 decision. The ruling also extends the online and mailed registration deadline from Oct. 14 to Oct. 21.",
            "A federal district judge ruled on Aug. 31 to extend Georgia’s ballot receipt deadline for mailed absentee ballots to allow ballots postmarked by election day to remain valid if they arrive up to three days later.",
            "The Pennsylvania Supreme Court similarly ruled last week that mailed ballots in that state will remain valid if they arrive by Nov. 6.",
            "In North Carolina, the state’s bipartisan five-member Board of Elections voted unanimously in favor of an agreement to settle a lawsuit by extending their state’s ballot receipt deadline. A judge still must approve the settlement.",
            "A legal challenge brought by Trump and the Republican National Committee to Nevada’s vote-by-mail statute, which was enacted over the summer, failed after it was dismissed by a federal judge on Sept. 21. In South Carolina, a federal judge ruled last week in favor of waiving the witness requirement for absentee ballots due to the pandemic.",
            "But now many of these rulings will go before either appeals courts or the Supreme Court. Republicans have already appealed, plan to appeal or otherwise challenge the rulings in Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. And a federal appeals court quickly stayed the lower court ruling in South Carolina to remove the witness requirement for absentee ballots.",
            "In North Carolina, meanwhile, the two Republican election commissioners resigned in protest of the settlement, arguing that the outcome wasn’t what they thought they had agreed to. Democrats dispute the claim that the two were misled. This could lead to even more litigation.",
            "The Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s ruling extending the ballot receipt deadline could be the first case to go before the U.S. Supreme Court.",
            "Normally, decisions made by a state’s highest court are the last word on election matters. “What this appeal is saying is that that state court got it so wrong that it can’t stand,” said Albert, adding, “That’s unusual.”",
            "The Pennsylvania appeal, and the potential for further appeals, also comes at a precarious time for voting rights before the Supreme Court. The death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg leaves the court with an ideological split of five conservatives and three liberals. Over the summer, the court repeatedly overturned earlier rulings granting greater allowance for absentee voting during the pandemic. It may well continue to do so. But now any chance it would change course would require one more conservative justice to switch sides than before.",

            "In the days before COVID-19, the concept of going out to eat or ordering takeout food always connoted a caloric splurge. Bring on the fats! The sodium! The sugary drinks and desserts! The carbiest of all the carbs! It’s a special occasion and time to #treatyoself!",
            "But today, it looks more than a little different. We’re no longer just patronizing our favorite restaurants for the ambiance or environment. We’re doing it to make sure those businesses survive this pandemic and will be there to welcome us again after it. We’re getting more global cuisine ― dishes we can’t make at home, flavors we can’t readily source or identify and food made with equipment not available in our kitchens. And while we still treat ourselves to special meals from our local “nice” restaurants, more often than not these days, we’re having our meals made for us by our local shops because we’re just plain tired.",
            "However, in this new world where eating out often equates to ordering in, the old rules don’t have to apply. Indulgent doesn’t have to mean unhealthy, and modifications are no longer at the mercy of the chef. When you’re bringing food home, you get to put your own thumbprint on the work of the pros; in fact, this freedom to be creative and increase the nutritional value of a meal has always been my favorite part of getting food to go.",
            "With the help of registered dietitian Casey McCoy of Country Doctor Community Health Centers, we have tips for how to eat healthfully, mindfully and consciously no matter where your meal was first prepared.",
            "Learn the magic 1:1:2 ratio",
            "The first rule of healthy eating is to balance your nutrition, which also means creating an ideal proportion of food types. According to McCoy, an average ideal serving should have a 1:1:2 ratio of carbs, protein and vegetable side dishes. For instance, half of your plate ought to be filled with the good green stuff, while the rest should be divided evenly between meats and a starch, which may include grains, pasta, bread, potatoes or any other high-carb accompaniment.",
            "When ordering for a group, just apply those same 1:1:2 proportions. For instance, on Italian night, choose one pasta dish, one meat entree, a big salad, and perhaps a vegetarian main or two vegetable sides for a group of four. Getting Asian food? Pick noodles or a rice entree, and either something where protein is the star plus two vegetable dishes, or two stir-fries that feature plenty of veggies and one more vegetarian one ― including tofu as an option ― for good measure.",
            "Order family-style",
            "When you’re out to eat, you often default to one plate per person ― you choose one menu item and that’s your meal. But in many cultures, family-style is the way to go and at home, where you’re already laying out the contents of your take-away bag, self-serve becomes simplified. After all, one of the most fun things about letting someone else do the cooking for you is variety. Plus, sharing dishes usually allows for greater balance; you’re not tied down to finishing a heavy pasta entree by yourself, or eating only a meat-heavy entree with a vegetal contribution of just three miserly florets of broccoli.",
            "“Eating family-style gives you the choice to balance your plate with a good ratio of protein, carbs, and veggies, and allows you to choose your portion sizes,” McCoy explained.",
            "You can also save money ― and calories! ― by estimating only three entrees per four people, with the option of adding in an appetizer. In the U.S., takeout portions tend to be generous; they’re typically large enough for one and a half to two servings.",
            "The same principle works for a meal for two when you choose one regular entree and a plant-heavy one. For instance, McCoy likes “going splitsies with a dining partner so we can both enjoy our favorite fried chicken sandwich cut in half, and also a nice salad.”",
            "“This can also be helpful to avoid getting over-full on large restaurant portions, and it makes it possible for you to enjoy your favorite items while creating better balance,” she concluded.",
            "Add nutritious ingredients from your fridge",
            "Another way to cut costs and increase satiation? Add your own healthy ingredients. For example, split an Italian pasta portion into two and add your own zoodles to fill it in. Mix brown rice into your fried rice to up your whole grains and fiber, add an egg or two for cheap and easy protein, and throw in more vegetables to lower your simple carbs per scoop. Steam or lightly sauté vegetables to toss them with your saucy stir-fries, or grill some chicken and throw that in a vegetarian stir-fry.",
            "Home-grilled chicken is a great add-in to your salad, too, as DIY lets you control the ratio of meat to greens. Obviously, it also provides a healthier style than breaded, fried or flat-top grill preparation, which can sometimes soak up a lot of oil. You can also throw chickpeas or black beans into salads for cheap protein and to bulk up your side salads.",
            "Don’t be afraid to customize your order",
            "Go ahead ― ask the restaurant to make it your way. Find out if you can get grilled chicken instead of fried whenever possible to cut down on fat and carbs. Request less oil or butter to be used when they’re cooking to limit your intake and lower the greasy heaviness you might be sensitive to. Say you want more vegetables than noodles in your pasta, or simply offer to pay more to double your roughage. Have them pile on the lettuce, tomato, onion and other fresh toppings on sandwiches and burgers to get closer to that 2:1 vegetable-to-meat ratio. And ask if whole-grain bread on sandwiches is an option, since “higher fiber/nutrient content will keep you fuller longer and regulate your blood sugar,” McCoy advised.",
            "More likely than not, if the restaurant can fulfill a special request, they will, and sometimes at little to no extra cost.",
            "Swap out fatty ingredients and replace them at home",
            "Full-fat food tastes better. Fat is satiating, filling, and of course, flavorful since it’s rich, which is why restaurants default to it. But if you’re watching your intake, it’s a good idea to have your takeout of choice omit certain ingredients so you can make some healthier substitutions.",
            "For instance, if you can’t skip the cheese on your sandwich, pasta or burrito, ask them to leave it out and top your meal off with the reduced-fat version you may have in your fridge at home. However, you’re going to want to go with the 2% as opposed to the fat-free. “You’re more likely to eat more fat-free cheese since it’s less filling. The 2% is much more satisfying and our bodies need fats, which can help prevent hunger and overeating later,” McCoy said.",
            "Another easy switch is Greek yogurt for sour cream on your Mexican food, again using 2% for a smoother taste and feel. Fage brand is particularly good for this ― it’s creamier and richer than competitors and doesn’t break as easily. It can also work well as a sandwich spread in lieu of mayonnaise for sandwiches that only need a dab.",

            "Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, offered a sobering warning earlier this month as the weather in the United States begins to cool and flu season is looming: Americans need to stop looking at the “rosy side of things” and prepare for a second wave of COVID-19.",
            "“We need to hunker down and get through this fall and winter, because it’s not going to be easy,” Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, said during a panel at Harvard Medical School.",
            "Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, offered a grim prediction as well, telling the Journal of the American Medical Association in July that the fall and winter, “are going to be probably one of the most difficult times that we’ve experienced in American public health.”",
            "This means that Americans need to be diligent about protecting themselves and others from the airborne virus to quell a spike of infections in the next few months. And given that COVID-19 is primarily transmitted person-to-person through respiratory droplets from sneezing or coughing, Fredrick Sherman, a professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, offered The Atlantic a new and helpful tip to help curb the spread.",
            "Sherman said that if you find yourself in a high-risk scenario in which a someone sneezes or coughs near you, “Immediately exhale to avoid inhaling droplets or aerosols. Purse your lips to make the exhaling last longer. Turn your head fully away from the person and begin walking.”",
            "This method won’t definitively protect you from COVID-19, but it could reduce how much of the virus you’re exposed to if the person who coughs or sneezes happens to be contagious.",
            "You’re more likely to get sick if you inhale higher doses of the virus, according to The Atlantic. The amount of time you’re exposed to infected particles also matters in terms of transmission; the longer you’re around them, the more time the virus has to get into your system.",
            "There are, of course, more longterm steps you should be taking to reduce your risk of COVID-19. Even in the winter, continue to socialize outdoors, despite the weather. According to the CDC, you have a higher risk of contracting the virus indoors than you do outdoors, due to less ventilation and space, which makes it harder for people to socially distance.",
            "You should also be vigilant about wearing face masks, which arguably offer the best protection against the virus.",
            "Albert Ko, the chair of the department of epidemiology of microbial diseases at Yale School of Public Health, told The Atlantic that people should also accept that face masks “will be a part of our lives indefinitely.” Some experts even say use of face masks may last well into 2021, even when there is a vaccine.",
            "Ko said that by continuing to wear masks, “We can focus on improving their effectiveness and making them less annoying to wear.”",
            "“And it’s not just the design of masks themselves,” Ko said. “We can come up with more innovative ways to promote face-mask use.” Luxembourg, for example, sent its entire population face masks via mail in April.",
            "Finally, continue to wash or disinfect your hands as well as high-touch surface areas in your home.",
            "Experts are still learning about COVID-19. The information in this story is what was known or available as of publication, but guidance can change as scientists discover more about the virus. Please check the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the most updated recommendations."

            "A controversial article about Kate Middleton has been amended months after Kensington Palace issued a rare, scathing rebuke of some of the claims.",
            "The high society U.K. magazine Tatler published a cover story for its July/August issue called “Catherine the Great.”",
            "The article delved into the rumored relationship breakdown among the Duchess of Cambridge, Prince William, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle and was based on anonymous sourcing.",
            "Certain sections have since been deleted, including one saying that Kate was “furious about the larger workload” once the Duke and Duchess of Sussex officially stepped back as working members of the royal family in March.\n\n“Of course she’s smiling and dressing appropriately but she doesn’t want this. She feels exhausted and trapped,” a source told Tatler in a now-removed passage from the original article. “She’s working as hard as a top CEO, who has to be wheeled out all the time, without the benefits of boundaries and plenty of holidays.”\n\nOther parts about Kate’s sister Pippa Middleton speaking “like the queen” and Carole Middleton being a “terrible snob” have been removed, along with comments about Kate being “perilously thin.”",
            "Curiously enough, quotes from a source saying that Harry and Meghan affected William and Kate’s parenting of their three children remain in the article.",
            "“Meghan and Harry have been so selfish,” yet another anonymous friend says. “William and Catherine really wanted to be hands-on parents and the Sussexes have effectively thrown their three children under a bus. There goes their morning school runs as the responsibilities on them now are enormous.”\n\nThe magazine also brought up the much-talked-about “incident” at a rehearsal for the royal wedding rehearsal, where Kate reportedly yelled at Meghan, who then made the Duchess of Cambridge cry. That passage also remains in the updated article.\n\nAfter the article’s publication, Kensington Palace slammed the cover story, despite its usual “no comment” policy and friendly relationship with Tatler.\n\nKensington Palace told HuffPost in May that the story is a “swathe of inaccuracies and false misrepresentations which were not put to Kensington Palace prior to publication.” The palace did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for further comment regarding which stories or statements in the piece it believes are false.\n\nTatler’s editor-in-chief said in a statement at the time that it stood by its reporting from journalist Anna Pasternak and her sources.\n\n“Kensington Palace knew we were running the ‘Catherine the Great’ cover months ago and we asked them to work together on it,” a spokesperson for the publication said. “The fact they are denying they ever knew is categorically false.”",
            "Kensington Palace and Tatler had no comment when reached by HuffPost earlier this week.",
            "A source close to Tatler told the U.K.’s The Telegraph that the magazine “wants to maintain its long-standing relationship with the palace and ultimately agreed to remove parts of the profile at Kensington Palace’s request.”",

            "“They are not corny anymore,” Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said about press-on nails back in 2019. While on a train to Washington, D.C., the congresswoman showed her Instagram followers how she applied the nails in a matter of minutes. And she was right ― the nails are suddenly trendy.",
            "In addition to Ocasio-Cortez, we’ve seen celebs like Chrissy Teigen and Ariana Grande jump on the press-on wagon.",
            "But why?",
            "First, a primer: While acrylics and gels can use tips or forms to extend the length of your nail, press-ons are applied to the entire surface of your natural nail. Many press-on kits cost less than $10, while a set of acrylics can start at $50, depending on where you live. Press-ons are also great for anyone who’s not ready to visit the salon due to COVID-19 ― they’re relatively easy to apply and can last anywhere from a couple of days to a couple of weeks.",
            "HuffPost chatted with nail pros to get the rundown on how to properly apply press-ons, make them look as natural as possible and preserve the health of your natural nails.",
            "Preparation",
            "Applying press-ons can be a pretty quick process, but before you truly get started, it’s important to do a bit of prep work on your natural nails.",
            "“Prepping the nails is always key when applying any sort of application to make them last longer,” said LeChat Nails’ Syreeta Aaron of Montgomery, Alabama.",
            "This should start with washing your hands and making sure nails are free of any oils or lotions. You can also lightly buff and wipe them with acetone or alcohol. These steps help the glue to adhere better.",
            "In addition to prepping your natural nail, licensed manicurist Kelley Baker suggests doing a bit of prep for the press-on as well, particularly when it comes to finding the right fit.",
            "“A lot of people skip this step, but fitting the [press-on nails] to your natural nails before gluing them on can really help ensure a durable, long-lasting set of press-ons,” Baker said. “If the press-ons don’t quite fit, it’s likely they will pop off or lift prematurely.”",
            "A proper fit should cover your entire natural nail from side to side and the bottom of the nail should mimic your natural cuticle shape. If a nail is slightly too big, it can be gently filed down. If you’re ordering a set of custom nails and you have to pre-select sizes, then this step might not be as necessary, compared to buying a pack of press-ons that aren’t pre-measured to fit your digits.",
            "Application",
            "Once your natural nails and the press-ons are ready to go, it’s time to start applying them.",
            "Some kits come with adhesive tabs to secure the nails. These are much gentler on your natural nail but won’t last as long as glue. So the tabs are a great option for a temporary, one- or two-day style.",
            "Most press-on nails come with a small tube of glue. Though you might be tempted to apply more to ensure a long-lasting application, that’s not necessary and can actually get a bit messy.",
            "“With nail glue, a little bit goes a long way. Apply just a few drops to cover your entire nail plate, avoiding any contact with your skin,” Baker said.",
            "Pressing down on the nail will naturally cause the glue to spread, so a few small drops is all you need. If the glue gets on your skin, you can quickly clean it up with a wooden cuticle stick, which comes with many kits. After holding the glued nail down for 10 to 15 seconds, you can move on to the next.",
            "Aaron notes, “Make sure that the press-on is glued securely over the entire nail to prevent air bubbles which can trap [water].”",
            "Having water or any moisture under your nail should certainly be avoided for optimal nail health.",
            "“Any time water is trapped between your natural nail and an enhancement, whether it’s a press-on, acrylic or gel, there is a risk of infection,” Baker said.",
            "For a super-natural look, Cheyenne Gartley, nail tech and owner of Liquid Chrome Nails, has a single tip: “Making sure [they] are on straight is a big factor in the natural look of the nail,” she said. Since the glue can dry in seconds, positioning the nail the right way is key.",
            "As far as how long glued-on press-on nails can last? That depends on a few factors, including whether you work with your hands a lot ― such as typing every day or doing household activities where your hands are submerged in water. Baker says some applications can last up to two weeks.",
            "Removal",
            "Whether you’re rocking the nails for a few days or weeks, the removal process is where some press-on wearers might run into trouble if they’re not careful.",
            "“Many nail techs will tell you that, whether it’s press-ons, gels or acrylics, it’s not the enhancement itself that can damage your natural nails; rather, it’s the removal process that makes your nails vulnerable to damage,” Baker said.",
            "Gartley said one of the biggest mistakes people make is being too aggressive. “Trying to pull the nail off is the most common way to damage the natural nail. That’s a really bad thing to do,” she said.",
            "Pulling and prying can damage your natural nails by stripping them of keratin layers. Baker said this is similar to the damage that can be done when gels or acrylics are removed improperly or impatiently.",
            "The safest way to remove the press-ons involves soaking your hands in acetone, which loosens up the glue. This can take 15 to 20 minutes, and Gartley has a hack if you choose this method.",
            "“Warming the acetone can speed up the process. The acetone should always be in a glass bowl and can be warmed by placing the bowl inside another with hot water,” she said.",
            "If you want to avoid soaking your nails in acetone, which can be drying or even ruin the press-ons, there’s another removal option. This is especially great for sets you’ve worn for more than a week, as the glue will naturally loosen over time.",
            "“Using the angled side of an orangewood stick, gently slide it under the press-on, alternating from one side of the nail to the other to loosen the bond on both sides. The press-on should pop off, but if it doesn’t, don’t force it,” Baker said.",
            "Though it won’t be as quick as acetone, Aaron also says you can use water.",
            "“If you’re trying to preserve the press-on for reuse, run your hands under hot water and slowly peel them off as they come up.” You can simply use nail polish remover to get rid of any excess glue from the press-on and use them for another application.",
            "Press-On Brands To Try",
            "As press-on nails become increasingly popular, they’re easy to find online or at your local drugstore or beauty supply store.",
            "Amazon has pretty much every option imaginable, including press-ons that are sold in bulk and come polish- and design-free so you can customize them to your liking.",
            "If you want a press-on brand that comes polished, in a variety of shapes (coffin, stiletto, square, etc.), then there’s one brand that’s pretty accessible.",
            "“Kiss (the press-on line under the imPRESS brand) is one of my favorites and also one of the most popular brands,” Aaron said. The line has nails in varying lengths, colors and embellishments. There’s even a limited edition collection with Rebecca Minkoff. (Rebecca Minkoff x imPRESS Press-On Manicure, $8.99)",
            "While brands like Kiss are readily available, Baker also encourages consumers to seek out independent nail techs who offer press-ons for sale.",
            "“In San Francisco, I love Estasha’s press-ons — all of her designs are super creative,” Baker said. Besides supporting the techs, many of whom had to shut down their shops during the COVID-19 pandemic, these professionals also offer custom designs for a more unique look.",
            "“My fellow nail artists have been creating, selling and distributing press-on nails to keep their businesses alive during this time, and it’s been so inspiring to see how these small-business owners have pivoted during such a difficult time,” Baker said."

            "People who go to therapy have a variety of methods for processing and implementing the lessons they learn from their discussions with mental health professionals.",
            "One approach that has gained traction is recording therapy sessions and then listening back to them later. It’s difficult to recall everything that’s said during an appointment, so some people believe listening to a recording aids their memory and allows them to process more of the discussion. For others, the listening process is therapeutic in itself and can provide a sense of calm in moments of panic or uncertainty outside of sessions.",
            "While there are have been some studies into this technique, professionals aren’t necessarily in agreement on the benefits and drawbacks. Some are also concerned that modern technology and circumstances can allow clients to covertly record their sessions without the counselor’s knowledge.",
            "HuffPost asked therapists for their thoughts on the practice ― the pros, cons and other considerations. (While the comments they shared are generally geared toward audio recordings, many can apply to video as well.)",
            "Here’s what you should know about recording therapy sessions:",
            "This is not a common practice ― but that could change",
            "Every therapist HuffPost spoke to noted that recording therapy sessions is not a common practice for clients.",
            "“Some clients may take notes, but recording is not something that happens a lot,” said Nicole M. Ward, a licensed marriage and family therapist in Los Angeles.",
            "Brief notes can be helpful for behavior modification issues like breaking bad habits and adopting better ones. Some therapists offer their clients printouts illustrating relevant concepts as well.",
            "“It is more common, if anyone is recording, for it to be the therapist,” Ward said. “Some therapists may record sessions, but that is with client knowledge and permission.”",
            "Recorded sessions can be a training tool for therapists to review their work with clinical supervisors and meet requirements for evidence-based treatment practices. Such recordings are generally obtained with client consent, securely stored and destroyed after use.",
            "“I have not heard of clients recording sessions without telling their therapist, although I imagine with the increase of teletherapy services being offered due to the pandemic, this issue will become increasingly important for therapists and clients to navigate together,” said Becky Stuempfig, a licensed marriage and family therapist in Encinitas, California.",
            "“With video and phone sessions becoming more common, therapists may want to consider proactively raising the topic of session recordings with their clients before beginning sessions to make sure the client is aware of their policy on recording sessions,” Stuempfig said.",
            "There are privacy concerns",
            "“Generally, it is not a good idea to record the therapy session,” said Zainab Delawalla, a clinical psychologist in Atlanta. “Once a client records a session, there is no ethical mandate that compels the client to keep that recording private, the same way professional ethics and federal law require the therapist to keep the contents of the therapy session confidential. If shared, knowingly (e.g., on social media) or unknowingly (e.g., a snooping spouse), it would be easy for others to take the therapist’s words out of context.”",
            "If it’s a group therapy session, recording the discussions may violate the privacy of the others present as well.",
            "When a client records a session, there’s always the possibility that the file could fall into the wrong hands. Thus, it can compromise the confidentiality of therapy sessions ― breaching the trust involved in the client-therapist relationship and potentially bringing psychological harm.",
            "“Confidentiality is at the heart of the therapeutic relationship ― it is what makes the relationship completely unique and unlike any other dynamic,” Stuempfig said. “The client needs to know that what they share is absolutely going to be kept private, giving the client the peace of mind needed to share their innermost fears, past traumas, insecurities and worries without being concerned about judgment.”",
            "It may hinder the therapeutic process",
            "As a client, knowing that you’re recording a session may take you out of the moment. You may also misinterpret the session after reviewing the recording or fail to get the full experience by only listening to portions of it.",
            "“The client may be embarrassed by how they present and over-analyze what they say and how they say it, which can be a hindrance to the therapeutic process,” said Saniyyah Mayo, a licensed marriage and family therapist in Los Angeles. “Clients may also become upset after listening to themselves being challenged or confronted by their therapist.”",
            "Another upsetting drawback is that it could be emotionally damaging to replay the recording without the supervision of a therapist if you processed traumatic events during the session.",
            "“That would be something that should be discussed thoroughly between therapist and client before either party agrees to recording the session,” Stuempfig said.",
            "The client may over-invest in the therapist’s words",
            "“Recording a session therapeutically may make you over-invest in the therapist and their magical powers to heal you and under-invest in your part of the work,” said U.K.-based psychotherapist Noel McDermott.",
            "He advised focusing on what happens outside of therapy and understanding the ways that things you learn in sessions help you manage real-life occurrences more effectively.",
            "Clients also shouldn’t hyper-focus on the literal interpretation of the therapist’s words without context.",
            "“A therapist is just a person with professional training, and I worry that, with the wrong person, [recording a session] could idealize a therapist as being all-knowing,” said Meg Gitlin, a psychotherapist and the voice behind therapy insight Instagram City Therapist. “While this is a common occurrence in the therapeutic relationship, I could imagine access to sessions could intensify this deification of or dedication to the therapist. Just like anyone else, therapists are flawed and misspeak or misunderstand, and preservation of these sessions without an understanding of this could be detrimental to growth.”",
            "It’s important to discuss recording sessions with the therapist",
            "“If a client did want to record a session, they should ask the therapist’s permission to do so,” Delawalla said. “Recording sessions without the therapist’s consent would represent a breach of the therapeutic relationship.”",
            "It may also be illegal, depending on what state you’re in. That’s the case in California, which has a “two party consent” requirement for recordings, so both the therapist and the client (and anyone else in the session if there are multiple clients) would be required to sign a consent form.",
            "“As therapists, we do not have a legal or ethical obligation to allow a client to record sessions ― it is left up to the therapist’s discretion,” Stuempfig explained. “Before recording a session, it would be crucial for the therapist and client to discuss the potential risks involved, such as a break in confidentiality or emotional damage if replaying a session without live support from their therapist.”",
            "If you feel compelled to record your therapy sessions, Delawalla recommended reflecting on the reasons you want to do this.",
            "She advised asking yourself: “What purpose does the recording serve? Is it a way to distance yourself from the strong emotions that might come up in a session with the knowledge that you can go over it later? Is it that the pace of therapy is too quick and it seems like you don’t have time to fully process a topic or understand a technique before the therapist moves on to something else? Is it that the revelations in therapy only make sense when the therapist says it in those words in session but if you think about them later, it no longer fits?”",
            "“Under any of these circumstances, it would be more beneficial to bring up these underlying concerns with your therapist and work through them together,” Delawalla said.",
            "And if you are tempted to secretly record sessions, it may also be helpful to examine why you don’t feel comfortable talking to your therapist about potentially recording your conversations.",
            "There are ways to make it beneficial",
            "Recording therapy sessions can be helpful, assuming it’s part of a client and therapist’s mutual understanding of their goals and follows a meaningful conversation about the benefits, purpose and potential harm. The key is to be collaborative and approach it on a session-by-session basis.",
            "“It could be beneficial if the client uses it for their own private use to reflect later,” Ward said. “A client may also use it to track their personal growth throughout the therapeutic process.”",
            "Gitlin said that recording and replaying sessions could indicate a client’s commitment to self-improvement and therapy and help them master specific skills they learn in sessions. For these same reasons, she encourages clients to take notes so they may better integrate changes discussed in therapy into their everyday lives.",
            "“I received the request [to record sessions] from a client for the first time last week and was encouraging of them taking whatever measures they wanted to make the most out of our time together,” Gitlin said. “Therapy is notoriously expensive and can be time-consuming, and it’s important to me as a clinician to respect the clients’ use of our time together.”",
            "Stuempfig agreed, noting that recordings may remind clients about their goals outside the therapy room, without the constraints of a time-limited session.",
            "“The reality is that therapy sessions are typically only 50 minutes long and oftentimes, clients are flooded by intense emotions throughout the session and many different topics are usually covered in that short time span,” she said. “When clouded by emotion, it can be hard to recall specific details of what was discussed. It could be helpful for a client to have a recording to play back when they are in a calm, relaxed state and can better incorporate the positive changes or practice skills discussed in session.”",
            "It could be helpful for people with memory disorders",
            "“Recording therapy sessions could also be beneficial for memory-impaired individuals such as people who have suffered traumatic brain injuries or individuals with dementia,” Stuempfig said.",
            "If someone has severe challenges with memory, it may be useful to have a recording of a session, especially if it focused on implementing specific strategies to aid memory, Delawalla noted.",
            "“Or, if the therapist is using guided meditation or a progressive muscle relaxation script to treat anxiety, it would be beneficial to have a recording to be able to use the script between sessions,” she added.",
            "It may help with couples counseling",
            "Mayo noted that recording a session can also be beneficial in the context of couples or group counseling ― assuming you have the consent of your therapist and any other people in the session with you.",
            "“It can allow a client to see how they present in session especially with couples,” she said. “I have recorded sessions with the couple’s consent to show them how they verbally attack one another. Many times people do not realize how they speak or present until watching or hearing it played back on audio or video. Recording sessions can be used as a tool to teach effective skills such as communication, body language, and/or facial expressions.”"

            "It’s well known that lawmakers, Cabinet members and their families have secured millions of dollars in federal funds to support their own businesses through programs like the Paycheck Protection Program, the federal loan scheme set up to support struggling employers during the coronavirus pandemic.",
            "There’s just no way of really knowing when these high-ranking federal officials apply for the very government loans, subsidies or grants they had a hand in creating — and how much they’re getting. Outside of press reports and incomplete data reported by the Treasury Department and the Small Business Administration, there’s no law requiring those in government to disclose the federal funds they collect.",
            "Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Rep. Katie Porter (D-Calif.) want the data.",
            "On Wednesday, the two lawmakers proposed a bill to require members of Congress, high-ranking staff and those in the judicial and executive branches who apply for a financial benefit from the government to report it — the same way current law requires them to report the sale of a stock.",
            "“I think unfortunately many of my colleagues engage in this kind of corrupt activity and, whether it’s purposeful or negligent, it’s wrong and it needs to be clarified that they can’t be writing legislation and can’t be benefiting from legislation that readily undermines people’s faith in our democracy,” Gillibrand said in an interview. “It looks like self-dealing, and it looks like pocket lining.”",
            "The bill, provided exclusively to HuffPost in advance, would expand on the STOCK Act, a 2012 law that Gillibrand co-authored requiring high-ranking federal government officials to report equities, bonds, derivatives and mortgages bought and sold within a month. The STOCK Act, which passed with bipartisan support and was signed by President Barack Obama, was intended to catch government officials engaging in insider trading.",
            "But Gillibrand and Porter say the law didn’t go far enough to root out other forms of corruption. The STOCK Act 2.0, as they’re calling it, would expand the reporting requirements and also establish a public website, which would be searchable, downloadable and easily accessible, showing any federal benefits going toward these officials.",
            "“For the same reason that we have to disclose information about our income and our assets, for the same reason we have campaign finance disclosures, this is asking people the more important question, which is: Are you using your government position for the public interest or for you own self-interest?” Porter said in an interview.",
            "This has taken on particular relevance during the pandemic. As HuffPost’s Molly Redden reported, there have been 20-plus loans that have been linked to businesses with ties to lawmakers — and nearly all of them happened within the first round of funding for the program. The Paycheck Protection Program, which Congress created as part of its $2 trillion stimulus package passed in late March, ran out of money by mid-April, two weeks after launching, leaving hundreds of thousands of small businesses in the lurch until Congress voted to pass additional funding.",
            "But members of Congress didn’t seem to experience any delays in getting funds. On April 5, two days after the loan program got off the ground, Republican Rep. Kevin Hern’s group of McDonald’s franchises in Oklahoma secured a loan of $1 million to $2 million, and Rep. Vicki Hartzler (R-Mo.), who owns a tractor dealership with her husband, got a loan of between $350,000 and $1 million through the program.",
            "Within a week of the program launching, Rep. Vern Buchanan (R-Fla.), one of the top 10 wealthiest members of Congress, received a loan of between $2 million and $5 million for his car dealership. Democratic Rep. Susie Lee’s husband received $5.6 million through two PPP loans for casino and resort businesses in Nevada and Colorado after the SBA decided to extend the loans to the small gaming industry.",
            "Rep. Roger Williams (R-Texas), who is among the top 20 wealthiest members of Congress, secured a loan of between $1 million and $2 million. In a congressional hearing Tuesday with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Williams referred to himself “as somebody on Main Street” and said the “economy is pretty good right now, and it’s getting better.”",
            "“Roger Williams... was telling Secretary Mnuchin and Federal Reserve Chair [Jerome] Powell that small businesses are doing fine. Well, maybe yours is doing fine because you got a PPP loan while a whole bunch of other small businesses struggled to,” Porter, who sits on the House Financial Services Committee, told HuffPost, responding to Williams. “It also distorts members’ understanding of what it’s like to be an American trying to get help from these programs — how hard it can be to get through the application process.”",
            "The economy hasn’t gotten better for many. Though unemployment claims have slowed since hitting historic highs in late March and April, tens of millions of Americans remain on unemployment assistance and the pandemic continues to take a toll on working-class Americans. Small businesses continue to close in the thousands. In an Economic Impact Report from Yelp, 163,735 businesses indicated they’ve closed as of the end of August — nearly 100,000 of which have reported they will not be reopening.",
            "Porter has been out front in calling for the Treasury Department and SBA to release full data on who has applied for PPP loans, and exactly how much they’re getting. But the Treasury Department has been reluctant to do so; Mnuchin has argued the details are private information. Instead, the department released the names of recipients and a range of loan amounts they received, from $150,000 up to $10 million.",
            "The STOCK Act 2.0, doesn’t stop at the coronavirus relief efforts. It includes any government program that distributes a benefit of value, such as subsidies or government contracts.",
            "In 2017, the Environmental Working Group found that more than 30 lawmakers from both parties and their immediate family members collected upward of $15 million in federal farming subsidies, while farm bill negotiations were ongoing. Because of a lack of disclosure requirements, it’s impossible to know which members also collected crop insurance subsidies.",
            "Gillibrand wants to be clear that the intent is not to prevent government officials from benefiting from federal funds altogether.",
            "“If you’re doing it for good honest reasons — you have had a family farm for generations and would normally get subsidies — that’s not the kind of corrupt activity we’re looking for,” she said. “We’re looking for activity that is unfair, that is taking advantage of a position they have.”",
            "“The intention of the legislation is to create transparency... so voters can decide whether their activities are corrupt or not,” Gillibrand added.",
            "The fight to get more transparency around the financial dealings of elected officials, their administrations and their close aides is certainly not new to Congress. Richard Painter, who served as the chief White House ethics lawyer under President George W. Bush, said this is one measure that’s part of a much larger problem, including elected officials owning individual stocks and Trump’s refusal to separate from his own businesses.",
            "“Now, all they do is require you to disclose that you own the company and then the company can roam around the place, apply for federal government loans or money from Vladimir Putin. We don’t know what they get,” Painter said. “I would kick them off their individual stocks, I wouldn’t kick them off their family farms, but we ought to at least be aware of the conflict of interest.”",
            "Painter added, “President Trump talks about Jefferson and Washington talking about their big plantations and farms and somehow that’s not a conflict, but of course it was. They used slave labor. It was a tragic conflict for our country. These financial conflicts have real consequences for our government.”",
            "The original STOCK Act drew bipartisan support. But this revamped proposal does not have Republican support yet. Gillibrand said, however, that she expects to see Republicans get on board."

The result ― almost every Netflix Film “looks good,” but actually isn’t.",

            "To keep things simple, I also excluded Young Adult and foreign language films, as those tend to get reviewed on an extreme curve. Arguably, documentaries also get this special review treatment (any decent documentary receives near-automatic widespread high praise).

            "For almost 30 years on the Supreme Court, Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a vocal defender of abortion rights, framing the question of reproductive choice as one of gender equality. “This is something central to a woman’s life, to her dignity,” she said at her 1993 confirmation hearing. “When government controls that decision for her, she’s being treated as less than a fully adult human responsible for her own choices.”",
            "That position guided her voting record up to her last reproductive rights case, which she participated in from her hospital bed in May. She used her voice, while weak, to castigate the Trump administration for undermining comprehensive birth control coverage.",
            "Ginsburg’s reliable liberal vote on abortion rights is now gone. In her absence, Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court decision that established a constitutional right to abortion, is expected to be contested. The future of legal abortion in the U.S. is facing its greatest threat in decades.",
            "HuffPost spoke with Mary Ziegler, a professor at Florida State University and author of “Abortion and the Law in America: Roe v. Wade to the Present,” about the looming confirmation battle to replace Ginsburg and what might come next.",
            "What do you expect to happen to abortion rights if a new conservative justice is confirmed?",
            "It depends who the nominee is. The two front-runners at the moment are Barbara Lagoa of the 11th circuit and Amy Coney Barrett. Lagoa doesn’t have as long of a record on abortion, which may make her the less likely choice. She could alienate social conservatives who share Sen. Josh Hawley’s angst. [Note: The Missouri lawmaker said in June that he would only vote to confirm Supreme Court nominees who say Roe v. Wade was wrongly decided.] Barrett, by contrast, would be expected to be a vote against Roe. She has been more openly pro-life than most current members of the court, including the conservative members, so we have reason to think that she’s skeptical of Roe.",
            "The question is, what would adding someone like her mean in terms of the balance of the court? The most immediate effect would be to change who the swing vote is on abortion. At the moment, the swing vote is Chief Justice John Roberts. Roberts has been more likely to vote with the liberals than any of his conservative colleagues. As we’ve seen, while he is willing to rewrite and even undo precedent when it comes to abortion, he also has concerns about going too far, too soon. [Note: Roberts recently voted with the liberals in June Medical Services v. Russo to strike down an anti-abortion law in Louisiana, but left open the door to upholding future restrictions.]",
            "Roberts has almost tied himself to the mast about this idea of precedent. It doesn’t mean he won’t overturn Roe or Casey. [Note: Planned Parenthood v. Casey established that states can regulate abortion as long as they don’t impose an “undue burden” on those seeking the procedure.] But for him to explain why Casey should go after writing an opinion about his commitment to precedent would be hard.",
            "The most likely swing vote on abortion would probably become Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Of the conservative dissenters in June Medical, Kavanaugh was the only one who was not prepared to say Louisiana’s law was fine. He wanted to send the case back to the lower court for more facts. He seems to share Roberts’ concerns about the court’s reputation. Having Kavanaugh as the swing would likely mean that the court would go further, faster in upholding abortion restrictions and moving toward the overruling of Roe, but maybe not that fast.",
            "How important was Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the issue of abortion rights?",
            "Ginsburg’s influence was significant because she helped articulate the idea that abortion was not just a question of autonomy and privacy and bodily integrity, but also of equality for women. She was the most concerned about the foundations that Roe laid for abortion rights, and the most invested in creating a better foundation.",
            "While she was certainly the most powerful voice [on abortion rights], she was maybe not the most influential voice, because a lot of our actual abortion jurisprudence was a function of compromise reached by the justices in the middle, like Sandra Day O’Connor and Anthony Kennedy and David Souter.",
            "In her absence, who will step into the role of defending abortion rights?",
            "Justice Stephen Breyer has written a lot of important opinions on abortion in recent years, but his abortion jurisprudence is very facts-driven. He digs into the sometimes spurious claims that legislators make in justifying abortion restrictions, and it’s his specialty to write about what’s wrong with those claims. So while that’s a version of writing about equality, it’s not really high-level constitutional theory. Sonia Sotomayor is a possibility, she’s done that in other areas of the law. Elena Kagan is probably the one of the savviest strategists on the court, not just among the liberals. And so you would expect her if you’re talking about abortion and equality to be framing it in a way that’s designed to consolidate some kind of majority. In that way, that’s Ginsburg’s legacy. Ginsburg was not, even as an attorney, just interested in being right but also interested in getting the votes. She was quite savvy about that and Kagan is too.",
            "Can you describe the anti-abortion movement’s legal strategy to overturn Roe, and do you think their approach will change now?",
            "There have been two parallel strategies. One is to push more absolute restrictions in the hope that the court will move quickly — we see this in the campaign for heartbeat bills. [Note: So-called “heartbeat bills” outlaw abortion at around six weeks of pregnancy, before many women even know they are expecting.]",
            "The more sophisticated players are still moving more cautiously. They favor cases that will limit abortion access dramatically, but more incrementally than an outright ban. This includes laws banning dilation and evacuation, the most common procedure after the first trimester, limiting access to medication abortion, banning abortion at 15 or 20 weeks, and prohibiting abortion for certain reasons, such as in cases of race, sex or disability.",
            "Moving incrementally will still make sense in the near term. But these incremental restrictions could have a major impact, both symbolically and in practical terms. Many could give states the power to introduce some kind of ban before viability for the first time since Roe. Others could put the most common or safe abortion technique for a particular group of patients out of reach.",
            "I don’t think this is coming soon, but if enough conservative justices were added to the court, we might get to the point where anti-abortion lawyers seriously think about arguing that there’s a right to life. Not just that there is no right to abortion, but that the Constitution protects fetal life. Then you’d be talking about abortion being illegal in New York as well as Alabama.",
            "How worried are you personally about Roe getting overturned at this point?",
            "I mean, certainly more than I was. It’s worth noting that there are other members of the liberal wing of the court who are older. If you had two more conservative nominees, which is a possibility depending on the results of the 2020 election, that would make the overruling of Roe even more likely.",
            "For the most part, Justice Clarence Thomas has been the lone clear voice for the overturning of Roe. If you add one more conservative justice, that might not be true. Neil Gorsuch has hinted that he thinks that way, but he usually hasn’t been as willing to join Thomas, or at least be as clear about what he thinks. If you had enough conservative justices added to the court, and one more very conservative justice on abortion, it would certainly push things in this direction.",
            "You might begin to see the consolidation of a clear demand to overturn Roe. That’s important because then you would have more pressure from the right on the conservative justices in the middle, like Kavanaugh or Roberts. But long story short, even one more conservative puts Roe in much more serious jeopardy than it is now."

            "With just weeks to go before the 2020 presidential election, the Justice Department is once again attacking elected Democratic officials, this time by designating New York City, Seattle, and Portland, Oregon, as “anarchist jurisdictions” and suggesting their federal funding may be in question.",
            "The Justice Department, responding to a memo from President Donald Trump that attacked all three cities, said the cities have “permitted violence and destruction of property to persist and have refused to undertake reasonable measures to counteract criminal activities.” The news was leaked early to the conservative-leaning New York Post.",
            "“When state and local leaders impede their own law enforcement officers and agencies from doing their jobs, it endangers innocent citizens who deserve to be protected, including those who are trying to peacefully assemble and protest,” Attorney General William Barr said in a statement. “We cannot allow federal tax dollars to be wasted when the safety of the citizenry hangs in the balance. It is my hope that the cities identified by the Department of Justice today will reverse course and become serious about performing the basic function of government and start protecting their own citizens.”",
            "Under Trump’s memo, the director of the Office of Management and Budget is now supposed to “issue guidance to the heads of agencies on restricting eligibility of or otherwise disfavoring, to the maximum extent permitted by law, anarchist jurisdictions in the receipt of Federal grants that the agency has sufficient lawful discretion to restrict or otherwise disfavor anarchist jurisdictions from receiving.”",
            "Any such decision would undoubtedly be challenged in court, which would likely push the process past the presidential election. So for now, the primary impact of the designations will be political.",
            "The Justice Department took an aggressive posture against the demonstrations that have unfolded across the United States in the months since George Floyd’s death, often targeting defendants whose conduct was already in violation of state law.",
            "DOJ’s press release on the designations names New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler, Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, all of whom are Democrats.",
            "“This is just another one of President Trump’s games,” de Blasio said Monday. “It’s part of his campaign strategy ... It’s insulting to the people of New York City and his effort to withhold our funding is unconstitutional.”",
            "News stories have also indicated that Trump administration officials at the Justice Department were considering charges against certain mayors for their response to unrest in their cities. Justice Department spokesperson Kerri Kupec told The Associated Press last week that DOJ had done research about whether it could bring criminal or civil rights charges against city officials in Portland. It is unusual for the Justice Department to publicly suggest elected officials were potentially engaged in criminal conduct unless they are bringing charges, though Kupec didn’t specify which officials DOJ has considered charging. Kupec did not respond to HuffPost’s inquiries on the topic.",
            "The Justice Manual that guides actions by Justice Department officials states that “DOJ generally will not confirm the existence of or otherwise comment about ongoing investigations,” and that “DOJ personnel shall not respond to questions about the existence of an ongoing investigation or comment on its nature or progress before charges are publicly filed.”",
            "A 2012 memo from then-Attorney General Eric Holder stated that Justice Department employees must work at “safeguarding the Department’s reputation for fairness, neutrality, and nonpartisanship.”",
            "“Simply put, politics must play no role in the decisions of federal investigators or prosecutors regarding any investigations or criminal charges,” Holder’s memo stated. “Law enforcement officers and prosecutors may never select the timing of investigative steps or criminal charges for the purpose of affecting any election, or for the purposes of giving an advantage or disadvantage to any candidate or political party.”",
            "The Justice Department has also gone after four Democratic governors for their response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division sent letters tied to their authority under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, which applies to jails and prisons as well as public nursing homes. While only a small percentage of America’s nursing homes are publicly run, one official hinted at much broader implications, writing that the tens of thousands of people who died of COVID in New Jersey and New York “deserve to have an investigation to determine if their Governors are responsible for their deaths.”"

            "On Monday, the three-time Grammy winner returned to television for the first in-studio episode of “The Kelly Clarkson Show” in six months. In her opening monologue, she told the audience ― who were beamed in virtually ― that her year so far has been a “dumpster fire.”",
            "“As you probably know, 2020 has brought a lot of change also to my personal life,” Clarkson said. “Definitely didn’t see anything coming that came, but what I’m dealing with is hard — it involves more than just my heart, it involves a lot of little hearts.”",
            "The Texas native filed for divorce from Blackstock in June, citing irreconcilable differences, though their separation date reportedly remains listed as TBD. The couple married in 2013 and share a 6-year-old daughter, River Rose, and a 4-year-old son, Remington Alexander. Clarkson is also a stepmom to Blackstock’s daughter Savannah, 18, and son Seth, 13, from his previous marriage to Melissa Ashworth.",
            "On Monday’s show, Clarkson said she and Blackstock both grew up in divorced families ― which is why they feel particularly guarded about how they discuss the split publicly and with their kids.",
            "“We know the best thing here is to protect our children and their little hearts,” the singer said. “I’m usually very open and I usually talk about everything, but in this case I will talk a little bit here and there about how it affects me personally, but probably won’t go too far into it because I’m a mama bear and my kids come first.”",
            "It’s only in recent weeks that Clarkson has begun to address the split publicly. In an interview with “Sunday Today” on Sept. 13, the singer shared that she had been relying on close friends for support. And she told the Los Angeles Times that same week that she can’t “truly be open” about the breakup for the sake of her family.",
            "On the flip side, Clarkson said Monday that she has already channeled many of those raw emotions into music, adding that fans can look forward to some new tunes in the near future.",
            "“My mom told me to start writing and that’s actually how I get my feelings out,” she said. “That’s how I became a songwriter. Music has always been my outlet to help me get through difficult times, and this year I’ve been listening to a lot of music and I’ve also been writing a lot of music as well.”"

            "In March, when Congress allocated $1 billion dollars from its first coronavirus relief package to go to the U.S. Department of Defense, the expectation was that the funds would be spent on essential medical supplies needed for the department to help combat the deadly disease. At the time ― and even now ― the United States was facing a shortage of critical items like N95 masks. A new Washington Post report, however, reveals the Trump administration gave a majority of the Pentagon’s billion-dollar coronavirus aid package to defense contractors to make things like Army uniforms, body armor and jet engine parts.",
            "The report comes on the same day the U.S. surpassed 200,000 coronavirus deaths, the most of any nation, according to Johns Hopkins University.",
            "Congress allocated the $1 billion in coronavirus aid for the Department of Defense in March to “prevent, prepare for, and respond to coronavirus.” But The Washington Post report revealed hundreds of millions of dollars from that fund was given to companies the DOD pays for shipbuilding, including the multibillion-dollar companies Rolls-Royce and ArcelorMittal.",
            "The report also notes $80 million was awarded to a Kansas company that makes plane parts — air travel has slowed during the pandemic, and the company had already suffered from the nationwide grounding of Boeing 737 Max planes, a widely defective model.",
            "On Tuesday afternoon, Democratic Representatives Barbara Lee (Calif.) and Mark Pocan (Wis.) said the Pentagon’s use of coronavirus aid for defense contractors is “unconscionable and should be investigated fully and prosecuted if warranted.”",
            "In all, the report found at least one-third of the companies the Trump administration paid with the coronavirus medical supply funds had already been given loans through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) Congress established for struggling businesses. PPP loans, distributed by the Treasury Department and Small Business Administration and designed as an incentive for small business owners to keep employees on payroll during the pandemic, have been found to be unevenly distributed. A May survey showed that nonwhite business owners were largely neglected by the program, and a lawsuit alleges that banks giving out the loans favored larger businesses. Reports on the pandemic’s economic impact show that large percentages of nonwhite business owners had to close their companies as the economy tanked under the weight of the pandemic.",
            "Trump has publicly downplayed the impact of coronavirus since early this year, calling the virus a “hoax” contrived by the Democratic Party in February. He has publicly opposed widespread testing and he has undermined health officials’ recommendations that Americans wear masks out of concern that acknowledging the virus will harm him politically. In March, while states were pleading with the administration for help supplying strapped hospitals with critical supplies, Trump suggested they didn’t need it.",
            "“How do you go from using 10,000 to 20,000 [masks] to 300,000?” Trump asked during a March press briefing. “Something’s going on. Where are the masks going, are they going out the back door?”",
            "The Post report reveals Trump’s administration had already been working to redirect medical supply funds to defense contractors when Trump uttered those comments publicly on March 29.",

            "During a private interview in February, Trump acknowledged that coronavirus posed a threat to public health: “You just breathe the air and that’s how it’s passed.”",
            "“It’s also more deadly than even your strenuous flus,” Trump added, before admitting he’d always planned to downplay the impact of the virus.",

            "One of the biggest bankrollers of this pseudoscience outfit is Greg Gianforte, the 2020 Republican nominee for governor. Through his family foundation, the millionaire technology entrepreneur donated at least $290,000 to the museum.",
            "Gianforte is a first-term Republican congressman from Montana who infamously body-slammed a reporter on the eve of the state’s special election in 2017. Gianforte pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor assault charge, and a judge gave him a six-month deferred sentence and ordered him to pay a $385 fine, perform community service and attend anger management counseling.",
            "Gianforte rejects evolution and dismisses the scientific consensus that humans are the primary drivers of global climate change. More recently, the supporter of President Donald Trump promoted the idea that so-called “herd immunity” — when enough of a population becomes immune to a disease that it can no longer spread effectively — is the solution to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.",
            "Gianforte said in a July 1 webcast that he received “encouraging” news from Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the former head of the Food and Drug Administration, that “by the end of this year, at current infection rates, if we do nothing, we will have built sufficient herd immunity that will stop the expansion of the COVID.” Gianforte made similar comments in a separate remote town hall that same day. Gottlieb has since said the U.S is “probably a long way from herd immunity.”",
            "Achieving herd immunity without a vaccine requires mass COVID-19 infection, which would likely result in at least 1 million deaths in the U.S and other unknown consequences. One Montana health expert warned such an approach would lead to at least 10,000 deaths in just his state.",
            "Asked for comment, a representative of Gianforte’s campaign who identified only as a “press intern,” said, “HuffPo is not an objective news organization.

Thanks for reaching out, but we’re not participating in your story or your coverage of this race.

            "Gianforte’s “unwillingness to follow basic science” on the coronavirus, climate change and evolution “is nothing short of disqualifying,” Cooney’s campaign spokeswoman Ronja Abel told HuffPost via email. “Montanans simply can’t trust a man who believes dinosaurs walked the Earth with humans to lead our state through a once-in-a-lifetime public health emergency,” she added.",
            "Montana Public Radio asked Gianforte three times during his 2017 congressional campaign if he believed in the scientific consensus that species evolved over time through the process of natural selection.",

            "Pressed again, Gianforte said, “I think I’ve answered your question.”",
            "On climate change, Gianforte has resorted to a favorite talking point of climate contrarians. “The climate has been changing for millennia,” he said in letters to at least two constituents. “Over the last few decades, the Earth has been getting warmer. While the climate is changing, we still do not know how much of that change is due to human activities.”",
            "An ever-growing, all-but-irrefutable body of scientific research shows that climate change is driven by human carbon emissions. A federal climate report released by the Trump administration in 2017, for example, concluded that “it is extremely likely that human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases, are the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.”",
            "Gianforte also faced recent criticism for his support of Turning Point USA, the right-wing student nonprofit founded by Charlie Kirk, who spread numerous conspiracy theories about the coronavirus. He was briefly banned from Twitter earlier this year for falsely claiming that hydroxychloroquine is “100% effective” against the virus. Gianforte spoke alongside Kirk at a Turning Point USA event in Montana last year.",
            "In April, Montana’s attorney general and then-Republican gubernatorial candidate Tim Fox accused Gianforte of insider trading on the coronavirus by investing in the manufacturer of hydroxychloroquine. Gianforte disputed the claim.",

            "This election cycle, Gianforte donated to at least two anti-vaccine candidates for state office, according to state campaign data. He gave the maximum $180 to state Rep. Theresa Manzella (R-Hamilton), who sponsored two failed anti-vaccine bills, one of which would have eliminated nearly all immunization requirements for children in day care. Manzella is now running for Montana state Senate.",
            "Gianforte also gave $180 to Jolene Crum, a GOP candidate for a state House seat north of Bozeman. Crum wrote on her website that vaccines must be voluntary and that she believes without any evidence that “Bill Gates is pressuring governmental leaders to keep things weird until his vaccine is ready to create a must-comply policy with vaccination.”"

Since millions of people will vote by mail, constraints on time and resources will slow ballot counting into potentially a weeks-long process. Voting patterns suggest it’s likely that President Donald Trump could end Election Day in the lead in certain key states, only to be overtaken by Democratic opponent Joe Biden when more votes are tallied.",
            "This could create a nightmare scenario during the three months stretching from Election Day to the Jan. 20 inauguration: a battle on the state and congressional level over who is the legitimate winner. This could include Congress reconvening on Jan. 6, presided over by Vice President Mike Pence, with no consensus over its potential role in choosing the next president.",
            "This is arguably the most likely of the contested-election narratives, and now the Supreme Court — which would likely have to rule on the legal arcana at issue in this epic battle — has been thrown into its own nightmare scenario with the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.",
            "Trump is already setting the stage to declare that anything but a victory for himself means the election is rigged. His penchant for conspiracism and open contempt for American democracy, combined with this procedural confusion, could lead to a genuine democratic crisis. That may not lead to the sort of authoritarian takeover that some, such as Trump’s former top political adviser Roger Stone, have dreamed of. But Trump could use the courts, along with Republican allies at the state level and in Congress, to cling to power.",

He has made numerous unsupported claims about how the only way he could lose his election is if it is rigged against him. And so, he’s been actively casting doubt on the election process and creating the conditions where I think both sides believe the other side is primed to steal the election.”",

Election officials in many states are underfunded and under-resourced, and in some by law are not allowed to begin counting ballots until Election Day.",
            "Polling and absentee ballot request data from some states show that Democratic voters are far more likely to cast their ballots via the mail during the coronavirus pandemic and that Republicans are more inclined to vote in-person. In Pennsylvania, for example, 70% of all absentee ballot requests were made by registered Democrats, as of Sept. 14.",
            "A dynamic known as the “Blue Shift” already has shown that ballots counted after an election day tend to favor Democratic candidates, as their voters are more likely to cast provisional ballots in-person or return their absentee ballots closer to the receipt deadline.",
            "Combine the existing “Blue Shift” with the pandemic-induced jump in absentee voting and it becomes clear that a great divergence could emerge between the Nov. 3 returns and the actual final tally when late-arriving absentee and provisional ballots are counted. Trump could easily go to bed with a lead in key states based on an incomplete tally on election night and wake up to see that lead eroding based on the totally normal counting of valid ballots ― a “red mirage,” as one political consultant called it in an interview with Axios.",
            "“It’s easy to see those normal corrections and calibrations that happen after Election Day being fodder for conspiracy theorists like Trump,” Hasen said.",
            "This nightmare scenario continues as lawsuits are filed by both parties over which votes should or should not be counted. But as the late-counted ballots begin to turn the three key Rust Belt states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin in Biden’s favor, Trump can be expected to declare the whole vote-counting process illegitimate.",
            "Perhaps some irregularities will occur ― a high number of rejected ballots due to normal voter errors, or maybe too many of Trump’s voters try to vote twice, as he has encouraged, something he could point to as election fraud. But Trump could also call the election tainted even if there is no reason to do so ― a notably disturbing possibility.",
            "“There is this risk that the parties start fighting over the vote tallies even when there’s no problem with the vote tallies,” said Ned Foley, an election law expert at Ohio State University’s Moritz College of Law who wrote a paper in 2019 about this exact scenario. “We could see a situation where they’re fighting even when the system is working properly.”",
            "Trump has already prepared for this potential situation. He says mailing ballots to voters is “unfair.” He boasts, without evidence, that the 2020 election will be “INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT,” and “the most rigged election in history.” Foreign governments will “forge” mailed ballots, he asserts, again without foundation. “People that aren’t citizens, illegals, anybody that walks in California is gonna get a ballot,” he tweets, incorrectly.",
            "And he has set a bar for when the outcome is declared. “Must know Election results on the night of the Election, not days, months, or even years later!” Trump tweeted in July.",
            "This is just an update of what Trump said in 2018 after the Florida Senate race came down to ballots counted after Election Day. “An honest vote count is no longer possible-ballots massively infected. Must go with Election Night!” Trump declared. (Republican challenger Rick Scott prevailed over Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson in that race.)",
            "Assuming Trump exhausts legal avenues in the courts, the scenario continues. Trump says, “Must go with Election Night,” again.",
            "Since Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin ― as well as North Carolina ― have divided government with Democratic governors and GOP-controlled legislatures, Trump calls on Republicans in those legislatures to stop votes from being counted and to certify him the winner of their electoral votes ahead of the scheduled Electoral College vote on Dec. 14. They bend to his request, citing Article II of the Constitution and early examples in U.S. history of state legislatures certifying electors to justify their action, and announce that they view the “blue shift” as evidence of fraud ― even if there has been nothing fraudulent about it.",
            "Meanwhile, the state courts and Democratic governors of these states certify the final vote total for Biden and his electors, declaring that the approval of Trump electors by the GOP-controlled legislatures is unconstitutional. Two sets of electors ― one for Trump, the other for Biden ― are sent to Congress.",
            "The Precedent",
            "American presidential elections are oddly not decided by which candidate receives the most votes. Instead, each state is apportioned a number of electoral votes based on its number of senators and representatives ― the lowest number being three and the highest being California, with 55. When a candidate wins a given state, it is a slate of electors that is being approved by the popular vote.",
            "Elections rarely end with the winner of the overall popular vote and electoral vote diverging. It happened three times in the 19th century and twice in the 21st. But it’s been more than a century since an election ended with a dispute in Congress over competing slates of electors.",
            "In 2000, the disputed election of Republican George W. Bush over Democrat Al Gore, determined by a margin of 537 votes in Florida, never moved outside of a fight within the state because the Supreme Court halted the recount.",
            "“If you thought Bush vs. Gore was an anxiety-provoking dispute, the kind that jumps the state boundaries and goes to the Congress is a much bigger deal,” Foley said.",
            "The last time multiple slates of electors were sent to Congress does not provide much help in how it could be sorted out in 2020. The disputed 1876 election between Republican Rutherford Hayes and Democrat Samuel Tilden came down to who won Florida, Louisiana, Oregon and South Carolina. Complicating matters, the three former Confederate states ― Florida, Louisiana and South Carolina ― sent two separate slates of electors to Congress. At the time, Congress was split between Democrats, who controlled the House of Representatives, and Republicans, who controlled the Senate.",
            "As one would expect to happen in the hyper-partisan post-Civil War environment, Democrats in the House affirmed the Tilden electors and Republicans accepted the Hayes electors. An argument ensued over which body got to choose, based on each chamber’s preferred interpretation of the Constitution’s 12th Amendment (which was enacted after the disputed election of 1800 to clarify the process of electing the president and vice president).",
            "The 12th Amendment, unfortunately, didn’t have anything to say about the 1876 impasse. The two chambers eventually decided to appoint a commission made up of 15 members ― five each from the House, Senate and Supreme Court. The end result was the Compromise of 1877, which handed Hayes the presidency in exchange for him pulling federal troops out of the former Confederacy, leaving formerly enslaved Blacks to fend for themselves against white terrorism and a new system of racial apartheid. The resolution did not occur until two days before Inauguration Day (which then was in early March).",
            "In response to this barely averted constitutional crisis, Congress enacted the Electoral Count Act of 1887 in an attempt to formalize procedures for how Congress should handle future Electoral College disputes. But the law, like so many other late-19th century laws, was poorly written, cryptic in its meaning and riddled with ambiguities and inconsistencies. Even today, scholars cannot agree on a shared reading of the law. And that hazy law will undergird the entire process by which Biden or Trump would ultimately prevail in the nightmare scenario.",
            "The Process",
            "Congress has a clearly defined role in accepting the results of a presidential election. Both congressional chambers will meet on Jan. 6 in a session presided over by the President of the Senate, who at that point will remain Vice President Mike Pence. His job is to open the certifications from each state in alphabetical order, which are then read aloud by “tellers.” He will then ask whether members of Congress have any objections to the submitted slate of electors ― objections that must be made by at least one House member and one Senate member.",
            "In general, objections aren’t made ― lawmakers are supposed to do so only if they believe a state’s submission of electors was corrupted in some way. It’s not unprecedented, however: In 2005, then-Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones (D-Ohio) and then-Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) objected to Ohio’s certification of electors for Bush’s reelection win over Democrat John Kerry. The House and Senate then separated to their respective chambers for two hours of debate before both voted down the objection. In both 2001 and 2017, Democrats in the House attempted to object to the submission of certain state electors, but were not joined by a senator.",
            "If Congress is faced with multiple competing slates of electors ― such as a set certified by a Democratic governor based on a popular vote for Biden and one certified by GOP state legislators for Trump ― matters become more complicated. Near-total agreement exists that if both chambers of Congress vote in favor of one of the two competing slates, that one will be the slate accepted. The problem emerges if the House and the Senate split on which slate to accept.",
            "The predominant view among legal experts is that the law requires Congress to accept the electors certified by the governor. This is the interpretation affirmed in a report by the National Task Force on Election Crises, a cross-partisan ad hoc group of experts across a range of disciplines related to elections.",
            "But there are dissenting opinions. A handful of scholars, including one writing for the Congressional Research Service, interpret the law as nullifying the electors of a state that submits competing slates if Congress cannot agree to accept one of them. Even if legally dubious, that could be enough to nullify electors of a given state if a Republican-controlled Senate adopts this interpretation.",
            "If a divided Congress were to go down this path, two potential scenarios could result ― each with potential for chaos.",
            "In the case where Congress nullifies the electors of a given state or multiple states, neither Trump nor Biden may meet the necessary threshold of 270 electoral votes to win the presidency. This would throw the election to the House of Representatives, where each state delegation would vote for the president.",
            "The candidate who wins the most state delegation votes would become president. As of now, Republicans have a majority in 26 state delegations, Democrats control 22 and two ― Michigan and Pennsylvania ― are evenly divided. That would, most likely, hand the election to Trump, though the outcome of this year’s House races could change the math.",
            "Alternately, a Democratic-controlled House could pull out of the electoral vote count after rejecting any effort by a Republican-controlled Senate to nullify a state’s electors or appoint electors for Trump. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) could declare that the chamber will only accept the electors certified by governors, based on a full vote that includes late-arriving absentee ballots.",
            "If the Senate refuses to agree, Pelosi could then say that since Congress has not approved a White House winner, that kickstarts the 20th Amendment that details what happens when there is no president-elect. Pelosi ranks as next in line after Trump and Pence, and she could say that she would serve as acting president starting on Jan. 20, when the first term for the GOP duo expires.",
            "All of this could be adjudicated by the Supreme Court ― which could soon hold a 6-3 conservative majority if Republicans appoint a new Trump nominee before the inauguration of a president. If not, though, it would create an existential crisis.",
            "“That’s a genuine constitutional crisis,” Foley said. “Because if that is protracted all the way to noon on Jan. 20 ― we know President Trump’s first term ends on Jan. 20 ― and then the military needs to know who gets the nuclear codes, starting at noon, who’s the new commander in chief?”",
            "Whether the parties end up in such a situation will be heavily influenced by the actions of Trump, as well as the demands of protesters in the street.",
            "During the 2000 recount in Florida, Republican operatives contrived protests, including the infamous Brooks Brothers Riot, to pressure state election officials to stop counting ballots. Democrats have already said they will not cede protest activity to the GOP, as they did in 2000.",
            "But right-wing protests that have emerged in support of Trump during his term in office don’t look like the work of astroturfing staffers dressed in the attire of the White Anglo-Saxon Protestant elite. He has the backing of a broad network of heavily-armed militia groups, far-right street-fighting gangs, white supremacists and a pseudo-religious cult that believes Trump is a demigod operating in secret to prevent the apocalypse.",
            "Trump has primed these supporters to potentially reject the election results with his false statements about voter fraud and absentee voting. He also routinely celebrates violence against his opponents, casting them as subversive, alien threats to the American way of life. The Republican National Convention featured a married couple as primetime speakers solely because they pointed guns at a peaceful protest that they imagined threatened their property. The calls for violence coming from some Trump supporters, such as Stone and disgraced Health and Human Services official Michael Caputo, likely will only increase as the election draws closer.",
            "Public pressure, including violence in the streets, could push reluctant Republicans in power to yield to Trump’s most wild demands, even if he has no legitimate case to question the election.",
            "It Was All A Dream",
            "Such an election meltdown nightmare that could paralyze the nation remains an edge-case scenario.",
            "It requires a massive confluence of factors in which many different actors with different political and personal desires follow Trump’s chaotic lead. Republican state legislatures may choose to not fulfill a Trump request to certify electors. Senate Republicans may choose not to accept those electors.",
            "A state-level version of this scenario occurred in Kentucky in 2019 when then-Gov. Matt Bevin, a Trump-endorsed Republican, declared that he only lost to Democrat Andy Beshear due to voter fraud in “urban areas,” an accusation the incumbent made up out of whole cloth. Bevin called on the Republican-controlled Legislature to overrule the election and install him in power, which GOP leaders considered. But after Bevin failed to produce any evidence of voter fraud, these Republicans, along with U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), refused to accede to his bid.",
            "Democrats could simply win control of the incoming Senate in November’s vote, smothering this entire scenario early on. The Supreme Court could settle any number of questions, from disputed vote counts to the proper interpretation of the Electoral Count Act ― although any potential court ruling on these topics now leans more in Trump’s favor after Ginsburg’s death. Or the election could be outside the margin of cheating.",
            "“The most likely scenario is still: The election takes place and we have a winner and it’s clear and that’s that,” Hasen said. “But, you know, there’s a non-negligible chance of a meltdown like this.”",
            "The election results may very well be known the night of the election. For instance, Florida allows officials to canvass absentee ballots ahead of Election Day, meaning the state’s results will be known much faster than those in the three Rust Belt states on which the nightmare scenario likely hinges. If Biden wins Florida, the biggest electoral-vote prize among the closest swing states, he has almost certainly won the presidency.",
            "In the end, it may come down to whether a higher power answers the Election Administrator’s Prayer, a pithy saying passed down from election to election by the people who run them. In November 2000, the director of the National Association of Election Officials provided his version of the prayer in a USA Today report that explained how machines help to tabulate and count votes: “God, please let the winner win in a landslide.”",
            "But God didn’t answer the prayer that time."

The real Ginsburg made a cameo at the end of the movie.",
            "“Ruth Bader Ginsburg gave us hope, a public figure who stood for integrity and justice — a responsibility she did not wear lightly,” Jones said, according to People. “She will be missed not only as a beacon of light in these difficult times but for her razor-sharp wit and extraordinary humanity.

            "WASHINGTON (AP) — A military whistleblower says federal officials sought some unusual crowd control devices — including one that’s been called a “heat ray” — to deal with protesters outside the White House on the June day that law enforcement forcibly cleared Lafayette Square.",
            "In written responses to questions from a House committee, National Guard Maj. Adam DeMarco said the Defense Department’s lead military police officer for the National Capital Region sent an email asking if the D.C. National Guard possessed a long-range acoustic device — used to transmit loud noises — or an “Active Denial System,” the so-called heat ray.",
            "DeMarco said he responded that the Guard was not in possession of either device. National Public Radio and The Washington Post first reported DeMarco’s testimony.",
            "Use of either the acoustic device or the Active Denial System would have been a significant escalation of crowd control for the Guard members, particularly since the Defense officials ordered that the Guard troops not be armed when they went into D.C.",
            "Law enforcement personnel were armed. And although active-duty military troops were sent to the region, they remained at bases outside the District in case they were needed but never actually entered the District.",
            "The Active Denial System was developed by the military nearly two decades ago, and was unveiled to the public around 2007. It’s not clear that it’s ever actually been used in combat, although there are reports it has deployed.",
            "The system, which emits a directed beam of energy that causes a burning heat sensation, was considered a non-lethal way to control crowds, particularly when it may be difficult to tell the enemy from innocent civilians in war zones. Use of the device appeared to stall amid questions about whether it actually caused more serious injuries or burns than initially thought.",
            "The Long Range Acoustic Device, also called a sound cannon, sends out loud messages or sounds and has been used by law enforcement to disperse crowds. The U.S. military has, in recent years, ordered the LRAD for the Navy’s Military Sealift Command to be used by ships to hail or warn other vessels.",

DeMarco’s lawyer sent his answers to the committee on Aug. 28; NPR posted the document online Wednesday.",

            "A virtual film festival is a strange thing. There’s none of the usual fanfare. No directors introducing their movies to packed auditoriums, no industry hobnobbing, no tangible momentum for what would have been the launch of another typical awards season. Those of us covering the Toronto International Film Festival over the past week have done so from our computers, streaming titles that would otherwise be seen on a big screen. Without the energy of an audience, it almost feels like the event didn’t happen at all.",
            "And yet it did, with 50 features on the lineup instead of the usual 300. A few of them have already seen glory, like “Bruised,” Halle Berry’s directorial debut, which reportedly sold to Netflix for a hefty $20 million. The Frances McDormand drama “Nomadland,” meanwhile, generated some of the year’s best reviews, as did Spike Lee’s concert film “David Byrne’s American Utopia.” Even in a year as off-kilter as 2020, autumn will bring with it a number of prestige projects to hold our attention.",
            "Of the movies I saw during TIFF, here are eight worth your time. (FYI: For some odd reason, “Bruised” did not screen for press during the festival, so I wasn’t able to see it.)"

            "A high school athlete was disqualified from playing at her school’s volleyball game after a referee cited that her hijab violated the rules.",
            "Najah Aqeel, who is a ninth grader at Valor Collegiate Academies, a public charter network based in Nashville, Tennessee, was due to play at an away game for the freshman volleyball team on Tuesday. Right before the start of the game, the referee told Najah and her assistant coach that her hijab violated the rules set by the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS), the national body that writes the rules for numerous sports for most high schools across the country, and that she required special permission to play.",
            "Neither Najah nor her coaches knew anything about the requirement. She had already played games wearing the hijab. Angered by the lack of communication and the arbitrary enforcement of the rule, Najah began to cry.",
            "“I was crying, not because I was hurt. I was crying because I was angry. I just thought it was unfair,” Najah told HuffPost. Najah’s mother, Aliya Aqeel, who was present to watch her daughter play, was devastated and tried to get answers.",
            "“My baby’s crying. She was upset and I am that mom that’s like, ‘No. You can’t make her cry,’” said Aliya. “This was an injustice. It was because of her religion. It was because of her hijab.”",
            "Najah is not the first Muslim student-athlete to have been disqualified from a high school competition due to the hijab. In 2018, Muslim teen Noor Alexandria Abukaram was disqualified from her race in Ohio after completing her personal best time because officials said her hijab violated the uniform and she needed to have a waiver.",
            "Beyond schools, Muslim athletes in professional leagues have also faced similar challenges due to their hijabs, and many said they felt forced to choose between their faith and their passion for sports. Advocates have since called on both athletic departments and international leagues alike to end singling out Muslims and update what they call antiqued rules that have particularly targeted Muslim women.",
            "A spokesperson for Valor Collegiate Academies told HuffPost that it had no idea the policy existed until that game, and that its other hijab-wearing athletes at the school had never had an issue.",
            "“As an athletic department, we are extremely disappointed that we were not aware of this rule or previously informed of this rule in our 3 years as a TSSAA [Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association] member school. We are also frustrated that this rule has been selectively enforced as evidenced by the fact that student-athletes have previously competed while wearing hijabs,” said Cameron Hill, the director of Athletics at Valor Collegiate Academies in a statement.",
            "Although the school was able to get a waiver for Najah and future players, Hill called the rule “discriminatory” and “inequitable.”",
            "When asked about the headwear rule, TSSAA, the state-level member of NFHS, told HuffPost it was just following the rules set by the national organization.",
            "“TSSAA has always granted exceptions to any student that wishes to participate with headwear, or other articles of clothing, due to religious reasons,” said Bernard Childress, the executive director of the organization.",
            "“The request in this situation was submitted to our office on Wednesday, September 16, and was approved immediately,” he added. But for Najah, it was too late. She was forced to sit out Tuesday’s game.",
            "The NFHS established its rules with the goal of minimizing risk, Karissa Niehoff, executive director of the federation, told HuffPost in an email.",
            "“The NFHS strongly supports the Constitutional rights that our young people have to exercise freedom of religion and has no intent to interfere with those rights,” Niehoff wrote. “We will take a hard look at the language in our rules publications and continue to work with our state associations as they develop policies related to NFHS playing rules in their states.”",
            "The Middle Tennessee Volleyball Association, the administration that supplied the referee, did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.",
            "Policing Muslim Women’s Dress In Sports",
            "In 2017, the International Basketball Federation overturned its long-criticized ban on religious headwear, including the hijab, after much scrutiny. Following the suit, the International Boxing Association announced last year that Muslim women would also be allowed to compete in a hijab.",
            "Big sports companies are jumping at those changes. That same year, Nike launched its Pro Hijab line. Companies like Adidas and Under Armour followed suit.",
            "But those changes came at a cost. College basketball star Bilqis Abdul-Qaadir was on her way to playing international basketball when her dreams were halted. The International Basketball Federation or FIBA prohibited her from playing with her hijab. The Muslim woman who played for the University of Memphis was forced to give up her dream. She’s since led the campaign for FIBA to change its policy. In 2017, the league finally lifted the ban.",
            "When Abdul-Qaadir heard about Najah’s incident, she was outraged. She said the incident brought back traumatic memories for her when she was confronted and humiliated by sports officials because of her hijab.",
            "“The fact this is still going on and young girls have to still make this decision between faith and sport is ridiculous, and it’s time to really put an end to it,” said Abdul-Qaadir. “We need to take these rules out of the way so that more of us can play freely without having to answer to anybody.”",
            "Shireen Ahmed, a sportswriter who has extensively covered Muslim women in sports, said “policies that require athletes to provide waivers are extremely outdated” and that there was no significant evidence or research that demonstrates that wearing a hijab while playing sports is dangerous.",
            "Schools and athletic associations need to ultimately support and advocate for their athletes against such policies, said Ahmed, adding that putting the onus on athletes like Najah or Noor in Ohio can be detrimental for the player.",
            "“I don’t think there is any need for this policy. It just others Muslim women athletes,” said Ahmed. “High school athletic associations really need to revisit and reexamine what they expect athletes to do in order to compete. These policies don’t reflect the communities they are supposed to represent and it’s unfair to the athletes and to their teams.”",
            "Fighting For Change",
            "In Ohio, Noor was able to successfully lobby for change. In June, the Ohio Senate passed a bill to allow student religious expression in extracurricular activities. Najah wants the same.",
            "“We want the rule changes. We want the rule thrown out,” Aliya said. “That’s our biggest mission as a family and as a team. So no other girl, not just Muslims, but no other religious groups have to go through what we go through.”",
            "Najah is among approximately 65,000 Muslims in the state of Tennessee. If the rule doesn’t change, advocates say it could discourage other Muslims from participating in sports.",
            "“This just puts unnecessary barriers for people of all religions but for Muslim girls to participate fully in sports. Our state agency should be servicing all their student-athletes and make sure none of them feel discriminated against and there are no barriers to playing sports,” said Sabina Mohyuddin, the executive director at the American Muslim Advisory Council, an advocacy organization that empowers Muslim Americans in Tennessee.",
            "Najah is back on the court and has played twice since the incident. Still, she and her family feel like this is just the beginning over a larger issue for Muslim women in sports.",
            "“We’re not just fighting for Najah. We’re not just fighting for Muslims. We’re fighting for anyone that this rule impacts,” said Aliya."

            "Faced with fines of more than $100,000 for defying Santa Clara’s public health order prohibiting indoor worship services, Pastor Jack Trieber has agreed to move his services to the parking lot of the Bay Area church. Parishioners remained in their cars during two Sunday services this week as Trieber preached from a podium draped in patriotic bunting.",
            "Trieber said that, “after a great deal of prayer, fasting and counsel,” he felt compelled to stand aside and let God lead the battle to reopen churches.",
            "“I have confidence that [city officials] are going to try their best ... to help to get churches open at the right time,” Trieber said during his sermon. “Your job and my job is to keep letting God fight this battle.”",
            "It was a significant about-turn from the pastor’s position mere weeks ago.",
            "North Valley Baptist is an independent fundamental Baptist church with a 3,000-seat auditorium and an affiliated Bible college. After initially shutting its doors for the pandemic, North Valley Baptist resumed indoor services in late August. The church’s actions caught the attention of officials, who started imposing fines for each violation of the county health order. The church was reportedly fined $5,000 for each large service it held, in addition to other penalties.",
            "Trieber, who has led the congregation since 1976, started posting videos online, insisting that the government had overstepped its bounds by restricting congregational singing and indoor worship. (Indoor choir rehearsals and performances have been linked to outbreaks of COVID-19 around the world.) He insisted that the death toll from the virus wasn’t that serious.",
            "Trieber also said that the church had taken steps to protect public health, such as cutting down its indoor capacity and seating people in every other row.",
            "“I beg you, look at the stats, look at the scientists ... there’s not a pandemic here,” Trieber said in an Aug. 24 video. “Yes, let’s be safe, let’s be careful. But this area needs the church.”",
            "Days later, Trieber told the congregation he didn’t care if he contracted COVID-19.",
            "“If I get COVID, it is going to be a great funeral,” Trieber said, according to The Mercury News. “If I get it I really don’t care. … We’ve social-distanced to death.”",
            "But the fines kept piling up. The church eventually accrued $112,750 in fines, The Mercury News reported Friday. Santa Clara County officials also announced that they were planning to file a temporary restraining order against the church, the paper reported.",
            "“The reality that churches and other religious institutions across our county were successfully holding outdoor services, drive-in services, remote services — and have been — just completely undermines the notion that they needed to have an indoor gathering and create that huge risk of danger,” James Williams, a lawyer representing the county, told The Mercury News.",
            "On Sunday, Trieber said during his morning sermon that he feared that pastors will be sent to jail for holding services in violation of public health orders. Still, he said he had made peace with the church’s change of plans.",
            "He said he took inspiration from a Bible verse from the book of Exodus, taken from a chapter in which God saves the Israelites from the persecution of a pharaoh by making a path for them through the Red Sea.",

            "Less than five weeks after pushing fall sports to spring in the name of player safety during the pandemic, the conference changed course Wednesday and said it plans to open its football season the weekend of Oct. 23-24.",
            "All 14 teams will play eight regular-season games in eight weeks, plus have an opportunity to play a ninth game on Dec. 19 when the conference championship game is in Indianapolis — if all goes well. That should give the Big Ten an opportunity to compete for the national championship.",
            "The Big Ten said its Council of Presidents and Chancellors voted unanimously Tuesday to restart sports. The vote last month was 11-3 to postpone, with Ohio State, Iowa and Nebraska voting against.",
            "“We’re in a better place, regardless of how we got here or how painful it was during the time we waited to get this moment,” Ohio State athletic director Gene Smith said. “That’s all behind us. What’s beautiful is that we have a process and protocols in place that’s based on science and based on lessons learned since Aug. 11.”",
            "The move does not mean Big Ten stadiums will be packed with fans. Tickets will not be sold to the general public, though some attendance is expected.",
            "The decision to play came after sharp pressure from coaches, players, parents and even President Donald Trump, all of them pushing for a Big Ten football season. The conference is home to a number of battleground states in the November election, and Trump swifly applauded the move in a tweet while his campaign suggested the return of college football was “in no small part” due to the president’s leadership.",
            "The emergence of daily, rapid-response COVID-19 testing, not available when university leaders decided to pull the plug on the fall season, helped trigger a re-vote. The Big Ten said it will begin daily antigen testing of all its fall sport athletes, coaches and staff Sept. 30.",
            "Northwestern President Morton Schapiro, chairman of the presidents’ council, said the turning point for him on giving the green light to football — even though many students have not been allowed back on the Evanston, Illinois, campus — didn’t come until this past weekend.",
            "“Medical opinions changed,” Schapiro said. “Paul Samuelson, the great economist was once asked why he changed his mind. And he said, ‘When the facts change, the mind changes.’”",
            "Team positivity rates and population positivity rate thresholds will be used to determine whether teams must halt practice or play. The earliest an athlete will be able to return to game competition would be 21 days following a COVID-19 positive diagnosis, following a cardiac evaluation and clearance from a cardiologist designated by the university.",
            "Myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart, was also among the concerns cited by the Big Ten in August.",
            "“Everyone associated with the Big Ten should be very proud of the groundbreaking steps that are now being taken to better protect the health and safety of the student-athletes and surrounding communities,” said Dr. Jim Borchers, team physician for Ohio State.",
            "The Big Ten will take a bow, but the conference has been battered for a month and businesses in college towns from Nebraska to Maryland have lost millions in sales.",
            "First-year Commissioner Kevin Warren was the main target, criticized for a lack of communication and not providing enough information to back the initial decision.",
            "“We have passionate athletes. We have passionate families and we have passionate fans,” Warren said of the blowback. “And so I take that from a positive standpoint.”",
            "The Big Ten postponed fall sports just six days after unveiling a modified conference-only schedule that was set to begin Labor Day weekend, and indicated it would try to make up the season in the spring. But there was no plan in place and the reaction was sharp. Trump at one point called Warren, who described their conversation as “productive” and “respectful.”",
            "The Pac-12 followed the Big Ten in postponing, but was far more detailed in its explanation and also had more obvious hurdles to clear. Half the Pac-12 schools are still operating under statewide restrictions that make it impossible for teams to practice.",
            "Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott released a statement Tuesday saying the conference has not been given the go-ahead by state officials in California and Oregon to begin preparing for a football season.",

            "As the Big Ten and Pac-12 bailed in August, the other three Power Five conferences forged ahead, along with three other major college football leagues. Games have started, with the Big 12 and Atlantic Coast Conference kicking off last week. The Southeastern Conference is scheduled to start playing games Sept. 26.",
            "Meanwhile, the Big Ten was on the sideline, with coaches struggling to explain to players why other teams could play but they could not.",
            "In Nebraska, the school president, athletic director and coach Scott Frost all expressed disappointment. Frost even suggested Nebraska might look outside the Big Ten to play games while eight of his players filed a lawsuit against the Big Ten over its decision to postpone. Glen Snodgrass, father of one of the players, Garrett Snodgrass, was teaching a class at York (Nebraska) High School when he received word of the reversal.",

            "Wisconsin athletic director Barry Alvarez said Big Ten teams can begin practicing immediately. The schedule comes with a twist. On championship Saturday, the plan is to provide each team an additional game, matching the teams by their places in the division standings: No. 2 vs. No. 2, No. 3 vs. No. 3 and so on.",

            "Multiple legal advocacy groups filed the complaint, dated Monday, on behalf of Dawn Wooten, a licensed practical nurse with a decade of experience.",
            "The complaint alleges that officials have fostered unsanitary conditions and allowed for “jarring medical neglect” at the Irwin County Detention Center, which is operated by the private prison company LaSalle Corrections. In addition to the allegedly high number of hysterectomies performed on female detainees, the center is accused of failing to take basic steps to prevent the spread of COVID-19.",
            "Wooten said in a press conference Tuesday that she had to speak out publicly after witnessing the “inhumane” treatment of immigrants.",
            "ICE told HuffPost that it “does not comment on matters presented to the Office of the Inspector General, which provides independent oversight and accountability within the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.”",
            "The agency continued: “ICE takes all allegations seriously and defers to the OIG regarding any potential investigation and/or results. That said, in general, anonymous, unproven allegations, made without any fact-checkable specifics, should be treated with the appropriate skepticism they deserve.”",
            "HuffPost did not immediately receive a response from LaSalle Corrections.",
            "According to the nurse, female detainees are regularly sent to an off-site doctor who sometimes ends up removing all or part of their uteruses. Due to language barriers, many of the women may not be able to properly consent to the procedure. Some nurses end up “simply googling Spanish” to obtain patient consent, she alleged.",
            "“That’s his specialty, he’s the uterus collector,” Wooten said of the doctor, who is not named in the public version of the complaint.",
            "“I’ve had several inmates tell me that they’ve been to see the doctor and they’ve had hysterectomies and they don’t know why they went or why they’re going,” she said.",

The patient was supposed to have her left ovary removed due to a cyst, but the doctor allegedly took out her right ovary.",
            "“She was upset,” Wooten said. “She had to go back to take out the left and she wound up with a total hysterectomy. She still wanted children ― so she has to go back home now and tell her husband that she can’t bear kids.”",
            "Wooten’s statements were bolstered by other, anonymous accounts given to Project South, a human rights group that helped file the complaint.",

            "For attempting to voice her concerns about ICDC ― including that rooms and equipment were not properly cleaned and that medical records were being fabricated ― Wooten says in the complaint that she was demoted and issued a reprimand.",
            "Since the coronavirus crisis began, employees have struggled to obtain sufficient personal protective equipment, according to the complaint, which notes that social distancing is not observed at the facility.

            "“It’s a sentimental thing for my girls, right? It makes them feel close to their dad,” Bell said of the girls drinking O’Doul’s, which she says they sometimes also order at restaurants. According to O’Doul’s website, the non-alcoholic beverage contains less than 0.5% alcohol by volume.",
            "It all started with their first daughter and some walks around the neighborhood. Bell said Shepard would “pop a non-alcoholic beer in his hand and the baby would paw at it and put the rim in her mouth.”",
            "“There’s nothing wrong with it. It’s just essentially a bubbly juice,” Bell said. “We also talk to them very much about his sobriety, the importance of it and why Daddy can’t drink.”",

            "“Every cliche is true. When I look at him, I see my young self. When I’m hugging him, I’m able to hug the little boy that I was, if that makes sense. So there’s so much healing going on.”",
            "On Childlike Curiosity",
            "“I love once he goes to sleep because he’s just at that age where he’s very curious about everything. This is the thing he does: ‘Can a cheetah beat a rancher? Can a cheetah beat a car? Can a cheetah beat a bird? Can a cheetah beat a leaf falling?’ By the time we go through all of ‘can a cheetah beat?’ I’m beat. But, no, it’s just joy. Just watching him learn and discover and, yeah, it’s wonderful.”",
            "On Parenting With His Partner",
            "“She’s from Ethiopia, and she don’t play, man. I have to force her to fly first class. She’s coach. She’s on the bus. He’s going to have really, really good balance because she’s very earth ― very, very earth ― and, you know, and I’m a little different. So he’s got good balance.”",
            "On His Dream For His Son",
            "“[My dream] for him is to be the best that he can be. All that he wants to be, no matter what that is. In my mind what I would love to say is, ‘Here are the keys to the studio. I’ll be somewhere smoking a joint on an island; you go do this. I’m 80 years old now; go do your thing.’ But, if that’s not his dream, I just want whatever it is that he does to be special and amazing.”",
            "On Parenting After Experiencing Childhood Abuse",
            "“When I think about my father, I’m trying to look at it now through the lens of this beautiful person that I’m raising, but it makes it harder because I wonder how could you be so cruel to something so pure, right? And [Aman] looks just like me, so I’m looking at myself in younger pictures.”\n\nOn Perspective\n\n“Just because he was born into privilege doesn’t mean he won’t have to work. He was born broke; he’s got to go to work. He’s got to find his own way. I’ll be there to help guide him, but he’s not going to have everything handed to him.”\n\nOn The Magic Of Parenting\n\n“Just having an opportunity to mold a great human being is a wonderful thing. To help nurture and cultivate his life, in whatever wonderful thing he is going to be, is really awesome.”\n\nOn Bedtime Stories\n\n“I don’t do characters with the books, but he’s into ‘Paw Patrol’ right now, so every night he gets three books [because] I tell him, ‘I’m only reading three tonight.’ And what he’ll do is bring 10, but we only get three, so we’ll read the three, and then I say, ‘OK, you have to go to bed now.’ And he’ll say, ‘Read them again. You said three, so just keep reading these three.’ Pretty smart already!”\n\nOn How His Son Changed Him\n\n“He really has changed my life. He’s so beautiful and strong and amazing. And he’s a ... healer for me, ’cause I look at him and see myself as a little boy. And I’m able to give him all the love and all the things that I never had. It’s really amazing. It’s amazing.”\n\nOn Disciplining His Son\n\n“I was in the other room writing, and he had just given the nanny fits. He didn’t know I was there listening to him. He’s just going at her. … I get down to this level, eye to eye. We’re talking; we’re having a conversation. I’m saying how disappointed I was, how he shouldn’t behave that way. And I watched this child, who’s very smart, get it and apologize — apologize to the nanny, apologize to Mom, apologize to me. I watched this child get it, and I had to rush out of the room because I lost it. Gelila comes, and she’s, [like], ‘Are you OK?’ I’m in tears because nobody had ever spoken to me that way as a child. Nobody had ever spoken to me as a person.”\n\nOn Special Moments\n\n“We were on the beach over the holidays, and we’re walking up the beach. … Behind me, he’s jumping up and down. I said, ‘What are you doing?’ He said, ‘I’m walking in your footsteps, Papa.’”"

An energizing makeover might be exactly what your home needs.\n\nBut if you’re having a hard time deciding what home decor style you like, it might be as easy as thinking about the spaces outside of your home that make you feel good, like your favorite coffeehouse. If that’s the case, industrial home decor might be what you’re looking for if you’re not into the rustic desert vibes of Southwestern-style furniture or the minimalist aesthetic of Scandinavian furniture and decor.",
            "But what exactly is industrial style furniture and what does this interior design trend look like? Visions of reclaimed wood coffee tables, vintage couches and exposed-pipe lighting might come to mind — and you wouldn’t be wrong.",
            "To create the industrial home look at home, just think about your favorite coffeehouse. It’s an interior design style that combines both modern, urban elements with rustic, vintage ones — like hanging rope or wire lights with Edison bulbs, a vintage wood coffee table with repurposed metal hairpin legs, vintage leather seating with exposed brick walls. It juxtaposes natural and manmade materials (wood and metal) and cool and warm tones like gray, black, tan and brown.\n\nThe best part is it’s a home style that pairs will with pretty much any other decor style too, particularly midcentury modern furniture and decor. For your own personal twist, you might add art deco-inspired accents for a more glamorous vibe, or Southwestern furniture and decor to make it even cozier.\n\nGet an industrial look in your living room, bedroom or dining room easily by adding industrial hairpin legs to your coffee table, end tables or even dining table. For that steampunk-meets-factory feeling, use reclaimed materials around the home, like with this pipe wall-mount ladder bookcase from AllModern or with this industrial pipe clothing rack from Amazon.\n\nYou might already know about destinations such as Wayfair and AllModern for industrial style furniture and home decor. But did you know that Amazon and Etsy are also worth browsing? Amazon’s own in-house brand Rivet carries industrial-looking midcentury modern styles, too. Etsy remains a prime destination for handmade industrial artwork, furniture and fixtures around the home, like this rustic entryway wall-mount coat rack and this industrial wall clock.\n\nWe’ve rounded up where to buy industrial-style furniture and home decor online for every budget.",

            "“The only thing I can say with confidence is that I am not an IT expert. Everything else is a big question mark,” the “Good Place” star told HuffPost while promoting her partnership with Yoobi’s “Supply A Student” initiative.",
            "“This time has been so confusing and I’ve found comfort in giving myself and my kids grace. Free passes to do it wrong,” she elaborated. “We’re all in this situation for the first time, so when I cannot get the computer to log onto their class, I don’t beat myself up. I just take a breath, get us all a snack, and try again later.”",
            "Bell and her husband, Dax Shepard, have two daughters, 7-year-old Lincoln and 5-year-old Delta. She noted that she’s lucky to have resources and flexibility to ease the chaos and confusion of the 2020 school year.",
            "“I realize I am doing it under the best conditions possible,” she said. “I am so fortunate to be available if my child has a question or wants to hug me during their ‘break.’ So many parents have to go to work and are having to choose whether to put food on the table or stay home and help their kids.”",
            "The actor emphasized that she knows she is a “VERY privileged mom” and works to instill that understanding in her children.",
            "“We do our best to be very transparent with our children and tell them we are more lucky than most people and that it’s our job as people on earth to help others,” Bell said. “We talk often of the importance of sharing ― not just of stuff but of time. And not just sharing with our family, but sharing with all people. It’s a constant conversation. From when they were very little we have put giving into practice and, for me, the best teaching tool is modeling. So seeing charitable actions is the best thing we can do for them.”",
            "That’s part of why she was drawn to “Supply A Student,” which brings together the school supply brand, Yoobi, and the Kids In Need Foundation. The initiative aims to equip under-resourced students and teachers with the supplies they need this year. Bell invited her fans to nominate deserving teachers to receive Yoobi classroom packs for their school and encouraged them to buy supplies for students across the U.S.",
            "“I think many of us had a baseline appreciation for teachers before the pandemic, but now people are seeing their true value,” the actor said, adding that educators deserve more appreciation than just social media memes. “They are emotional wizards, sacrificial heroes, their capacity for giving is endless and they provide stability so that parents can feel free to explore their own identities. They are so special. And yet they are consistently undervalued and underpaid ― so many are paying for their own school supplies.”",
            "Bell said she hopes that this appreciation extends beyond the confusing pandemic school years.",
            "“I think we all need to show up consistently and ask (teachers), ‘What do you need to teach our children? How can I make your life easier?’” she said. “Teachers have given us so much. It’s long overdue that we give back to them.”",
            "In addition to showing what it means to give back, Bell also converses with her children about privilege in its many forms. One major topic they’ve been tackling is what it means to be white and issues of racism in the U.S.",
            "“I think the big problem comes into play when people choose to avoid. So, we make sure to talk about why the protests are happening and the depth of injustice,” she said. “We talk about the problems but we also talk about the solutions. We make sure to include that part so they feel empowered to make better decisions than the generations before them. Also, we make sure to talk about the weight of our responsibility. If Black parents have to talk to their kids about what to do when they confront law enforcement, it’s incumbent on white parents to say, ‘If you see someone getting treated unfairly because of their race, you must speak up. Use your privilege for good. That’s your responsibility.’”",
            "Bell said gratitude lists have helped her family find joy and appreciation in everyday moments.",
            "“We’ve been doing three things we are grateful for at the table,” she said. “Often for me, it’s ‘I’m grateful the dog didn’t pee in the house.’”"

            "Suicide in children and young adults has been a public health crisis in the United States for years — and new data suggests it is getting worse.",
            "A new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released on Friday found the national suicide rate among 10- to 24-year-olds in the U.S. was mostly stable at the start of the 2000s. However, it then increased by 57% from 2007 to 2018. That represents an increase from 6.8 deaths per 100,000 in 2007 to 10.7 deaths per 100,000 in 2018.",
            "Suicide is the second-leading cause of death among American children and young adults. There are twice as many suicides in this country as there are homicides.",
            "Yet mental health experts warn it has not been adequately addressed.",
            "“For this particular generation, one of the things we see is an uptick in a lot of the risk factors for suicidality,” said Isaiah Pickens, a clinical psychologist and the CEO of iOpening Enterprises. “That can include anxiety and depression.”",
            "He believes these can be “magnified” by social media, but cautioned that suicide is a complex problem with many contributing factors.",
            "According to the new CDC report, Alaska had the highest youth suicide rate, followed by South Dakota, Montana, Wyoming and New Mexico. The overall rate was lowest in the Northeast region — although several of those states saw a relatively high uptick in suicide deaths, including New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts. The national report simply tracked trends in youth suicide rates; it did not provide any insights into why those changes may have occurred.",
            "Of course, the new findings come amid the COVID-19 crisis, when mental health experts have sounded the alarm about the potential impact on children. In a survey published in early summer, 7 out of 10 teens said they were struggling with their mental health in some way during the pandemic. It is unclear how, if at all, the pandemic might influence rates of youth suicide and suicidal thoughts, but there is concern it could worsen current trends.",
            "“We don’t talk enough about suicide,” said Mitch Prinstein, professor of psychology and neuroscience at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. “Especially now, when kids are feeling so disrupted in their routines and remarkably lonely compared to the way they’re usually feeling in a nonpandemic situation.”",
            "Although the factors contributing to the continued rise in youth suicide in the U.S. are complex, experts say they also point to the need for parents to proactively speak to their children about this public health crisis — without fear that mentioning suicide will somehow plant an idea in their head. One conversation will not “solve” suicide, but it can make it easier for a child or young adult to open up.",
            "“Approaching a child’s life with curiosity, instead of judgment, is a huge first step,” Pickens said.",
            "Parents should look also out for warning signs, such as significant changes in their children’s behavior, including their sleep patterns, or withdrawal. They might appear more irritable and stop finding pleasure in activities and relationships they once enjoyed.",
            "Parents and caregivers should also restrict access to firearms, alcohol and medication. Any type of suicidal statements should be taken seriously and warrant professional help.",
            "“We have the ‘sex talk,’ we have the ‘drugs talk.’ We need to be having the ‘suicide talk’ with every child,” Prinstein said. “One out of every 5 kids reports they’ve seriously considered suicide within the last 12 months in the high school years. In the same way that we have conversations about other risks that our kids might be exposed to, it must be discussed openly and clearly.”",
            "If you or someone you know needs help, call 1-800-273-8255 for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

            "A new research paper on the spread of COVID-19 from a South Dakota motorcycle rally last month has generated a lot of attention ― and a lot of skepticism.",
            "In both cases, it’s easy to see why.",
            "The paper, by four economists from three U.S. universities, claims that the 10-day event in Sturgis led to nearly 267,000 cases around the country. That figure is dramatically higher than the number of cases public health departments have linked directly to the festival ― 124 in South Dakota, according to state officials, and 290 across the country, according to a tally from The Associated Press.",
            "The study prompted splashy headlines and has lit up social media all week. Even Bette Middler tweeted about it. “Thanks assholes,” she wrote.",
            "South Dakota officials have rejected the paper’s findings, with Gov. Kristi Noem calling it “fiction.” Noem, a Republican, said the researchers “took a snapshot in time, and they did a lot of speculation, did some back-of-the-napkin math, made up some numbers and published them.”",
            "Noem’s attitude may not be surprising, given the relatively lax approach she’s taken to the pandemic ― eschewing mask mandates, for example, and allowing the Sturgis rally to go forward despite warnings that it would become a “superspreader” event.",
            "She isn’t the only one questioning the paper, however. A number of public health specialists raised concerns about its assumptions and findings. They have noted that the paper has yet to undergo peer review, which refers to the process of using outside scholars to vet a paper before it’s published in an academic journal.",
            "At the same time, plenty of outside experts are taking the paper seriously ― noting that the authors used a widely accepted methodology and were transparent about their assumptions. That’s is a far cry from making up the numbers, as Noem suggested.",
            "Whatever the merits of that 266,000 figure, several outside scholars told HuffPost, the paper offers more reason to think that Sturgis significantly increased COVID-19 spread well beyond what official figures suggest.",
            "Warnings Before The Rally, COVID Cases After It",
            "The Sturgis rally took place over 10 days in early August and ultimately attracted an estimated 460,000 visitors from all over the country. It was one of the few mass public gatherings to proceed as planned in the last few months, as COVID-19 has forced cancellations of everything from professional sports to rock concerts.",
            "Many public health scholars warned beforehand that Sturgis would cause outbreaks, not just near the festival site but also in communities around the country once riders returned home.",
            "During the event, images showed attendees crowded together, sometimes indoors, creating precisely the conditions in which the virus spreads most readily. Most people were not wearing masks.",
            "Since the festival, COVID-19 cases have spiked in South Dakota, North Dakota and neighboring Iowa, and public health workers in those states and others have identified cases originating from people who likely got sick while attending the event. That includes one Minnesota man who died last week.",
            "Still, the official tally is not much more than 100, and it is not clear how much those big spikes in the Dakotas and adjacent states are byproducts of Sturgis. Other factors, starting with the return of college students to campus, could be playing a big role.",
            "To address these questions, four economists affiliated with the Center for Health Economics and Policy Studies at the San Diego State University ― Dhaval Dave, Andrew Friedson, Drew McNichols and Joseph Sabia ― used mathematical modeling, based in part on anonymized cell phone data, to compare outbreaks in communities with Sturgis attendees to those without.",
            "That is how the scholars got their 267,000 caseload figure ― which, they said, would account for nearly 1 in 5 COVID-19 cases at the time.",
            "The findings, in a working paper published by the Iza Institute of Labor Economics, provide “strong evidence that the Sturgis Rally appears to have been a superspreader event for COVID-19,” the authors wrote. “We find significant case increases within the state of South Dakota as well as increases extending to counties from which relatively more residents attended the event.”",
            "The authors also said evidence suggested lower spread in states that were taking active mitigation steps, like requiring masks and restricting business activity.",
            "The Difficulties Of Pinpointing A Number",
            "One reason the number of coronavirus cases the working paper links to Sturgis is so much higher than the official numbers is that public health departments rely on contact tracing ― that is, interviewing everybody who tests positive for the virus to get their known contacts, then getting in touch with those people, and so on. It’s labor-intensive work that can strain even well-funded public health departments.",
            "“At the scale we’re talking about here, contact tracing is just not going to be effective, at least as it’s currently implemented,” Elizabeth Stuart, a biostatistician at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told HuffPost on Wednesday.",
            "Keri Althoff, a professor of epidemiology also at the Hopkins Bloomberg School, said she, too, found the paper’s general finding “plausible.” She also said that’s not the same thing as saying the finding is right.",
            "“Models are very valuable tools when we can’t have our ideal, but there are limitations,” Althoff said.",
            "Among the key issues, she and other scholars said, were the assumptions the authors plugged into their models.",
            "“What the paper doesn’t tell us is what would have happened in these communities if the rally had been cancelled,” Lauren Ancel Meyers, director of the University of Texas COVID-19 Modeling Consortium, said in an email. “Would the folks who attended the rally still have gathered in large groups or engaged in other activities that exacerbated COVID-19 spread?”",
            "Stuart added, “I would have liked to have seen more acknowledgment of the uncertainty, the noise in there.”",
            "Other scholars weighed in on Twitter, with Kevin Griffith of Vanderbilt urging “caution” before taking results at face value and Jimi Adams from the University of Colorado Denver saying, “Author’s summary of the assumptions left me less convinced of their methods, rather than moreso.” The paper, he said, “likely vastly overstates the impact.”",
            "But Stuart said the general approach of the paper was “reasonable” and “widely accepted.” Although she might not vouch for the 266,000 figure, she said, all current estimates of COVID-19 spread are going to be highly imprecise.",
            "Meyers also saw the paper as a contribution: “Even though the analysis makes key assumptions that need further validation,” she said, “it provides initial evidence that the pandemic spread faster in communities that hosted or had large numbers of residents that attended the rally than communities that largely stayed away.”",
            "It’s entirely possible that, as the paper continues to get attention and scrutiny, a consensus among scholars will form ― that it’s mostly right, that it’s mostly wrong, or somewhere in between. That’s the nature of academic research, especially for hastily written working papers.",
            "“I think it’s really important to do these sorts of studies, but it’s also incredibly hard to do,” Stuart said. “I’m a big fan of building a body of evidence, knowing that any one study is not going to be definitive.”",
            "CORRECTION: A previous version of this article misidentified the institution associated with the Center for Health Economics and Policy Studies as the University of California; rather, it is San Diego State."

IFTNA doesn’t disclose exactly which chemicals are used in its antiviral coating or where it conducted the efficacy testing against COVID-19, but the company states that it kills 99.9% of the virus within 10 minutes of contact and works by destroying the fatty molecules that surround the virus.",
            "How these fabrics claim to work",
            "Apposta’s Viroformula relies on a technology called Viroblock, developed by Swiss company HeiQ. Viroformula and Viroblock use silver-based applications to attract and bind viruses as well as a “fatty vesicle technology that works as a booster.” HeiQ conducted testing with the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity in Melbourne, Australia, with results showing a 99.99% reduction of the virus on treated fabrics.",
            "Antibacterial and antimicrobial textile treatments are not new technologies.",
            "“We’ve known for a long time that you could add coatings to fabrics to prevent the growth of and kill different types of bacteria. That’s been around since the 1990s,” microbiologist Jason Tetro (aka The Germ Guy) told HuffPost. “[We have] silver-impregnated fabrics that are designed to make sure your feet don’t smell, so this whole idea is not new. What is new is that we’re looking at using it for facial protection and as a prevention against pathogen transmission.”",
            "Lee W. Riley of the University of California’s School of Public Health explained that viruses have DNA, RNA and proteins, and within these are phosphorus and sulfur molecules.",
            "“Silver ions bind to the sulfur and proteins, which disrupt the virus’s DNA so it can’t replicate,” Riley told HuffPost. “Especially affected are the proteins on the membranes of the microbes; once the membrane is disrupted, the virus or bacteria no longer remains viable.”",
            "Silver, by itself, is a reactionary chemical. “In other words,” Tetro said, “if you have just a little silver element and then you bring water into it, and then you bring other things around it, it’s going to want to react with them and create bonds. It’s just a hugger.”",
            "What this means is that the silver in the textile coating or treatment gravitates to and bonds with the sulfur-containing amino acids and proteins of the virus.",
            "“And, if that sulfur-containing molecule happens to be what’s necessary for the virus to get into you, then the silver is effectively blocking the opportunity for the virus to enter your cells. We call that inactivation,” Tetro explained.",
            "HeiQ’s fatty vesicle technique works because, just like our blood forms cholesterol membranes, viruses also use cholesterol to form their membranes. This knowledge comes from a 2008 study published in Virology, which found cholesterol was a necessary component for a virus to really get into human cells.",
            "“You want to prevent the virus’s ability to infect by taking away the cholesterol. You create these liposomes (a spherical sac or bubble often used to deliver drugs to the body). And what that’s going to do is when the liposomes come up against something that has cholesterol, it’s going to suck the cholesterol right out of it. And when you do that to a virus, not only are you preventing the protein from getting in, but you’re also preventing the entire chemistry of the virus infection to happen,” Tetro said.",
            "“Now, that may take hours. It’s not instantaneous,” he added. None of these fabric coatings or treatments kills the virus instantly on contact.",
            "Polygiene’s ViralOff works a little differently than the HeiQ formula. “What they’re doing is taking metals that are known to have antimicrobial activity, like silver titanium, and they’re just spraying it into the fabric. What that does is essentially, when the virus gets in there, it’ll eventually come into contact with the sprayed-on metal. And then as they say, in their [words], it’ll die within two hours,” Tetro said.",
            "“It doesn’t matter if it’s titanium, copper or silver: all of those ions have that ability to want to be huggers. And as a result of that, they can bring down the protein levels and inactivate the virus,” Tetro said. This is why some face mask manufacturers have put copper in their masks.",
            "Can you contract COVID-19 from your clothes in the first place?",
            "The possibility of contracting COVID-19 from fabric you’re wearing is not very high, according to Riley. “It’s not really transmitted through clothing,” he said.",
            "“It takes about an hour [of exposure to these treated fabrics] to just bring down the number of virus particles by maybe 20%,” Riley said. COVID-19 is thought to be spread primarily via droplets and aerosols when somebody talks, coughs or sneezes as opposed to from surfaces.",
            "“So just having these [treatments] on clothing, even on masks, is not going to be that effective. Some groups have tried to make masks with copper wires in them and they really are just not going to do that much because it takes time for these types of products to have an effect on the total number of microbes that somebody might be exposed to,” Riley added.",
            "“In order for a person to get infected, the virus has to be aerosolized. If somebody touches those surfaces and then rubs their eyes, or sticks their finger into their mouth, then yes, potentially you can get infected, but those types of transmission mechanisms are very, very, unlikely,” Riley pointed out.",
            "Silver-based technologies used in textile treatments do indeed inhibit the virus as they claim to, but consumers should keep in mind that COVID-19 is really a respiratory virus. As both Riley and Tetro point out, transmission from clothing is not incredibly likely. That being said, adding another barrier against virus transmission can’t hurt. Just don’t forget to wear a mask with your new antiviral jeans (while also socially distancing)."

            "“It’s less about me. You become less self-obsessed and you let go of things. You forgive your parents for stuff, and you’re more at peace and you’re more motivated. You know you have to be an example for this child, so you have to be the best person. You can’t just say, ‘Do as I say, not as I do.’ He’s the best thing to happen to me, for sure.”",
            "On Her Son’s Experience Having Famous Parents",
            "“Bless him. He’s a gypsy by proxy because his parents are. He’s only 3 now, but he’s starting to understand. He hears one of my songs and he knows that that’s me, and he has seen me on TV and he’s starting to put the pieces together. His parents are very different. My ex-husband is lovely and very British and straightedge, and then he’s got this glam-rock weirdo for a mom.”",
            "On Embracing The Chaos",
            "“People say, ‘What about when the baby goes to sleep?’ But that’s when I’m doing laundry, cleaning the house, answering emails. I pretty much always have a stain on my shirt. That’s my life!”\n\nOn Her Home Birth\n\n“It was a psychedelic experience. I felt like I was hitting every corner of the room. Everything was vibrating.”\n\nOn Moving To Nashville For Her Son\n\n“L.A. is wonderful, and it has given me so many amazing things, but I’ve also got a lot of demons here. I was ready to break it up a little bit. I wanted to give my kid some grass to run around on. Again, he’s got two actor parents. I was like, you don’t need to live in L.A. full-time. Let’s go somewhere a little ‘normal’ for a bit.”",
            "On The Intensity Of Motherhood",
            "“Becoming a mom is the best thing I ever did with my life, but it’s not for everyone. It’s harder than you think and you are never ready, but it will open up your heart in ways you never thought possible.”",

            "“I think he taught me a lot about deeper emotions. I think that that’s certainly made me a better actor and given me more to draw from and given me a deeper understanding of myself.”",
            "On Co-Parenting After Divorce",
            "“I think any separation, whether it’s amicable or not, is always difficult. But we’re always doing our best, and the most important thing is our son always comes first. ... Whatever issues the parents have, you’ve just got to get over that and put it to the side. Another reason why kids are a gift: They get you out of your stuff and you let go of the things that don’t serve you or them much faster.”",
            "On Learning From Her Son",
            "“He said something to me that was so profound I wanted to put it on a T-shirt. I was just poking fun at him lovingly one day and I said, ‘You’re weird,’ and he said, ‘I’m not weird. I’m playing.’ And I was like, that’s the most brilliant thing I’ve ever heard. ‘I’m not weird, I’m just playing’: That’s my motto for life from now on.”",
            "On Parenting As A Rape Survivor",
            "“I’ve been able to talk about it in a new way — from a place of strength rather than still kind of going through it. And there are still good days and bad days. That stuff never fully goes away. Even when the response is positive, it’s still overwhelming because people start opening up to you about their experiences and that’s really heavy. But it’s kind of like how I felt when I had my son, where it was like, ‘All right, now you get to take your experiences and turn them into lessons and you get to kind of be there for him instead of just wallowing in your thing.’”",
            "On Lessons From Motherhood",
            "“It’s no joke when people say your heart keeps growing every day. The more your heart grows, the more open you get, the more understanding you have of people and emotions, and the deeper you are in tune with yourself.”",
            "On Dating As A Single Mom",
            "“I’m doing my best. Doing my best. I’m very satisfied, very happy. It’s always interesting being a single mom and dating. That comes with its own challenges. But again, everything is an opportunity to learn and grow, and I think I’m just taking it all one day at a time.”",

            "A pandemic never occurred to them. The idea that Donald Trump would ever be required to sit still, pay attention and make rational decisions that would determine whether hundreds of thousands of Americans would live or die not once crossed the minds of those who put him into the Oval Office.",
            "Oh, they all had their various reasons for wanting him there. For white evangelical Christians, he had explicitly promised to appoint the federal judges they had so longed for to turn back the nation’s cultural clock. For Mitch McConnell, a Trump win — as unlikely as it seemed — was the only real path to making sure Republicans retained control of the Senate and he himself remained majority leader. And for Vladimir Putin, having Trump in the White House — as unlikely as it seemed — would be a dream come true, an opportunity to wreak havoc on his longtime adversary and weaken its historic alliance with Western Europe.",
            "Russia’s dictator, of course, was not remotely interested in what Trump’s ascension might mean for Americans in the event of an actual calamity. If they were dumb enough to vote for him, well, they deserved whatever they got. In any event, it was not his problem.",
            "As for Trump’s American supporters, perhaps so much time had passed since Sept. 11, 2001, that the idea of a genuine national emergency was but a faded memory. Perhaps the quiet competence that President Barack Obama’s team had employed with the 2009 flu pandemic and later with the 2014 West African Ebola outbreak had diminished the perceived threat that a simple virus could present.",
            "For whatever reason, even as they watched the noise and chaos and nonsense generated by candidate Trump for a full year and a half, the consequences of a real crisis requiring real leadership actually happening on the watch of a President Trump had never really dawned on them.",
            "True, there existed then — and continues to exist today — a significant cadre of Republican voters who genuinely believed that the Trump they watched on “The Apprentice” was the real Donald Trump. That he was a real billionaire, based on his own efforts and smarts. That he was capable of making rational, quality decisions based on the facts presented to him.",
            "That excuse, though, does not work for those Republicans from McConnell on down to the congressional candidates who had occasion to speak with Trump in person. As one top Republican National Committee member told me after his first face-to-face encounter with Trump two months before the 2016 election: “OK. Our guy is insane.”",
            "His was not a minority view, by the way. Trump’s incoherence, his temper, his impulsiveness, his breathtaking ignorance — all of it was well-known among the top tiers of the Republican machinery. But for them, it was simply a challenge to overcome, another hurdle that fate had placed between them and their holy grail of judges and tax cuts and regulatory rollbacks. Not once did I ever hear any concern that just maybe they were working to install a useful idiot who truly was an idiot, with absolutely zero leadership qualities one ordinarily looks for in someone aspiring to become the chief executive of the world’s remaining superpower.",
            "It was an abject failure of the Republican Party’s responsibility to the country. In our two-party system, both have a duty to weed out candidates who fail the threshold test of commander-in-chief and, relatedly, emergency-manager-in-chief. Through the summer and fall of 2015 and then the early nominating contests of 2016, it was clear as day that Trump was not credible in those roles, and yet neither the remaining candidates nor the party leadership made a serious effort to ensure his defeat.",
            "True, there were some who voiced warnings. Jeb Bush called Trump a “chaos candidate” who would bring us a “chaos presidency.” But there was also Ted Cruz, who literally praised Trump for the better part of a year, refusing to criticize him in the hopes of one day inheriting his voters. By the time Cruz did unload on him, it was seen as sour grapes. Such was the cynicism and game-playing that put us where we are.",
            "Republicans will pay a price for that negligence. This already became apparent in the off-year elections, with Democrats winning back the House in 2018 and scoring wins in such unlikely races as a special election for an Alabama Senate seat in 2017 and the Kentucky governorship in 2019. Whether Republicans suffer a complete presidential year wipeout in the autumn of 2020 or four years later is debatable, but that it will happen is not. Trump is betting not just his own future, but that of the party he hijacked on the dwindling demographic of angry white men without college degrees, disproportionately in the South. This is not a winning bet.",
            "Separate from the Republican Party’s failure to safeguard the country, though, is the failure of ordinary Americans. Trump did not elect himself. And while he had the direct help of Russia and the unintended help of the FBI director, it was, in the end, actual Americans who cast their ballots for him.",
            "In a representative democracy, the buck ultimately stops with the voters. So, yes, the president failed us miserably in his handling of the pandemic. From pretending he had stopped the virus from entering the country to claiming it wasn’t so bad to wishing that it would just go away to nonsensically hyping an unproven treatment to discouraging the use of masks to eventually just getting bored with it and moving on, the president could not have handled this more poorly had he been actively trying to fail us.",
            "This is on him — the many hundreds of thousands, even millions, of serious illnesses that might not have happened with a competent response. The 150,000 deaths, at least, that could have been avoided. But it’s also on us.",
            "When the coronavirus reckoning is complete, when all the numbers are eventually tallied, here’s one more that should be included: the 62,984,828 who enabled it to happen back on Nov. 8, 2016.",
            "In truth, no one should have been surprised by Trump’s ruinous handling of a real disaster when it arrived in January 2020. He himself had given us all a clear warning just a few months earlier when he ginned up a fake one for no good reason at all.",
            "In late summer 2019, Trump wreaked chaos and confusion upon Americans trying to plan for the possible arrival of a massive hurricane along the Southeast coast. As residents of Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas anxiously tracked Dorian’s projected path, Trump tossed out his own forecast on Twitter, adding a new state into the mix:",
            "“In addition to Florida - South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama, will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated. Looking like one of the largest hurricanes ever. Already category 5. BE CAREFUL! GOD BLESS EVERYONE!”",
            "Almost immediately, the phones lit up at the National Weather Service office in Birmingham as panicked residents called to ask if it was true: that Dorian was going to cross Florida and hit them. This led to a tweet from the meteorologists in that office — who at the time did not know where the misinformation was coming from — stating that Alabama was not, repeat, not in Dorian’s path and everyone should calm down.",
            "And that, in turn, spawned a weekslong imbroglio, with the White House and Trump’s various apologists on one side insisting that Trump had been right and Alabama had been in danger at the time Trump posted his tweet, versus the meteorologists and tropical storm experts at the National Hurricane Center who pointed out that the consensus forecast was already calling for the storm to parallel the East Coast and then head off to sea. Front and center was a week-old tracking map onto which Trump had, with a black Sharpie, apparently drawn a semicircle to include Alabama.",
            "The defenses of him afterward were largely along the lines of, well, that’s just Trump being Trump. Which was both true and — although this went underappreciated at the time — downright horrifying.",
            "It was an open rejection of expertise in a life-and-death field. What Trump was saying was that because he was the president of the United States, his opinion of where the storm would head and whose lives were in imminent danger was every bit as valid as the opinions of those who had devoted their adult lives to the study of Atlantic cyclones. It was beyond parody.",
            "Most stunning of all was the view within his senior staff that it was no big deal. One aide even kept on his desk a printout of the tracking chart in question, kind of as a souvenir from what he considered a ridiculous kerfuffle in which Trump had, yet again, owned the press.",
            "That, right there, should have been a bright red flashing warning sign. Because a hurricane is a slow-moving menace that is observable through publicly available images from weather satellites and other data. What’s more, the National Hurricane Center and the National Weather Service continued to do their jobs, notwithstanding the president’s meddling. What Trump did was inexcusably dangerous — but only those foolish enough to still be listening to the man, given the track record of his first two and a half years in office, were going to be negatively affected. Everyone else would listen to the Hurricane Center and local emergency management officials and act accordingly.",
            "No, the bigger risk that became obvious with the hurricane map stunt was the possibility of a threat that truly required a competent presidential response. Trump could not even properly manage the approach of a hurricane — something that typically happens several times every single year — and then tried to coerce his executive branch agencies into revising history in an attempt to back up his silly tweet.",
            "How would he manage a threat that a president, and only the president, was in a position to deal with?",
            "I actually mentioned that in a long piece about Trump’s endless dishonesty, and even posited the threat of a deadly disease. That article published on Jan. 15, 2020.",
            "Unfortunately, it was only a week later that America started to get the answer to that question.",
            "It’s easy now as the pandemic drags on and the American death toll climbs toward 200,000 to put all the blame on Trump. He did, after all, make bad decision after bad decision in the crucial early weeks of the outbreak, from ignoring intelligence community warnings to downplaying the threat to avoiding taking steps that would anger China’s dictator and endanger the all-important trade agreement he believed he needed in order to win a second term. He even called concerns about the pandemic “a hoax” at one of his campaign rallies, sending a signal to his voting base that public health officials have had an impossible time countering ever since.",
            "That mishandling of the disease, in turn, wrecked the strong economy that for three years Trump had been claiming as his own. In truth, he had inherited it from Obama, with employment and gross domestic product numbers largely similar to those under his predecessor’s second term. The resulting crisis is rivaling the Great Depression in job losses. With a competent response to the pandemic, much of the related economic catastrophe might have been avoided, as well.",
            "And yet, again, Trump did not anoint himself president. That was the work of those 63 million Americans who walked into their polling places and decided to put a cartoonishly unserious person into the most serious job in the country.",
            "There were a number of factors that led to this. Putin decided that the best way to weaken America in 2016 was by hurting former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primaries and boosting a “reality” game show host in the Republican contests. How could he know that the then-162-year-old party that once prided itself on its hard-headed realism would fail to do all in its power to stop him?",
            "FBI Director James Comey, for what he thought was the good of his institution, decided in late October to reopen an investigation into Clinton’s misuse of a private email server. How was he to know that state polling was off and that Clinton’s expected easy win was a chimera, and that his two letters to Congress would put the election on a knife’s edge?",
            "In retrospect, it seems quaint — adorable, almost — how much time and energy and hand-wringing went into investigating Clinton’s emails, given the loud and proud corruption Trump has carried out these past three years: the funneling of millions of both campaign as well as taxpayer dollars into his own cash registers, the installation of his own daughter and son-in-law into White House positions, the use of his office and his attorney general to squash investigations into himself and his companies, the attempted extortion of a foreign leader into hurting the political rival he feared most, the begging of a dictator for a favorable trade deal to help him win reelection, the open use of his office and White House staff to stage de facto campaign rallies, and on and on and on and on.",
            "That he would behave this way was not surprising in the least. He had lived his entire adult life in this manner, and the evidence was right out in the open, from his business dealings with the mob to the way he treated his “charity” as a personal slush fund, using it for everything from buying a $12,000 football helmet autographed by Tim Tebow to paying his son’s $7 Boy Scout dues. Sixty-three million Americans knew this, or actively chose not to know this, and decided they were fine with it.",
            "One such voter, in fact, worked with Trump for years and knew full well about his dishonesty and treachery. He told me he didn’t care. That the system needed shaking up, and that he wanted Trump to go in and be a bull in a china shop and smash things.",
            "That person is now a senior official in the administration.",
            "Trump’s handling of the pandemic, also, was entirely predictable.",
            "For starters, he only occasionally takes intelligence briefings. Both George W. Bush and Obama began their days with one. Trump spends the first several hours of his day watching television and tweeting about what he has just seen. In 2020, he has been taking between just one and two briefings each week.",
            "Meaning that when the experts were trying to tell him that something bad was happening in China and that we needed to prepare, Trump could not be bothered to listen. His top health officials were getting alarming news over the New Year’s holiday about a pneumonia-like outbreak in Wuhan. Trump was golfing. When his health and human services secretary finally got him on the phone nearly three weeks later to talk about the virus, Trump yelled at him instead about a backlash to vaping regulations that was going to hurt Trump with vapers.",
            "Indeed, Trump’s singular focus was then, and remains today, his own reelection. Nothing else matters, and that is now why well over a hundred thousand people in America killed by the coronavirus would still be alive if just about any other adult human being had been president instead of Trump.",
            "In January, winning a second term meant getting his “trade deal” with China signed. Not a harsh word could be spoken about the country or its dictator. Never mind that it wasn’t really a free trade agreement, just a partial unwinding of the trade war he had started. For Trump, it was everything. He repeatedly praised China and Xi Jinping for their “transparency” about the virus when the opposite was true.",
            "In February, trade deal signed, Trump saw increasing concerns about the virus as a direct assault on his reelection bid. He refused to take the pandemic seriously, even as it ravaged Italy and Iran. When a top CDC official warned that people’s lives were about to change dramatically, Trump was enraged because of the stock market sell-off this triggered. He told Americans via Twitter that thousands die from the flu every year and encouraged them to buy stocks. From the White House briefing room, he claimed he had done a fantastic job and that the 15 diagnosed cases to date would soon drop to zero. At one of his rallies, he even claimed that the virus had become his critics’ latest “hoax” and lumped it into the category that included his acceptance of Russian help to win the 2016 election (which was, by the way, true; he had, in fact, done that) and his impeachment over his extortion of Ukraine for help to win the 2020 election (which was also true; he actually did that as well).",
            "After seeming to take the threat seriously for a couple of weeks in the second half of March, Trump quickly grew bored of it and began demanding that states “reopen” their economies so he could go back to the campaign strategy that he had been planning: that is, taking credit for the economy Obama had left him.",
            "Numerous times, Trump repeated in remarks what he had tweeted on March 22, in all capitals: “WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF.”",
            "Indeed, just reading back through his various statements through the course of the pandemic is an exercise in shock and awe. “The coronavirus is very much under control in the USA.” “This is a flu. This is like a flu.” “I think that we’re doing a great job.” “It’s going to disappear. One day, it’s like a miracle, it will disappear.” “Just stay calm. It will go away.” “Slow the testing down, please.”",
            "And, of course, the statement that could easily wind up the epitaph of his presidency: “I don’t take responsibility at all.”",
            "If evil scientists had conspired to concoct a worse president for our country in a time of crisis, they would have been hard-pressed to outdo Trump. His ignorance, mendacity and stubbornness are a toxic mix in the best of times. Many of the adults in both parties assumed that eventually, when it was finally over, his most egregious messes in the area of trade policy, the NATO alliance, climate change and the environment could, with some work, be cleaned up.",
            "The same cannot be said for all the Americans who will have died unnecessarily because one of the worst human beings in public life — a man who has shown time and time again that his lack of humanity is matched only by his open corruption — happened to become our president.",
            "Perhaps something good can come of this, in the end. Maybe this hard lesson will bring back the idea that the presidency is not a game. That the judgment and the maturity and the smarts of the person behind that desk matter — and not in the way that most people think.",
            "There is a segment of the population that insists a president be “relatable,” to be someone they’d want to have a beer with. Others demand that a candidate match up completely with their preferred vision of the future, of the policies they want to see enacted, and failing such a person’s presence on the ballot, they will not vote at all. Still others — disproportionately, younger voters — believe they have a fundamental right to demand that a candidate inspire them, and failing such inspiration, they also will not bother voting.",
            "Maybe, perhaps, the election of a shameless, cheerfully corrupt con man whose selfishness and ignorance led to the sickness and death of so many of their fellow Americans will help these people grow the hell up.",
            "We don’t choose a heart surgeon or a tax accountant or an airline pilot using those criteria, and their jobs are not nearly as critical for the common good as the presidency of the United States. Sure, it would be nice for a president to be interesting and down-to-earth enough to seem relatable — but that’s not nearly as important as competence. There’s nothing wrong with supporting a candidate who shares your ideas and ideals. But making big changes takes time, and, in a crisis, an ideologue can be the worst personality to have in charge. You need someone willing to understand the world as it is, not insist on seeing the world as they feel it ought to be.",
            "As for inspiration — we do not pick the surgeon who is funnier or the accountant who spins out the most engaging anecdotes. Why do we conflate those traits with leadership?",
            "This is not new, by the way. People did not vote for John F. Kennedy because they believed he would bring thoughtful wisdom to the Oval Office. Ronald Reagan’s people learned from that and made his entire campaign — indeed, much of his presidency — a movie production. George H.W. Bush had, hands down, the most relevant experience of any president, and had governed with a low-key self-assuredness. Bill Clinton beat him by seeming more empathetic.",
            "In all three of those cases, though, the winning candidate exhibited an interest in a serious approach to the job during his campaign, and all three wound up demonstrating that in office. In contrast, Trump during his campaign showed he had little knowledge of how the world worked and made it clear he had no interest in learning. His view was that it was all easy and that any idiot could do it. Well, clearly, he was wrong.",
            "Forget all the insane promises he made that were not possibly deliverable. The only real promise that the biggest slice of his base wanted was to make America like it was in the 1950s, which even they knew was not possible. They didn’t care. They liked that he was willing to promise it to them and that he was willing to smash things and make “the establishment” mad.",
            "It is true that Trump did not even receive a plurality of the votes cast, and almost certainly would not have won without the combination of both Russian help and the Comey letters reopening and then reclosing his Clinton investigation in the campaign’s final days. Yet the fact remains that 46% of Americans casting ballots in the 2016 election did so for someone who was not remotely qualified for the job. This, nearly four years later, remains astounding.",
            "A significant percentage of them were perhaps not the most informed or sophisticated of voters and believed Trump really was the savvy and smart businessman he played on television. But what about the rest? They could see what he was all about but voted for him anyway. What does that say about their view of the importance of the job?",
            "Maybe the coronavirus pandemic can impart the lesson that, first and foremost, the person elected to the Oval Office has to be capable of handling the really bad things, the things you did not or even could not anticipate. Airlines don’t pay pilots $200,000 a year to set planes down on clear sunny days with little wind. They get paid well for their years of experience, for all the training they’ve had and the training they continue to undergo for the day the hydraulics fail and they lose an engine to a bird strike on final approach during a thunderstorm, with a bad crosswind. On a related note, nobody asks as they climb aboard whether the pilot is someone they’d like to have a beer with later, or what her views are on “Medicare for All.”",
            "Leadership matters, as has now been made abundantly clear.",
            "There was a terrific skit by “Saturday Night Live” in the late 1980s that portrayed Ronald Reagan as a doddering, increasingly detached granddad smiling and mouthing meaningless clichés to the news cameras as they demanded answers about the Iran-Contra scandal … and then, behind closed doors, transforming into a cunning mastermind who had personally directed every detail.",
            "This, roughly, was how Trump’s defenders in the Republican Party portrayed him during the 2016 election after they were stuck with him as their nominee. It was all an act, they promised. The unhinged rants, the constant tweeting, the outlandish lies — it was all performance art, they claimed, to appeal to a segment of the population that has long been disaffected with traditional Republican politics. Behind closed doors, they promised, he was a different person. A thoughtful and reasonable grown-up who sought divergent viewpoints before making decisions. This would be revealed in the off chance that he somehow won the election, particularly as the weight of the office burdened his shoulders.",
            "These claims, obviously, were lies — or, in the case of those who did not really know Trump very well, wishful thinking.",
            "There is no doubt that Trump can, on occasion, behave like a grown-up. But as insider account after insider account confirms the evidence of our own eyes and ears, it is this occasional grown-up behavior that is the act, the performance art.",
            "The real Trump is the one who bellows angrily at his critics and opponents, the one who posts absurd conspiracy theories on Twitter, who manically calls his safe circle of fawning sycophants for advice, who openly admires authoritarians around the world while attacking and insulting democratically elected leaders, who refuses to take responsibility for any of his failings and who is willing to do anything — extorting a foreign country, begging China’s dictator, egging on open racists, delegitimizing our own coming election — to hold on to power.",
            "The burdens of office have not weighed down on him a single bit. Compare photos of Bill Clinton, either of the Bushes or Obama before they took office and four years in. Note the graying hair, the worry wrinkles and weariness. Now, look at Trump before and today. More bloat, perhaps, but a face otherwise unchanged.",
            "He is now, and for decades has been, a middle school bully with the impulse control of a toddler. The only thing Donald J. Trump cared about before he took office was Donald J. Trump. That has not changed in these three and a half years.",
            "What’s remarkably missing in my multi-year exploration of Trump’s universe is a full-throated, or frankly, even half-hearted defense of any sort of basic, human decency in him. People defend his “economic” nationalism. They shrug and point out the judges he has appointed and the regulations he has rolled back. Others point to the tax cut and how he has helped their personal bank accounts. One White House aide told me that no other Republican elected in 2016 would have produced as many conservative policies as Trump has.",
            "Not one bothers to sell the idea that he is misunderstood and is, at heart, a good human being. Not one.",
            "This view is not restricted to those who work with him. Over the past four years, I have done countless interviews with Republican supporters who, after rattling off judges and tax cuts and deregulation, nevertheless concede in the end that they wish he would keep his mouth shut more and tweet less or even not at all. Which is about as open an admission of what they think of him as a person as is possible.",
            "His off-the-cuff remarks and his tweets — not the prepared speeches people write for him to read — are the most honest reflection of his true self. When his supporters say they wish he would hide that truth, it is because they understand precisely what kind of human being he is and how that is perceived by normal people with basic standards of conduct.",
            "Amazingly, that so often gets glossed over in all the talk about him. Sixty-three million Americans, and the quirks of the Electoral College, put into the most powerful office in the world a truly despicable person. Trump does not treat people well. He would cheat you as soon as look at you. He is spiteful and mean while also venal and ignorant. And none of this was hidden from view. Not a single bit of it. Yet people voted for him anyway.",
            "That says a lot about us. None of it good.",
            "Democracy is not easy.",
            "If there’s one lesson that needs to be learned from the Trump years, it is that one. Democracy is not easy, because for many, many people on this planet and in this country, freedom is not easy. For folks who more or less have it together, that may be hard to understand.",
            "While those who live and work in the world of ideas have the time and the inclination to ponder grand concepts and endless possibilities, a great many of our brothers and sisters struggle just to get through each day. As in, literally wonder how they will manage to make it until bedtime. Whether it’s anxiety or depression or the drugs and the alcohol with which they are often intertwined, so, so many people just want someone to tell them what to do and to take care of them.",
            "It’s no wonder that religions with strict rules on how to live one’s life hold such appeal and are growing so rapidly. The more rules, the better.",
            "This is the key to “populists,” who understand that a substantial number of people are perfectly fine with a strong leader who promises order in a universe that appears not to have any. In his 2016 run, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum understood this even as most in his party did not. The vast majority of people are not entrepreneurs who dream of starting their own businesses. Most people just want a steady job that will be there next year and in five years and in 20 years so they can buy a house and raise children and do all the things they’re supposed to do the way their parents did.",
            "Small wonder that a craven demagogue like Trump could take advantage of those insecurities and tell those people exactly what they wanted to hear.",
            "This has always been the inherent danger in the American experiment: Self-governance requires active engagement by the citizenry. Because things rarely work out as planned, the drafters of the Constitution came up with federalism and checks and balances. On top of all that, this country has been blessed by its massive size and its attendant bureaucracy. It’s hard to institute large-scale change of any kind, in any direction. People demanding action on the climate can attest to this. People pushing for universal health care can attest to this —indeed, have been attesting to this, for decades.",
            "Despite this, the fact remains that breaking things is easier than fixing them, as Trump has repeatedly demonstrated. With a 30% plurality of the populace interested in maintaining its cultural supremacy solidly behind him and a large enough slice of the Republican establishment willing to accept a Faustian bargain for the sake of its own agenda, he has gotten away with it.",
            "We can already see what this has done to our country after three and a half years. What happens if that three and a half becomes eight?",

            "An indoor wedding and reception in Maine last month resulted in at least 147 confirmed cases of COVID-19 across the state, including three deaths, state health officials said.",
            "The growing outbreak came after about 65 guests attended the Aug. 7 wedding in Millinocket, Maine. Just 10 days later, two dozen people directly associated with the event tested positive for the virus, the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention said.",
            "As of Sunday, additional confirmed cases linked to the wedding included 19 at the Maplecrest Rehabilitation and Living Center in Madison, Maine, where a member of a wedding guest’s household worked, Maine CDC spokesperson Robert Long told HuffPost. The nursing home is about 100 miles southwest of the Big Moose Inn, where the wedding reception took place.",
            "The event was also linked to a 72-case outbreak at the York County Jail, southwest of Portland, Maine, Long said.",
            "A jail staff member attended both the wedding and reception and was one of the first people at the jail to test positive for the virus, Maine CDC Director Nirav Shah told a news conference Thursday. Inmates made up the majority of those infected with the virus at the jail, followed by staff members and their families, Shah said.",
            "The three people who died from the virus did not attend the wedding or reception, Long said.",
            "The state CDC continued to investigate whether an outbreak at the Calvary Baptist Church in Sanford, Maine, was also connected to the Millinocket event. The church’s pastor, Todd Bell, officiated the wedding at a Millinocket church and reportedly admitted to his congregation last week that he was at the wedding.",
            "“I went to the wedding. I officiated the wedding. It was a beautiful wedding,” Bell said, according to News Center Maine. “Six families from our church went there. We never expected to get COVID. Nobody expected to experience the things that happened because you went to a beautiful thing like that.”",

            "Many kids across the country are starting the school year from the confines of their own homes, as both large school districts and individual parents are keeping students remote this fall.",
            "What can parents expect this fall? What’s been working and what hasn’t? A warning: It doesn’t seem to be going too great overall.",
            "We asked parents in our Facebook community whose kids have started the school year virtually about what we should know. Read on to find out what they had to say.",
            "“I live in Metairie, Louisiana, and my son is attending first grade virtually for at least the first nine weeks. He started yesterday, and naturally there were hiccups with the format. However, I am truly flabbergasted that in general the district seemed extremely underprepared for a virtual learning option. ... Teachers seem overwhelmed by the virtual format. So far, the majority of the class periods have been teachers telling students to mute their microphones. Our district had over half of the children sign up for virtual learning, and I am just really surprised at how poorly planned the whole scenario seems to be. I do not fault the teachers — this is out of their control — but I do question what the district leaders have done since they knew virtual was going to be a legitimate option.” ― Ashley Collins",
            "“I have two children in middle school in Texas, so I can’t really speak for other grades. Our district is doing ‘synchronous virtual learning’ on the bell schedule, just like if they were changing classes. During the first two weeks or so, the teachers spent about 80% of the class time just making sure the kids were following along with the technology and troubleshooting. This caused a lot of frustration, as some kids were not paying attention, not tech savvy; software glitches, etc., would slow everything down. Depending on the day, my kids are kicked out of Zoom classes at least twice a day, and sometimes the teachers do not realize the kids are in the ‘waiting room.’ It took one of my son’s teachers 20 minutes to let him back in, and by then he had missed the lesson. Kids get called out for looking away from the screen as it is interpreted as not paying attention. Teachers are doing their best, but they are ‘building the plane while flying it.’ Lots of grace, patience and walking away to breathe.” ― name withheld",
            "“I have been incredibly impressed by the organization, communication and patience of our teachers as my kids are learning virtually! The first grade teacher keeps the Google Meet open all day, even during lunch, recess and ‘specials’ (she turns off their microphones and cameras), and that way the kiddos aren’t having to try and log back in multiple times a day. The fifth grader can do almost everything on his own, and I’m impressed at how much he has taught his little brother. One struggle is that they don’t have the same lunch/recess/PE time, which means we make lunches the night before and set timers on our phones to make sure the kids go outside during ‘recess.’” ― Carrie McNeil",
            "“My only child has declared, every other day, that she is not doing this (virtual learning). And every other day she doesn’t. Sure, we have consequences for that decision — but the toolbox is slim, and the consequences don’t change her mindset. We have positive reinforcement for good days as well! Today, however, she declared she is quitting school. She closed her Chromebook every time I logged her in. She’s 12 assignments behind. So. It’s going really well, I’d say. ADHD + anxiety + depression = a virtual learner does not make. We’ve tried everything. Learning pod with other students. Independent learning. Tutors. Teacher’s aide to be an in-person resource. We’re fresh out of ideas, fresh out of pivoting options, fresh out of energy. Week 4 and we’re all about to quit.” ― Ashlee Reddick",
            "“We’ve been doing full remote with three kids, one in each school (elementary, middle, high). It’s fairly miserable. The technical difficulties are about 90% of the frustration. It has helped all my kids for me to print off a big sheet for each of them with their daily schedule, so it’s super easy to read and keep track of what they’re supposed to be doing at what times. I taped them up on the wall by their workspace.” ― Carrie Kindt",
            "“My kids went back Aug. 10. It’s much better than the distance learning we had last spring. They’re in and out of live instruction during the day, with independent assignments in between. My best advice is to give it a couple of weeks before you judge. There are going to be technical problems or things that don’t work right. Be patient, help your kids be patient. Things were running very smoothly for my kids by the middle of the second week. (I have kids in fifth, eighth and ninth grades.)” ― Krista Karlsson Henderson",
            "“I’m frustrated at how much my oldest likes it because it’s going to be a pain in the butt to get him back to in-person school without complaining.” ― Jacque Smith",
            "“I have a first grader and a second grader. We have found that a dry-erase calendar is very helpful for documenting Zoom meetings, assignment due dates, etc.” ― Laura Carnago Lewis",
            "“I’ve been in a blended ‘one day at school, homeschool the rest of the week’ [setup] for eight years now. We have developed ways to work since we’ve been doing it so long. First, I have rewards cards. There are 50 spaces on the card that they have to fill. Once they fill that card, they earn a monetary reward. I have to sign each space for every lesson they do. DEVOTE SPECIFIC TIMES. If you don’t designate a specific time for schoolwork, your kids will lag. I’ve noticed if I start schoolwork later than our designated time, my kids will be very lazy about getting to work. If your kid is struggling, TAKE A BREAK! All you’re going to do by yelling at your kid is make them cry, make yourself cry, and get no work done. Tell your kid that you understand that they’re struggling, so say ‘let’s get some fresh air’ outside, toss a ball, play with the dog, have a snack, then get back to it. Let your kids look at the lessons and see what they want to work on first. ... They will always pick the easier lessons, so make sure they work on at least one difficult one a day. If multiple kids need your help, have one work on the ‘easy’ lessons while you help with the difficult one, and then switch.” ― Jessica Marin Ibarra",
            "“We chose virtual rather than the in-person hybrid [option] because we wanted a more stable schedule than one that would be constantly changing based on infection rates. Our district seemed to have their act together when they sent out information on virtual school. It was supposed to be live Meets interspersed throughout the day with independent work. So far, it has been one live Meet that starts at 7:15 a.m. and lasts until 2:15 p.m. Our daughter (in fourth grade) just turns her camera off for lunch and recess. She hates it, and I hate it for her. She is not allowed to turn her camera off, even if she’s done with the work. We’ll likely be pulling her out to homeschool her by the end of the week. It’s not about patience while they work out the kinks in our case so much as this format is not going to work for my ADHD kid.” ― Ashley Lynn",
            "“My kids started early August. Our struggle was that there was not a consistent schedule each week. My youngest is 5 and starting kindergarten, and her class had a 60- to 90-minute class call every day to start. She never sat through an entire class. The virtual programs that the district use required quiz questions to be read to them by the parent. We struggled so much that I withdrew my kids from the public school last week when they cleared the waiting list at an all-online charter elementary school. Today is our second first day of remote learning.” ― Erin Chappell",

            "WASHINGTON ― Attorney General William Barr’s Justice Department is calling out D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) ― who had a massive “Black Lives Matter” mural painted on a street near the White House that she renamed to honor the movement for Black lives ― for blowing off the constitutional rights of anti-racist protesters in her own city.",
            "This story begins on the evening of Aug. 13, when a group of protesters was being trailed by police officers in the Adams Morgan neighborhood of the nation’s capital. After some people damaged property, D.C. Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) officers encircled a large number of protesters ― maybe one-third of the overall group ― in a “kettle,” detaining them for hours as they processed the arrests.",
            "Protesters on the scene didn’t understand why officers swept them up, deployed pepper spray and shoved them. Police released very little information justifying an aggressive response that swept up so many people. A MPD press release showed images of a Starbucks umbrella and newspaper boxes that had been set ablaze, but didn’t explain why police kettled protesters, a tactic that has often been found unconstitutional.",
            "Dozens of people were seized and held overnight. MPD wanted 42 of them charged with felonies under a rioting statute. But MPD officers didn’t identify the individuals actually responsible for property damage. Instead, they just sought to bring felony charges against most of those they’d trapped in their kettle.",
            "In the nation’s capital, the U.S. Attorney’s Office ― currently headed by a Trump administration official Barr appointed ― prosecutes both federal and serious local crimes. Prosecutors in the office evaluated MPD’s arrest reports and determined that nearly every one lacked probable cause. The office essentially determined that the rioting arrests, based on the information presented by MPD, were not justified.",
            "Absent a lawsuit against the city by the people who were arrested, that likely would’ve been the end of the story. But in an Aug. 31 letter to Acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Michael Sherwin, Bowser wrote that she was “dismayed” that prosecutors in his office “declined to prosecute 41 of the 42 rioting arrests” that were made on Aug. 13 and 14.",
            "It was a strange position for the mayor to take, but one that highlights the tension nationwide between anti-racist activists and protesters and the primarily Democratic mayors that preside over their cities.",
            "Bowser, a Black female Democrat in an overwhelmingly Democratic city, renamed a part of 16th Street NW “Black Lives Matter Plaza” in defiance of Trump and spoke out against the federal government’s response to protests on the city’s streets. Yet here she was, accusing the Trump administration’s Justice Department ― which has enthusiastically seized any opportunity to prosecute left-leaning rioters since protests broke out after the death of George Floyd in May ― of going soft on protesters who were indiscriminately seized by her own police force.",
            "So instead of quietly fading away, Bowser’s letter set off a new round of media coverage and allowed Sherwin to criticize Bowser ― quite credibly ― of brushing aside the protections guaranteed in the U.S. Constitution because she wanted to see “rioters” locked up. Bowser’s office did not respond to a request for comment.",
            "“As I am sure you are aware, without some evidence to establish probable cause of a particular arrestee’s criminal conduct ― e.g. police officer’s observations or video footage of the alleged crime ― we cannot bring federal charges,” Sherwin wrote. “Surely, by your comments, you are not suggesting that this Office skirt constitutional protections and due process.”",
            "Sherwin went on to say that “MPD’s arresting documents lacked sufficient probable cause to support any criminal charge,” publicly airing an embarrassing MPD failure that likely would’ve stayed mostly quiet were it not for Bowser’s letter. Sherwin also wrote that he met with MPD leadership to help develop the cases and “establish a bare minimum of probable cause” but said “no sufficient evidence” had materialized to justify the arrests of Aug. 13 and 14.",
            "“The ‘42 rioters’ were arrested as a collective by MPD and presented to the Office without any articulable facts linking criminal conduct to each individual arrested,” he wrote. “Simply put, we cannot charge crimes on the basis of mere presence or guilt by association.”",
            "Sherwin said the pattern repeated itself when MPD arrested 19 people for rioting over the weekend, but officers “failed to provide the bare minimum of articulable facts linking the charged persons with alleged individual criminal conduct.” Due to MPD’s lack of evidence, just one individual was charged.",
            "Sherwin also seemed to hint at the irony of Bowser laying into the federal response to protesters in D.C. even as her own police force engaged in what looked like unconstitutional conduct.",
            "“Your recent portrayal fo the federal response to violence in the District as insufficiently vigorous seems to contrast sharply with your earlier criticism of the federal response in the District as overly aggressive,” Sherwin wrote.",
            "There’s one huge factor looming over the U.S. Attorney’s Office’s decision-making process: Its near-total failure to secure convictions against hundreds of defendants swept up in a police kettle during demonstrations and rioting surrounding President Donald Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20, 2017.",
            "The government took an extremely aggressive posture in the “J20” cases, pursuing felony rioting conspiracy charges against defendants who they never alleged actually destroyed any property or committed any acts of violence.",
            "In an admission that sheds some light on Bowser’s current push for prosecutions, a former government prosecutor told HuffPost that Bowser’s office was advocating for charges against the J20 protesters as well.",
            "In tweets sent the day of Trump’s inauguration, Bowser wrote that she could “not condone crime and vandalism which are the antithesis of what we hope to accomplish today” and said that they would not allow visitors to “destroy our neighborhoods.” She tweeted that she supported MPD “as they have handled crowds and this event.”",
            "Rizwan “Rizzy” Qureshi was one of the Justice Department prosecutors on the J20 case. Now in private practice, he said he’s a Democrat who supports the Black Lives Matter movement and attended the 2017 Women’s March, which took place the day after Trump’s inauguration.",
            "Qureshi said it was important to note that Bowser’s office “pushed hard” for prosecutions after J20, and that politicians like her were no longer supportive when the case became a political liability for them. Now Bowser’s political rhetoric is impacting another case, only this time her actions are backfiring on the MPD.",
            "“Is Muriel Bowser taking political advantage of this because the guy who happens to be there happens to be a Trump guy? Yeah, sure, why wouldn’t she? Trump’s easy to rag on, and I think people should rag on him more often, especially after what his Department of Justice did in Roger Stone and other cases,” Qureshi told HuffPost. “But you shouldn’t make the prosecutors and the police officers who work tirelessly to enforce the laws and protect victims the collateral damage of your politics.”",
            "Qureshi said he believed that career prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney’s Office were making the calls on prosecutions and were not allowing politics to dictate their charging decisions.",
            "“What the acting U.S. attorney’s letter to Bowser makes clear is exactly what the jurors told us in the J20 cases,” Qureshi said. “Prosecutors are not going to proceed unless there’s actual evidence of that individual breaking property or engaging in violence, and I think that makes sense. You have to listen to juries because their guidance is instructive on the viability of a prosecution.”",
            "Kropf said there’s “no question” that Sherwin’s concerns about MPD’s lack of probable cause were rooted in the legal issues that came up during the J20 trial. She finds the politics of the dispute fascinating.",
            "“I’m like, wait a minute, I’m on the side of a Donald Trump-appointed prosecutor more than the mayor,” Kropf said. “The alignments here are interesting.”",
            "It may have taken a lot of resources, but Kropf said prosecutors were generally able to individually identify defendants using surveillance video and connect them with specific actions, even though most were wearing all black. She said there’s no reason why police couldn’t do the same here: actually attempt to connect individuals to specific conduct, and charge them under law.",
            "“I don’t think he’s holding MPD to an absurd standard,” Kropf said. “I do think what he’s saying is you can’t just kettle a big group of people, knowing that some people in that group committed property damage or assault on an officer, and expect that we’re going to charge all of those people. There’s nothing unusual about that standard.”",
            "Even in Democratic D.C., Kroft said, jurors would be willing to convict defendants if the government proved they engaged in property damage and violence.",
            "“D.C. is obviously a liberal community, but you don’t meet a lot of people who say, ‘Yes, in support of a cause ― no matter how much I agree with that cause ― that it’s OK to destroy property or, particularly, injure a police officer.’ I don’t think you’re going to see a lot of potential jurors who say that,” Kropf said. “If they can show it’s a person who’s actually damaging property or throwing something at an officer and so forth, I think a jury in D.C. would absolutely find someone guilty.”",
            "Steven McCool, a former federal prosecutor and defense attorney who represented a J20 defendant, said that D.C. jurors would fairly consider cases against people “destroying personal or business property,” so long as they believe “they have been fairly investigated and are prosecuted in an unbiased manner.”",
            "Broadly speaking, MPD had been known for taking a more progressive approach to protest policing than departments in many parts of the country. That’s both because protests occur so frequently in the nation’s capital and because extensive litigation has forced MPD to curb some of its worst behaviors.",
            "Yet despite their extensive protest experience and the outcome of the J20 cases, MPD has occasionally continued to kettle protesters. In the early days of the Floyd protests, a man living near D.C.’s historic U Street became a local folk hero after he allowed protesters into his home to protect them from the police officers who kettled them on his street.",
            "Bowser is “trying to say that she protected D.C. citizens, but under her watch mass arrests became a common police tactic to suppress demonstrators,” said Dylan Petrohilos, a J20 defendant who was also caught in the police kettle last month and was among those D.C. police wanted to charge, yet again, with a felony. “No one should expect to be mass arrested in the nation’s capital, right? This is where politics happens.”",
            "Bowser’s decision to go to the mat to defend questionable arrests has many wondering why she picked this battle. D.C. hasn’t exactly been overwhelmed by unrest in recent weeks. There have been a few high-profile incidents ― one involving confrontations between protesters and customers dining in outdoor street cafes amid an ongoing pandemic ― but nothing that would necessarily rise to the level of making Bowser politically vulnerable.",
            "“The only thing I can imagine is that she is feeling pressure from MPD, from the police union, to back up MPD, and the officers who are arresting people and believe they should be charged,” Kroft said.",
            "Bowser’s support for police ― even when they’ve tried to bring charges the Trump administration considered an overreach ― reveals why she’s not beloved by many in the local activist movement. She supported billionaire Michael Bloomberg in the Democratic primary and opposed a $15 million cut to the police department from the city’s overall $8.6 billion budget back in July.",
            "Anthony Lorenzo Green and other Black Lives Matter DC organizers denounced Bowser for touting her Black Lives Matter Plaza during the Democratic National Convention while opposing shrinking the police budget in her own city. Activists want governments to downsize their police budgets and reallocate that funding to integral, and often underfunded, social services like mental health care, affordable housing, job programs and education.",
            "“Mayor Muriel Bowser must be held accountable for the lip service she pays in making such a statement while she continues to intentionally underfund services and programs that meet the basic survival needs of Black people of Washington, D.C.,” Green told HuffPost in the days following Bowser’s DNC speech. “Mayor Bowser refused to answer the call and chose to stand with our oppressors.”",
            "“She is the closest thing to a Republican in Washington, D.C.,” says Petrohilos.",
            "Looking back at the J20 cases, Qureshi said the prosecutions would have been “way more successful” if prosecutors had “focused on only the breakers” instead of pursuing what he acknowledged was a “novel” and “aggressive” prosecution strategy under a law that hadn’t been used since the 1960s.",
            "McCool said elected officials in D.C. need to revisit the city’s rioting laws, especially considering the history of the statute.",
            "“These vague DC anti-rioting laws were written, after Dr. King was assassinated, to deter Black people, during the civil rights movement, from exercising their constitutional rights or even peacefully using the public streets,” McCool said. “The Council should take a hard look and rewrite these statutes so that those who commit crimes are prosecuted and people who are protesting or merely present at an assembly are not arrested without cause.”",
            "Qureshi pointed out that many of the victims who testified during the J20 trial were working-class people of color, and that the vast majority of J20 defendants were white.",
            "“There’s no question that the statute is imperfect,” says Qureshi. “But overwhelmingly, the breakers and the people who were arrested in connection with the Inauguration Day riots were white people, not Black people.”",

            "Ancient grains, which are described by the advocacy group Whole Grains Council as those that have been largely unchanged over the last several hundred years, have become quite the contemporary commodity. Over the past decade, grains like buckwheat, spelt, millet and, of course, the ever-present quinoa have become starchy staples on wellness-minded restaurant menus as well as many personal grocery lists.",
            "Given the many nourishing qualities attributed to ancient grains, it’s ironic that the grain packing the most powerful punch when it comes to health benefits happens to be the smallest in actual size and the newest available on the U.S. market ― fonio.",
            "Fonio is good for your health.",
            "Ancient grains, in general, are coveted for their nutritional value. Much more beneficial to the body than some of the most widely used varieties of rice, corn and wheat ― which have undergone centuries of breeding ― ancient grains offer an abundance of advantageous vitamins and nutrients.",
            "DJ Blatner, a Chicago-based registered dietitian, nutritionist and winning trainer on the 2016 ABC competition series “My Diet Is Better Than Yours,” recommends adding ancient grains to your diet for their “stress-fighting B vitamins, magnesium for muscle health, blood-building iron, and fiber for regularity and gut health.” She advises that “ancient grains can help feed good bacteria in our gut and healthier gut bacteria can help with everything from digestion to immunity to mood.” Ancient grains are also known to be relatively high in protein, which is beneficial for anyone on a plant-based diet.",
            "But fonio, specifically, goes above and beyond most ancient grains in many nutritional categories.",
            "Native to West Africa and considered “the seed of the universe” by ancient Egyptians, fonio has been grown in that region for over 5,000 years and is likely Africa’s oldest cultivated grain. This tiny member of the millet family is much more nutritious than its larger kin ― and most other grains, for that matter. It’s a great source of complex carbohydrates. Fonio is also a gluten-free grain with a low glycemic index, making it ideal for gluten-sensitive eaters and those who monitor their blood sugar.",
            "Fonio also fares much better than its fellow grains in calorie count. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1 cup of cooked fonio has 140 calories vs. 216 calories per cup of brown rice, 300 calories per cup of wheat pasta and 222 calories per cup of quinoa. Fonio is also high in the amino acids methionine and cysteine, both of which promote healthy hair, skin and nail growth but are not present in any other grain.",
            "It’s good for the planet, too.",
            "As beneficial to the body as fonio is, how it’s grown helps the environment as well. Fonio is generally a product of climate-smart agriculture ― that is, farming practices that sustainably increase productivity while reducing greenhouse gases.",
            "Pierre Thiam, co-founder and president of Yolélé Foods (a Brooklyn, New York-based fonio brand available at Whole Foods and Thrive Market), explained that fonio seeds are typically broadcast in soil, meaning they’re scattered by hand over soil that has been lightly prepared. Growing the grain requires no deep plowing, which is harmful to the soil.",
            "The resilient little seeds also tolerate a wide variety of soil types, varying rainfall levels and assorted elevations. Fonio is part of a traditional crop rotation in countries like Guinea, Nigeria, Cameroon and Senegal, which are among the largest producers of the grain.",
            "Thiam, who is a New York-based chef, seeks not only to return fonio “to its original glory that had been stifled by colonization,” but also to ensure that the regions that produce it, like his native Senegal, benefit long term from the grain’s global expansion.",
            "Like quinoa, fonio has the potential to be a huge economic boon for the small farms that grow it. But Thiam cautioned, “We are hoping to avoid quinoa’s disruptive boom and bust cycle, which posed problems for growing communities.” He said his company contracts with farmers to buy their crops at “attractive” prices while also working with them “to help them increase their productivity and thus their profits.”",
            "What it tastes like and how to eat it.",
            "If fonio’s nutritional benefits, environmental advantages and potential to financially assist the economy of African nations isn’t enough of a draw, the grain’s taste and texture, coupled with its foolproof and speedy preparation, should definitely seal the deal.",
            "Thiam described fonio as “light and fluffy” with “a slightly nutty, earthy flavor.” He said that it “soaks up spices and sauces beautifully” and that it can “replace any grain in your favorite recipes ... you can even use it in baked goods.”",
            "The recipe below should give you perfectly cooked fonio in approximately 6 minutes. However, all is not lost if for some reason it doesn’t go to plan. Thiam said it’s a very forgiving grain: “Fonio never embarrasses the cook!”",
            "His advice: “If it comes out too soggy, leave it on the heat for a little bit longer to cook off the liquid. If it’s dry, add a spoonful of water, cover, and cook for one minute.”",
            "How to cook fonio.",
            "In a pot with a lid, coat 1/2 cup fonio with 1 tablespoon oil. Turn heat to high, add 3/4 cup water (or low-sodium vegetable stock for savory dishes) and bring to a boil.",
            "Add a pinch of salt, stir, cover and turn heat to low for 1 minute.",
            "Turn off heat and let sit covered 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork. Serve hot or cold.",
            "Easy enough!"

            "Many of the tributes pouring in for Chadwick Boseman, who died last week at age 43 after a private battle with colon cancer, have emphasized his grace. “Black Panther” made Boseman one of the world’s preeminent movie stars, but those who knew him say he remained loyal, humble and philanthropic, leaving behind a legacy defined by forward-thinking generosity.",
            "Aakomon Jones witnessed Boseman’s ascent firsthand. A veteran choreographer who has worked with Usher, Madonna and Jennifer Lopez, Jones taught Boseman — an untrained dancer — how to capture James Brown’s famous moves for the under-appreciated 2014 biopic “Get On Up.” They had three short months to achieve a physicality that takes some performers years to perfect. Along the way, Jones found himself learning as much from Boseman’s dedication as Boseman did from Jones’ techniques. When the actor went on to make “Black Panther” a few years later, he asked Marvel to hire Jones to choreograph the spirited scene set at Warrior Falls, Wakanda’s king-making epicenter.",
            "In the wake of Boseman’s death, I asked Jones to reflect on their work together, from suggesting the actor do all of his own dancing in “Get On Up” to observing the spiritual journey that accompanied his superhero renown. What resulted was a conversation about a man who exuded dignity.",
            "Let’s start with how “Get On Up” entered your life and your initial thoughts about working on a project that required you to capture someone as specific as James Brown.",
            "Mick Jagger was one of the executive producers. I had worked with him on a music video before. By the time I was involved, [the producers] were considering a number of actors, but they were really more interested in Chadwick, so they brought me in to work with him on his screen test. I didn’t rehearse with him prior. It was literally that morning. I just tried to get him worked up enough for his screen test. We connected really quickly on that. He got the role and we got straight to rehearsals. I’m a student of James Brown. A lot of roads lead back to James Brown in terms of stage energy.",
            "I promise you ― and I remember it as though it was yesterday ― from day one of our rehearsals with Chadwick, I was absolutely convinced that he was going to be able to pull this off. And it wasn’t because he walked in day one already having it. He’s 6 feet tall [and] thin, trying to play this guy who was short, bowlegged and 5’7” ― a little running-back type of guy. So the physicality already had us at a disadvantage, but Chadwick had impressed upon me a work ethic and a passion for the arts that had me reassured that this is going to work because this guy is showing up to work before I am. He’s dancing as long as I can dance, and I think I can go for hours and hours. He can go for a couple more.",
            "At that point, you were accustomed to working with experienced dancers, having choreographed for folks like Usher and Madonna. Chadwick was not a dancer. So what did it take for both of you to feel ready and comfortable to carry the movie?",
            "For me, it was just time. That’s all I would just ask for. We’re trying to pack 30 years of dance experience into three months. That’s crazy to think of, but that’s what we’re all charged with. Chadwick was so invested beyond the moves because there’s the physical, technical aspect of it and then there’s also the “How do I connect this to the character?” That was always the angle with which Chadwick would approach our rehearsals. In the moment that I would force him to sit down and take a break and have some water, I would step away and turn right back around and he’s reading another chapter in some James Brown biography that he had read because he remembered something that he connected to the dance we were doing.",
            "Do you have a specific example of an emotional trigger point from either James Brown’s life or the way Chadwick related to James Brown that directly informed some of the choreography?",
            "Yes, one thing in particular. Chadwick is a martial artist ― well before “Black Panther,” he was always practicing martial arts ― and very athletic. I always reference dancers as being athletes because you literally have to be that. But before James Brown became the James Brown we all know and love, he was a boxer, and Chadwick picked up on that. If you look at James Brown in that context, you see how he would ball his fist or how he would work his footwork or how he would dance holding up a guard, in a boxing stance. I would watch Chadwick explain it to me and do it better than I was trying to teach it to him.",
            "How ready was he by the time cameras were rolling?",
            "Were we prepared on that first shoot date? Yes. He was confident. I was confident in him. He was ready. From the moment we started principal photography, there may have been one and a half numbers that we had yet to design that he would have to find time to learn. And number one on the call sheet, it’s hard to get access to them after we start shooting. But he was so good at that point, to where the process and teaching him something new was like lightning speed because he was such a well-oiled machine with regards to being James Brown. So, a new number? Easy. We can knock it out quick because he had done the work. My relationship with him would be just to keep him anchored. And to be able to share the stage in a couple of those numbers [as singer Bobby Bennett], that meant the world to me.",
            "In many movies where actors play dancers, the camerawork is designed so we never see the person’s full body and can never know there’s a double doing most of it. “Get On Up” is different. Those strategic cuts don’t exist, so we know that Chadwick is doing all of his own work. Was that the plan all along?",
            "That was not the thought going in. The thought from producers was, “We need to discuss ways to double Chad.” That kind of was everyone’s anticipation because that’s what we do [in movies]: We protect the artists with regards to making sure they come across on-screen. I personally was anti that, but I wasn’t going to speak on that until I was certain that we were going to be able to pull this off. So day one in rehearsal, I was like, “Oh no, we’re not doing any body doubles. Nope.” And he was down for it. He felt and he understood — and I’ll say this because I’ve heard him say it in an interview, and I say this with the utmost humility — my level of confidence in him. Because if you’re not a professional dancer and you’re now playing James Brown, what an undertaking. But he did it. As one of the accessories to that journey, it made me want to work that much harder.",
            "What was the dance move that was the hardest to work through and achieve the results that both of you wanted?",
            "There’s so much that you have to do to try to perform like James Brown, but the toughest thing for him physically was being able to drop down into that split and come right back up. I mean, he’s blessed to be 6 feet. That’s a blessing, unless you’re trying to do that. We would work on that, and he understood the muscle groups that were required so he could train on those. Those hamstrings and that inner leg strength to draw your body back up off of the floor, that’s tough. And you’re in dress shoes. That was the toughest thing physically for him to do at that rate of speed in the middle of a performance when you’re already fatigued and sweating and singing.",
            "What do you remember about seeing the film for the first time and how you and Chadwick felt about it?",
            "The experience was a dream experience. I’ll tell you this specific memory. Tate [Taylor, the director] invited Chadwick and I to his offices to watch his first edit and get our feedback. So it was just three of us sitting in the room. We looked at it and he had his notes, but it was really beautiful and awesome to sit with the two of them and watch that first draft. After we talked about it, we started talking about what our next projects were. And in that conversation, Chadwick said, “I have some meetings with Marvel coming up.” And they didn’t tell him what those meetings were for. Being comic book heads, we’re sitting there speculating on, “Who is it? I think I know.” It’s just fun for me to think back to that day, as we watched “Get On Up” for the first time and he was on his way to have these meetings, not knowing what they were for. Years later, here we are.",
            "You were catching him on that last wave before he entered the huge, global stardom that comes with being part of that franchise.",
            "Absolutely, and Marvel couldn’t have chosen a better guy for that. All the things that “Black Panther” role embodies, he was really that beforehand. He was always about upward mobility. He was about the underdog. He was about taking his artistry seriously, and he was forever a student.",
            "You did some work on “Black Panther.” How did that come about?",
            "I was there doing “Pitch Perfect 3” in Atlanta [where Marvel movies also shoot] and so we were able to cross paths a couple of times: “Oh, I’m having a barbecue, come through,” or “Oh, you’re in town? Let’s kick it.” We would hang out. But then there were the scenes [in “Black Panther”] where there was an opportunity for dance. That’s one thing that I always said about Chadwick: He used his leverage at every stage of his career to help someone else, to bring someone else on. I personally heard him have conversations with producers about the importance of choreography and dance. Choreographers are oftentimes an anomaly in the industry, so we have to fight to get that appreciation because you won’t see one of us on set every day.",
            "So he brought you on for “Black Panther”?",
            "He brought me on for “Black Panther.” In African tradition, a lot of tribes would have a war dance. In Asian martial arts, you call it a kata. So I would work with him on some of that. For the Warrior Falls scene where they choose the new king, you can have an opportunity to challenge the king. I worked on all the tribes and their movements, driving on the boats, up in the waterfall, what have you.",
            "They weren’t looking for a choreographer to help with that, but Chadwick expressed the importance of it. He called on me, and you got to know I came running top-speed. It was, of course, Marvel’s “Black Panther.” Who doesn’t want to be a part of that? But I’m not lying to you: My reasoning for not thinking twice was because he called. That meant the world to me that he put his neck on the line even in a small way. I can’t thank him enough for that.",
            "You mentioned what it was like for him to be number one on the call sheet during “Get On Up,” so I can only imagine what it was like to be number one on “Black Panther,” which was budgeted around $200 million. How did the machinery of that franchise and the size of the production change the nature of what you guys were doing together?",
            "Well, the nature of what was required meant that I didn’t need as much time with him. But in terms of the scale, when you got to Chadwick, you didn’t feel the scale. It still felt small and personal, in a good way. He has a theatrical background, so he just made it seem like, “Hey, I know you, we cool. I’m so glad you’re here. Hey, check this out. What do you think about this or that?” He’s immediately engaging you in a way that makes you forget this is the biggest, craziest, most amazing thing you would ever want to be involved in.",
            "I don’t think anybody at the time could have predicted that “Black Panther” would cross a billion dollars, even though there was a lot of enthusiasm around the movie. Still, he had to know that it would vault him into this upper echelon of fame and also that the movie would mean a lot to a lot of people. I’m curious whether you saw that in him and whether he was readying himself for that change in his life.",
            "Absolutely, because he would use his leverage in the way that he did. He was already in the culture of helping others and bringing others with him: “If I’m about to skyrocket into the stratosphere, I’m not going alone just to make new friends when I get there. No, I want those others who were with me to experience that.” He was very well-prepared from a spiritual standpoint. The movie touched upon the importance of staying connected to ancestors. He already had that language. He would bring a djembe drum to rehearsals for “Get On Up.” We were doing soul music in the ’60s, but that’s the rhythms that really got him going in the morning.",
            "It’s poetic that he was chosen for [the Black Panther role] because he was more than deserving. He’s very kinglike, and not king like “I rule over,” but “I’m the king who brings the community, and I lead from that perspective.” I can’t say enough on that. On day one of our rehearsal for “Get On Up,” he told me, “Man, as a kid growing up, I always wanted to be in an action movie, and I’m fortunate enough to play in all these biopics when I really got into acting to one day be in an action movie.” And then fast-forward, you are the greatest action character that we know right now. I think he handled that level of success with such grace and responsibility because he always felt responsible and respectful of what was happening. Didn’t take any of it for granted. That’s one thing that I know for a fact.",
            "Is there a defining anecdote or memory about Chadwick that I haven’t already prompted that sticks out to you?",
            "Sometimes it’s the small things that let you know the character of a person. There have been two times that I’ve been out in public where he has gone out of his way to say hello. This is after the major success of “Black Panther.” One of them was at the airport. I was coming in, he was coming out. Another time, we were literally on the street. He was just always sending love and sending vibes and checking in on you. I’m like, there must be 10,000 people in your life every day, but you would still take time to reach out to people and to connect with them.",

The list also includes clergy from diverse theological positions ― from the progressive Christian pastor Rev. Nadia Bolz-Weber, long a critic of President Donald Trump, to the evangelical preacher Rev. Rob Schenck, a former militant anti-abortion rights activist who has pledged to vote for a Democrat for the first time in 44 years.",

John McCullough, president of the Christian humanitarian group Church World Service, Bishop Vashti McKenzie of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, and Rev. Greg Boyle, a Los Angeles Roman Catholic priest.",
            "Lisa Sharon Harper, a Christian writer and founder of the faith-based consulting group Freedom Road, told HuffPost she believes Biden is a “man of true faith” who is guided by Jesus’ commandment to love God and love one’s neighbor. Harper decided to break from her regular practice and explicitly endorse the Biden-Harris ticket because she believes “now is the time for clarity.”",
            "“There is no time to mince words. A second Trump term could deal a mortal blow to our democracy. It would surely deal a mortal blow to the witness of the evangelical faith,” Harper, who identifies as evangelical herself, told HuffPost.",
            "“Faith leaders will be held accountable by God and history for how we used our voices right now,” she added. “Did we bless our neighbor or did we curse them. That will be the question.”",
            "Faith 2020 calls itself a “group of friends and neighbors” who are backing Biden and Harris to “lead us in restoring our nation’s values.” Its bid to create a “big-tent, multi-faith coalition” echoes one of the main messages of outreach that marked last month’s Democratic National Convention.",
            "The endorsement list was spearheaded by the head of Faith 2020′s board, Rev. Fred Davie, the executive vice president of New York’s Union Seminary, according to the Religion News Service.",
            "The list of supporters, first published with about 350 names last Thursday before swelling in size, comes as the Biden campaign expands its outreach to communities of faith. The former vice president’s team hired an evangelical Christian and former Republican, Josh Dickson, as its national faith engagement director in July. Religious voters were explicitly courted during the party’s convention that sought to highlight Biden’s faith as a Roman Catholic. Biden’s campaign has also been targeting specific groups of faith voters in swing states, including Latino evangelicals, Catholics, Hindus and young people of faith.",
            "“For too long the Republican Party has hijacked faith,” Faith 2020′s executive director Rev. Adam Nicholas Phillips told HuffPost in an email. “It’s outrageous to think that Donald Trump would be ‘the values candidate’ in 2020, especially, as he consistently stokes racial division and lets neighbors near and far lose loved ones and livelihoods amidst the pandemic.”",
            "Phillips, a progressive evangelical pastor from Portland, Oregon, also pointed to the scandals surrounding Trump’s “so-called faith supporters” ― such as Liberty University’s ex-president Jerry Falwell, Jr., who was pushed out of his post after a sex scandal, Pastor John MacArthur, whose church has been flouting COVID-19 regulations, and the conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who has helped to spread the patently false QAnon conspiracy theory.",
            "“These guys are outliers, not representative of faithful Americans,” Phillips said.",
            "Phillips said he believes Biden and Harris are the “morally serious candidates” that faith-motivated voters are looking for, especially on issues such as systemic racism. He also said he believes religious voters across party lines are deeply committed to “welcoming the stranger,” a goal that in his view Trump’s “cruel” policies toward migrant children and refugees has harmed.",
            "“Most faithful Americans are increasingly inclusive and forward-looking ― looking for justice and healing, not tired old toxic ways,” Phillips said."

            "Catch the “Three Chords and a Lie” trailer above.",
            "The movie, which had its U.S. premiere at Outfest Los Angeles last week, succeeds in placing Stansell’s story in the broader context of country music, still seen as a conservative genre. Gay CMT personality Cody Alan and singer Shelly Fairchild, who lost a recording contract when she came out as a lesbian, appear in interviews.",
            "But the film’s most poignant moments show Stansell breaking down in tears in rehearsal while recalling his family’s refusal to accept him as his authentic self, and being approached by young LGBTQ people at a Pride festival who thank him for living his truth.",
            "“I think the movie can potentially help people like me, and families with people like me in them,” Stansell, 33, told HuffPost. “Even though I want to share my experiences, they’re really hard to share. I don’t take people home with me. There are sides of the coin I don’t really talk about ― not intentionally, but just because they’re hard to talk about. But if I had thrown up walls along the way, we would’ve ended up with something a lot different.”",
            "Five years after the release of his debut single, “Dear John,” Stansell has come to occupy a unique niche within country music. Earlier songs like “Slow Down” and “Never Know,” for example, directly speak to the men he has loved. Newer tracks like “Hurt People” and “Like Us” relay the broader struggles of the LGBTQ community, namely the ostracism many queer people face at home and in the workplace.",
            "In 2018, he set a new precedent when the video for his song “Hometown” premiered on CMT and became the first queer-themed clip to receive airplay on the country music network.",
            "“If country music is about storytelling, then it should be about telling everybody’s stories, all stories,” he said. “Until now, the queer stories in this genre have been missing. I have the vehicle of music and a passion for sharing my experiences in a way that I think can help change the way that we treat queer people in this world. I want to be a part of that.”",
            "Following the premiere of “Three Chords and a Lie,” Stansell plans to spend the remainder of 2020 collaborating remotely with songwriters and producers on a six-song EP, slated to drop next year. The new music, he said, the “antithesis” of the four acoustic tracks he recorded for the film and more in the celebratory vein of his 2019 single, “Top Shelf.”",
            "And he remains hopeful his parents and siblings will make a point to watch the documentary. Regardless of whether that happens, however, he believes its family-focused message will resound among viewers who are open to hearing it.",
            "“Trying to convince my family that I’m not a broken person, that there’s nothing wrong with me ― that isn’t my job,” he said. “So I just keep rolling along and singing the songs, and doing what I do.”"

            "“Black Panther” director and co-writer Ryan Coogler revealed that his late friend Chadwick Boseman helped come up with one of the film’s most memorable lines.",
            "In an emotional tribute to Boseman, who died at his home in Los Angeles on Friday after a lengthy battle with colon cancer, Coogler explained how Boseman was deeply involved in the filmmaking process.\n\n“He would come to auditions for supporting roles, which is not common for lead actors in big budget movies. He was there for several M’Baku auditions. In Winston Duke’s, he turned a chemistry read into a wrestling match. Winston broke his bracelet,” Coogler said on Sunday. “In Letitia Wright’s audition for Shuri, she pierced his royal poise with her signature humor, and would bring about a smile to T’Challa’s face that was 100% Chad.”",
            "During filming, Coogler said he and Boseman would often meet to “discuss lines and different ways to add depth to each scene.”\n\n“We talked costumes, military practices. He said to me, ‘Wakandans have to dance during the coronations. If they just stand there with spears, what separates them from Romans?’” he continued. “In early drafts of the script, [Erik] Killmonger’s character would ask T’Challa to be buried in Wakanda. Chad challenged that and asked, ‘What if Killmonger asked to be buried somewhere else?’”\n\nThe director was referring to Michael B. Jordan’s character, Killmonger, whose final line in the film is, “Why? So you can just lock me up? Just bury me in the ocean with my ancestors who jumped from ships, ’cause they knew death was better than bondage.”",
            "Last year, Marvel Studios Chief Kevin Feige told The Hollywood Reporter that he thought the line was “one of the best lines” he had ever read, and that he’d even encouraged filmmakers to “build more of the movie around it.”\n\nSince Boseman’s death, fans and co-stars in the Marvel community have come out in droves to mourn his loss. On Monday night, Jordan shared a similarly heart-wrenching tribute to his friend.\n\n“I’ve been trying to find the words, but nothing comes close to how I feel. I’ve been reflecting on every moment, every conversation, every laugh, every disagreement, every hug…everything,” he wrote on Instagram. “I wish we had more time.”"

            "Puerto Rican voters stand to play a critical role in the Democratic primary for Massachusetts’ 1st Congressional District, where progressive Holyoke Mayor Alex Morse is hoping to unseat Rep. Richard Neal, one of the most powerful Democrats in Congress.",
            "Nearly one in five residents of the vast House district, which encompasses parts of central and Western Massachusetts, is Latino, the overwhelming majority of whom are Puerto Rican.",
            "But who wins the race could also have an effect on the lives of Puerto Ricans who remain on the island.",
            "That’s because Morse and Neal have staked out starkly different stances on how the United States should respond to Puerto Rico’s decadeslong debt crisis, compounded by a series of deadly hurricanes in recent years and the COVID-19 pandemic.",
            "On his campaign website, Morse declares his support for getting rid of the U.S.-run fiscal oversight board (known in Puerto Rico as “La Junta”) that has veto power over Puerto Rico’s budget, canceling Puerto Rico’s debt, and giving the people of the U.S. commonwealth full “self determination” to decide their status vis-a-vis the mainland United States.",
            "“Alex understands the urgency of this moment for Puerto Rico, having served people migrating from the Island to Holyoke searching for economic stability,” Morse campaign manager Max Clermont told HuffPost in a statement. “We can’t expect to trust Neal to act with urgency on this issue when he’s failed to use his accumulated power through a quarter century to fix a crisis that he’s helped create, nor when he’s had a shared agenda with Wall Street.”",
            "At least one Puerto Rican Morse supporter said his stance on Puerto Rico was a motivating factor for her. Morse “understands the need for Puerto Ricans to determine our own destiny, and that starts with abolishing La Junta, followed by canceling the debt, and entrusting working committees composed of on the ground grassroots organizations, community and municipal leaders to move the nation forward,” said Gladys Franco, a school administrator from Springfield who supports Morse.",
            "Neal’s campaign website has a far glossier section on Puerto Rico, complete with photos of Neal attending Puerto Rican parades in the district.",
            "But while it notes Neal’s efforts to secure additional aid for victims of Hurricane Maria, and his efforts to celebrate Puerto Rican culture through the creation of a Hispanic Heritage Month and the construction of the National Museum of the American Latino, it does not reference the debt crisis directly.",
            "Asked what Neal thought about the fiscal oversight board and restructuring Puerto Rican debt, his campaign spokesperson Kate Norton responded with a statement that did not explicitly address either topic.",
            "“Richie Neal believes that the fundamental issue of rebuilding and stabilizing the economy must be the highest priority, and without this resolved the debt will only grow exponentially without any hope for a sustainable future for Puerto Rico,” Norton said.",
            "At the heart of the discussion over how the U.S. government should proceed in Puerto Rico is a debate about the effectiveness of the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA), a bipartisan bill enacted in June 2016.",
            "The bill’s proponents cast it as a positive, if imperfect, source of relief for Puerto Rico, which suffers under a $74 billion public debt burden that most experts believe the island will never be able to pay down.",
            "On paper, the bill created a path for Puerto Rico to discharge debt that it was previously unable to write off. Unlike municipalities and public corporations on the mainland, Puerto Rico’s indebted public entities do not have the authority to declare bankruptcy to restructure their debts.",
            "The problem is that the law also created a seven-person, unelected fiscal oversight board that must approve any write-downs of the debt. Critics charge that the panel, which is stacked with fiscal conservatives like Andrew Biggs of the American Enterprise Institute and corporate executives like José Carrión III, has proved far more willing to keep the burden of fiscal austerity on the island’s most vulnerable residents, rather than the bondholders who own Puerto Rico’s debt.",
            "Under the board’s watchful eye, the island has been forced to slash spending on public university tuition and public employee pensions. Those cuts, the continued economic stagnation on the island, and Hurricane Maria in 2017, have accelerated an exodus of working- and middle-class families to the mainland U.S. Due to the hurricane alone, an estimated 100,000 Puerto Ricans migrated to the mainland, including a significant number who have arrived in Holyoke and Springfield.",
            "What’s more, some of the bondholders to whom Puerto Rico is indebted are “vulture capitalists” who purchased the debt from other creditors at a discount and are now using their deep-pocketed political influence to ensure they are repaid at the original dollar value of the debt.",
            "PROMESA, passed by the Republican-controlled Congress and signed by then-President Barack Obama, had the support of the vast majority of congressional Democrats. Just 12 members of the Senate Democratic Caucus voted against the bill, and 24 Democrats in the House. Neal was not among the two dozen “no” votes.",
            "Former Rep. Luis Gutiérrez, a Chicago Democrat from Puerto Rico who served with Neal for 26 years, told HuffPost unprompted that reelecting Neal is an important step in the fight to restructure Puerto Rico’s debt on more favorable terms. (Gutiérrez, who retired at the beginning of 2019, voted against PROMESA.)",
            "“Massachusetts is going to play a great role in Puerto Rico’s development,” said Gutiérrez, who moved to Puerto Rico after leaving Congress. “Let me tell you why: There is no one who was clearer on reducing the debt in Puerto Rico and dismantling this terrible fiscal control board than Richie Neal.”",
            "Asked how Gutiérrez reconciled his confidence in Neal with Neal’s vote for PROMESA, Gutiérrez responded that many progressive lawmakers with whom he works closely voted for the bill at the time, including fellow Puerto Rican lawmakers Nydia Velazquez and José Serrano of New York. (Another Massachusetts Democrat facing a tough reelection battle, Sen. Ed Markey, voted against the bill; his challenger, Rep. Joe Kennedy III, voted for it.)",
            "“Now a lot of people see the damage that [PROMESA] is causing,” Gutiérrez said.",
            "Massachusetts state Rep. Carlos González, another Puerto Rican who has endorsed Neal, had a similar defense of Neal’s vote for the bill, claiming that many Puerto Ricans in Western Massachusetts supported the bill at the time.",
            "Four years after its passage, though, Puerto Ricans in Massachusetts’ 1st District have turned against the law, and González expressed confidence that Neal would hear them out.",
            "“It’s time to eliminate the PROMESA and eliminate the debt that Puerto Rico has acquired because of vulture capitalists. … That’s an issue that we will be addressing with the congressman as well,” González said, though he conceded he had not received any assurances on the matter yet from Neal.",
            "As chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Neal does not have direct jurisdiction over Puerto Rico. U.S. policy for the island is usually under the purview of the House Committee on Natural Resources.",
            "But as Neal is fond of noting, his nearly 32 years in Congress have afforded him influence that extends far beyond the boundaries of his committee. He has, for instance, the ear of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who starred in one of the Neal campaign’s TV ads.",
            "Morse’s Puerto Rican backers are skeptical, though, that Neal would ever be inclined to side with Puerto Rico against the island’s creditors given the massive sums of campaign cash that Neal receives from Wall Street. Executives at BlackRock, an asset management fund that holds over $110 million in Puerto Rican debt, contributed $10,000 to Neal’s reelection campaign this cycle through the firm’s political action committee.",
            "Neal “can be trusted to do what the bondholders tell him to do,” said San Juan, Puerto Rico, Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz, who is supporting Morse. “He cannot ― he absolutely cannot ― be trusted to fight for the best interests of the Puerto Rican people.”",
            "Neal has said that his policy positions are not influenced by donors.",
            "“If you contribute to my campaign, you buy into my agenda,” the congressman said during a televised debate with Morse on Aug. 17. “I’m not buying into yours.”"

            "“In the early 1660s, there were numerous outbreaks of plague in Restoration London, especially the Great Plague of 1665, during the reign of Charles II,” she said, which drove the king and his court out of the city for months.",
            "“For centuries, the monarch has faced the challenge of acting as a unifying force while remaining in comparative seclusion during times of plague and pandemic,” said Harris.",
            "Windsor Castle hardly represents a flight from the queen’s duties either. Harris said it is “a place that symbolizes the continuity of the monarchy over the past thousand years.”",
            "“Windsor Castle has existed since the Norman Conquest (though it has been renovated and rebuilt many times since then, most recently after the fire of 1992) and the reigning dynasty also took its name from the castle in 1917,” the author noted.",
            "Harris predicts that one of the queen’s first public engagements again will be coronavirus-related and deal with essential workers, just like Prince William, Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall’s first events out of quarantine.",
            "“The Queen will probably meet with health care workers and other first responders to thank them for their efforts during the pandemic,” she said. “The Queen may also want to meet with individuals who contracted the illness and recovered in order to hear about their experiences.”",
            "Throughout the past few months, we’ve heard little about the queen’s own experience with the pandemic and only seen one in-person event, when she knighted Capt. Tom Moore at Windsor. But William Hanson, etiquette coach and executive director of The English Manner, described it as a sign of sacrifice that Elizabeth has limited her in-person engagements and carried on without a word of public complaint.",
            "“By The Queen scaling back her commitments, making big changes to her lifestyle, she once again sets the tone for the nations over which she reigns,” he said. “If The Sovereign can make personal sacrifices and not see her family and friends without grumbling, so can the rest of us.”",
            "While it’s unlikely that the queen will return to Buckingham Palace before the end of the year, the Sunday Times expects that she will still head to her Sandringham estate for the Christmas holiday.",
            "If the queen needs any guidance as to what she should say in her annual Christmas address this year, she can look for inspiration from her famous “Annus Horribilis” speech in 1992 ― the year in which a fire destroyed 115 rooms in Windsor Castle; Sarah, Duchess of York was caught in a toe-sucking scandal; and the queen’s three oldest children announced they were separating from or divorcing their spouses. That November, the queen said:",
            "1992 is not a year on which I shall look back with undiluted pleasure. In the words of one of my more sympathetic correspondents, it has turned out to be an “Annus Horribilis.” I suspect that I am not alone in thinking it so. Indeed, I suspect that there are very few people or institutions unaffected by these last months of worldwide turmoil and uncertainty.",
            "In the meantime, as Hugo Vickers, a broadcaster, royal biographer and author of “The Crown Dissected,” told HuffPost, it is important to take as many precautions as possible to safeguard the health of the queen and the Duke of Edinburgh. Not just because they’re royal, but because they’re in a vulnerable age group.",
            "“Under normal circumstances, we would not be wondering why two nonagenarians were living quietly,” he said, adding that the queen “should not emerge until it is known that it is safe, and that may be a long time off.”",

            "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP’S motives for a planned visit to Kenosha, Wisconsin, this week are already being called into question. The White House announced Saturday that the president intends to visit Wisconsin following the police shooting of a Black man, Jacob Blake, and the filing of charges against a Trump supporter suspected of killing two protesters who gathered on Blake’s behalf.",
            "On Sunday, California Rep. Karen Bass (D) said Trump’s plan to visit Kenosha on Tuesday serves “one purpose and one purpose only, and that is to agitate things and to make things worse.”",
            "Wisconsin Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes also commented Sunday about the pending visit, saying the people of the state “don’t need that right now.”",
            "The state attorney general on Wednesday identified the officer who shot Blake as Rusten Sheskey. Blake, 29, was shot in the back at least seven times as he walked away from police and tried to enter his car. Blake’s children were in the back seat when he was shot, and his attorney says Blake is now paralyzed from the waist down.",
            "Blake’s shooting ignited protests for racial justice in Wisconsin, much like similar protests that have been smoldering around the United States following the widely publicized police killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor months ago. On Tuesday, Gov. Tony Evers (D) declared a state of emergency as protesters clashed with police through the night and armed vigilantes with assault rifles arrived on the scene, characterizing themselves as a pro-police presence. That night, two protesters were killed. A 17-year-old from Illinois has been charged in the deaths.",
            "The suspected shooter has been celebrated by prominent conservative figures, including Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson. On Sunday, the president liked a tweet celebrating the teen ― who was once pictured in the front row of a Trump rally ― and justifying why people like him vote for Trump. The president was far more reserved in discussing Blake’s shooting by police, saying Friday he will “pretty soon” announce whether he thinks police were justified in shooting Blake seven times.",
            "On Saturday, the White House said Trump plans to speak with law enforcement and survey property damage during his visit to Kenosha. Blake’s family members said Friday they had not heard from the White House and didn’t know of any plans for Trump to meet them.",
            "Trump’s hypocrisy when it comes to violence isn’t new. He has eagerly stoked and celebrated racist violence when it has served him politically. Before this week, the most glaring example of such allyship was, perhaps, his claim that some of the white supremacists who gathered in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017 were “very fine people.”",
            "But Trump has leaned more heavily into white grievance politics since then. Particularly, as polls have continued to show him trailing Democrat Joe Biden in the presidential race, Trump has used the levers of government more overtly to incite and inflict fear and violence on his political rivals.",
            "As protests against police violence toward Blake were ramping up this week, Trump was accepting the Republican Party’s nomination for president on the White House lawn, during a convention designed to inflame white anxiety over racial justice movements. Throughout the week, prominent GOP politicians touted Trump’s respect for “law and order,” but others highlighted during the Republican National Convention revealed the racist contradiction in their message.",

            "During his closing RNC speech on Thursday, Trump used similar language to instill fear in Americans over movements for racial justice in cities across the U.S.",
            "“In the strongest possible terms, the Republican Party condemns the rioting, looting, arson and violence we have seen in Democrat-run cities like Kenosha, Minneapolis, Portland, Chicago and New York,” he said.",
            "Although anti-racist protests have gained traction in every state since June, Trump’s focus on demonizing specific cities is heightening concern that Kenosha ― like Portland and Washington, D.C., recently ― will become the latest stage for Trump’s desperate, political show of force."

            "President Donald Trump’s top civil rights official at the Department of Justice announced this week that he was considering launching investigations into how state-owned nursing homes responded to the coronavirus. The four states he targeted all have Democratic governors. This highly unusual public announcement of potential investigations raised alarm bells among Civil Rights Division alumni and Democrats that DOJ’s move was motivated by partisan politics.",
            "Eric Dreiband, the assistant attorney general running the Civil Rights Division, sent letters to Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Wednesday, requesting documents and information under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA) about how public nursing homes in their states responded to the COVID-19 pandemic.",
            "Cuomo and Whitmer said in a joint statement that the inquiries were “nothing more than a transparent politicization of the Department of Justice in the middle of the Republican National Convention.” They called DOJ’s move a “nakedly partisan deflection” and questioned why Republican-run states that, based on federal guidelines, had similar rules about nursing home admissions were not being targeted.",
            "In a press release on Wednesday, the Justice Department claimed, without pointing to evidence, that state orders “may have resulted in the deaths of thousands of elderly nursing home residents.” The department said it was “evaluating whether to initiate investigations,” meaning that it had not actually launched a probe. It is unusual for DOJ to highly publicize such a preliminary inquiry.",
            "The press release went on to compare the COVID-19 death rate in the blue state of New York to the death rate in the red state of Texas, despite the vast array of factors and variables ― including population density and the geographical progression of COVID-19 ― that made the Empire State more vulnerable to the pandemic than the Lone Star State.",
            "Drawing The Heat Away",
            "CRIPA is a 40-year-old federal statute meant to protect Americans held in government-run institutions like jails, prisons, mental health facilities and state-owned nursing homes. The vast majority of nursing homes in the United States are privately run and therefore not covered by CRIPA, even if those entities receive most of their funding through Medicare. Pennsylvania, for example, has just seven such state-owned facilities, which house roughly 1,300 residents ― a small fraction of the state’s nursing home population of more than 80,000.",
            "With more than 180,000 Americans dead in a pandemic that has devastated the U.S. economy, Trump’s reelection campaign benefits from drawing heat away from the administration’s handling of the crisis and onto Democratic governors’ decisions. The best-known state-run nursing facilities tend to be veterans homes, allowing the administration to suggest that Democratic governors failed to protect our nation’s elderly war heroes.",
            "Moreover, the most common CRIPA cases involve jail and prison conditions. But DOJ hasn’t announced any inquiries into how such facilities have handled COVID-19 despite the fact that jails and prisons have seen some of the biggest coronavirus clusters in the U.S. Nearly 160,000 incarcerated individuals and staffers have tested positive for the virus, and at least 1,000 have died ― including 116 people held in facilities run by the Justice Department’s own Bureau of Prisons.",
            "While CRIPA gives DOJ limited jurisdiction over state-owned nursing homes, a department official suggested that the inquiry could drive at a much larger question that goes far beyond the scope of the preliminary probe.",
            "“Those 50,000 COVID dead in NY/NJ deserve to have an investigation to determine if their Governors are responsible for their deaths,” the DOJ official wrote.",
            "‘Isn’t Particularly Subtle, Is It?’",
            "There are, without a doubt, legitimate questions to ask about how governors and other state authorities have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic. But the timing of DOJ’s unusual announcement ― and the lack of action against jails and prisons ― has raised alarm. Former Civil Rights Division officials told HuffPost they were deeply concerned that the Justice Department’s authority was once again being weaponized for political purposes under Attorney General William Barr.",
            "“Here we are, 70 days before the election and right in the middle of the Republican convention, and they dropped four letters on four Democratic governors in particularly visible states? Please. This really does smell,” said Sam Bagenstos, a University of Michigan Law School professor who served in the Civil Rights Division during the Obama administration. “It’s absolutely the case that if the Department of Justice were taking the [CRIPA] seriously on COVID, they would have been investigating prisons and jails across the country.”",
            "“I do not recall ever seeing a press release announcing that the Department is ‘evaluating whether’ to initiate a CRIPA investigation,” said Christy Lopez, a Georgetown University Law Center professor and former Civil Rights Division official. “And the New York/Texas comparison isn’t particularly subtle, is it?”",
            "“Using CRIPA to target Democratic governors on the eve of an election is nothing short of an abuse of the Civil Rights Division’s enforcement authority for political purposes,” said Jonathan Smith, the executive director of the Washington Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs and a former Civil Rights Division official. “This is part of a very disturbing pattern from the DOJ to use its powers to advance the President’s electoral agenda as opposed to the neutral, objective, and independent enforcement of the law.”",
            "DOJ’s press release generated negative headlines against Democratic governors. Some of the media coverage falsely suggested, despite CRIPA’s limits, that DOJ was investigating whether state governments were responsible for all nursing home deaths. “DOJ probes nursing home deaths in 4 states — including in NY,” said the New York Post. “DOJ asks governors about coronavirus orders that may have resulted in nursing home deaths,” wrote The Hill.",
            "Pandemic At The Nursing Home",
            "According to HuffPost’s review of DOJ’s letters to Congress on CRIPA enforcement, the Trump administration hadn’t launched any CRIPA investigations into public nursing homes until the current fiscal year.",
            "The Justice Department official pointed out that the Civil Rights Division announced back in April that it had launched an investigation into the Soldiers’ Home in Holyoke, a state-run facility for veterans in Massachusetts. The state’s governor, Charlie Baker, is a moderate Republican and Trump critic, but DOJ’s press release on that investigation made no mention of the governor. There were 76 deaths at the Soldiers’ Home in Holyoke, which was described as a “warzone” and a “nightmare” during the worst days of the pandemic in late March. An independent report authored by a former federal prosecutor at Gov. Baker’s request found that the facility’s superintendent, a retired Marine Corps lieutenant colonel who had no prior experience with nursing homes, created “close to an optimal environment” for the spread of COVID-19.",
            "There have been documented coronavirus outbreaks at veterans homes in Michigan, New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Veterans homes were hit hard in New Jersey, where 81 veterans died at a facility in Paramus. More than 50 veterans died at a facility in New York. A state-run nursing home for veterans in Pennsylvania keep mum about the extent of its outbreak, but a licensed practical nurse told an inspector that it was “awful” to watch people die and have to “wrap the residents in a body bag and meet the undertaker at the elevator.”",
            "The DOJ official also said that the four letters focused on states that had orders requiring nursing homes to admit patients with COVID-19. That’s a particularly difficult question, especially in state-run facilities that were dealing with patients in desperate need of care amid a pandemic that was overwhelming hospitals and leaving nursing homes ― in part because of the failures of the federal government ― short on personal protective equipment (PPE).",
            "There’s some skepticism among civil rights experts that the admission of COVID-19 patients to public nursing homes during a catastrophic pandemic was something that should prompt a Justice Department division with limited resources to launch an inquiry into potential violations of the constitutional rights of confined persons. DOJ’s letters asked for information on how many patients were admitted to public nursing homes from a hospital or other facility after testing positive for COVID-19. Given the relatively small population of public nursing home residents, and the failures of many nursing homes to restrict visitation in the early days of the pandemic or provide adequate PPE, it seems unlikely that the admission of COVID-19 positive patients into public nursing homes was a significant contributor to the overall pandemic.",
            "What About Prisons And Jails?",
            "More broadly speaking, there are major questions about the Trump administration’s overall CRIPA enforcement, which has been somewhat anemic. The Trump administration’s latest report on CRIPA enforcement, sent to lawmakers earlier this month, says DOJ filed no complaints or settlements in the entire 2019 fiscal year but opened three new investigations. The Justice Department did release major CRIPA reports on conditions in prisons in Alabama and a deadly jail in Virginia, but both probes began during the Obama administration. The Trump administration has launched some new prison and jail investigations, including into Mississippi prisons and a New Jersey facility.",
            "Politically, standing up for elderly veterans is much more popular than protecting the civil rights of the incarcerated. During the George W. Bush administration, said former DOJ official Smith, there was a big focus on public nursing home investigations involving veterans, which were “seen as less controversial” than prison and jail probes.",
            "“Republican administrations are much more likely to be driven by this kind of war-on-crime idea that we accept poor conditions in penal facilities,” Bagenstos said. “They have a much higher bar, historically, for getting involved in cases that come out of those facilities. I think it’s as simple as that. It’s just crime politics.”",
            "Dreiband, the Civil Rights Division chief, said in a statement in DOJ’s press release that protecting the rights of “some of society’s most vulnerable members, including elderly nursing home residents, is one of our country’s most important obligations” and that the department must “ensure they are adequately cared for with dignity and respect and not unnecessarily put at risk.”",
            "‘You’re The Pot Calling The Kettle Black’",
            "Incarcerated Americans definitely fall into the category of “society’s most vulnerable,” and prisons and jails have seen massive COVID-19 outbreaks. Some of the largest coronavirus clusters in the country are linked to prisons, including facilities in Florida and Ohio ― both states with Republican governors. But there’s been no announcements from the Trump administration about whether they’re digging into those outbreaks.",
            "Moreover, the Justice Department itself hasn’t done a good job containing the spread of the coronavirus within its own facilities. At least 1,400 incarcerated persons and more than 600 Bureau of Prisons staffers have tested positive for COVID-19, according to the bureau’s latest numbers. The latest federal prisoner lost to the coronavirus, 56-year-old Marie Neba, died on Tuesday.",
            "“You’re the pot calling the kettle black. The banana calling the school bus yellow,” said a Bureau of Prisons corrections officer, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the department’s pandemic response. The officer, who dealt with PPE shortages and COVID-19 outbreaks at his DOJ-run facility for months, found the department’s potential scrutiny of states’ coronavirus responses deeply hypocritical. “How dare they go around complaining about how states are reacting to coronavirus,” he said.",
            "CRIPA investigations are “pattern or practice” civil rights probes, meaning they look broadly at conditions and systems rather than focus on isolated abuses. The only “pattern or practice” policing probe launched during the Trump administration, which focused on a narcotics unit in Massachusetts, found that officers “repeatedly punch individuals in the face unnecessarily” and use “excessive force without accountability.” The Trump administration has all but ended those broad investigations into police conduct, in part because of their belief that identifying patterns of unconstitutional behavior against Americans hurts law enforcement morale. But the administration apparently has no such qualms about how public health care workers who cared for veterans in the middle of a pandemic might feel about the federal government second-guessing their actions.",
            "DOJ veterans worry that this week’s announcement is yet another indication that Trump’s political appointees at the Justice Department are doing his political bidding. They wonder what else Barr has planned in the run-up to Election Day.",
            "“In normal times, one would not suspect political motivations behind a Justice Department investigation ― but we do not live in normal times,” said Vanita Gupta, the president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and former head of the Civil Rights Division under Obama. “CRIPA is the sole federal civil rights law that the Attorney General must personally approve. This Attorney General and administration’s record on civil rights speaks for itself.”"

            "“The best way to stop the cycle of privilege and ignorance [in our country] is to educate our kids about allyship, antiracism, oppression and activism sooner rather than later,” Reed told HuffPost.",
            "Parents have an obligation to protect their children’s innocence, the artist said, but age-appropriate conversations about race need to happen, too. Still, it can be a struggle to know “what information to share with our kids, when to share it and how to share it effectively and clearly while still leaving room for hope.”",

That’s what ‘A is for Ally’ is all about.”",

Another illustrates a motto for classrooms (or in these social-distanced times, a teacher’s wall during a Zoom class): “A is for ally. Black lives matter. Love is love. Diversity is beauty.

            "The campaign of Rep. Richard Neal, a Massachusetts Democrat fighting a spirited progressive challenge from Holyoke, Massachusetts, Mayor Alex Morse, called for a pro-Neal group to take down an advertisement using a politically motivated smear to attack Morse.",
            "The 30-second TV ad, funded by American Working Families, a super PAC funded by labor unions and health care industry groups spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to reelect Neal, begins by hitting Morse for a number of alleged failures that Neal himself has brought up. Neal, 71, has, among other things, faulted Morse for the state’s takeover of Holyoke’s schools under his watch and a police brutality incident in which city cops beat a 12-year-old boy nearly unconscious.",
            "The ad closes, though, by invoking a scandal that broke in early August that, it subsequently became clear, was at least partly the work of a college student plotting to ingratiate himself with Neal by accusing Morse of abusing his power to have sexual relationships with male college students.",
            "“Now Alex Morse admits to sexual relationships with college students ― even while he was a university lecturer,” the ad says. “Alex Morse, terrible judgment, we don’t need in Congress.”",
            "Although there was never a specific allegation of misconduct beyond Morse making some students feel uncomfortable, he has apologized for any hurt he caused while also defending his right to have consenting relationships with adults. Morse has also said that in keeping with university policy, he never had relations with any of the students he taught.",
            "Neal has repeatedly said that he had nothing to do with the effort to smear Morse, which LGBTQ community advocates believe exploited homophobic tropes about gay men. (Morse, 31, is Holyoke’s first-ever openly gay mayor.)",
            "“Our campaign has been consistent: There is no place for homophobia in our society, and Richie condemns it,” Neal campaign manager Peter Panos said in a statement to HuffPost. “Voters will make a choice in this race based on both candidates’ records and issues that actually affect the district. The outside group should take this ad down.”",
            "The super PAC preemptively announced that it would be withdrawing the ad before HuffPost published the Neal campaign’s statement. American Working Families said it “accidentally” sent an uncorrected version of the ad to TV stations.",
            "Neal’s campaign followed up with HuffPost with a statement approving of the super PAC’s comments.",
            "“This ad should not have been aired, and we are glad it’s been taken down,” Panos said.",
            "Even if the network TV stations in the Springfield-Holyoke media market take down the ad immediately, viewer data obtained by HuffPost showed that it already reached more than 30,000 viewers. It has aired 10 times as of Saturday afternoon.",
            "A representative from the CBS affiliate, WSHM-LD, told HuffPost he did not know if the ad had been removed.",
            "HuffPost reached out to sales departments for local affiliates of NBC and The CW and was awaiting a response.",
            "The Morse campaign reacted by linking the ad to Neal’s ties to corporate special interests such as those contributing to American Working Families.",
            "“Richie Neal is the top recipient of corporate money in Congress for a reason — he protects the profits of big corporations,” the campaign said in a statement. “Now Neal’s friends are repaying him by spending millions in desperate, last-minute homophobic attack ads against Alex Morse because they know Alex can win on Tuesday. This is exactly the type of ugly, old-school politics Alex is running to change.”",
            "The LGBTQ Victory Fund, which backs Morse, tweeted that the ad’s creation in itself was cause for outrage.",
            "’It aims to perpetuate a false and homophobia-laced narrative against a gay candidate just days before the election,” the group said. “The way to prevent these ugly campaign tactics is to ensure they backfire. Lets get [Alex Morse] elected on [Tuesday].”",
            "Waleed Shahid, a spokesman for Justice Democrats, a left-wing group backing Morse, expressed skepticism of the super PAC’s claim that the ad wasn’t deliberately crafted to harm Morse,",
            "“There is little about these desperate, last-minute smears against Alex Morse that seem like an ‘accident’ at this point,” he said.",
            "A number of poll watchers suspected that broadcasting the ad was no accident because of its timing on the weekend. TV stations typically program their weekend advertisements in advance and use a skeleton staff on the weekend that is less capable of pulling an ad from the air.",
            "“It’s next to impossible to take a spot down ― even if it’s your own spot ― over the weekend,” said Mike Mikus, a veteran Democratic campaign consultant. “It is possible they sent the wrong version, but I’ve never seen that happen.”",
            "In response to accusations that American Working Families deliberately sent the video referencing Morse’s relations with college students to TV stations and criticism of the video itself as a homophobic, the pro-Neal super PAC provided HuffPost with a statement firmly denying that its actions were intentional.",
            "But the group also pushed back on the idea that the video is homophobic in any way, arguing instead that it had decided against airing the ad on television because it predicted that the criticism it would elicit would “create a distraction caused by people distorting it to suit their own agenda and narrative.”",
            "American Working Families added that the ad was “factually correct,” drawing as it did on Morse’s own admission of consensual relationships with college students and his apology for what Morse called “unacceptable behavior.”",
            "Mikus, the Democratic consultant, told HuffPost that the super PAC’s actions would be less suspicious if it could provide immediate evidence of a video that did not include the segment it said it had sent to TV stations by accident.",
            "A version of American Working Families’ 30-second video that does not mention Morse’s relationships with college students has in fact been on YouTube since Monday.",
            "Morse came under fire on Aug. 7 when The Daily Collegian, the student newspaper of the University of Massachusetts, published a leaked letter from the College Democrats of Massachusetts informing Morse that he was no longer welcome at the group’s meetings because he had used “his position of power for romantic or sexual gain” with college students.",
            "The letter stated that Morse, who had taught a course at UMass Amherst since 2015, matched with college students as young as 18 on the dating apps Tinder and Grindr and that he had “sexual contact” with students at the UMass Amherst and other colleges near Holyoke.",
            "It also said that Morse “us[ed] College Democrats events to meet college students and add them on Instagram” and that he messaged them in a way that made students “feel uncomfortable.”",
            "Five days after the Daily Collegian article upended the race, The Intercept reported that at least two students active in the UMass Amherst College Democrats chapter sought to ensnare Morse by flirting with him on Instagram. One of the conspirators explicitly said that he was interested in currying favor with Neal so he could advance professionally.",
            "A second Intercept report revealed that the Massachusetts Democratic Party, which is officially neutral in competitive primaries, referred Democratic power broker and former Neal donor Jim Roosevelt to the student group as an attorney to counsel them on how to handle confronting Morse. Roosevelt reportedly advised them to publicize the letter, against the students’ instincts, according to sources close to the College Democrats; Roosevelt insists that he advised that it be kept private.",
            "Even before The Intercept exposed the claims against Morse as at least partly politically motivated, Morse argued that the timing of the leaked letter so soon before the Sept. 1 primary suggested it was designed to affect the race.",
            "Neal denied any involvement in the letter or the Daily Collegian article covering from the very beginning. But prior to The Intercept story, his campaign sounded more encouraging of the students who were trying to speak out against Morse.",
            "“The College Democrats independently came forward, and our campaign commends these courageous students,” Neal spokesperson Kate Norton said.",
            "By the time Neal met Morse for a televised debate on Aug. 17, 10 days after the Daily Collegian story, Neal said he was content to let a UMass Amherst investigation of Morse’s conduct proceed without any additional comment from his campaign.",
            "“Clearly, unequivocally, no room for homophobia ― and my campaign was not part of this action,” he added.",
            "Unlike the candidate himself though, American Working Families, the pro-Neal super PAC, still considers Morse’s dating life fair game. Notwithstanding its claim that discussing the matter would create a “distraction,” other parts of the group’s statement on Sunday suggested it wants to revive the mid-August scandal as a topic of interest in the waning days of the campaign.",
            "“We challenge Alex Morse to explain how having relationships with college students while working as a university instructor is good judgment, even when the students are not in his classroom,” the group said.",
            "Democrats of all ideological stripes have been watching the Neal-Morse race closely. Since Neal, a 32-year incumbent, chairs the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, unseating him would be the biggest prize yet for an ascendant activist left that has ousted three incumbent House Democrats so far this cycle.",
            "A poll commissioned by the news site Jewish Insider found Neal leading Morse 49% to 40%, with 12% of voters “not sure” for whom they plan to vote.",
            "Election Day is Tuesday."

            "President Donald Trump opened the 2020 Republican National Convention by requesting party delegates lead a chant ― not for four more years, but for 12. He spoke on every single night of the convention. Three out of four convention nights featured at least two members of the Trump family as prime-time speakers, making “my dad” and “my father” two of the most uttered phrases. The Republican Party, meanwhile, adopted no platform.",
            "The platform is simply Donald Trump, who embodies all that is good and American. No policies need be explained or, heaven forbid, debated. Trump’s nomination represents them all ― whatever they may be. Any dispute over policy is treated as a personal dispute with the party’s leader and is therefore illegitimate.",
            "The only thing that needs to be expressed is seething resentment and disdain for anyone who dares oppose the beacon of the people. And since the GOP has proven it can win presidential elections without support from a majority of voters, the campaign and convention are all about riling up the base and convincing anyone who’s on the fence to just stay home.",
            "“Always Remember: they are coming after ME, because I am fighting for YOU,” Trump said Thursday night during his unprecedented acceptance speech from the South Lawn of the White House.",
            "This is a stark change from 2016, when Trump led a hostile takeover of the party and speakers like Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) dissented from at the GOP convention in Cleveland. Today, Republicans who may be loyal to the party itself but have not fully bent the knee to Trump are no longer welcome.",
            "“There’s no semblance of a party in any way that is larger than the president,” Daniel Schlozman, a political scientist at Johns Hopkins University and the author of “When Movements Anchor Parties: Electoral Alignments in American History.” “The party is nothing more than support of Trump.”",
            "Trump’s takeover of the Republican Party follows trends stretching back decades. The conservative movement, rooted in cultural, social and racial resentments, took advantage of the hollowing out of political parties that was the side effect of 1970s liberal reforms and poured itself into the GOP to make it what it is today.",
            "“This didn’t come from nowhere,” Schlozman said.",
            "The movement that took over the party and laid the foundation for Trump did so in order to build a durable electoral majority. But that majority no longer exists. Trump’s dominance of the party after his minority-vote victory in 2016 indicates that this conservative coalition increasingly sees its future in power through anti-democratic means.",
            "From Majority To Minority",
            "The New Right conservative movement began as an effort to destroy New Deal liberalism and return to power the ancien régime of Gilded Age economic theories that it wiped away. But it found its true base of support among white voters of all classes who were frightened and angered by the collapse of racial, gender and familial hierarchies. Those fears were hastened by the advances of democratic and social rights for minorities and women and the increase of college education that began in the 1950s.",
            "The conservative movement adopted a pugilistic and win-by-any-means approach to politics with the purpose of “mobilizing cultural and social conflict as a means to majority,” Schlozman and Sam Rosenfeld, a political scientist at Colgate University, write in their 2019 paper, “The Long New Right and the World It Made.”",
            "“The modern Republican Party under the conservative movement’s control represents a continual bargain between a plutocratic public policy agenda and populist social politics,” said Rosenfeld, the author of “The Polarizers: Postwar Architects of Our Partisan Era.”",
            "“Trump is the apotheosis; he’s the reductio ad absurdum; he’s the comical version of that more than he’s a major break,” Rosenfeld said.",
            "While the party pursued plutocratic economic policies, it mollified its voting base by adopting the signature style of Sen. Joseph McCarthy (R-Wis.), mimicking the disgraced anti-Communist’s “fervid demonization, the headlong transgression of institutional and behavioral norms, the suffusion of political debate with potent social resentment,” Schlozman and Rosenfeld write.",
            "That style was on full display at the 2020 GOP convention, where the power and visage of the office of the presidency was used for Trump’s personal private benefit. Meanwhile, convention speakers said the Democratic Party wants to “control how you live,” “invite MS-13 to live next door,” “abolish the suburbs,” and “destroy our way of life” to the point that “you will not recognize this country or yourself.” And, they warned, “no matter where you live, your family will not be safe.”",
            "Although this movement took over the Republican Party, it was never much interested in it as a political party itself. Instead, it saw the party simply as a means to the end of securing an electoral majority ― whether that be Silent or Moral. Building an electoral majority means the party can win. And if it wins, it can enact its agenda.",
            "Toward Minority Rule",
            "The coalition’s marriage of plutocracy and right-wing populism propelled Republicans to smashing success in the second half of the 20th century. The party came to power by pulling on the strings of an unstable New Deal coalition between Southern segregationists, Black Americans, immigrants, labor unions, university intellectuals and rural farmers. That coalition collapsed as the end of Jim Crow, the Vietnam War and economic stagnation mixed with rampant inflation, among other events, pulled apart its internal contradictions. The party went on to win five of six presidential elections from 1968 through 1988.",
            "During this period of dominance, Richard Nixon won 49 states with 61% of the popular vote in his 1972 reelection campaign. Ronald Reagan also won 49 states and 59% in his 1984 reelection campaign. And George H.W. Bush secured 51% in 1988.",
            "Through this period, conservatives stopped and then rolled back progress toward racial equality, stymied the women’s movement by blocking the Equal Rights Amendment and waged a punitive carceral war, with bipartisan support, against the lower classes. But their most durable success was enacting an economic agenda that slashed taxes and ran up massive deficits in order to redistribute money from the poor and the middle class to the rich, and economic power from small to big business.",
            "Nothing was more important to the marriage of the movement and the party than their majority. It was the fact that the party knew it was the majority that kept the populist base in check as the plutocratic wing got what it wanted.",
            "But now that majority has deteriorated. It is, in fact, a minority.",
            "Just look at Trump. He won 46% of the vote in 2016 while losing the popular vote by 3 million votes. He only won the election through the undemocratic mechanism of the Electoral College. That made him the second Republican president to win election in such a way after George W. Bush did so while losing the popular vote in 2000. Before Bush, no president had won the office while losing the popular vote since the 19th century.",
            "Their agenda and message may not pull together a majority coalition, but it is large enough to win minority victories, as long as enough people don’t vote.",
            "Trump’s shock minority-vote victory in 2016 ― and his appeasement of the party’s donor class by adopting their plutocratic economic agenda ― set the stage for the unquestioned takeover of the party on display at the GOP convention this week. It has also set in motion the party’s increasing lean toward questioning democracy and liberal government.",
            "When Trump ran in 2016, the most influential intellectual argument for Republicans to fall in line was “The Flight 93 Election,” an openly fascistic screed written by a then-pseudonymous author. The essay likened voting for Trump to the passengers who stormed the cabin and seized control of the flight hijacked by terrorists on 9/11 to save it from being crashed into the U.S. Capitol building. (The plane crashed in Pennsylvania and everyone on board died.)",
            "In this analogy, the Democratic Party and then-nominee Hillary Clinton, are the terrorists. The author — later revealed to be Michael Anton, who went on to serve as a national security aide in the Trump White House — argued that the Democrats were such a threat to the future of the nation that conservatives needed to risk handing an in-flight airplane to Trump, regardless of whether he knew how to fly it. The risk was too simply too high. Why?",
            "“[T]he ceaseless importation of Third World foreigners with no tradition of, taste for, or experience in liberty means that the electorate grows more left, more Democratic, less Republican, less republican, and less traditionally American with every cycle,” Anton wrote.",
            "It always goes back to the pursuit of a majority. It’s the same majority that Kevin Phillips, the political theorist and former Nixon aide who came up with the Republican Party’s Southern Strategy to win racist white voters in the North and South, foresaw in his book ”The Emerging Republican Majority.” It was a majority built on white voters in the South and North repelled by the advances in democracy and freedom for Black Americans. A majority that is now a minority in a nation where white people will make up less than 50% of the population in 25 years.",
            "This explains Charlie Kirk — a Republican youth leader whose organization, Turning Point USA, has repeatedly been found to employ white supremacists — calling Trump “the bodyguard of Western civilization” at the convention.",
            "Trump’s coronation tilts the party ever further toward the anti-democratic instincts that have always run just beneath the surface. This week, the party nodded in support of Trump’s illiberalism and bet their hopes on another victory through anti-democratic constitutional mechanisms to continue their rule ― majority be damned.",
            "“He has revealed and kicked the tires around to show what it is that [the party’s] elite economic interests and ordinary voters will accept to keep the coalition going,” Rosenfeld said.",
            "Trump’s vision of permanent minority rule, it seems, is the only hope to secure the existence of, and a future for, the ruling conservative coalition."

            "When historic wildfires rage in blue California, President Donald Trump slams the state for doing a poor job of “raking” forests, and threatens to withhold federal relief funds.",
            "When a devastating hurricane takes aim at red states along the Gulf of Mexico, Trump stands ready to assist.",
            "The past two weeks have once again highlighted the White House’s favoritism for the people who live in states that helped elect Trump in 2016. With the 2020 election less than three months away, Trump has shown he has no intention of playing nice with the jurisdictions he stands little chance of winning in November. Along with threatening to punish fire-scorched California, he and his team have sought to paint other Democratic-run cities and states as dangerous, crime-ridden and mismanaged ― and insisted that Trump, even though he leads the nation, bears no blame for anything happening there.",
            "“These are Democratically-led cities and most with Democratic governors,” White House senior counselor Kellyanne Conway said Thursday during an appearance on “Fox & Friends,” when asked about ongoing unrest across the country. “It’s not Donald Trump’s watch.”",
            "It’s clear why the president would do this. As Mark Joseph Stern, a staff writer at Slate, wrote in a recent Twitter post: “A president who knows he won’t win blue states can punish them, sacrifice them, undercut them, trash them ― there’s no electoral penalty. Those states don’t matter to him. Their residents’ votes don’t matter.”",
            "Meanwhile, blue states are struggling with problems that have nothing to do with party affiliation. California is once again reeling from record-breaking wildfires. In less than two weeks, some 700 fires scorched more than 1.3 million acres — nearly three times the five-year annual average of 450,000 acres ― and forced tens of thousands of people to flee their homes.",
            "As the fires grew last week, Trump rolled out his to-go attack. At an Aug. 20 campaign rally in Pennsylvania, he insisted California has “gotta clean your floors, you gotta clean your forests” of “leaves and broken trees,” adding: “Maybe we’re just going to have to make them pay for it, because they don’t listen to us.” As usual, there was no mention of the link between climate change and wildfires, or the fact that many of California’s worst fires have been on land managed by the federal government, not the state.",
            "“Just today, the president of the United States threatened the state of California ― 40 million Americans who happen to live here in the state of California ― to defund our efforts of fire suppression, because he said we haven’t raked enough leaves,” California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) said later that day during an address at the Democratic National Convention. “You can’t make that up.”",
            "Compare that to Trump’s response to Hurricane Laura, which slammed into the Louisiana coast early Thursday as a powerful Category 4 storm, with maximum sustained winds of 150 mph.",
            "“My Administration remains fully engaged with state & local emergency managers to continue preparing and assisting the great people [of] Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas,” Trump wrote of the red states in a Wednesday post to Twitter, as Laura continued to intensify offshore. “Listen to local officials. We are with you!”",
            "Vice President Mike Pence also promised a swift federal response in areas impacted by the storm.",
            "“Our prayers are with you tonight,” Pence said late Wednesday during a speech at the Republican National Convention. “FEMA has mobilized resources and supplies for those in harm’s way. This is a serious storm, and we urge all of those in the affected areas to heed state and local authorities. Stay safe. And know that we’ll be with you every step of the way, to support, rescue, respond and recover in the days and weeks ahead. That’s what Americans do.”",
            "Disparities in the Trump administration’s disaster responses are nothing new.",
            "When Super Typhoon Yutu ― one of the strongest recorded tropical cyclones to make landfall anywhere on the planet ― tore through the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, a U.S. territory of some 55,000 people in the Pacific, in October 2018, Trump declared an emergency but did not comment publicly or post to Twitter about the Category 5-equivalent storm. And during the fires in California last year, Trump claimed to have ordered the Federal Emergency Management Agency to cut off wildfire relief aid for the state until officials there could “get their act together” and do a better job of managing forests.",
            "“He told us to stop giving money to people whose houses had burned down from a wildfire, because he was so rageful that people in the state of California didn’t support him and that politically it wasn’t a base for him,” Miles Taylor, former chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security in the Trump administration, said in a political ad last week endorsing Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.",
            "But when a barrage of deadly tornadoes wreaked havoc in Alabama, a deep red state, in March 2019, Trump offered nothing but support. “FEMA has been told directly by me to give the A Plus treatment to the Great State of Alabama and the wonderful people who have been so devastated by the Tornadoes,” he boasted on Twitter.",
            "The double standard goes beyond Trump’s Twitter presence and public statements.",
            "A Politico investigation in March 2018 found that the government’s response to the devastation Hurricane Maria caused in Puerto Rico ― a U.S. territory whose residents do not vote in general elections, but which supported Hillary Clinton and Marco Rubio in the 2016 presidential primaries ― was “much slower” than relief efforts in Texas for Hurricane Harvey. When a government-commissioned study concluded that back-to-back hurricanes Irma and Maria killed nearly 3,000 people in the island territory, Trump flatly denied the death toll.",
            "Trump has maintained that the administration’s widely criticized response in Puerto Rico was “an incredible, unsung success.”"

            "After days of staring at co-workers over Zoom and nights wide-eyed in front of endless streaming television binges, it feels good to open a cookbook instead of mindlessly scrolling to the latest viral recipe. But beyond the break from screen time, cookbooks offer an analog advantage of allowing cooks to really dive in deeply to a place, concept, genre or even the mind of another person. Compared to a single recipe on a blog post, a book offers a culinary narrative.",
            "We asked people from around the food world ― chefs, cooks, food photographers, writers and editors ― to tell us which cookbooks they have been turning to as they figure out how to cook their way through social isolation.",
            "Paula Forbes, creator of Stained Page News, the internet’s source for cookbook news",
            "“Paula Wolfert is one of my all-time favorite cookbook authors, and as I’ve been trying to eat healthier recently, I treated myself to one of her titles I didn’t already own: ‘Mediterranean Grains and Greens.’ In the 1998 book, Wolfert ― whose books are notoriously well-researched and detailed ― travels the shores of the Mediterranean, offering a myriad of approaches to staples I have in my pantry (grains) and the only thing I’ve managed to keep alive in my vegetable garden (that would be greens). In other words, it’s perfect for pandemic cooking.”",
            "José Ralat, taco editor at Texas Monthly and author of “American Tacos”",
            "“Although I know how to cook, I don’t do much cooking at home. My wife cooks ― and I eat everything she makes. Because we want to support local restaurants, almost all of which are independently owned, we’ve gotten a lot more takeout since the pandemic started. That being said, I recently got a copy of ‘The Flavor Thesaurus,’ and it’s blowing my mind.",
            "“The 10-year-old book written by British food writer Niki Segnit pairs flavors in an encyclopedic fashion. The first entry, Chocolate and Almond, begins with, ‘What does parental guilt taste like?’ Each entry includes a quippy musing ― almost always unabashedly Eurocentric ― with an example of how the food relates to the cuisines of former European colonies. Usually those colonies are India and Indonesia, but Mexico makes an appearance for tacos al pastor, mole and others.",
            "“Recipes are written into the entries much like in early cookbooks, as narratives. It’s a smart, fascinating book for its insight into flavor combinations and the interconnectivity of our gastronomic traditions. Peanuts are everywhere! It’s also humorous for its lack of self-awareness in the world and as a relic that retains significance. In the time of COVID-19 and the march toward racial justice and equity, ‘The Flavor Thesaurus’ is an excellent example of how far we have come and how much farther we need to go. Still, it’s problematic. The analogy used in the Lime and Chili entry doesn’t sit right with me. It begins: ‘Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo. This turbulent twosome brings fervor to a vast range of Mexican dishes.’ Uff.”",

            "“Information comes at you fast on the internet but with cookbooks, you get to settle into a moment. This was supposed to be a year of travel for me, so I’m reading cookbooks from all the places I want to be: ‘Bäco’ by Josef Centeno, ‘Falastin’ by Sami Tamimi and the old ‘Best of Gourmet’ cookbook. Because just as much as I want to travel, home is always an included destination for me.”",
            "Maya-Camille Broussard, chef and owner of Justice of the Pies in Chicago",
            "“The cookbooks that I love are by Edna F. Lewis, one of the first Black women from the South who wrote cookbooks that didn’t hide her real name, race or gender. Edna, as a Southern cook, a teacher, and a lecturer, has been an immense inspiration for me because I see so much of my journey in the kitchen in hers as well. My go-to cookbooks authored by Ms. Lewis are ‘The Gift of Southern Cooking’ and ’In Pursuit of Flavor.’”",
            "Tiffany Ran, cook and pop-up operator of Ba Ba Lio",
            "“The book I’ve been turning to a lot these days is ‘Pei Mei’s Chinese Cook Book, Volume 1.’ Fu Pei Mei is Taiwan’s Martha Stewart and the first edition of this cookbook published in [the 1960s] was Taiwan’s first colored recipe book. Fu Pei Mei’s book and cooking show helped to preserve and spread Chinese cuisine throughout Taiwan and bring the cuisine to an international stage. This is also the book that most young brides or international students would receive from their mothers as a way to carry a taste of home with them. I found this book for a steal at a used bookstore. It was well used before I acquired it. The English translation of this book can be a bit clunky at times, but something about that is really charming and comforting to me. Especially being away from home during the pandemic, it’s rare to have a cookbook that gives you a sense of cooking with your mother.”",
            "Liana Aghajanian, journalist and author of “Dining in Diaspora”",
            "“The cookbook that I’ve sought out and cooked from most during this pandemic is one called ‘Armenian Cuisine: Preserving Our Heritage,’ published by the Women’s Guild of St. John Armenian Church in Southfield, Michigan. This church cookbook is very special to me because I know many of the women whose recipes appear in it. In fact, if the pandemic had not happened, I would be cooking with them right now, because every year between March and September, the Women’s Guild of the church gets together almost every week to bake and cook a plethora of goods in preparation for the annual Armenian bazaar that takes place in October. To say that I’ve missed them and their immense culinary knowledge and camaraderie is an understatement. Most are third-generation descendants from Armenian genocide survivors continuing on their food traditions of their parents and grandparents, and being with them, cooking with them, goes beyond the food for me ― it’s a race against time to capture and document their skills before they’re lost. It’s been a privilege to learn from them, and not being able to be together has been upsetting. So instead I’m cooking the recipes that they’ve contributed in the book, at home alone. I’ve made different breads, filo dough pastries, pilaf, kebab, yogurt-based dishes and more. I’m grateful that they’ve preserved their work in this book so that even when I don’t get to see them, they’re with me in these recipes.”",

            "“I’ve been cooking a lot from ’Every Grain of Rice.’ The food is just so good ― better than my local Chinese restaurants, and completely unlike what I normally cook. Especially in the beginning of quarantine, it was something to look forward to at the end of the day.”",
            "Chandra Ram, editor of Plate",
            "“It’s really helped me to create a bit of structure during this otherwise endless, weird time, so having a big cooking project on the weekend helps ― it gives me something to research, plan for and write lists about. And, cooking through some of the cookbooks stacked on my shelves and on my desk has basically become our new date night for me and my husband. One of the books on repeat lately is ‘Ethiopia: Recipes and Traditions From the Horn of Africa,’ by Yohanis Gebreyesus. I’ll be honest, I keep returning to it because I haven’t been able to nail the recipes the way I’d like to, especially injera. I’m on round five of trying to make it, and it’s just not right. And sometimes, it’s terrible. The first couple of rounds, I cooked it at too high a heat, making it crispy like the dosa I’m used to making. Then I got the cooking temp down, but the batter was too heavy and lacked that bubbly structure I love about injera. So, I keep going back to it and am taking the time to really get to know the batter and its quirks. If life was normal, I would plan to keep at it, but then would be distracted by weekend trips away, dinners out and vacations. But stuck in my apartment week after week, I can take the time to try and master injera, and let my actions follow my intentions.",
            "“Along the same lines, I have ’Jam Session’ by Joyce Goldstein on my kitchen counter all the time. Normally I swing by the farmers market quickly before going to the office, and a few days later, try to figure out what to do with all that fruit turning soft on my countertop. Now, I can walk to the local market for a quick work break, and set up my computer in the kitchen so I can write next to pots of fruit bubbling into jam. And I can work out my frustration while forcing black raspberries through a food mill to get rid of all those annoying seeds. If ― fingers crossed ― life starts to return to normal next year, I’ll have a shelf or two of jams as my reward for staying in.”",
            "Celeste Noche, food photographer",
            "“My partner and I have been leaning on the new ’Joy of Cooking’! It’s the only cookbook that lives on our counter and has wrinkled pages and food stains as testaments for how much we use it. With everything going on, it’s been a real comfort to have an idea for something and know it’ll most likely be in Joy, versus combing through our other cookbooks or wading through blog posts on the internet. I love that the recipes are pretty straightforward and that there are so many variations. Our cats also always, ALWAYS sit on the book when we have it open to cook from, so it’s like we also have their approval ― just good and comforting vibes all around.”",
            "Tristen Epps, executive chef, Red Rooster Overtown in Miami",
            "“Like everyone on and off Instagram, my COVID kitchen included many loaves of sourdough, but that also inspired me to dig deeper into experimenting with fermentation. And no better place to draw from than ’The Noma Guide to Fermentation.’ I utilized a ton of chef Rene Redzepi’s techniques, including applying his lacto-fermentation method to white asparagus to enhance spring flavors and trying my hand at homemade miso using wild rice and black-eyed peas.",
            "“Another book that became super relevant was ‘Toques in Black: A Celebration of Black Chefs.’ The book, curated by photographer Alan ‘Battman’ Batt, features recipes and stories from 101 Black chefs from across the country (including me). When the book was released in December, it felt monumental. It celebrates craft, cuisine and culture far beyond (but also including!) chicken and waffles. In June, when racial justice and equity came to the forefront of the conversation ― and while Black restaurant owners disproportionately struggled to secure the Paycheck Protection Program and other means of financial relief for their struggling businesses ― it solidified just how important this book really is. For people looking to learn about and support chefs of color, this is a great place to start.”"

            "Anti-abortion activist Abby Johnson used her five-minute speaking slot on the second night of the Republican National Convention to stigmatize abortion and smear her former employer, Planned Parenthood, the country’s largest provider of reproductive health care.",
            "Johnson, who spent the day under fire for past statements on racial profiling and women’s right to vote, worked at Planned Parenthood for eight years before defecting to the anti-abortion movement.",
            "On Tuesday, she described how she experienced a moral crisis while watching the ultrasound-guided abortion of a 13-week-old fetus.",
            "“Nothing prepared me for what I saw on the screen — an unborn baby fighting back, desperate to move away from the suction,” she said on Tuesday night. “And I’ll never forget what the doctor said next — ‘Beam me up, Scotty.’”",
            "Details of Johnson’s oft-repeated conversion story, which was expanded into a book and then made into a 2019 movie, “Unplanned,” have been contested. Johnson maintains she is telling the truth.",
            "As HuffPost previously covered, Johnson’s description of the fetus’ movements do not align with medical science.",
            "Throughout her speech, she used graphic language to describe abortion, a safe and common procedure. “I know what abortion smells like,” Johnson said. “Did you know abortion even has a smell?”",
            "Johnson also accused Planned Parenthood of racism, claiming that its founder, Margaret Sanger, wanted to eradicate minorities, and asserted erroneously that almost 80% of abortion clinics are located in minority communities. According to the Guttmacher Institute, about 6 in 10 abortion providers are located in neighborhoods where more than half of residents are white.",
            "Since her conversion more than a decade ago, Johnson has become somewhat of a poster child for the anti-abortion movement, reminiscent of Norma McCorvey, the plaintiff in the landmark case Roe v. Wade, who made headlines in 1995 when she announced she no longer supported abortion. (Recent reporting on McCorvey’s conversion suggests she was motivated by finances, not her own personal beliefs).",
            "Johnson opposes abortion in all cases, as well as hormonal birth control. On her website, she espouses “a new kind of feminism,” arguing that abortion hurts women, and she advocates for women to dress modestly.",
            "She also supports “head-of-household voting,” which would allow only the head of a household to cast a ballot. “In a Godly household, the husband would get the final say,” she said on Twitter. Minutes before her speech, she continued to tweet in defense of her head-of-household voting position.",
            "Johnson, who has eight children, has also come under criticism for a viral video clip in which she defended racial profiling. In the video, she says that her adopted brown son was “statistically more likely to commit a violent offense” than her white sons and that it was “smart” for police to be more careful around him.",
            "In the past, she has also co-opted the language of the Black Lives Matter movement to advocate for the end of abortion.",
            "“I think maybe it’s time for me to lead a campaign to paint ‘Unborn Lives Matter’ outside of every abortion clinic in the country,” she tweeted in July. “I’m not much for getting arrested, but I’m feeling like maybe this would show the blatant hypocrisy running rampant in our society today.”",
            "In a statement, Jenny Lawson, executive director of Planned Parenthood Votes, said that Johnson cannot be trusted to tell the truth about safe, legal abortions.",
            "“While Republicans will continue to lie and stigmatize sexual and reproductive health care services, Planned Parenthood Votes will continue to shine a light on President Trump’s and Vice President Pence’s unconscionable health care record and fight to protect access to reproductive health and rights at the ballot box,” she said."

            "In one of the most alarming trends in recent history, the American lifespan is getting shorter.",
            "For decades, the United States tracked the progress of other developed countries, as advances in nutrition, medicine and health care added years to the average life expectancy. But starting about 10 years ago, that progress stalled in the U.S. People in other wealthy countries kept living longer and longer, but Americans plateaued. In 2014, American life expectancy fell backward for the first time in 21 years. U.S. lifespans slid lower for another three years straight before barely ticking upward in 2018.",
            "This backward slide has set off one of the most important debates in epidemiology: What’s happening? Explanations range from America’s semi-privatized medical system to its higher rates of sedentary lifestyles to “deaths of despair” among poor rural whites.",
            "This month, a team of epidemiologists, physicians and political scientists published a study that found an even simpler explanation: Republicans.",
            "Conservative policies, the researchers found, are the driving force behind America’s declining lifespans.",
            "“Across a huge range of issues, the more liberal version of state policies predicts longer life expectancy and the conservative version predicts shorter life expectancy,” said Jennifer Karas Montez, a sociologist at Syracuse University and the study’s lead author. Passing tougher regulations on tobacco and guns while enhancing labor rights and pay could extend U.S. life expectancy by as much as 2.8 years for women and 2.1 years for men. “Our findings are very powerful and very consistent,” Montez said.",
            "The study illuminates the choice before Americans in the 2020 election. While the Republican Party has declined to release a national policy platform for the next four years, the GOP currently holds 29 state legislatures and 26 governorships and has spent decades enacting its preferred policies in conservative states.",
            "Over the last decade, a growing body of research has found that these policies are negatively affecting the health of constituents. In a 2017 study, researchers discovered that U.S. states with less income inequality, larger tax credits for poor workers and higher cigarette taxes had lower disability rates. According to a 2006 report, countries that spend more on early childhood education have better outcomes on a wide range of health measures, from smoking rates to cognitive development to crime rates.",
            "Five years ago, Indiana had an unprecedented outbreak of 215 HIV infections, mostly among drug users. The vast majority of these cases, epidemiologists concluded in a 2018 study, could have been prevented if then-Gov. Mike Pence had allowed needle exchange programs. The outbreak eventually subsided when Pence reversed his conservative policy and allowed exchanges to open.",
            "The same effect appears with a wide range of diseases and an even wider range of policies.",
            "“What liberal policies have in common is that they’re ways of investing in people,” Montez said. “They make sure working adults have a decent income, they have labor rights and they can breathe cleaner air. Conservative policies tend to do the opposite.”",
            "The Diverging States of America",
            "The starting point for Montez’s study was the striking health disparities between states. Hawaii has a life expectancy of nearly 82 years, roughly on par with Finland and New Zealand. West Virginia has a lifespan of just under 75 years, more comparable to Honduras and Belarus.",
            "While states have always differed on health measures, the gap has grown since the 1980s. This widening disparity presents a puzzle. The most obvious explanation for the United States’ lagging mortality rates is its fragmented, profit-driven health care system. Millions of Americans either don’t have health insurance or have such low-quality coverage that illness can bring ruinous costs.",
            "But if medical care were the sole reason for low life expectancy, states wouldn’t show such alarming mortality differences. People in Hawaii, after all, are just as vulnerable to the vicissitudes of emergency room bills and extortionate copays as those in West Virginia. Plus, numerous studies have found health disparities persist even between Americans who have high-quality medical coverage and people in other wealthy countries.",
            "“The medical system explains some of the disparity, but it leaves a lot out,” Montez said. “To explain the deficit, you have to explain why some states are doing really well while others are flatlining.”",
            "So what does explain the rest of the disparity? The widening divide between liberal and conservative policies.",
            "Over the last 30 years, federal authorities have handed a huge range of powers down to the states. From welfare payments to environmental protection to gun control, state legislatures have taken on an increasingly influential role in setting public policy.",
            "And they have, to say the least, used these powers for different purposes. Blue states have established steep tobacco taxes, strict automobile emissions standards and (relatively) generous unemployment benefits. Red states have restricted welfare, lifted regulations on businesses and preempted cities from raising wages or requiring sick leave for workers.",
            "Over time, these policy changes have produced strikingly different outcomes. Every year, Massachusetts spends more than $14,000 on welfare per low-income resident. Florida spends a paltry $3,904. Seattle has a minimum wage of $15.75 per hour, whereas Atlanta is prohibited by state law from exceeding $7.25 per hour. A pack of cigarettes costs $5.25 in Missouri and $12.85 in New York.",
            "“Every policy is a public health policy,” said Steven Woolf, a physician and epidemiologist at Virginia Commonwealth University. “It’s easier to notice that when the policies are more directly related to public health, like when states repeal their motorcycle helmet laws and all of a sudden they have more deaths from motorcycle accidents. But what we’re finding out is that a huge range of other social and economic policies have similar effects.”",
            "Montez’s study examined 121 laws that differed between states. Tobacco regulations, civil rights legislation, environmental safeguards and labor protections were all significantly correlated with higher life expectancy. Protections for LGBTQ rights and liberal access to abortion also predicted longer lifespans, but with smaller effects.",
            "In nearly every category, the liberal version of the policy was associated with a longer lifespan.",
            "The only area where liberal policies were linked to shorter lifespans was marijuana: Residents of states that restrict cannabis tend to live longer than those where it’s legal. And policies related to campaign finance, immigration, taxes, education, housing and transportation didn’t appear to affect lifespans significantly.",
            "Others, like voting rights, affected women’s longevity but not men’s.",
            "Why Health Disparities Remain",
            "The findings from Montez and her colleagues represent a paradigm shift from previous explanations for America’s languishing lifespans.",
            "“Epidemiologists have traditionally focused on individual explanations — what are Americans doing wrong?” Montez said. Life expectancy was shrinking, went the theory, because we refuse to eat better, stop smoking and start exercising.",
            "“Even if you could explain this troubling trend by lifestyle choices, that doesn’t explain why Americans smoke more, take more drugs and don’t move as much,” Montez said. “We need to look at issues like corporate behavior and environmental policies and how we’re spread out geographically.”",
            "Policy choices profoundly affect American eating and exercise habits, after all, especially crop subsidies, housing policy and infrastructure management. Individual preference alone cannot explain large-scale societal trends, such as the percentage of children who walk or bike to school falling from 48% in 1969 to 13% in 2009. Furthermore, differences in life expectancy between states are greatest among the poor and less-educated ― the populations most vulnerable to hazardous environments and cuts to welfare.",
            "“A lot of the behaviors that affect lifespan, like drugs and bad diets, are compensating behaviors,” said Mark Hayward, a sociologist at the University of Texas at Austin who studies population health. “They’re a response to the stresses of day-to-day existence. If you’re well-educated, it matters less where you live, but life can be a slippery slope for people at the bottom of the ladder.”",
            "Numerous health conditions and measures, from diabetes to HIV to high infant mortality, play out along the same political and economic disparities ― but they don’t have to.",
            "“It’s important when we debate policies that affect people’s pocketbooks,” said Montez, “to acknowledge that they also have implications for how long people will live.”"

            "The University of Arizona discovered two students had the coronavirus with no symptoms and were able to stop an outbreak in its tracks because of wastewater testing.",
            "University President Dr. Robert Robbins confirmed to local outlet KOLD News 13 that wastewater samples from the Likins Hall dorm in Tucson came back positive for COVID-19, prompting the school to test the 311 students and staff in that dorm. Of those tested, two were positive and have since been put in isolation. The school is also conducting contact tracing, Robbins said.",
            "Dr. Ian Pepper, an environmental science professor at the university and the director of its Water & Energy Sustainable Technology Center, told the outlet that his team has been sampling sewage from dorms, as it “can pick up a single positive case in a group of 10,000.”",
            "Earlier this month, Pepper talked to the “Arizona Science” podcast about his team’s work, sharing that “poop can tell you the truth about yourself and your community.”",
            "“By analyzing the sewage, we’re actually monitoring the whole community with one test,” he said, adding that wastewater testing can give “the total virus load shed by infected individuals both with symptoms and asymptomatic ― no symptoms.”",
            "Pepper went on to say that “sewage surveillance is a leading indicator” because “you can detect the virus in sewage seven days prior to symptoms appearing.”",
            "“That gives you seven precious days in which you can put in mitigation or interventions to try to deal with the virus. I think about a week in the U.S. is probably equivalent to 20 or 30,000 cases,” he told the podcast.",
            "Wastewater testing involves monitoring the presence of coronavirus RNA in the water and can be done very fast. Pepper says he can turn results around the same day that they collect the sample.",
            "The University of Arizona is far from the first place to use sewage to zero in on cases before outbreaks begin. The practice has been in use all over Europe, from Scotland to Milan to Paris. As of this month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is “developing a portal for state, tribal, local, and territorial health departments to submit wastewater testing data into a national database for use in summarizing and interpreting data for public health action.”\n\n“Participation in a national database will ensure data comparability across jurisdictions,” the website says in the recent update.\n\nHuffPost has reached out to the University of Arizona for more information."

            "A day after the Republican National Convention stressed how much Donald Trump has done for the little guy, White House economic policy adviser Larry Kudlow bragged on Tuesday about the president’s plans to reduce the capital gains tax and cut still more of the health, labor and environmental rules that guide business conduct.",
            "As a sign that this top-heavy approach was already succeeding, Kudlow pointed to gains to the stock market since March.",
            "“The S&P 500 is up 50 percent from its low in March,” Kudlow said, glossing over the stock index’s more than 1,000-point drop from February to March.",
            "Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council, added that, “looking ahead, more tax cuts and regulatory rollback will be in store.”",
            "“Payroll tax cuts for higher wages,” he added, “income tax cuts for the middle class. Capital gains tax cuts for investment, productivity and jobs. Much more regulatory relief for small businesses.”",
            "Analyses of cuts to the capital gains tax have shown that 99% of the benefit would go to the richest 1% of Americans. And an estimated 65% payroll tax cut would benefit the richest 20%.",
            "Those economic policies, which would overwhelmingly benefit the rich, are a stark contrast from the message of the first night of the convention, when speakers stressed that Trump was helping “the little guy” and lowering unemployment rates for the poor and minorities.",
            "Kudlow also charged that, if Joe Biden becomes president, he would massively raise taxes.",
            "“In economic terms, folks, this is no time for a $4 trillion tax hike,” Kudlow said. (Biden has proposed restoring the former income tax rate of 39.6% for individuals making more than $400,000 a year, which had been lowered to 37% under Trump, and raising the capital gains rate to that same percentage.)",
            "“Coming out of the deep pandemic, who in their right mind would pick the pockets of taxpayers and drain the money from their wallets and purses?” Kudlow asked. “Look, our economic choice is very clear: Do you want economic health, prosperity, opportunity and optimism, or do you want to turn back to the dark days of stagnation, recession and pessimism?”",
            "The economy has officially been in a recession since February, and unemployment remains above 10%. But Kudlow seems to think the worst is over.",
            "“It was awful. Health and economic impacts were tragic,” Kudlow said, using the past tense.",
            "Kudlow’s actual remarks strayed from his prepared remarks, where he said of the coronavirus: “We still have a lot of hardship, and we have a lot of heartbreak.”",
            "He ended up dropping that line.",
            "Kudlow, who reminded viewers on Tuesday that he also served in the Reagan administration, is one of the Trump White House’s most devout adherents of the conservative church of trickle-down economics. Trickle-down theory holds that, regardless of the economic problem, the solution always involves cutting taxes for rich people and loosening corporate regulations. In the decades in between White House stints, he spent his days fulminating against taxes and regulations to audiences of Wall Street bankers glued to CNBC’s business-friendly broadcasts.",
            "It’s not particularly surprising then that Kudlow would see cutting taxes on capital gains, which generally benefit the wealthiest slice of Americans, as just the thing for an ailing U.S. economy with yawning inequality.",
            "Capital gains tax cuts, long favored by proponents of trickle-down economics ― sometimes nicknamed Reaganomics ― benefit the wealthy because the types of transactions that are subject to capital gains taxes ― profits earned on the sale of stocks and other financial assets ― are overwhelmingly concentrated in the hands of the rich. Though 55% of Americans own some stock, 84% of stocks are owned by the wealthiest 10% of households.",
            "The last time Congress cut capital gains taxes, at the behest of the George W. Bush administration, income inequality and the national debt skyrocketed, while middle-class wages budged only modestly. The super-rich investment class, flush with cash, helped finance a housing bubble that ended up igniting the biggest economic conflagration since the Great Depression.",
            "In a way, though, Kudlow’s speech was a fitting coda to Trump’s disappointing first term as president.",
            "As a presidential candidate, Trump ran as a vanquisher of GOP economic pieties, promising to protect the social safety net and stand up to Wall Street. But he ended up letting people like Kudlow devise his economic policies.",
            "Trump’s biggest legislative achievement was the lopsided 2017 tax cut bill that reduced income taxes, estate taxes and corporate taxes in ways that disproportionately benefited Americans who are already well off. At the time of its passage, the top 1% of earners were projected to reap 80% of the tax savings from the bill in the first decade of it being in effect."

            "The event was organized by the United States of Women, an advocacy group for gender equality, and When We All Vote, a nonpartisan initiative to encourage voting, and Meghan did not mention a political party or a candidate. But Morgan felt that the duchess got too political.",

            "Though the Duchess of Sussex didn’t respond to Morgan, Midler got the job done in just three little words: “Oh, fuck off.”",
            "While there is no law barring members of the British royal family from voting and they support causes that could implicate government policy, senior members are expected to remain clear of electoral politics. The queen, in particular, must remain politically neutral.",
            "Between that tradition and the attacks that Meghan has regularly faced in the British tabloid press, it’s no surprise that other U.K. commentators also leaped to criticize her. Dan Wooten, executive editor of The Sun, tweeted that the duchess was “now actively campaigning against Donald Trump.”",
            "But Midler wasn’t the only one to come to her defense,",
            "In response to Wooten, actor Jameela Jamil wrote that the royal family might be “more embarrassed” by Prince Andrew, “who was besties with a sex trafficker, than an American supporting women voting in her own country, and loosely referencing the importance of general democracy which is being threatened here currently.”",
            "Andrew stepped back from royal duties in November of last year following a disastrous BBC Newsnight interview that discussed his ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The prince has been accused of raping a minor who was allegedly trafficked by Epstein, although Andrew has repeatedly denied all allegations.",
            "Before marrying into the royal family, the future Duchess of Sussex made her political views known. During an appearance on “The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore” prior to the 2016 election, Meghan referred to Donald Trump as “divisive” and “misogynistic.”",
            "Since stepping back as a senior working member of the royal family this year and settling into a new role beyond palace walls, Meghan has been actively encouraging Americans to exercise their right to vote.",
            "“I know what it’s like to have a voice, and also what it’s like to feel voiceless,” the duchess said in a Marie Claire feature published earlier this month.\n\n“I also know that so many men and women have put their lives on the line for us to be heard,” she added. “And that opportunity, that fundamental right, is in our ability to exercise our right to vote and to make all of our voices heard.”\n\nSubscribe to HuffPost’s Watching the Royals newsletter for all things Windsor (and beyond)."

            "Sixteen-year-old Casey, a high school junior living in New York, has amassed more than 50,000 new Instagram followers since the start of this year. On his account, @FuriousPatriot, he churns out memes that lionize President Donald Trump and ridicule Democrats and the mainstream media. One is a manipulated image of the Democratic nominee, former Vice President Joe Biden, asleep on a lectern; another is a GIF that calls Biden’s running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), a “hoe” and simulates her performing oral sex. A third falsely accuses CNN of altering a photo to make a gunman’s skin appear lighter.",
            "Amid the sea of memes, a new post stands out. It’s a paid promotion for a clothing brand’s fitted T-shirts, featuring an illustration of Trump dominating Biden in a wrestling match. This kind of ad, known as “sponcon,” is common on Instagram — influencers regularly score endorsement deals and earn a commission from their followers’ purchases.",
            "Casey doesn’t consider himself to be an influencer, and he certainly doesn’t fit the stereotype. Instagram starlets, who can earn salaries of up to six figures on the platform, are often conventionally attractive young women who grow their audiences with glamorous photos of themselves — lounging by the pool, luxury traveling, modeling lingerie — while profiting off the attention by shilling for brands.",
            "But in recent years, the influencer marketing business model has given rise to a starkly different crop of entrepreneurial content creators — one led by young men and teenage boys like Casey. In lieu of selfies, they’ve found another niche that, with the help of Instagram’s powerful recommendation algorithm, has also proven highly effective at attracting followers (and brand deals) en masse: MAGA memes.",
            "Casey is part of a sprawling network of ad-hungry memers reaching millions of followers. They chase growth at all costs by sharing a torrent of right-wing clickbait — often including content that crosses the line from snarky political satire to hyperpartisan misinformation and bigotry. Though they decry the “fake news” media, many accounts circulate falsehoods and conspiracy theories with roots in the far-right QAnon movement. And throughout the coronavirus pandemic, they have downplayed the crisis, demonizing public health officials and railing against face masks. They also pander to their base by demeaning prominent female Democrats — especially those of color — in crude and sexist ways.",
            "This effort to capitalize on America’s fractured political climate, and Instagram’s amplification of inflammatory content, is working remarkably well. As Election Day looms, MAGA meme moguls are enjoying explosive surges in traffic, even earning “likes” and reposts or follows from Trump’s confidantes ― including his sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump. Their thriving cottage industry serves as a free propaganda operation for the president’s campaign, and highlights the role that social media platforms play in fueling political polarization by incentivizing the spread of hyperpartisan agitprop.",
            "“Instagram is a gold mine,” Casey told HuffPost. “And it’s only getting better.”",
            "Inside Teens’ Lucrative MAGA Meme Factory",
            "There are hundreds of sponcon-soliciting MAGA meme accounts, ranging in size from a few thousand followers to well over 1 million. Many are fan pages for Trump and members of his inner circle, such as Donald Trump Jr., White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany and Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas). Some are dedicated to trashing Biden, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and other top Democrats. But the majority purport to be partisan news and satire pages, like Casey’s. Certain terms and themes frequently appear in the usernames of such accounts; there are umpteen variations on “patriot,” “libtard,” “deplorable” and “snowflake.”",
            "The teen MAGA memer subculture contains both true believers and opportunists ― and, sometimes, both. A staunch Republican, Casey started his account as a fun way to post about his political views, and never expected to have much of an audience. But he soon realized it could become much more.",
            "“I saw other conservative meme pages posting ads, and I thought, ‘If I actually grow this account really big, I can do that to earn money on the side,’” the 10th grader, who also works part-time at a restaurant, told HuffPost over the phone.",
            "Casey began posting multiple times a day, and studied what kind of content would really drive traffic. It had to be incendiary, and fit a specific narrative. Once, when he shared a post questioning whether a police officer had unjustly shot someone during an arrest, he received angry messages and even lost some followers. He quickly realized he could get more likes and follows with memes that attacked Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).",
            "“Conservatives are more likely to be hating on her,” Casey explained. “We [memers] just do it to get followers. We’re not actually trying to make AOC look bad or anything — it’s just to grow our accounts.” And it does: “I hit 50K [followers] way before my expected goal,” he said. “As we get closer to the election, I feel like I’m going to grow even more.”",
            "The young men who run these pages tend to describe themselves on Instagram in ways that emphasize both their age and their political valence: “16 year old patriot,” “teen Republican,” “20 year old conservative,” “Political Teen,” “15 Year Old Die Hard Trump Supporter,” pro-Trump “high schooler.” Like other savvy influencers, they often appear in livestreamed videos to engage with their followers, who tend to be much older. Those who spoke to HuffPost said their audiences consist mainly of “Boomers.” The owners of many meme accounts are minors, and HuffPost is protecting their identities as requested (including Casey, whose name has been changed).",
            "For Daniel, the 21-year-old Nevada resident behind the QAnon-promoting meme page @TrumpsPlans, ad requests slowly started rolling in after he passed 10,000 followers a few months ago. Now he has more than 40,000 followers and says he receives more marketing requests than he can handle — posting ads too frequently can scare off followers, after all. Last month, he said, he earned $1,200.",
            "“This is just a side hustle that I have,” Daniel added, “but I realized it has big potential.”",
            "‘DM For Business’",
            "Most MAGA memers openly solicit marketing partnerships right in their Instagram bios with requests for brands to direct-message them, such as “💰DM For Business💰,” “📩Msg for biz promo” and “DM FOR AD RATES!!!” Often, novice pages will pay bigger ones to promote them and help them grow through shoutouts in posts or Instagram Stories.",
            "When it comes to brands, successful MAGA memers work almost exclusively with little-known firms that are seeking targeted exposure to sell their Trump swag or apparel. Typical ad deals include posts that display a company’s products or promotions (often including “free” giveaways that are actually bait-and-switch schemes), along with captions instructing people to click the “link in bio” to visit the company’s website. The Proud Republicans, Keep Gifts Great, The Patriot Factory, Trump Face Mask 2020, Right Revolt, Bold Eagle USA, The MAGA Shop, Republican Gadgets, The Louder Party, Crusader Outlet, Trump Collection Co. and numerous others have all partnered with memers to peddle their products.",
            "Although the Federal Trade Commission orders influencers and brands to clearly and conspicuously disclose their paid relationships on Instagram and other platforms, this rule is poorly enforced. A representative for Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, directed HuffPost to a Facebook policy page for its branded content tool, which makes it easy to label posts as ads. But MAGA memers almost never use it, not wanting to draw attention to the fact that a post is sponsored rather than an independent endorsement.",
            "This marketing approach can be more cost-efficient than traditional advertising strategies. Unlike TV or radio ads, the meme pages’ posts reach a very specific audience of people who share a common interest — in this case, Trump — and many young memers offer better rates than digital ad giants such as Facebook and Google. Daniel charges around $10 to $15 to keep a sponsored post up on his page for 24 hours before deleting it; Casey charges $30.",
            "It’s not much to start out with, but as MAGA meme pages grow, they can generate more income for their owners. Casey said that when he asked a conservative memer who has close to 2 million followers for a shoutout post, the given rate was $400 for a single hour. And in the current political climate, these pages can quickly become huge.",
            "Rogan O’Handley, a millennial from Tampa, Florida, left a career in finance law to launch his pro-Trump meme account, @DC_Draino, shortly after the 2016 election. The page now boasts 1.5 million followers and a bio that reads, in part, “DM FOR BUSINESS.” Between ads, his content centers around political news and is occasionally reposted by Donald Trump Jr., who on Instagram calls himself “General in the Meme Wars.” O’Handley’s influence has grown so large that the White House invited him to attend its Social Media Summit last year.",
            "O’Handley did not respond to a request for an interview. His page appears to be a passion project that’s sustained by frequent ads, but his success has been inspiring to many memers who aggressively solicit brand deals in hopes of cashing in on inflamed political tensions ahead of the election. O’Handley has even offered advice to conservatives starting new pages. “Just do it,” he wrote in an Instagram Story. “Every meme counts.”",
            "In an effort to reach his level, many memers chasing ad deals post inflammatory content to drive traffic ― whether it comes in the form of support from fellow conservatives, or angry comments from liberals.",
            "“That stuff honestly helps me,” Casey said. “[My followers] will respond and just boost my engagement, so hey, I like it getting hate comments.”",
            "Working The Algorithm",
            "Memers hoping to go viral often traffic in racism, misogyny and misinformation. But some are reckoning with the consequences of spreading such content. Daniel, who has posted memes accusing Biden of pedophilia and calling antifa activists a “complete waste of semen,” told HuffPost he’s trying to cut down on sharing divisive posts because he doesn’t like pitting people against each other.",
            "“Some meme pages go too far,” he said. “It shouldn’t just be about offending people.”",
            "Days later, however, he posted a video of a man dressed as Trump picking up a woman dressed as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and throwing her over his shoulder onto the ground. It quickly racked up tens of thousands of views.",
            "This kind of polarizing and prejudicial content is reminiscent of the meme-based Facebook operation that Russia launched ahead of America’s 2016 election to divide and manipulate voters. Although the MAGA memers’ objectives are less nefarious, and primarily financial, they’re still exploiting and exacerbating political divisions ahead of one of the most important elections in American history. And Instagram is helping them do it.",
            "The kinds of memes described above frequently appear in Instagram’s algorithmically curated hashtag and Explore feeds. This helps them reach new people who don’t already follow the memers’ accounts, and incentivizes the memers to shell out even more disinformation and hateful propaganda. Instagram regularly rewards such content with increased visibility. When you search for #MichelleObama on Instagram, for example, one of the top results is #MichelleObamaIsAMan — a reference to the meme-fueled conspiracy theory that the former first lady is a trans woman.",
            "As with most social media platforms, Instagram’s recommendation engine was designed to show users whatever content it algorithmically determines will keep them on the app for the longest period of time, because their attention is the commodity that Instagram sells to its own advertisers. Influencers know this well, and they’ve learned how to consistently produce the kind of attention-grabbing content that stimulates algorithmic promotion — whether it’s pretty selfies, fashion inspo or polarizing clickbait.",
            "Instagram’s role in propagating fake news and hate speech in this way has largely flown under the radar. Although it partners with third-party fact-checking organizations to apply labels to posts that contain misinformation, it does not remove them. It also announced a policy last week aimed at stifling the spread of QAnon content, but has yet to implement it.",
            "Unlike platforms such as YouTube, Instagram doesn’t give its users an opportunity to earn a cut of the ad revenue they generate, so financially, there’s less of a direct incentive to try to gain lots of followers or go viral (through incendiary content or otherwise). But Instagram is the backbone of the influencer marketing economy — which is projected to be worth $15 billion by 2022, nearly doubling in three years — and the app’s recommendation engine can rapidly turn content creators into social media sensations who attract brand deals like flies.",
            "Many of the memers who talked to HuffPost insisted that they receive no algorithmic amplification, and in fact claimed they’re actually victims of political censorship through “shadow-banning,” echoing the false narrative that Big Tech is biased against conservatives. Yet in captions on their Instagram posts, they regularly instruct viewers to follow them — indicating that they’re not only aware they’re reaching new people through Explore and hashtag pages, but that they’re counting on such promotion as a way to grow their accounts.",
            "Literal Fake News",
            "Outside of algorithmic amplification, MAGA memers commonly resort to cheap tactics to gain followers. One page will post a doctored tweet that typically appears to show a Democratic politician calling for another meme account to be taken offline for spouting hate speech — along with a message urging people to go follow that account to show support. (The supposedly targeted account will then return the favor, posting a similarly doctored tweet and directing people to follow the other page.) They also share fake Instagram notifications as “evidence” that they’ve been shadow-banned, and fake news headlines that purport to show major news outlets calling for their deplatforming.",
            "“I know it’s dumb, but it works,” Casey said, noting the fake-tweet technique can earn him as many as 1,000 new followers at a time. “It’s really easy. There’s even an app you can use.”",
            "Such posts may seem like obvious hoaxes, but people still fall for them — likely in part because they look up to the influencers who share them. One post shows a doctored tweet supposedly written by 17-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg, which says: “It’s unbelievable how offensive the Trump Campaign account @trumpfact on Instagram can be. They said ‘Merry Christmas’ rather than ‘Happy Holidays.’” In a maelstrom of angry comments, people responded by calling Thunberg a “brat,” an “asshole” and “stupid eurotrash.” One user called for someone to “shove something in her mouth long enough to shut her up, and give her a nice warm feeling in her throat at the end.”",
            "The MAGA meme community is so rife with disinformation and deceptive advertising that it has triggered internal criticism.",
            "“It’s kind of a scam,” said 15-year-old Reed Cooper, who asked to be identified by his real name, which he displays on his meme page, @GodBlessDJT. “A lot of these pages are just in it for the money. I mean no offense — I’ve talked to a lot of them, and they see it as a job.”",
            "The Virginia-based high schooler features Trump quotes, Bible verses and QAnon conspiracies on his account, which he started in January and which now has more than 40,000 followers. But he doesn’t run ads — his dream is to get so popular through social media that he has an opportunity to meet Trump.",
            "“I wear Trump shirts everywhere I go,” he said. “I guess you could say I’m obsessed.”",
            "Donald Trump Jr. even reposted one of his memes, branded with Cooper’s original logo — but failed to tag or credit him. Cooper still hopes the “Meme Wars” general will follow him back. In the meantime, he’s using his page to help “rally the base” ahead of November.",
            "While Casey espouses the same views, his priority — like that of many teens in the MAGA meme sphere — remains a financial one. After shilling for so many Republican apparel brands on Instagram, he hopes to start his own someday. He’s dedicated to doing whatever he can to draw in new followers and build up a future customer base.",
            "Asked if he actually believes in the divisive messaging behind the memes he posts, or if he ever considers their impact, the teenager paused for a moment.",
            "“No,” he said. “Some stuff I post, it’s just because it will get likes. But am I trying to post my beliefs, or am I trying to grow something I can turn into a bigger business down the road?”"

            "The Republican National Convention kicked off Monday night with an anti-teachers union screed from a 28-year educator who also recently wrote an op-ed accusing U.S. schools of grooming children to be sexualized.",
            "“If we as a society are so disturbed by the actions of Epstein, Miss Maxwell and an untold number of others,” Rebecca Friedrichs wrote in The Washington Times in July, referring to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and his criminally charged former partner Ghislaine Maxwell, “then why are we allowing America’s public schools to groom our children to be sexualized?”",
            "The essence of Friedrichs’ argument is that sex education can “sexualize” children and lead to “heightened sexual activity and even abuse by predators like Epstein.”",
            "While Friedrichs offers no empirical evidence to support this claim, naturally, she argues that unions are to blame.",
            "“Leading this despicable charge are unions posing as teachers and the deceptively named Healthy Teen Network, a coalition of over 180 sexual and reproductive-health justice organizations,” Friedrichs wrote.",
            "Her tenuous argument seems to rest on the presumption that sex education in schools promotes activities that would lead children to sexual predators. Again, there is no evidence offered to support this, and as FiveThirtyEight noted in 2018, hundreds of studies on the efficacy of sex education have shown that those classes do not increase sexual activity — they may actually delay teen sexual activity — and have decreased teen pregnancy and the spread of STDs.",
            "In her speech Monday night, Friedrichs charged that unions had “intentionally rewritten American history to perpetuate division, pervert the memories of our American founders, and disparage our Judeo-Christian virtues.” She added that lenient discipline policies had “morphed” schools in “war zones.”"

            "House Democrats will launch an investigation into whether Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s planned address to the Republican National Convention on Tuesday night violates State Department policies and laws that prohibit federal employees from engaging in partisan political activities, The Daily Beast reported Tuesday afternoon.",
            "Pompeo’s unprecedented speech, which is being taped in Jerusalem during a foreign tour as part of his official duties as America’s top diplomat, would mark the first time a sitting secretary of state has addressed a political convention in recent memory, and is another sordid episode in the Trump administration’s effort to turn every aspect of American foreign policy into a blatant tool for domestic political gain.",
            "But while it’s definitely a break from tradition ― Condoleezza Rice avoided the RNC in 2004, even at the height of the Bush administration’s efforts to politicize the War on Terror, and former secretaries of state Hillary Clinton and John Kerry skipped Democratic conventions in 2012 and 2016, respectively ― the speech has also dismayed diplomats and State Department officials who’ve argued that his appearance is a blatant violation of the Hatch Act, the federal law in question.",
            "Pompeo’s address, The Associated Press reported, will focus on President Donald Trump’s “America First” foreign policy, and he tweeted that he’s “looking forward to sharing with you how my family is more SAFE and more SECURE because of President Trump.”",
            "State Department officials insisted to AP and Reuters this week that Pompeo’s speech is not ethically or legally problematic because he will address the convention in his “personal capacity,” rather than as secretary of state.",
            "“What the hell does that mean?” one former Trump administration official, who requested anonymity to speak freely, said in an interview with HuffPost. “What personal capacity does a secretary of State have outside of, say, the bathroom?”",
            "Democrats on the Hill were similarly aghast.",
            "“Once again, the rules go out the window for Secretary Pompeo when they get in the way of serving his political interests and Donald Trump,” Rep. Eliot Engel, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a statement about the speech.",
            "Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas), the chairman of the subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun on Tuesday that he would lead a probe into whether Pompeo’s speech violates the law and State Department protocol, The Daily Beast reported.",
            "The Foreign Affairs committee obtained State Department documents this week that show Pompeo sent a cable to employees reminding them to avoid partisan political activities, and reiterated that “Senate-confirmed Presidential appointees may not even attend a political party convention or convention-related event.” (State Department officials told AP that legal advisers reviewed and signed off on Pompeo’s speech, while Politico reported that officials have suggested that because the speech is prerecorded, it doesn’t necessarily count as “attending” the convention.)",
            "The idea that “politics stop at the water’s edge” has always been a bit naive, but under Trump and Pompeo, the line between foreign affairs and domestic politics has blurred to the point that they’re indistinguishable.",
            "“Everything is being politicized and used for electoral advantage,” the former administration official said. “All aspects of what an administration does are going to be used for its electoral aims in some fashion. But the question is who’s doing it, and how he’s using it.”",
            "In 2019, Pompeo delivered a speech in Cairo that spent as much time lambasting the Middle East policy of President Barack Obama as it did laying out the Trump administration’s view of the world, a clear sign that under Pompeo’s direction, U.S. foreign policy would be driven by the political whims and grudges of a president with little knowledge of or interest in the world.",
            "“In nearly 25 years of working for half a dozen administrations — both Republican and Democratic — I never saw one so obsessed with defining itself against the successes and failures of another,” Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Wilson Center in Washington and a longtime U.S. diplomat, wrote of the speech. When he did focus on actual policy, Pompeo outlined an approach to the Middle East that was “highly moralistic, muscular and far too black-and-white for a region better suited to gray,” Miller wrote.",
            "Overtly political and overly simplistic have defined U.S. foreign policy on Pompeo and Trump’s watch, and the site of Pompeo’s RNC speech is yet another example: In December 2017, the Trump administration relocated the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, officially recognizing the latter as the Israeli capital. It was a controversial and complex decision (one future Democratic administrations are unlikely to reverse) that, under Trump, was made almost solely with domestic politics in mind.",
            "“That’s for the evangelicals,” Trump said of the embassy move in a stump speech earlier this month, admitting that it was a political giveaway to voters who’ve long wanted the embassy moved. “The evangelicals are more excited by that than Jewish people.”",
            "Closer to home, Trump’s attempts to oust leftist Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his simultaneous rollback of Obama’s efforts to normalize relations with Cuba’s communist government are widely regarded as a nakedly political maneuver to drive out Cuban and Venezuelan-American voters in Florida this fall. (Trump has empowered a longtime lobbyist and political operative to design a “maximum pressure” strategy that has proven empty as a foreign policy but potentially useful as an electoral cudgel.)",
            "Trump was also impeached less than a year ago for overtly blending foreign policy and his reelection efforts. Last July, Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to “do us a favor” by digging up dirt on Hunter Biden, the son of Democratic nominee Joe Biden, over businesses the younger Biden was involved with in the country. His February impeachment apparently didn’t put a stop to the practice: This July, Brazilian newspapers reported that Todd Chapman, Trump’s ambassador to Brazil, asked the Brazilian government to relax ethanol tariffs in order to boost Trump’s reelection campaign in Iowa.",
            "House Democrats also raised concerns about potential political interference after Eduardo Bolsonaro, the son of right-wing Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, tweeted a campaign-style video promoting Trump’s reelection.",
            "“After everything that occurred in the U.S. presidential election in 2016,” Engel wrote in a letter to Chapman, “we frankly believe that you should know better.”",
            "Pompeo’s appearance at the RNC is another example of his “repeated and blatant use of his office for overtly political purposes,” Kate Bedingfield, the Biden campaign’s deputy campaign manager, said Tuesday, according to USA Today.",
            "“Every day America’s diplomats abroad proudly represent our country — not a political party — but Mike Pompeo’s repeated and blatant use of his office for overtly political purposes only serves to undercut their work, and it further weakens the critical alliances and global relationships that have already been so badly damaged by this administration’s recklessness,” she said."

            "As South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster prepared to announce the end of a coronavirus stay-at-home order, his top staff received an email from the state health department.",
            "The message, highlighted in bold, was clear: Wait longer before allowing customers back inside restaurants, hair salons and other businesses where people will be in close contact.",
            "Instead, McMaster pressed ahead with a plan written by the state restaurant association to resume inside dining on May 11. The guidelines made masks optional for employees and allowed more customers inside than the health agency had advised.",
            "A few days later, the Republican governor opened the doors to salons, fitness centers and swimming pools. He did not wait to gauge the effect of the restaurant reopening on the virus, as public health officials had suggested. Like many states, South Carolina later experienced a surge in infections that forced McMaster to dial back his reopening plan.",
            "He was hardly alone. Thousands of pages of emails provided to The Associated Press under open-records laws show that governors across the U.S. were inundated with reopening advice from a wide range of industries — from campgrounds in New Hampshire to car washes in Washington. Some governors put economic interests ahead of public health guidance, and certain businesses were allowed to write the rules that would govern their own operations.",
            "As job losses accelerated, the pressure to reopen intensified.",
            "“Attraction folks are on me like white on rice,” McMaster’s tourism director wrote to the head of the governor’s reopening task force, describing lobbying from amusement parks, bingo halls and other entertainment venues.",
            "Though governors often work with business leaders to craft policy, the emails offer a new window into their decisions during a critical early juncture in the nation’s battle against the pandemic. Many governors chose to reopen before their states met all the nationally recommended health guidelines, which include a sustained downward rate of infection and robust testing and contact tracing.",
            "“The interest in trying to reopen and restart economic activity had a much greater pull at the time ... than did public health concerns or question marks about how it would go,” said Anita Cicero, deputy director of the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security.",
            "Many states were forced to halt or roll back their reopening plans as COVID-19 cases spiked across the country this summer, and the number of infections and deaths in the U.S. far outpaced those of any other country.",
            "In early August, McMaster transformed his restaurant guidelines into requirements, including a mandate that all diners and employees wear masks. The governor’s spokesman, Brian Symmes, said “some restaurants weren’t doing what they needed to do.”",
            "Symmes also defended the spring reopening, saying the governor “has a wider scope of responsibility and focus than our public health officials.”",
            "“It simply isn’t the government’s job to put its thumb on the scale by shuttering these small businesses for an undefined and indefinite period of time,” Symmes said.",
            "Two weeks after North Dakota reopened, Republican Gov. Doug Burgum received a report showing a single-day spike of 69 new COVID-19 cases in one county. Burgum fired off an email to several of his top officials complaining that the outbreak — combined with lower-than-promised daily COVID-19 testing — was “driving our state numbers in the wrong direction.”",
            "“Our house is on fire,” Burgum wrote, accompanied by a fire emoji. “Need to drive a much greater sense of urgency and action.”",
            "North Dakota was among at least 15 states that provided records to the AP at no cost. A few states wanted hundreds or thousands of dollars to supply copies of the communications that could reveal how governors were making decisions — and which voices influenced them the most.",
            "Some states suspended or slowed responses to open-records requests because of the coronavirus. Three months after submitting its request, the AP is still awaiting records from many states, including California, Texas and Florida, which have the greatest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases.",
            "“In a pandemic, you need more transparency, more information — not less of either one of those,” said Dan Bevarly, executive director of the National Freedom of Information Coalition.",
            "As she was putting the finishing touches on a reopening plan in May, Oregon Gov. Kate Brown received a letter from a coalition of business groups pressing for more say in the process. Two hours later, the head of the state hospital association wrote urging the Democrat to mandate masks as “foundational to any business opening where people will be gathered, indoors or out.”",
            "At first, Brown required masks only for employees of certain businesses, but she had to reverse course as COVID-19 cases rose over the summer. She became one of 34 governors to impose statewide mask mandates.",
            "In Washington state, landscapers, dog walkers and car wash operators all had a role in the rules affecting their businesses, according to the emails provided by Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee’s administration.",
            "Lance Odermat, vice president of Brown Bear Car Wash in Seattle, said he was frustrated that car washes were not exempt from Inslee’s order shutting down many businesses in March. But Odermat continued to plead his case. He was included in a car-wash reopening group and sent the administration the company’s internal plan for reopening with coronavirus precautions.",
            "When the governor released his reopening strategy, “it seemed like a lot of those guidelines were taken directly from our operating plan,” Odermat said.",
            "In North Carolina, the head of a restaurant association sent a copy of the group’s reopening plan to Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper’s chief of staff on April 24 and warned in a letter the following week that the outlook for restaurants “becomes more dire” with each passing day. She also served on a state task force that helped shape the guidelines Cooper eventually issued, which allowed in-person dining to resume with up to 50% of fire-code capacity and tables spaced at least 6 feet apart.",
            "The tensions between economic and health interests were evident in New Hampshire in a decision allowing campgrounds to open with restricted capacities.",
            "Margaret Byrnes, executive director of the New Hampshire Municipal Association, urged Republican Gov. Chris Sununu’s administration to keep campgrounds closed because of concerns they could attract visitors from areas with higher coronavirus caseloads. She also wanted cities to have a greater voice on the governor’s reopening task force.",
            "“There was a lot of business and industry representation, which is really important in the reopening process, but it needed to be balanced with some local municipal representation,” Byrnes said.",
            "Sununu’s policy director, D.J. Bettencourt, said municipalities were represented on the task force through lawmakers who doubled as local officials. He said opening campgrounds on May 1 was “an essential aspect of ensuring housing” for some health care workers and guarding against homelessness.",
            "Back in South Carolina, the director of the state Department of Parks, Recreation and Tourism said in an April 27 email that he had asked the restaurant association to “create a plan for the ‘new dining room’” guidelines. The association proposed to resume indoor dining May 11, according to the email.",
            "On May 1, the health department chief of staff emailed the governor’s top staff saying the agency recommended waiting until May 18 to resume indoor dining. The agency also recommended a 25% capacity limit for restaurants, with no more than six people per table and mandatory masks for employees.",
            "But the governor’s final plan, announced a week later, stuck with the May 11 start date, a 50% capacity guideline and up to eight people per table. There were no mandates, and the entire policy was only a suggestion.",
            "How closely did McMaster’s restaurant guidelines mirror the industry’s plan?",
            "“Oh, it was exactly,” said Douglas OFlaherty, vice president of the restaurant organization. “He basically said, ‘What the South Carolina Restaurant and Lodging Association’s recommendations are, you should follow.’”",

            "For years, American parents have had to grapple with a deeply disturbing question: How do I explain to my children why they’re being required to huddle close to their classmates, practicing what they’d do if a shooter was loose in their school?",
            "But high-intensity active shooter drills could very soon be a thing of the past.",
            "The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) on Monday came out strongly against all but the calmest, most mild version of those drills. The group said the drills have the potential to cause substantial emotional trauma in children, while their effectiveness remains largely unproven.",
            "The new recommendations coincide with an unprecedented moment in U.S. education, as millions of students are embarking on yet another round of full-time or partial remote learning because of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
            "Experts with the AAP believe that in many ways, the new policy statement is timelier than ever, as such drills would be a particular drain on schools’ limited resources and on children’s mental health reserves.",
            "“I’m telling people right now that it makes very little sense to take all of these steps to physically distance people during the pandemic, and then ask them all to pack into a closet,” David Schonfeld, lead author of the statement and a developmental-behavioral pediatrician with the National Center for School Crisis and Bereavement at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, told HuffPost.",
            "“Some schools have to seek waivers because these active shooter drills are required on a regular basis,” he said",
            "While still rare, school shootings have increased across the U.S. over the past decade and the majority of school districts across the country now require some form of active shooter drills.",
            "But the AAP has grave concerns about the nature of these routines.",
            "In some schools, drills have included actual weapons (with blanks), theatrical makeup and really extreme acting by the faux-perpetrator or perpetrators, the group says. At times, students and staff have been led to believe that they are living through an actual attack, not a drill.",
            "To date, not much research has been conducted on the potential for emotional trauma linked to such exercises. But there are ample anecdotes. The AAP cited the example of a 7-year-old girl who wrote “love mom and dad” on her arm during a drill and later told her mom it was in case “the bad guy got to us and I got killed, you and daddy would know that I love you.”",
            "“There’s no question in my mind that exercises and drills can be sensitizing to children who are vulnerable,” Schonfeld said.",
            "In addition, evidence is lacking that many of the tactics or strategies being practiced on children are particularly effective.",
            "One study cited by the AAP found that teachers who completed trainings to help them decide between various actions during a shooting scenario (whether to run or hide, for example) were twice as likely to make critical errors in judgment than teachers who did not receive any such training.",
            "The AAP is not calling for an outright ban of all active crisis drills.",
            "Instead, the group believes they should be made much more like fire drills: conducted calmly, with no simulation of the actual crisis (attack or fire) and focused on the safe movement of students and staff throughout a school building.",

            "For the first time, Erasure’s Andy Bell is celebrating the release of new music while in self-isolation and an ocean apart from his bandmate, Vince Clarke.",
            "Released Friday, “The Neon” is Erasure’s 18th album and puts a modern spin on the glittery beats that propelled the synth-pop duo to stardom in the 1980s. Featuring Bell’s searing vocals and Clarke’s thumping basslines, songs like “Hey Now (Think I Got a Feeling)” and “Nerves of Steel” demand to be played at maximum volume ― the irony being, of course, that the COVID-19 crisis is keeping nightclubs and other venues, for which these songs feel meticulously calibrated, shuttered for the foreseeable future.",
            "“The Neon” marks a milestone for the members of Erasure, who first came together as a duo 35 years ago. It also represents a bit of a creative departure. Bell, who lives in London, recorded the album’s 10 tracks with the New York-based Clarke in Atlanta last year. Being in Georgia’s capital city, he said, imbued the music with a youthful exuberance absent from recent Erasure albums like 2017’s moody “World Be Gone.”",
            "“I just wanted to not be a middle-aged bore,” the singer, 56, quipped in an interview with HuffPost. “When I go to a new city, I love that you can be whoever you want to be. You don’t carry all your baggage with you when you go somewhere new. ... I think I kind of reverted back to being a 17-year-old. I had an instinctive feeling it was going to be good.”",
            "Thus far, listeners seem to agree. Consequence of Sound called the album “an undeniable positive for the world,” while Pop Matters praised its “superb electropop” that is “as vibrant as any from the past three and a half decades.”",
            "And Bell isn’t bothered if Erasure’s new songs don’t hit the critical or commercial heights of the band’s ’80s classics like “Chains of Love” and “A Little Respect.”",
            "“I love being under the radar,” he said. “We’re a cult band, which I love. I love my anonymity. We’ve always been a backdrop, especially in the U.K., kind of like ABBA. I feel like we’re very much aligned with them because they were always there. Now they’re always here all the time.”",
            "Bell came out as gay to his family at 17 and, unlike many of his 1980s and ’90s contemporaries, has never shied away expressing his authentic self both publicly and in performances. In 2004, he announced to fans that he was HIV-positive.",
            "Though he bemoans the “sensory overload” of the contemporary pop landscape, he’s nonetheless impressed by openly LGBTQ stars like Adam Lambert and Sam Smith. Still, he fears they, too, could face unforeseen challenges down the line.",
            "“[Coming out] is, in some ways, treated as promotion by record companies now,” he said. “It’s fine if you’re winning for the record company. But I’m always on the lookout for when they get passed by, because they’re probably first on the list to get dropped.”",
            "Bell also shrugs off the notion he helped pave the way for artists like Lambert and Smith by living authentically.",
            "“It’d be interesting to do a gay family musical tree,” he said with a laugh. “[But] it’s like when pop stars or musicians have children. Their children don’t give a damn who their parents are.”",
            "Looking ahead, Bell is eager to return to the road as soon it’s safe to do so, but he’s confident Erasure fans will find creative ways to enjoy “The Neon” until then.",
            "“My sister says she’s been in her garden with her kids, and she’ll tell [the Amazon app] Alexa, ‘Play some Erasure,’ and they’ll be dancing in the garden,” he said. “So maybe they can do something like that.”",

            "LOS ANGELES — Hundreds of believers of the dangerous conspiracy theory QAnon rallied in Hollywood on Saturday, just days after President Donald Trump praised the cult-like group.",
            "The demonstration, purported to be about bringing awareness to child sex trafficking, was largely an opportunity for supporters of QAnon to spread various unfounded conspiracy theories; the group has co-opted anti-trafficking messaging to draw more people into its conspiratorial web. Most demonstrators did not wear masks as they marched through Los Angeles, where thousands of people have died from COVID-19.",
            "QAnon believers follow the postings of “Q,” an anonymous individual who claims to be a high-ranking official working with Trump to take down a supposed cabal of Satanic-worshipping pedophiles who have breached the highest levels of government, media and entertainment. Though that appears to be the primary belief of QAnon supporters, followers often fold in a wide array of other baseless conspiracy theories. No matter how wild or absurd the theory, QAnon embraces it all.",
            "More than 200 Facebook and Instagram events called for demonstrators to spread awareness about child sex trafficking across the U.S. on Saturday, as NBC News first reported. Though this appears to be a worthy cause, something more sinister is at play.",
            "“This is not about pedophilia,” Whitney Phillips, an assistant professor of communication and rhetorical studies at Syracuse University, told NBC News. “This is not about child protection. This is about a conspiracy theory that’s trying to couch itself in other terms to get more people involved and sympathetic.”",
            "In Hollywood, people chanted “Defund Hollywood” and “Defund Pedowood,” and carried signs demanding an end to child sex trafficking. But in conversations with HuffPost, demonstrators quickly drew connections between trafficking and the conspiracy network of QAnon.",
            "Parents brought their children along for the ride, including 15-year-old Isis, who told HuffPost that the “government keeps secrets from us.”",
            "“They try to keep us under a rock,” she said. When asked where she gets her information, Isis said it comes from seeing politicians on TV “making weird moves on children.”",
            "Despite numerous signs referencing conspiracy theories unrelated to child sex trafficking, 47-year-old Kristen Cummins said the rally was first and foremost about bringing awareness to the problem of child sexual exploitation. She’s also a believer in QAnon, a movement she says is about the “restoration of America.”",
            "“I love the hope and the perspective it offers,” Cummins said. “I love that it’s not this negative, beat-down approach to try to force agendas. Q is very much inviting, inclusive.”",
            "Protestors gathered next to an In-N-Out Burger on Sunset Boulevard, where they held a 20-second moment of silence followed by a rendition of “Amazing Grace.”",
            "Angelita, 33, who declined to give her last name, said she started following QAnon because of her distrust of media.",
            "“I started doing research into what was really going on because what I was seeing on the news was not matching what I was seeing in the world around me,” she told HuffPost, while wearing a QAnon shirt and holding a sign that read, “THE REAL PANDEMIC IS CHILD TRAFFICKING.”",
            "“It’s more about a mindset,” she added. “I want to be a critical thinker, I want to be a truth-seeker, instead of just believing an article and what the narrative is in the article.”",
            "Multiple protesters who declined to be interviewed by HuffPost later took part in a chant of, “Where is the media?”",
            "What may have once been a laughable conspiracy movement has now led to dangerous real-world consequences. In 2018, a man took his AR-15 and an armored car to the Hoover Dam to demand the government come clean about supposed crimes related to QAnon beliefs. In 2019, a QAnon-obsessed man was arrested in the killing of a high-profile mob boss. A Colorado woman was arrested earlier this year after allegedly attempting to kidnap her son with the help of QAnon followers. In April, the New York Police Department arrested a woman connected to the QAnon movement who was carrying 18 knives and allegedly threatened political figures.",
            "Just last week, a Texas woman was arrested after she allegedly used her car to attack strangers she believed were pedophiles. As Right Wing Watch reported, the woman was a believer of QAnon. The FBI has now designated QAnon a domestic terror threat.",
            "What’s more, the deadly movement has now infiltrated politics at some of the highest levels. In Oregon, the Republican Senate nominee, Jo Rae Perkins, is a staunch supporter of QAnon and even fought against her own campaign to promote the conspiracy network. In an interview with CNN published Saturday, she continued to praise QAnon while falsely claiming that masks don’t protect against COVID-19 and that the more than 170,000 American deaths from the disease had been “doctored” in an effort to hurt Trump.",
            "Earlier this month, racist QAnon follower Marjorie Taylor Greene won a runoff election in Georgia’s 14th Congressional District and will be on the ballot there in November.",
            "Following her win, Trump praised Greene in a tweet, calling her a “rising Republican star.” When asked why he was celebrating a conspiracy theorist, Trump sidestepped the question.",
            "“Well, she did very well in the election,” Trump said. “She won by a lot, she was very popular, she comes from a great state and she had a tremendous victory.”\n\nDays later, when asked by a reporter if he supports QAnon, Trump outright embraced the group.\n\n“I don’t know much about the movement, other than I understand they like me very much, which I appreciate,” Trump said on Wednesday. “I have heard that it is gaining in popularity. … I’ve heard these are people that love our country.”"

            "Brian Kolfage had a problem. It was late 2018, and the triple-amputee and Air Force veteran had just started a GoFundMe page where devotees of President Donald Trump could donate money to help build a wall on the southern border, helping fulfill a long-running Trump campaign promise. The effort, called We Build the Wall, was a smashing success: It racked up $20 million in donations in its first week. But GoFundMe suspended the campaign soon after its launch, until Kolfage could prove the money was going to a legitimate nonprofit.",
            "In stepped Steve Bannon, fresh off a seven-month stint in Trump’s White House and a key role in the president’s 2016 campaign. He provided We Build the Wall with the much-needed nonprofit organization and so much more: strategic guidance, plugs in conservative media and the stamp of approval from someone in Trumpworld. He also enlisted several prominent far-right figures for a 2019 Arizona event to promote the scheme.",
            "Bannon helped launch an endeavor Donald Trump Jr. called “private enterprise at its finest.” That story ended Thursday with a wide-ranging federal indictment charging Bannon, Kolfage and two alleged co-conspirators with defrauding donors to We Build the Wall.",
            "The indictment alleges that some donors contacted Kolfage and said that, although they did not have a lot of money, “they were giving what they could because they trusted” the group to use it on a border wall. Instead, Bannon and his co-conspirators used the money to subsidize a lavish lifestyle of speedboats, cars, cosmetic surgery and travel, according to federal prosecutors. HuffPost interviewed some of the donors on Thursday who now feel “taken.”",
            "The alleged scheme amounts to a coordinated fleecing of some of President Trump’s most loyal supporters, and the ties to the White House go much further than Bannon. Acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf appears to have been in contact with We Build the Wall organizers and even visited the project site less than a year ago, as federal investigators were closing in. A powerful GOP “super lawyer” acted as the nonprofit front group’s legal counsel. A HuffPost analysis of social media and the public record shows repeated contacts between Kolfage and both of Trump’s adult sons, including during an event at Mar-a-Lago, a Trump-owned resort in Florida. And in some instances, the president himself appears to have brushed up against the scheme.",
            "There are questions, in fact, as to whether Attorney General William Barr’s sudden and confusing attempt to help remove U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman, who oversaw the Manhattan office that just produced this indictment, earlier this summer was a failed effort to keep the public from learning of a damning accusation: that several people in Trump’s orbit were running a huge scam on his voters.",
            "“I Feel Taken”",
            "The indictment from the Southern District of New York charges Bannon, Kolfage, Florida venture capitalist Andrew Badolato and Timothy Shea of Colorado with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering.",
            "At the time Kolfage launched the GoFundMe campaign, Congress was locked in a fight over government funds for the border wall, which Trump had famously pledged Mexico would pay for. Kolfage, already known for earning an income off online far-right content, told HuffPost at the time that he had no plan for what to do with the money.",
            "Bannon and Badolato offered a lifeline, a nonprofit 501(c)(4) that Bannon controlled to satisfy GoFundMe’s demands for clarity. They also changed the mission of Kolfage’s campaign to one that would “privately” build the wall instead of just giving the funds to the government.",
            "To further convince GoFundMe they weren’t running a scam, the group told both the platform and the donors that 100% of their contributions would go to the project and that Kolfage would earn no salary or compensation.",
            "“Everyone who donates right now, your money goes toward this wall — 100% of your money goes toward this wall,” Kolfage insisted in a video advertisement on Facebook. “It’s not going to line someone’s pocket. I’m taking zero dollars as a salary. No compensation. It’s going toward the wall.”",
            "Privately, Kolfage struck a deal with Bannon and Badolato to earn $100,000 from the wall funds immediately and $20,000 per month after that, according to the indictment. “[A]s far as [the public] know[s] no one is getting paid... [s]alaries will never be disclosed,” Kolfage told Badolato in a text exchange. And in April, according to prosecutors, Kolfage and Shea, who had an earlier wall-funding scheme, set up a shell company to pay themselves tens of thousands of dollars more from the GoFundMe campaign by claiming to provide services to We Build the Wall. Badolato and Bannon also used hundreds of thousands of dollars raised for the wall for their personal expenses, the indictment contends.",
            "As news of the fraud charges broke on Thursday, donors grappled with the realization that they may have been conned.",
            "“I feel taken,” said 56-year-old Barbara Copeland, a Trump supporter in South Carolina who said she donated $100 to We Build the Wall last year. “I too fell for [Kolfage’s claims that he was] never going to use a dime of it for personal use.”",
            "Copeland had spent months aggressively promoting the fundraiser on social media and said she had repeatedly encouraged her friends and family members to donate.",
            "“I do not donate just willy-nilly, I checked it out — or so I thought,” she added, noting that in retrospect the “lavish lifestyle” Kolfage flaunted on his Instagram account could have been a warning sign. “To say that I’m upset is a gross understatement.”",
            "The scheme even ripped off children. One of the biggest donors to We Build the Wall was a 7-year-old in Texas who set up a hot chocolate stand so he could collect donations for the effort. Benton Stevens watched Trump’s 2019 State of the Union address and decided to help with the border wall effort — though his parents, active Republicans, told local media in 2019 that their dinner table conversations “may have rubbed off” on him.",
            "Already having offered tours of his fossil collection for $2, Benton thought the hot chocolate sales would be a good way to help the We Build the Wall effort. So he did, and the money poured in — along with insults. People online called the second-grader a “little Hitler.” (His father told local television in Texas at the time that “If he’s going to do it, he needs to learn that there’s going to be a little backlash.”)",
            "Bannon featured Stevens and his parents at a July 26, 2019, fundraiser, announcing that he had raised $25,000 for the effort. “Thank you to the We Build the Wall crew,” said Benton’s father, Shane Stevens. “I love what they’re doing here today.”",
            "Stevens did not respond to requests for comment on the revelation that the campaign was a scam.",
            "Trumpworld Connections",
            "Trump claimed on Thursday that he doesn’t “know anything about the [We Build the Wall] project at all,” and his press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, said that he “does not know the people involved with this project.” But last August, Amanda Shea — Timothy Shea’s wife and a member of We Build the Wall’s leadership team — said on Twitter that she had met with the president and discussed the project in detail.",
            "“Had the pleasure of meeting with @realDonaldTrump personally last week in the Hamptons, answered very specific questions about the wall @WeBuildTheWall built,” she tweeted. “[Trump] said I really know my stuff & our group needs to bid the whole wall project.”",
            "Trump Jr. and his girlfriend, Kimberly Guilfoyle, an adviser for the Trump reelection campaign, were prominently featured on the We Build the Wall website with quotes praising the project. They also were key speakers at a fundraising event.",
            "“This is private enterprise at its finest,” Trump Jr. said of We Build the Wall. “What you guys are doing is pretty amazing. Started from a grassroots effort and it’s just doing some wonderful things for an important issue.”",
            "The Trump Organization downplayed Trump Jr.’s connection to the group. Spokesperson Amanda Miller told The New York Times: “Don gave one speech at a single We Build the Wall event over a year ago with a group of angel moms and besides that, has no involvement with their organization.” He was unaware of his quote praising the group being used on its website, and that praise “was based on what he was led to believe” about its mission, Miller said.",
            "″[I]f he and others were deceived, the group deserves to be held accountable for their actions,” Miller said.",
            "But that’s not true, HuffPost found. As part of a fundraising promotion, We Build the Wall offered free, autographed copies of Trump Jr.’s book, “Triggered,” to people donating at least $75. And Instagram posts from Kolfage and We Build the Wall suggest Trump Jr. directly interacted with the group again in November.\n\n“[We Build the Wall representative] FOREMAN MIKE will be in Florida TOMORROW with Donald Trump Jr. at Sandestin Golf and Beach Resort!” the organization announced in a post on Nov. 7. The next day, Kolfage posted a photo of himself with a small group of people including Trump Jr. and “Foreman Mike.” Kolfage shared the same image to his website, captioning it, “Brian Kolfage and Donald Trump Jr. During a Recent Visit to the Border Wall.”",
            "Trump ally Kris Kobach, an immigration hard-liner and former Kansas secretary of state who led Trump’s failed investigation of alleged voter fraud, also served on We Build the Wall’s advisory board. Kobach said the plan had Trump’s personal approval.",
            "Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf visited the group’s building site just months ago, Yahoo News revealed. And in a photo of Kolfage and his wife with Trump’s second son, Eric Trump, at Mar-A-Lago in 2019, We Build the Wall claimed that Kolfage was “given American Patriot Award for his efforts in privately building the border wall.”",
            "All of these ties helped We Build the Wall promote itself as closely aligned with Trump. Along with the praise from Trump Jr. and Guilfoyle on the organization’s site, it highlights comments from Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas), a Trump booster infamous for anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim statements; Corey Lewandowski, one of Trump’s 2016 campaign managers; and Brandon Judd, president of the National Border Patrol Council, the union that represents Border Patrol officers.",
            "Wolf, the acting DHS secretary, also lent some legitimacy to the project by meeting with some of its board members in Washington, Yahoo News reported in November. DHS did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment on Wolf’s interactions with the group or the federal indictment.",
            "Rising GOP stars have been in touch with We Build the Wall recently, too. Madison Cawthorn, the Republican nominee for North Carolina’s 11th Congressional District who recently got into hot water for an Instagrammed trip to Hitler’s vacation house in Germany, appeared in a late July Instagram post from Kolfage that said: “Pumped to see @madisoncawthorn make it out to the ‘people’s wall’ he’s one of my favorite patriots, he bleeds red, white and blue.”",
            "And the nonprofit Bannon used to funnel We Build the Wall Funds also has deep ties to the larger Republican infrastructure. The indictment alleges that Bannon received more than $1 million from We Build the Wall to something referred to only as “Non-Profit-1” but which is described as a 501(c)(4) group focused on “promoting American nationalism and economic sovereignty.” That closely matches the description of Citizens of the American Republic, a Bannon-run 501(c)(4) that “seeks to advance the ideals of Economic Nationalism and American Sovereignty,” according to the group’s website. Later in the indictment, prosecutors ask for the forfeiture of “any and all funds” held in a Wells Fargo bank account belonging to Citizens of the American Republic.",
            "COAR was the main vehicle Bannon used in his quixotic 2018 quest to keep the House of Representatives in Republican control and protect Trump from impeachment. Bannon claimed at the time that the group would spend $3 million on digital ads to get out the vote for that year’s midterm elections. He traveled across the country to promote various Republican candidates and also plug his film “Trump@War.”",
            "The group’s tax returns for 2018, during a run of high publicity for the group, list slightly less than $4.5 million in contributions and grants. The 2019 tax returns are not yet public, but even if COAR matched that fundraising total that year, the $1 million it got from We Build the Wall would have constituted a sizable share of COAR’s income.",
            "Groups designated as 501(c)(4)s, often referred to as dark money, are not required to disclose their donors or very much else about their funding sources. Bannon wanted to keep it that way. In mid-2019, CNBC reported that Bannon hired a GOP “super lawyer” named Cleta Mitchell as COAR’s legal counsel. At the time, CNBC noted Bannon was trying to “protect the identity of his contributors and works to stay in the good graces of President Donald Trump.”",
            "Mitchell is a partner at the high-powered law firm Foley & Lardner and has served as a chair of the American Conservative Union Foundation and as president of the Republican National Lawyers Association. In 2018, she drew the attention of Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee for her work on behalf of the National Rifle Association in 2016, and they included her in a list of witnesses they hoped to interview about Russian interference in the last presidential election because they believed she “may be able to clarify for the Committee any Russian-related approaches to and interaction with the organization [NRA] and persons of interest to the Committee during the 2016 election.” She was never interviewed.",
            "The indictment says that in October 2019, Bannon and his co-defendants “learned that We Build The Wall might be under federal criminal investigation” and began taking aggressive actions to conceal their alleged fraud. Mitchell declined to elaborate to HuffPost if Bannon shared those concerns with her, as legal counsel of the group that received $1 million from We Build the Wall, according to the indictment. “I cannot discuss anything with you about my work for COAR.” It is not clear if she is still working for the group.",
            "But she has remained active in Republican politics. Just this week, when Trump posthumously pardoned Susan B. Anthony at a White House event, Mitchell was photographed beaming directly over his right shoulder.",
            "Mitchell told HuffPost she has not discussed her work for COAR “with anyone else, including but not limited to the President. Any suggestion by you to the contrary would be false.”",
            "Help From The Far Right",
            "In “Wall-A-Thon” videos shot in front of mounds of dirt and rocks with construction workers moving in the background, Bannon came off like a downmarket Jerry Lewis, beseeching viewers to send in money while a ticker at the bottom of the screen scrolled through donor names and dollar amounts.",
            "In July 2019, to supercharge contributions, the organization held a three-day “symposium” on private land in New Mexico near the border. Bannon and his team assembled a motley collection of far-right propagandists, white nationalists and social media “influencers” to promote the project. Many of these extremists had been instrumental in spreading agitprop and disinformation in 2016 to help Trump get elected. It was an easy network for Bannon to tap into.",
            "One panel was headlined by Mike Cernovich, an alt-right grifter who spearheaded the Pizzagate disinformation campaign. Cernovich used his time to smear the mainstream media as “fake news.” When asked for his thoughts on the QAnon disinformation campaign, which the FBI considers a potential national security threat, said, “I’m happy that people believe in something.”",
            "Other speakers at the event included Michelle Malkin, who now collaborates openly with white nationalists, who ranted about communists and anarchists and warned that the resettlement of Muslim refugees could destroy America; Candace Owens, whom Republicans in Congress frequently use to whitewash the threat of far-right extremism, downplayed police brutality; and Darren Beattie, a former Trump speechwriter who lost his job after being linked to prominent white nationalists, raised the “deep state” specter as he attacked the Mueller report and branded Russian interference in the 2016 election a “hoax.”",
            "“I could go on and on but I conclude this portion by simply saying an obvious and lamentable fact that every single institution in the United States is either actively malicious against the American people or a scam,” Beattie said.",
            "NumbersUSA, an anti-immigration organization associated with white nationalist John Tanton, co-sponsored the event. So did Citizens United, the conservative Super PAC that opened the floodgates for unlimited corporate political spending. Another sponsor was a super PAC called Black Americans for a Better Future, which has historically been funded entirely by rich white men, with the vast majority of the money coming from billionaire Robert Mercer.",
            "One America News Network (OAN), a favored propaganda outlet of the Trump administration, covered the symposium and had promoted Kolfage’s GoFundMe as early as Jan. 7, 2019, about a month after it began, giving him an early platform from which to lure in donors. One of OAN’s correspondents, Jack Posobiec ― a neo-Nazi sympathizer and Roger Stone protege who has spread disinformation along with Cernovich ― appears frequently on Bannon’s “War Room” podcast. Posobiec went on a “We Build the Wall Anniversary Special” episode of the podcast this June that featured Kolfage and Kobach, as well as Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk, an influential associate of the Trump family.",
            "On Thursday, the OAN website has a tag for “we build the wall,” but it doesn’t link to any actual content. GoFundMe suspended the campaign in October 2019.",
            "A Possible Cover-up?",
            "The U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan is known for its independence from “Main Justice” in the nation’s capital, often jokingly referred to as the “Sovereign District of New York.” In the Trump administration, the Southern District of New York caused a number of political problems for the president by charging several of his associates with crimes. SDNY even named Trump as “Individual 1” in its case against former Trump personal attorney Michael Cohen, which implicated the president in a scheme to pay to silence a porn star and a former Playboy Playmate ahead of the 2016 presidential election.",
            "In June, Trump wanted to remove SDNY’s top prosecutor, U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman. Barr wanted Berman to go quietly, even issuing a highly misleading statement, without Berman’s approval, that claimed Berman would be “stepping down.” Berman refused to resign, and Trump soon fired him.",
            "But Berman’s move paid off. Regular order in the line of succession was maintained, and Berman’s deputy, Audrey Strauss, was named to take over the office instead of an acting U.S. attorney handpicked by Trump or Barr. Berman said that Strauss would “safeguard the Southern District’s enduring tradition of integrity and independence,” expressing faith that the ongoing criminal investigations he’d wanted to see through would move forward without political interference under her leadership.",
            "It’s not entirely clear if Trump was concerned about a criminal case that would accuse his former top strategist of bilking his supporters out of cash for a cause connected to one of the chief issues of his 2016 campaign. But the president’s record of interfering in ongoing criminal investigations on behalf of his associates, as laid out in Robert Mueller’s special counsel investigation, raises questions about whether the Bannon case is linked to the ouster of Berman.",
            "Everything Unravels",
            "Kolfage, as The Wall Street Journal reported, recently started another fundraising scheme, purportedly to file a class-action lawsuit against a hashtag, #blacklivesmatter. Kolfage proclaimed that the Black Lives Matter movement is “a full blown racist terror group” which had been “fueled by the NBA, NFL, MLB, and the NHL.”",
            "The Black Lives Matter movement, of course, is largely decentralized and began long before professional sports teams lent their support, particularly since the police killing of George Floyd on May 25 in Minneapolis. The GoFundMe page, which has since been taken down, pointed to a website that claimed Black Lives Matter “is a full political scam” that funnels money to Democrats. (In fact, donations to the Black Lives Matter Global Network are routed through the online donation platform ActBlue, which is known to be associated with Democratic causes, but donations to the Black Lives Matter Global Network can’t go to political campaigns because of the tax status of its sponsoring organization.)",
            "It is unclear how, precisely, Kolfage would sue a decentralized political movement or a hashtag. A federal judge previously ruled: “For reasons that should be obvious, a hashtag — which is an expression that categorizes or classifies a person’s thought — is not a ‘juridical person’ and therefore lacks the capacity to be sued.”",
            "In any event, we probably won’t find out. Kolfage was taken into custody Thursday morning, along with his co-defendants.",
            "Bannon pleaded not guilty. He is currently under federal investigation for another business venture with a Chinese tycoon, Guo Wengui, according to The Wall Street Journal. Earlier Thursday, federal agents arrested him while he was on Guo’s yacht off the coast of Connecticut.",

            "Postmaster General Louis DeJoy told a Senate committee that he was not sabotaging the U.S. Postal Service in order to disrupt the anticipated rise in mail-in voting during the coronavirus pandemic in November, but said he would not reverse any recent changes including the removal of mail sorting machines across the country.",
            "“I think the American public should be able to vote by mail and the Postal Service will support it,” DeJoy told the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee on Friday, later adding that he is “extremely, highly confident” that mailed ballots sent seven days before the election will arrive on time to be counted.",
            "President Donald Trump has attacked both the USPS and mail-in voting. He explicitly stated that he opposed increased funding for the post office to help it following a decline in income during the pandemic because it would help people vote-by-mail.",
            "“Now they need that money in order to make the post office work so it can take all of these millions and millions of ballots,” Trump said on Aug. 13. “But if they don’t get those two items, that means you can’t have universal mail-in voting.”",
            "“There has been no changes in any policies with regard to election mail with regard to the 2020 election,” DeJoy said, denying doing anything on purpose to disrupt mail-in voting.",
            "Since DeJoy entered office as postmaster general in July, the USPS has seen a dramatic increase in delivery delays and disruptions. Post offices around the country have been ordered to disable and dismantle 671 automatic mail sorting machines, limit overtime work and alter delivery schedules. Postal workers and Americans awaiting mail have reported huge delays, leading to late prescription drug deliveries to veterans and seniors and rotted meat and the death of baby chicks sent from and to farmers.",
            "The changes to the post office, the ensuing disruptions to mail delivery and Trump’s statements have caused many to look skeptically at DeJoy, as he is a major Republican Party donor with significant investments in USPS competitors and contractors. He continues to hold between $25 and $50 million in XPO Logistics, a logistics firm that contracts with the postal service to help during heavy mail delivery periods like Christmas and acts as a courier between package and fulfillment centers and post office locations. And at least one former Postal Service board of governors member has stated that he was not qualified for the position.",
            "He “didn’t strike me as a serious candidate,” David Williams, the former vice chairman of the Postal Service board, told a hearing held by the Congressional Progressive Caucus on Thursday.",
            "The American people, and their representatives in Congress, however, have “pretty good reasons” to be suspicious of DeJoy and his changes to the USPS, Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) admitted during the hearing, even if there is no nefarious intent on his part, as “the president has made repeated claims that mail-in voting will be fraudulent.”",
            "Both Democrats and Republicans questioning DeJoy endorsed mail-in voting ― which Trump opposes ― and made sure to get DeJoy to say he is not trying to impair it.",
            "Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wisc.), the committee chairman, however, disagreed with Romney, and committee Democrats, and claimed postal disruptions were simply part of a “false narrative designed to extract a political advantage” and complaints from the public “are highly scripted.” He added that DeJoy “should be commended” and “not condemned.”",
            "DeJoy claimed ignorance at the committee hearing on Friday, asserting that he learned about the removal of mail sorting machines and blue postal mailboxes when the public did. He denied ordering any reductions in overtime, despite reporting showing that he did just that.",
            "“The only change that I made was that the trucks leave on time,” he said.",
            "He further blamed much of the delays and disruptions on postal workers calling out of work in coronavirus hot spots. This excuse comes despite complaints about delays and disruptions only emerging in July after DeJoy took office and not during the March to June period when the pandemic was ongoing.",
            "DeJoy asserted that changes like the removal of mail sorting machines and mailboxes were caused by policies put in place before he arrived and that he stopped these changes due to “the excitement it was creating.” But he also said he had “no intention” to replace or return any mail equipment disabled in recent weeks.",
            "Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.) pressed DeJoy to disclose any data or analysis he used to make the changes that have led to increased disruptions, but he was unable to do so.",
            "And while DeJoy said he was halting policy changes at the USPS before the election, he said, “We’re considering dramatic changes” afterwards. Those changes will include major price increases and service reductions, among other things, according to a report by The Washington Post."

Several dozen of Krome’s nearly 440 detainees are Muslim.",
            "The pork meals violated the immigrants’ religious practices ― but the expired halal meals made them sick. Those who ate the expired meals consequently suffered from “stomach pain, vomiting, and diarrhea,” according to the letter.",
            "“ICE is choosing to act in a way that not only hurts the rights of these people to practice their faith, while in detention, which is legally protected but also hurts their health,” said Nimra Azmi, staff attorney at Muslim Advocates and one of the signatories on the letter. “It puts them in a place where they’re not able to eat food that can fully sustain them in the middle of a pandemic.”",
            "Prior to the coronavirus pandemic, Muslim detainees were able to choose their meals at a cafeteria. But the facility switched to prepackaged meals when it suspended large gatherings to limit the spread of the virus. When Muslim immigrants complained to ICE staff and Krome’s chaplain, they were repeatedly ignored, and the chaplain told them, “it is what it is,” Azmi told HuffPost.",
            "An ICE spokesperson told HuffPost that its “Performance-Based National Detention Standards cover all aspects of detention to include reasonable accommodation of religious dietary practices” and that claims stating otherwise were “false.”",
            "DHS did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment on the allegations.",
            "Despite making up only 1% of the U.S. population, Muslims make up about 9% of the total U.S. prison population. In some states, such as Maryland, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, that number is higher than 20%.",
            "This is is not the first time Muslim detainees were forced to eat pork at various American facilities. Out of the 163 Muslim prisoner-related federal lawsuits pertaining to religious freedoms filed by Muslim Advocates between October 2017 and January 2019, 64 complaints, or nearly 40%, were about dietary needs.",
            "Earlier this month, the Arizona Department of Corrections dropped its kosher menu used by both Jewish and Muslim inmates to meet their religious dietary needs. In June, Muslim inmates at a Virginia prison did not receive meals on time needed to fast during the holy month of Ramadan. In 2019, border patrol officers fed pork to a Muslim detainee in Texas. That same year, the Alaska Department of Corrections settled a lawsuit and agreed to serve Muslim inmates two hot meals a day during the month of Ramadan.",
            "The Florida case sparked outrage from advocates and politicians alike. Rep. Judy Chu (D-Calif.) called the incident “a disgusting outrage” and that “Donald Trump and Republicans claim they care about freedom of religion, but that has always been code for discrimination.” Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that Wednesday’s reports were “horrifying” and “not one-off incidents” and that “ICE is structured for dehumanization.”",
            "In the letter sent Wednesday to ICE, the groups demanded that the agencies immediately stop forcing Muslim detainees to choose between eating pork or expired halal meat and noted that it was a clear violation of federal law and First Amendment rights.",
            "“When [the Muslim detainees] tried to go through all the channels for the facility, they’re being dismissed, ignored, and dehumanized,” Azmi told HuffPost."

            "The four defendants are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. Each charge carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison.",

But the defendants “secretly schemed to pass hundreds of thousands of dollars to Kolfage, which he used to fund his lavish lifestyle,” she said.",

            "“Well, I feel very badly,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “I haven’t been dealing with him for a long period of time. ... He worked for a lot of companies. But he was involved likewise in our campaign and for a small part of the administration very early on. I haven’t been dealing with him at all.”",

Countries like Italy that have largely contained their outbreaks after an initial period of crisis are returning to a semblance of normalcy, while America is lagging woefully behind.",

            "I still think that most people do get it. But watching other parts of the country, in particular, suffer such terrible losses precisely because of willfully ignorant behavior — frankly, it is just too much for me to bear, and I am angry writing about it. If everyone would just follow the rules aggressively, then this problem would come under so much better control, lives would be safe, our economy would have a fighting chance.",
            "Some people just do not seem to care. COVID-19 is not the enemy; it’s just a stupid viral particle. Our ignorance and selfish behavior, that is the enemy. I am so embarrassed for us as a nation. I know we can do better, but many days, watching the case numbers and body counts rise, I do lose faith in us. And, for an optimist like me, that is #SAD.” — Paul S. Pottinger, professor of infectious diseases at the University of Washington School of Medicine",

These attacks emanate from the president and trickle down to the average person and reveal a deep-seated evasion of the role of the mind, logic and evidence in solving complex problems. It is the minds of experts that will get us through this pandemic, and to attack them, not for any fault but for their virtue, is nihilistic.” — Amesh A. Adalja, senior scholar at Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security",

Listen to the public health experts, practice social distancing, wear your face mask or face shield correctly, wash your hands on a regular basis and after being out in public.",
            "Be open and receptive to valid, evidence-based research from public health experts. There is a lot of research being done in the U.S. and abroad to understand the virus, its impacts on humans — including risk factors, length and severity of infection, the role of asymptomatic patients — and our immune response to infection. Don’t be complacent, speak up when you see someone taking unnecessary risks.” ― Erin Sorrell, assistant research professor in Georgetown University’s department of microbiology and immunology",

Instead, the politicians fuel the epidemic by prioritizing their political ambitions and misguided personal beliefs.",
            "Even more frustrating is that a large proportion of Americans support these politicians. They claim to practice personal freedom and do whatever they like, not understanding the real meaning of personal freedom. True American personal freedom is based on one important consideration — one is free to do whatever one likes as long as no one else gets hurt.",

It is not surprising that the two countries with the worst COVID-19 epidemic are the U.S and Brazil —two countries with leaders who share one thing in common — their personal ambition at the sacrifice of the health of their people.” ― Lee W.

Despite their proven efficacy, vaccine hesitancy for routine childhood immunizations is already an issue in the U.S. Annual vaccinations for influenza hover around 60%.",

Gaps in vaccination coverage of these preventable illnesses could result in additional infectious disease outbreaks layered on top of this existing pandemic.” — Amanda Castel, professor of epidemiology at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health.",
            "There are huge delays in turnaround for test results.",
            "“The inability to rapidly scale-up testing has crippled our ability to respond to the pandemic in a timely fashion. Testing is fundamental to our ability to rapidly identify persons infected with COVID-19, allow them to self-isolate and halt the spread of the virus.",
            "With week-long delays between testing and receiving results, individuals often are not effectively quarantined while awaiting their test results, leading to increased viral transmission. We need to have rapid tests that are highly sensitive, easily accessible and administered, and provide results in minutes ― not weeks. Without this diagnostic capability, we will continue to see uncontrolled community spread of the virus.” ― Castel",
            "People are not taking care of their health in other ways.",

            "This summer, as Black Lives Matter protesters dodged rubber bullets fired by police and Black and brown communities were hit hard by COVID-19, book clubs sprang into being, and into action.",
            "Shoshanna Hecht, an executive and personal coach from New York City, had just joined a book club themed around racial justice in March; she also signed up for a Zoom study group that would complete Layla F. Saad’s “Me and White Supremacy” workbook together. Joanna Mang, an adjunct English instructor in North County San Diego, was invited to join a new book club, called the Equity Re-Education Discussion Group, by a friend from her Stroller Strides group.",
            "Ja’Rod Morris, founder of the Atlanta-based book club Black Men Read, didn’t have to form a new group. “The truth is, we have been having these conversations about police brutality,” he told HuffPost. Though the club was designed for literary discussion rather than activism, any space where Black people gather, he said, is a good space for political mobilization. “We’re on the front lines. We are the subject of this.” As the protests broke out, he called a “state of emergency” meeting to discuss how members could get involved.",
            "Many white Americans, however, have not been having these conversations. The protests following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis seem to have changed that.",
            "“I have been very, very surprised by the apparently sudden outpouring on the parts of what appears to be millions of people, many of them white, who realize, wow, we have a lot of work to do, we have a lot we need to learn in order to do that work,” said Dr. Crystal Marie Fleming, author of “How to Be Less Stupid About Race: On Racism, White Supremacy, and the Racial Divide.”",
            "Since late May, it seems like every well-meaning, left-leaning white person in America has been trying to get their hands on a copy of “White Fragility” by Robin DiAngelo. Or “How to Be an Antiracist” by Ibram X. Kendi. Or “So You Want to Talk About Race” by Ijeoma Oluo. Or, hey, maybe all of them. Anti-racist manuals have been cleaned out from virtual bookstore shelves and pushed to the top of bestseller lists.",
            "And often, these buyers don’t want to read alone. Enter the anti-racist book club.",
            "Anti-racist book clubs hold great allure, and potentially great power, at a moment when many, particularly white people, are becoming conscious of their own educational blind spots around Black history and racial justice. Book clubs sit at a slippery nexus between education and relaxation, radicalization and affirmation; there’s a vibrant history of reading groups expanding people’s political consciousness and moving them to action, but also a deeply entrenched tradition of book clubs for white women as social spaces. This tension likely makes them an appealing starting point for people who want to dip their toes into the struggle for perhaps the first time, in a setting that they’re familiar with. The real test, of course, will be what comes next, once the book club attendees have gotten their feet wet with some radical reading.",
            "The problem of white supremacy, said Dr. Fleming, a professor of sociology at Stonybrook University, “is not something that an anti-racist reading group will fix. It’s something an anti-racist reading group can help facilitate.” To make change, people will need to leave the warm uteri of their reading circles and put their knowledge into bold, concrete action.",
            "“We have definitely seen a surge of interest in group reading for our anti-racist titles,” Sanj Kharbanda, sales and marketing director at Beacon Press, told HuffPost. Beacon publishes numerous anti-racism books, including “White Fragility” and Fleming’s “How to Be Less Stupid About Race.” He noted that this interest came from “traditional book groups” as well as clubs newly formed to discuss race. Churches, universities and bookstores have launched anti-racist book clubs (often virtual, in deference to social distancing measures); friends are organizing reading groups among their social circles.",
            "Though it’s impossible to know exactly who is joining these groups, or even how widespread they are, it seems likely that those turning to literary discussion are disproportionately people who already participate in book clubs: mostly women, mostly well-educated, and mostly in their 30s or older. What could be more natural for a white woman who already belongs to a book club with her friends to ask that “How to Be an Antiracist” be the focus of next month’s meeting, or to start a spinoff group?",
            "“A lot of people, a lot of college-educated women, seem to be attacking this problem from the books angle. What if I amass a lot of books — this has to be a way in,” Mang said. “They’re realizing that, now is a time that I need to be reading.”",
            "But reading what? Despite the proliferation of reading lists, even picking the right book to read leaves some feeling paralyzed. More than one person HuffPost spoke to mentioned “White Fragility,” and the competing recommendations to read it (because it introduces white people to methods for decentering themselves during conversations about racism) and to not read it (because, among other concerns, it perpetuates the centering of whiteness and white feelings itself).",
            "Mang, who has taught racial justice texts as a college instructor, had some pedagogical quibbles with “White Fragility”; she considers it dry, corporate jargon that does little to convey the urgent moral clarity of the issues to readers. Nevertheless, her club ended up reading it for their first meeting, and she was struck by the resulting discussion. “While I think ‘White Fragility’ is a silly book,” Mang said, “I think it could be a gateway.” Her group, populated with affluent, mostly white women, felt ready to get more radical in their reading afterward.",
            "Kate Dearing, a TV writer based in Los Angeles, said that her club eased into things as well, reading “Stamped,” the young readers adaptation of Ibram X. Kendi’s “Stamped From the Beginning” by Kendi and Jason Reynolds. Her clubmate, Sami Kriegstein Jacobson, a creative consultant in New York, said there was an unexpected upside to the choice.",
            "“After reading this book, I felt so frustrated at my own middle school and high school education,” said Kriegstein Jacobson, who attended a prestigious East Coast boarding school. “There was so much that was new to me in what was this actually very simple book that was meant for kids that age.”",
            "She was so frustrated that she responded to the school’s latest donation solicitation by writing back to ask them what they were doing to decolonize the curriculum and to hire and retain teachers of color. “It made me glad that my eyes are open and that I could do something about it. I don’t know if we had started with a more rigorous book if I would have made the connection of, we should have been taught this so much earlier in life.”",
            "For several years, the Bay Area chapter of Showing Up for Racial Justice (SURJ), a national organization which focuses on bringing white people into the struggle against white supremacy, has hosted study and action groups for allies looking to learn and get involved. Their ever-evolving, carefully designed curriculum goes a bit deeper than the most frequently recommended texts for beginners.",
            "“We lean more towards articles, videos, speeches, relatively short pieces that we can group together,” Lizzie Humphries, one of the organizers behind the study and action reading group program, told HuffPost.",
            "In shaping the curriculum, she and her fellow organizers were inspired by Black Panther study and struggle groups: spaces for learning and developing a shared political language that were inextricably connected to the on-the-ground work. Though the SURJ Bay Area groups do use “White Fragility” and other texts about how white people experience white supremacy, she said, “we really focus on pieces by authors of color.” Authors like James Baldwin and texts like the policy platform for the Movement for Black Lives, she said, “are really the central texts of the reading group.”",
            "This focus, Fleming said, is key. Though “white anti-racists have a very important role to play in promoting anti-racist change,” she told HuffPost, “If your antiracist reading group or your antiracist initiative is not centering the work of Black people, indigenous people, and people of color, then they’re not antiracist.”",
            "In choosing books to study, Carla Bruce-Eddings, a writer and senior publicist at Catapult/Counterpoint/Soft Skull Press, urged readers to “look to the work of queer Black women; they have been paving the way for radical thinking for generations.”",
            "While curating the right curriculum is valuable, it’s not a panacea. “There’s no anti-racism checklist. It’s not something that can be mastered by reading a couple of books and it’s not something that can be bought,” anti-racist author and educator Tiffany Jewell said. Though sometimes, unsettlingly, it seems as though many white people believe otherwise. In a rich landscape of social justice literature, the skyrocketing sales of certain titles suggest not merely an eagerness to learn, but perhaps an almost talismanic attitude toward the most-recommended hits.",
            "To see such a flurry of interest in anti-racist learning has been heartening for some. But for others, the timing and the type of action looks suspicious. As critic and academic Lauren Michele Jackson argued in a skeptical piece on the anti-racist reading list phenomenon in Vulture, the very word “anti-racist” “suggests something of a vanity project, where the goal is no longer to learn more about race, power, and capital, but to spring closer to the enlightened order of the anti-racist.”",
            "This impression has only grown as Black booksellers have reported that customers have been quick to berate them for not shipping backordered titles popularized by these reading lists quickly enough. When I reached out to one Black-owned bookstore for this piece, an autoreply email responded that there would be a “SIGNIFICANT DELAY” in response time and asked for patience, as they were overwhelmed filling orders for in-demand anti-racist titles.",
            "In July, Sruti Islam, events coordinator at Librairie Saint-Henri Books in Montreal, tweeted that after people had flooded the store with orders for anti-racist literature, they were failing to pick up their reserves; the tweet went viral. (After her tweet, she told HuffPost in an email, the store’s regulars “swiftly sent folks to pick up the remaining stock,” and the problem has not persisted.)",
            "Besides, amid historic nationwide uprisings demanding an end to police brutality against Black people, surely buying a book or two is a tepid reaction to the state-sanctioned violence on display. Buying a book isn’t revolutionary; it’s easy, even a bit indulgent. In one sense, it’s a consumerist response to a crisis that calls for something deeper: putting bodies on the line. As writer Kelsey McKinney argued in June, turning to book purchases and book clubs can be a way of staying self-centered, of channeling newly aroused anxiety about racism back into spending money on yourself, spending time thinking and talking about yourself, and adding a new social activity to the calendar.",
            "But there are practical reasons for many people to join a reading group as a way into, or a supplement to, anti-racist work. A deeper understanding of white supremacy and Black struggle can make newbies more adept at the nitty-gritty work, and forming bonds with like-minded people is a great basis for organizing. “I’m glad that white people are doing the work,” Bruce-Eddings told HuffPost. “They’re late, but I hope they’re reckoning with that too.”",
            "Islam told HuffPost that Librairie Saint-Henri Books held outdoor, socially distanced book club meetings specifically in response to the demand for anti-racist literature. “We were concerned that people would be buying the books, Instagramming the books, and never actually engaging with the books,” she explained. “We wanted to bring back the book club in order to hold ourselves and these readers accountable.”",
            "As white people grapple with the inadequacy of their good intentions and look into doing anti-racist work, many come to realize that one crucial form of it is countering racism within their own friend groups and families, as well as their own hearts and minds.",
            "“We need to take initiative within our circles,” Kriegstein Jacobson said. “It’s our job to make sure to not only hold ourselves accountable but our friends, our families, our schools, our places of work.”",
            "Being an effective advocate, however, requires a depth of knowledge that many are lacking. “A lot of people have more conservative family members and friends and they want to be able to talk to them,” said Mang of her book club. “Someone will say something, or write something on Facebook, and they’ll think, this feels wrong, but I don’t know what to say.”",
            "Dearing said that in the past she found herself often staying silent instead of speaking up about racism she encountered because “I felt I didn’t know enough, that I didn’t know where I fit or how this would be useful or enough context, so I got scared that I would be called out.” Forming the book club was a way of building her resolve and her arsenal so that she would be prepared to, as she quoted late Rep. John Lewis, “make good trouble.”",
            "A book club can provide a richer experience than just reading a book — a setting in which to practice having those tough conversations, other people to call you on your errors, and solidarity to strengthen your dedication. And, temptingly, it can mingle the tough intellectual work with social connection. This balance of joyful togetherness and political engagement can be valuable, said Bruce-Eddings, who has worked as books editor and helped plan festivals for the popular club Well-Read Black Girl.",
            "“I think both things can happen simultaneously, and in fact, I think it’s more impactful when they do,” she said. She recalled her first Well-Read Black Girl meeting, where serious conversation about how the women could take action to change their lives was intermingled with lighthearted gossip and laughter. “As a Black woman, I’ve grown up very accustomed to witnessing and partaking in moments like this: the joy is inextricable from the pain, but that makes it all the sweeter. Political work has to be grounded in our humanity, otherwise it’s simply hypothetical; meaningless.”",
            "As white people join anti-racist book clubs, the ideal approach may look a bit different. “A book club that is for Black women is going to have a completely different purpose than a book club for white people focused on their own [and small-group] learning/unlearning,” Jewell pointed out.",
            "And the cozy kaffeeklatsch vibe may be too cozy to keep a predominantly white club serious. Imagine a book club full of well-off white women, nursing glasses of Pinot and plates of banana bread, the prototypical American book club: It doesn’t seem like the prime setting for harsh callouts. “In our dominant white culture, conflict, disagreement, the feeling of discomfort, those are all really unusual things to happen in a book club,” Humphries said. “And I think there needs to be room for those things in this kind of book club.”",
            "Though Jewell said she hoped white anti-racist reading groups could stay on task and avoid becoming an unchallenging space for members, she expressed skepticism that this would be the case. “I’m not sure this is what is happening,” she said. “I have noticed how quickly the stamina of a lot of white people who seemed fully outraged in early June has waned.”",
            "Morris, the founder of Black Men Read, suggested that having Black people present was important to counter the drift into ease. “What I caution folks to do, if white people are going to be putting together book clubs to read books about Black stories: Don’t get caught in your bubble,” Morris said. He suggested inviting Black friends to offer their perspective, and not requiring them to complete the reading. “A white-only group, it just satisfies your comfort level.”",
            "There’s no one simple answer, however, to this problem. While inviting Black friends may prevent white people from lapsing into mutual reassurance, it also demands a great deal from those Black friends ― as does, as Rachel Charlene Lewis argued in Bitch, asking Black people for reading recommendations and tips for one’s book club. Bruce-Eddings noted that she was glad to see white people “place the onus of this education and radicalization on themselves, rather than reach out to the Black people in their lives for hand-holding and emotional excavation for the sake of their guilt.” She added, “I understand the intent, but it does more damage than they realize.”",
            "For Dearing and Kriegstein Jacobson, the latter concern was front of mind. “Kate and I have talked a lot about not wanting to put that educational burden on someone who is living this every day. It doesn’t feel right,” Kriegstein Jacobson said. “I wouldn’t want to bring a Black person or BIPOC [Black, Indigenous, or other people of color] person into this space this early on. Personally I feel like we are way too novice and clumsy. We’re like a toddler that’s running around the house and falling down and breaking shit.”",
            "In their group, they said, they’re trying to cultivate an ethos of resisting white fragility and calling each other out. “My hope for this was that we hold each other accountable in this group,” Dearing said. “I think there is that desire. I’m sure we will still, in our whiteness, miss things.”",
            "A firm structure can help maintain focus, and resources abound for groups who want to guard against attention drift. Humphries suggested that groups studying independently should find a curriculum to follow. Hecht’s “Me and White Supremacy” Zoom discussion group follows the text’s suggestion of using the Circle Way method (including assigning members to roles like “scribe” and “guardian”) to keep discussions on track. “There isn’t chitchat about our lives,” she said. “Some fragility has maybe come up, and it’s had to get dealt with, and it’s taken very seriously.”",
            "But no matter how well-intentioned or determined, “white people cannot hold each other accountable for ending white supremacy,” Fleming said. “This is something that requires a shift of power relation.” For white people looking for genuine growth and accountability around racial justice, she argued, it’s vital to seek out guidance and teaching from Black communities and communities of color. Seeking that guidance ethically may be a daunting task, but she suggested getting involved with or taking cues from existing groups for white people involved in antiracism, like SURJ, to learn how to appropriately approach and compensate speakers and educators who are Black and people of color.",
            "“SURJ develops these really deep and powerful relationships of accountability with organizations that are led by people of color. Our chapter has like 16 organizations that really set our agenda,” Humphries explained. “I think there is a pattern around which kind of study groups are really radical and transformative, that is connected to the way that those groups are happening in the setting of an organization or some kind of organized movement space.”",
            "Joining a local organization with ties like this, she said, can make sure readers are held accountable — not just for what they say during meetings, but for how they channel their study into action.",
            "The study and action program at SURJ Bay Area, as indicated by its name, is intentionally structured to integrate hands-on work into the conversation. Each meeting follows a “three-part framework for personal transformation that draws on your heart, your head and your hand,” Humphries said. In addition to exploring a deep spiritual and emotional response to the reading, and to intellectual discussion of what they’re learning, each meeting the members discuss future action they can take and check in on whether they followed through on past commitments.",
            "“I think what feels different about just starting a book club amongst friends, is it feels disconnected from the hand work that is already happening in a local area,” cautioned Humphries. “Especially because I do think that there is a cultural tendency amongst white people to stay up in our heads about things, to really only do the head piece of the work. It does help to be in the context of a movement to help move you toward a heart and a hand piece.”",
            "Those solitary study groups may provide some shared motivation to take action, however. “The woman who invited me to the group, she was like, I feel like we need to use our Karen power to do something,” Mang said. “We don’t know what it is. We know we have this power. And we know we need to use it.”",
            "At their best, anti-racist book clubs can push members to think of ways to help — and to actually show up — instead of turning into solipsistic self-help circles.",
            "“If you have time to read, you’re probably in a decent space in your life,” Morris said. “So what I’m trying to push the guys to do is for us to continue to do what we can with the power we have, the success that we’ve had in life, to leverage our positions to help bring other people up.”",
            "At Black Men Read’s emergency meeting, they discussed how members of different generations and backgrounds felt inspired to pitch in, and Morris took notes on the resources and ideas that came out of it to send to all the club’s members: a list of Georgia state representatives to contact, a Black gun organization for those who want to responsibly get a firearm. “Everyone has to move the needle in their own way,” he said.",
            "The white book clubbers buying up anti-racism manuals, meanwhile, are at least hearing the message that reading books does not count as doing the work.",
            "“What we are learning from everything we’re reading is that you can’t be anti-racist devoid of action. You just kind of can’t be,” said Kriegstein Jacobson. “If you want to call yourself an anti-racist, it must include action with impact. Intention counts for very little.”",
            "Their group has become a space to share organizations that need donations or initiatives that could use a set of hands — and having like-minded people to volunteer and protest with can make getting involved look less intimidating and more sustainable.",
            "“You’re connecting people who have never been politically active to people who have been politically active before,” said Mang, who had her own awakening after the 2016 election. The newcomers hear about their friends calling members of Congress, attending protests, and speaking up at city council meetings. “You influence them to do those things too. Things they want to do, but feel shy.”",
            "The book club itself, the people I spoke to emphasized, is not a wormhole into an antiracist future or a tool for easing one’s own guilt, nor is it a version of doing the work. Though there are pitfalls that are important to avoid in creating and running such a group, the most central is ensuring that the book club doesn’t become a cul de sac for activist urges.",
            "“Books are a great way to begin a journey,” Jewell said. “They should not be the end goal.”"

            "“I had created a VOTE necklace for the last election and knew I was going to do it again,” ByChari said in an email via a brand representative. “As we started our outreach, I was honored when Michelle Obama’s Stylist asked for one and am thrilled she is wearing it!”",

            "Obama didn’t let her necklace do all the inspiring, though. During her speech, in which she called Donald Trump the “wrong president for our country,” she encouraged voters to come out with the same enthusiasm as they did for her husband during his two presidential elections.",
            "“We have got to vote like we did in 2008 and 2012,” she said. “We’ve got to show up with the same level of passion and hope for Joe Biden. We’ve got to vote early, in person if we can. We’ve got to request our mail-in ballots right now, tonight, and send them back immediately and follow up to make sure they’re received. And then, make sure our friends and families do the same.”",

            "After four months of working for the small management consulting firm Red Associates in New York City, Funke Sangodeyi felt like something was “off.”",
            "Sangodeyi, who has a bachelor’s degree and a Ph.D. from Harvard and a master’s from Cambridge, was at a company retreat in the spring of 2015. There were workshops and team-building exercises typical of such gatherings. The setting was posh, the south of France, a couple of hours outside Nice, recalled Sangodeyi, who is Nigerian American and in her early 40s.",
            "Then at a party one night at a villa overlooking the lush countryside, a senior manager, a white man, approached her. “Oh my God, your skin is so dark,” Sangodeyi recalled him saying. “Does it come in shades darker than yours?”",
            "She was shocked. “You don’t say that,” she told him. “It’s a bizarre thing to say.”",
            "That was just the start of a disturbing few years for Sangodeyi at Red Associates, a management consulting firm based in Copenhagen and New York City that currently has 51 employees.",
            "Red is small compared to competitors like McKinsey, but not insignificant; its clients have included global giants such as Lego, Facebook, Google, Samsung and the Ford Motor Company. Red is also partly owned by Cognizant, a multibillion-dollar, publicly traded global tech consultancy.",
            "Like many consulting firms, Red markets itself as an elite group that offers brilliant insights. But a close look at the firm raises questions about what “elite” actually means.",
            "HuffPost spoke with 11 former employees and others close to the firm, a mix of white and nonwhite men and women. Nine requested anonymity, fearing reprisals from the firm. Together, they paint a picture of a company led by mostly white partners, some of whom appear to view themselves as superior to people of other races, nationalities and classes.",
            "Partners mocked the accents and appearance of Indian colleagues, characterized Black female employees as “angry” and “scary,” and used stereotypes about Chinese people while doing work for clients in that country. Class distinctions were particularly fraught: One former employee says she was mocked for the brand of tea she drank.",
            "“Comments like these are of course completely inappropriate and wrong,” the company said in a statement to HuffPost. “They do not reflect the culture of ReD where we value diversity of thought and experience.”",
            "These kinds of views seeped into the firm’s work, when one partner became obsessed with “The Bell Curve,” the widely discredited 1994 book that tries to link IQ and race, and pushed to research inherited intelligence for a prospective pitch to the Lego Foundation. (The research never made it to the company.)",
            "Rhetoric vs. Reality",
            "Red’s story is not unusual: Corporate America likes to broadcast its commitment to diversity, but isn’t exactly known as welcoming for people of color. A minuscule percentage of corporate leaders are Black. In a 2018 survey, 58% of workers of color said they’re always or often on guard against racist comments and behaviors. Outright racist comments, microaggressions and mistreatment are not uncommon, and little is done about it. The federal agency handling race discrimination complaints gets at least 100,000 each year, but most go nowhere.",
            "As nationwide protests over police brutality and systemic racism swept the country this summer, companies around the world doubled down on promises to diversify their offices. Red Associates was no different. The firm posted on LinkedIn, declaring “Black Lives Matter” and decrying systemic racism.",
            "Current and former employees were stunned at the hypocrisy. The post prompted Sangodeyi to reach out to HuffPost.",
            "Red told HuffPost that it cares “deeply about racial justice” and employs people with diverse backgrounds. “[W]e are continually striving to build an ever more diverse collective of thinkers, in particular through the addition of more Black voices,” the firm said.",
            "Most of the leaders listed on the firm’s website are white.",
            "In recent years, Red has hired people of color at the entry level, particularly as some clients and junior staff complained about the lack of diversity. But those new hires have mostly left, and many felt beaten down, isolated and repelled by the culture. At least 13 people of color, including all of the firm’s Black female employees, have either quit or say they were pushed out over the past two years.",
            "Some close to the firm wonder if it could ever truly diversify.",
            "“The people who ran the company had a very narrow understanding of what it means to be elite, valuable and successful, and that was always being a white man,” said Luke Johnson, 26, who worked as a consultant at the firm from 2017 to 2018.",
            "Eliot Brown, a partner at the firm who describes himself as “mixed black Trinidadian and British,” said he was surprised to hear that others weren’t comfortable at Red. He has worked there since 2008.",
            "“I believe that these people experienced what they claimed to experience, but it’s a long way away from what I and many other people of color I’ve known at Red have experienced,” he told HuffPost. “The whole thing is really upsetting to me because of that. I feel like a place that should at least be given a break for trying and possibly even celebrated for getting it right is being depicted as a place that intentionally got it so wrong. It feels unfair.”",
            "The firm’s current managing partner, Millie Arora, is not white, and she told HuffPost that she realizes the firm can do better at diversity.",
            "“As an Indian American woman, as managing partner, it is one of my key priorities. It’s something we continuously want to do better at,” she said. “Recent events have prompted a lot more introspection.”",
            "‘A Notorious Elitist’",
            "Former employees and others close to the firm said its culture is exemplified by co-founder Christian Madsbjerg, a Danish man who has lived in New York City for years. He teaches at the New School and has written for the Financial Times, The Wall Street Journal and Quartz.",
            "Johnson called Madsbjerg “a notorious elitist” who is very much against what he perceives as political correctness, an attitude that prevails at the firm.",
            "Johnson laid out why he was leaving Red in a 2018 email pointing to remarks Madsbjerg made that he believed were troubling.",
            "In the email reviewed by HuffPost, Johnson said he’d just heard Madsbjerg make “a seemingly off-hand, seemingly joking remark about how France and Germany are the only places ‘where there’s any civilization left.’”",
            "Madsbjerg made the remark to a female partner at the firm and a new hire, a woman of color, as well as to Johnson, he wrote.",
            "He said they laughed awkwardly. “Oh just ignore the crazy old Dane,” the “clearly uncomfortable” partner told the new consultant, according to Johnson’s email.",
            "“But Christian persisted,” he wrote, “insisting that it wasn’t just a joke―that he did indeed believe that there’s a small triangular region situated, of course, in Europe, where ‘the only real valuable cultural and historical progress has happened.’” As an “afterthought,” Madsbjerg said Japan is included in this group, Johnson wrote.",
            "He also wrote that he’d heard Madsbjerg say of Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, “Nobody would have complained about Weinstein if he were attractive.” (Weinstein was convicted of rape in 2020.)",
            "In the email, Johnson said comments like these were part of the reason he was leaving the company earlier than planned to go to graduate school. Those kinds of remarks made Red a “hostile place” for people who are not straight white men and could also turn off prospective clients, he wrote.",
            "In a long statement to HuffPost, Madsbjerg insisted he was passionate about diversity. “I never in my wildest dreams thought that one day I would have to ward off allegations of bigotry,” he said, emphasizing that his wife is Muslim and that he converted to Islam. He also said he moved to the U.S. from Denmark to escape bigotry.",
            "“I am perplexed and hurt by it,” he added. “It is just not who I am.”",
            "‘The Bell Curve’ Controversy",
            "In 2018, according to several former employees and others close to the firm, Madsbjerg became “obsessed” with “The Bell Curve,” a widely discredited 1994 book by Charles Murray about inherited intelligence that’s favored by those who subscribe to racial eugenics. Madsbjerg pushed for research into the work, according to Johnson and several other former employees.",
            "Madsbjerg assigned one of the firm’s entry-level consultants to write up a research proposal citing Murray’s work, former employees said. He was particularly interested in the notion that intelligence is inherited, the consultant wrote in notes titled “Quick overview of what Christian asked” that were shared with others at the firm at the time, and have since been obtained by HuffPost.",
            "In another document, the consultant prepared more detailed notes and research about what he said he and Madsbjerg discussed.",
            "“Task: write a 1 page memo to Lego Foundation convincing them to commit their time [and] money to promoting learning/development among the ‘stupid,’” state the notes, also obtained by HuffPost, in a section titled “Overview.”",
            "In a list titled “Find information/figures Christian mentioned regarding,” the consultant included “The Bell Curve,” “Racial correlation” and “Coverup/repression (why it isn’t popular in society today).”",
            "Deeper into the document, the consultant wrote: “Private note to Christian: we’re putting ourselves out on a limb here. It wouldn’t take much digging to find well-structured, empirically-reviewed studies that undermine the heritability of intelligence.” He then listed some citations.",
            "Such a proposal is typically a first step in putting together a client pitch, and the consultant ultimately wrote a draft memo titled “Acknowledging Hard Truths To Discover New Solutions.” The memo, addressed to the CEO of the Lego Foundation and obtained by HuffPost, argues researchers have for years ignored the “inconvenient truth” that intelligence is passed down genetically and social factors are less significant. It proposed that the Lego Foundation needed to acknowledge this in order to truly help children.",
            "Lego has long been a client of Red, but the Lego Foundation did not ask for the research, Red Associates told HuffPost in a statement. The Lego Foundation confirmed that it had never asked for this material nor seen the memo.",
            "The consultant’s source materials delved into race and intelligence, but the draft memo HuffPost saw doesn’t explicitly mention race. Still, it’s the unavoidable subtext whenever the subject of heritable intelligence comes up, said Kathryn Paige Harden, a behavioral geneticist and a professor of psychology at the University of Texas at Austin.",
            "“Anyone who talks about ‘The Bell Curve’ without addressing race, it feels like a dog whistle to me,” said Harden, who reviewed the draft memo for HuffPost.",
            "Younger staff members at Red and a number of people of color at the company, aware of the yearslong controversy surrounding Murray’s work, spoke out against the research. At the height of the controversy, one consultant threw a copy of “The Bell Curve” in the trash in front of his colleagues and poured ranch dressing over it, according to one former employee.",
            "Sangodeyi said she recalled a conversation with Madsbjerg at the time in which she told him that “debates around IQ are racially charged in the U.S. and that the whole thing was extremely dicey to venture into.”",
            "In a statement, Madsbjerg said that he had little to do with the research and that he’d never seen the memo until HuffPost asked about it.",
            "As for “The Bell Curve,” he said in the statement, “I didn’t even know what it was until it was brought to my attention as part of general research conducted by a new consultant at ReD about how job automation and job loss might be predicted.”",
            "“In Denmark, the debate about intelligence is not about race or ethnicity at all,” he said. “I find even the suggestion that there is any connection between race and intelligence repulsive, but also simply untrue.”",
            "Red also blamed the consultant who was tasked with writing the memo.",
            "“[T]his research was conducted by a staff person in an effort to understand the correlation between employment and IQ. After the research was complete and synthesized in a memo, it was dismissed as without merit,” the company said, emphasizing that the research was never shared outside the firm and that Red has never used it in any way.",
            "But former employees said Madsbjerg initiated the research.",
            "“I felt bad for the guy tasked with writing it,” said one former employee familiar with the project. “These were not his views at all. This was not a consultant gone rogue. Instructions came from higher up.”",
            "Madsbjerg is no longer running the firm day to day, but he sits on its board and brings in business from prominent clients. He told HuffPost he takes “full responsibility” for the firm’s culture.",
            "“From the beginning I wanted a global culture and I have tried to make sure that we transformed from a Danish to a global, generous culture the best we could,” he said. “This was important to me for business reasons, but also because it reflects my personal values.”",
            "Madsbjerg is set to teach a course at the New School this fall called Human Observation. “True observation is the ability to look and listen without the interference of assumptions and prejudices,” reads the course description found online. Only white authors are listed in the description.",
            "‘There’s Just Something Off’",
            "Although no one HuffPost spoke to alleges that Madsbjerg made overtly racist statements to employees, other partners and managers have been heard making comments about Black people, as well as about their counterparts within Cognizant. That company, which bought a 49% stake in Red in 2016, has a big presence in India.",
            "At a 2018 meeting, a top partner at Red described an Indian colleague at Cognizant as looking like Apu from “The Simpsons” and laughed to himself, according to contemporaneous notes a former employee shared with HuffPost.",
            "It wasn’t unusual for partners to mock Indian accents, several former employees said, or to look down on Cognizant employees more generally. “There was a dismissiveness to the value of Cognizant’s math and science [expertise],” Sangodeyi said.",
            "Partners at Red would say that they needed to teach their counterparts at Cognizant “how to think,” Johnson said.",
            "Brown was one of the people to put on an Indian accent. Some employees of color were offended by this, according to a former Red employee.",
            "Brown said he meant it in fun. “I do all sorts of accents at work and in life. I do posh English people, Danish people, Trinidadian family, my London family and yeah, I do Indian accents. I’m quite good at accents,” he said. “I would’ve hoped that people would’ve realized that I meant no malice by it. India is one of my favorite countries on the planet. I lived there for six months. I get on well with my Indian colleagues at Cognizant and celebrate them sincerely. I’d hope all that considered, people would realize I meant not to belittle by doing an accent.”",
            "Ethnic stereotyping wasn’t confined to Indian people. If a client was trying to understand the Chinese consumer, partners would at times fall back on certain “Orientalist cliches,” using words like “inscrutable” and characterizing Chinese people as mysterious, said one former employee.",
            "Another former employee, a 29-year-old woman with an Indigenous background, recalled bringing Twining tea to the office. She said one of her male colleagues told her it was “proletariat” tea, as though the brand wasn’t fancy enough.",
            "She said she never felt like she fit in at the firm.",
            "“I don’t want to call them all racists, that’s not true,” she said. “But they didn’t think of people of color as their equals or worthy enough to be accepted into the doors of Red.”",
            "Sangodeyi takes care to point out that there were a lot of good people at the firm, but said things could get uncomfortable with the most senior managers and partners. “I told the HR person when I left, ‘There’s just something off about this place,’” she said.",
            "In 2015, after the incident in the south of France, Sangodeyi wanted to give the firm the benefit of the doubt. She was new to the company. “Perhaps the comment was coming from a place of ignorance, since the manager was from a more provincial part of Denmark,” she thought. Many partners and managers at Red, which was founded in Copenhagen, are Danish, including the man who made the remark. Denmark is relatively small and homogenous.",
            "“Possibly a dynamic at play here is that Red is a global company founded on non-American, not exclusively American dynamics,” Brown said.",
            "One of the challenges at Red will be “bridging the cultural divide,” said Mathew Yazzie, a San Francisco-based diversity consultant Red hired. Yazzie, who has worked on diversity issues at Google and for other Silicon Valley firms, said he didn’t think Red was that unusual. “I wasn’t surprised by a lot of it,” he said. “I’ve seen everything.” He plans to do a diversity audit in the coming weeks, looking at the firm’s processes such as hiring and performance reviews.",
            "‘This Felt Different’",
            "In a statement to HuffPost, Red Associates claimed that the man who exclaimed about Sangodeyi’s skin color “made an immediate and deeply sincere apology.”",
            "Sangodeyi said that was absolutely not true — and that the man just walked away after she told him his remarks were bizarre.",
            "She said she was mainly happy day-to-day working at the company, but that her time at Red Associates was marked by these kinds of off-putting moments.",
            "There was the time she was at the daily communal lunch, where everyone stands and shares a meal around a tall white table in the company’s meeting room. Flowers are usually on display, too. Always white.",
            "Sangodeyi was eating with a group of colleagues when a white female partner started talking about the term “Negro,” she said.",
            "“It’s like, why are you talking about this?” she recalled thinking. She walked out.",
            "Sangodeyi is a historian of science by training. She grew up in the suburbs, went to a private school, spent years at Harvard.",
            "“I’m used to being in [white] spaces and not being bothered by microaggressions,” she said. “This felt different.”",
            "Partners at the firm also called her “angry” or “difficult,” both to her face and to others within the firm, even after Sangodeyi pointed out to her managers that such characterizations were steeped in stereotypes. Former colleagues told HuffPost neither term applied even remotely to Sangodeyi.",
            "Comments like these could help explain why women of color didn’t seem to advance at the company.",
            "Women of color took nearly four times as long as white men to get promoted to manager, according to an analysis that was created by a consultant at Red in 2018. Some men led only one project or no projects before getting promoted, according to the spreadsheet obtained by HuffPost. Two white women were promoted after leading a single project. No women of color were.",
            "Sangodeyi led five projects over her nearly four years at the company without being promoted. She left the firm two years ago, frustrated after watching less experienced, less credentialed male colleagues be promoted to manager while she was skipped over because she wasn’t “ready.”",
            "Red Associates said it can’t comment on individual employees. But it did say Yazzie will develop a training program “to make sure everyone understands microaggressions, and why they are racist and harmful to their colleagues and to the overall culture of a workplace.”",
            "‘It Seemed Tone Deaf’",
            "In June, Red Associates declared on LinkedIn that “Black Lives Matter” and condemned systemic racism. “We want to see change and we need to move beyond social media statements. Inequity is only addressed through long term, sustained efforts at the root of the social and racial issues,” read the post.",
            "The firm also seemed to acknowledge its own shortcomings. “[W]e also have much to interrogate, and so much we can and must do better,” said the post. “If you have thoughts or resources to share, experts you recommend we learn from, or partner with, please comment or email us ...”",
            "Current and former employees were outraged.",
            "“It seemed tone deaf, given the lack of diversity, to say we stand with this movement,” said one person who is close to the company and familiar with the recent turmoil, noting it also seemed like Red was soliciting free advice from people of color. “It should be something the company should be actively seeking out and paying for.”",
            "Soon the firm hired Yazzie.",
            "Leaders at Red should look inward, wrote Nelson Saldana, a former consultant who left the firm this spring, in a comment on the LinkedIn post: “The fact that no one internally can act as a thought leader on these issues demonstrates the types of people who are valued internally.” That comment has since been deleted, and Saldana did not respond to HuffPost’s request for further comment.",
            "Inside the company, the LinkedIn post prompted consultants and partners to have an open conversation about diversity on a conference call. One consultant, a person of color who already had a foot out the door, talked about how they had always felt uncomfortable at Red and never felt OK speaking up, according to someone familiar with the call.",
            "Arora, the managing partner, also sent out emails to staff in early June, acknowledging the firm needed to do more.",
            "“We are a small company who values inclusion and diversity of ideas and perspective, yet we don’t have enough diversity on our team, have struggled to retain people of color and I worry that means our culture hasn’t felt as welcoming to all as it should,” she wrote.",
            "It Affects Your Work",
            "Sangodeyi left the firm in 2018, fed up with its “casual racism, implicit and explicit bias,” and with the inequities in promotion, she said. She founded her own consulting company last year.",
            "About 13 people of color — including four Black women — have left the firm since then, according to those familiar with the firm’s numbers. Some quit; others were laid off after a recent bout of downsizing.",
            "One of the Black women who left said working at Red Associates was a painful experience.",
            "This woman, who was relatively new to the firm and young, said her manager called her “scary” during a 2018 meeting with a client at which she was presenting. She said she complained about this to him, and finally to another senior manager — but nothing happened. In fact, she said, her manager was promoted.",
            "The remarks, the way the incident was handled, and the feelings of otherness wore her down.",
            "“After a while, those things make you question your voice, your team, the trust of the people you work around,” she told HuffPost.",
            "Red said these comments were “completely inappropriate and wrong.”",
            "It’s not unusual for people of color working in the corporate world to wind up questioning themselves and those around them, said Dnika Travis, lead researcher at Catalyst, a nonprofit that advocates for diversity, inclusion and equality in the workplace. Travis, who is Black, has been interviewing women and men of color about their experiences for years.",
            "The “comments, the slights and insults” amount to what Travis calls an emotional tax. Women and men of color pay the tax with their very souls.",
            "“The stories are harrowing and heartbreaking,” Travis said.",
            "The Black employee who was called “scary” by her manager said she felt like she shut down after that. “That shutting down let me be less creative at work,” she said. “I’d stop speaking up as much in meetings. I’d stop speaking up as much in group sessions. I felt invalidated. Like I didn’t matter.”"

            "Robert Stewart Trump was born in 1948, the youngest of New York City real estate developer Fred Trump’s five children.",
            "The president, two years older than Robert, admittedly bullied his brother in their younger years, even as he praised his loyalty and laid-back demeanor.",
            "“I think it must be hard to have me for a brother but he’s never said anything about it and we’re very close,” Donald Trump wrote in his 1987 bestseller “The Art of the Deal.” “Robert gets along with almost everyone,” he added, “which is great for me since I sometimes have to be the bad guy.”",
            "In the 1980s, Donald Trump tapped Robert Trump to oversee an Atlantic City casino project, calling him the perfect fit for the job. When it cannibalized his other casinos, though, “he pointed the finger of blame at Robert,” said Blair, author of “The Trumps: Three Generations that Built an Empire.”",

The stresses of lockdown have driven more of us to take breaks from social networking sites, and the rise of digital detoxes shows just how damaging our social media habits can be for our well-being.",
            "During the pandemic, some people have witnessed – perhaps more than ever before – abusive and hateful messages online. Throughout this period, JK Rowling attracted criticism for her comments on trans issues, and rapper Wiley made the news for his anti-semitic outbursts.",
            "This prevalence of hate led the European Union Commission to prepare new guidelines in an attempt to eradicate hate speech on social media by making platforms more transparent, according to Tech Crunch.",
            "But how can we cope in the meantime, if our social media feeds are affecting our mental well-being?",
            "Be active about when you engage – and when you don’t.",
            "Social media is becoming harder to ignore, so it’s almost essential to manage it properly. Is it even possible to have a healthy relationship with the online world? Social media expert and psychotherapist Aaron Balick believes so.",
            "“The important thing is to be active about the way you engage with social media and not passive,” says Balick. “This means managing your notifications.”",
            "Ideally, Balick says, you should turn off notifications and only check social media when you choose to – rather than habitually looking at your feed. “Be vigilant as to how it makes you feel,” he says. “If it makes you feel depressed, stressed or anxious, come off straight away and give yourself a break.",
            "“Also, think about which feeds are more nourishing to you, and which less so, and plan accordingly.”",
            "Luring ourselves off from social media takes some getting used to – many of us check our feeds whenever there’s a quiet second. And the phenomenon of the “zombie scroll” epitomizes the problem: users scroll for hours for quick, instant hits of dopamine released when they get a like, comment or follow.",
            "“We tend to be addicted to being stimulated by information, checking our feeds at every quiet moment, which stops us having quiet moments that are actually necessary for positive mental health,” explains Balick.",
            "You should have a social media detox when socializing with friends, too. Put your phone out of sight, he suggests. “If you find yourself getting anxious when you can’t check social media, this may be an indication of a dependency, and you should wean yourself off. Come off a platform if it brings you no joy.”",
            "Diversify the content you’re consuming.",
            "Once you have a more balanced approach, it’s time to think about the content you’re taking in. Having your own views backed up by 100% of your feed isn’t necessarily healthy, as it doesn’t provide an authentic view of the world.",
            "Diversity is important, even if you disagree with what another user thinks, says Balick. “It’s important we peer outside our filter bubbles every now and then, but it should be done with an open mind and curiosity.”",
            "“Each person should make their own judgements about this, as peering into some bubbles can be distressing and upsetting,” he adds. “So if you’re going to do it, do it with a purpose and be ready.”",
            "That purpose may be to educate yourself why other people share beliefs you can’t understand, and to humanize people, or to simply gain a broader understanding of conversations going on outside your own friendship circle.",
            "“It can also be a source of important information as to how other people think and feel, so engaging in that can be informative, but also challenging. If you do this, do it to learn, and not pick fights,” warns Balick.",
            "Monitoring new additions to your feed is important, he adds, as they may throw up hateful comments unexpectedly, or make you feel anxious or nervous. It’s important to keep a critical eye on new followers, and old ones too.",
            "Acknowledge that you may get upset.",
            "Feeling upset on social media is, often, inevitable. Even if you run a tight ship with your feed, users re-sharing posts from others on Twitter, Instagram or Facebook may mean you’re exposed to content you find hateful.",
            "“Don’t engage with trolls or haters if you can,” says Balick. “They live off the energy of kicking up a storm. Gently mute and get on with your life.” Although, he adds, “dissociating from an attack is easier said than done.”\n",
            "If possible, “put some distance between yourself and the attack,” he says, which may mean working up a defense mechanism, denouncing attacks as childish, or reading more about why people feel they are safer to be hateful behind screens. Whichever works for you.",
            "“Remember, these attacks often have very little to do with who you are, and more to do with someone getting some anger off their chest,” he warns. It may feel personal, but it often isn’t.",
            "While there’s joy to be extracted from online conversations, the relationships that can be built and nurtured in the digital sphere are often limited. “Social media isn’t often the best arena to have rational discussions about different points of view, which are important discussions to have,” urges Balick.",
            "“Always prioritize face-to-face encounters,” he says, and importantly: “Find other ways to share ideas and work through differences that aren’t on social media.”",

The aid, he said, will be handled directly by the World Food Program.",
            "“This is a moment for Lebanon to define a Lebanese — not a foreign — vision of Lebanon,” Hale said. “What kind of Lebanon do you have and what kind of Lebanon do you want? Only Lebanese can answer that question.”",
            "Coinciding with Hale’s visit was that of the Iranian Foreign Minister Jawad Zarif who said Western nations are exploiting Lebanon’s disaster to push their political dictates.

            "As the rallying cry to “defund the police” reverberates across the country, some critics have claimed that women will be irrevocably harmed if police budgets are downsized, pointing specifically to sexual assault survivors. The argument, steeped in misogyny and antiquated ideas of what a victim looks like, uses crimes (largely but by no means exclusively) committed against women to justify the continued overfunding of police.",
            "But for survivors themselves, the debate is more complicated. Some went to the police for help and received it; most who reported crimes saw their perpetrators walk free. Many didn’t go to the police at all, fearing they would face victim-blaming questions and get little help. Some were assaulted by the very people they’d have to report crimes to.",
            "These survivors don’t want more police. They want more help.",
            "HuffPost spoke to more than a dozen survivors of sexual assault about the debate over defunding police. While their views don’t represent those of all survivors ― nearly 434,000 people are sexually assaulted every year in the U.S. ― they said police often ended up retraumatizing them instead of helping them find justice.",
            "“The criminal system is built to punish. It’s not built to support the victim in any way,” Thomas Shim, co-founder of #WhyIDidntReport, told HuffPost. “As soon as you report, you have to retell your experience over and over again to complete strangers who often victim-blame. In the name of ‘I’m just doing my job,’ they’ll ask you things like ‘What were you wearing?’”",
            "One look at the statistics, and it’s easy to see why many survivors don’t report their assaults to law enforcement. Out of every 1,000 sexual assaults, 995 perpetrators will walk free. Survivors who do decide to press charges against their attackers are usually in for a long and expensive legal battle that can end with a prosecutor deciding not to pursue a case or a contaminated, untested rape kit.",
            "Just last week, retired Memphis Police Department officers admitted to throwing thousands of rape kits into a nearby landfill in the 1990s, and many of the kits were for prosecutable cases within the statute of limitations.",
            "Police also may fail to take reports seriously, especially from members of marginalized groups or people not stereotypically thought to be victims. Black women and non-binary people are “hyper-vulnerable” to sexual violence, according to the ACLU, but not as likely as white women to be believed. And an estimated 1 in 6 men have been victims of sexual violence, yet their stories are often brushed off.",
            "Cops are also perpetrators of sexual assault: Between 2005 and 2013, over 1,200 police officers were arrested for sex crimes, but those were only the ones against victims who were brave enough to report. Law enforcement officers also have a storied history of actively targeting more vulnerable people, like sex workers.",
            "Social services that could receive a reallocation of funding from downsized police budgets are the very types of services survivors need when they report: mental health, addiction and other trauma-informed services.",
            "Many survivors told HuffPost they’d like to see transformative justice ― an alternative method of addressing harm by relying on community members instead of police. Transformative justice is about communal healing and prevention. Incarceration does the opposite; between 3% and 9% of male inmates reported experiencing sexual violence while incarcerated ― that’s more than 180,000 men.",
            "“If I wanted a process of accountability for the abuse I had experienced and to prevent this person from hurting other people, my only option was to lock my rapist up,” said Tani Ikeda, a sexual assault survivor and founder of Survivor Love Letter. “As someone who had family members suffering from PTSD from incarceration, I wanted to search for other solutions.”",
            "The majority of survivors Shim speaks to through his work support defunding the police, but a few ― the “lucky and privileged” who had good experiences with the police ― are not always on board with the movement, he said.",
            "“They’ve had experiences where the police actually helped them find their perpetrator and punish them. That’s amazing. We completely understand where they’re coming from because, again, they demanded justice and they got that,” he said.",

            "“Maggie,” a 25-year-old from Iowa, told HuffPost she was raped several times by her then-partner over the course of a few months. She never reported it to police because of threats from her partner, although she did report the abuse to her school after the last assault, which she says was the most severe.",
            "I frequently thought about filing a police report and often came close to doing so. However, my partner regularly used threats and coercion to prevent me from involving the police. While initially after the last incident of rape, he expressed remorse and even encouraged me to seek help, later on, he began to regularly use suicide threats if I mentioned filing a report… In addition, one of his favorite tactics was to try to convince me that he would be repeatedly raped in prison if I reported. Because I loved him and because I did not want him to harm himself or be harmed, I eventually chose not to pursue police involvement because I feared for his safety both inside and outside of prison.\n\nDespite it being used as a threat, I often think about how my abuser’s commentary about prison rape is not without truth. While that threat will forever haunt me, it has taught me an important lesson about how the criminal justice system so often reinforces and perpetuates violence.\n\nI support abolishing and defunding the police. My answer would likely have been different several years ago, back when I believed that law enforcement was a supportive mechanism for survivors. As many other people do, I believe there is significant work to be done to develop systems of community accountability and community public safety, but it has become clear to me that police were never about providing safety.",
            "“Alex,” a 25-year-old from Denver, told HuffPost she was sexually assaulted by a guy friend while she was at college. Alex, who is Black, said she didn’t report her assault because she was afraid that her attacker, a Black man, would face consequences far worse than his actions due to racism in policing. She also decided not to report because she felt pressure to ensure the representation of the Black community at her school was not affected.",
            "Many Black students at our university had already had issues with the police racially profiling them and harassing them. While what [my attacker] did to me was wrong and illegal, I don’t think it should come with any risk of endangering his life. Additionally, because of the criminalization of Black bodies in our society, I always hesitate to incite police interactions with Black people as I’m afraid of both perpetuating the narrative of our criminality and putting their lives in danger. Within our sphere of influence, my attacker was also someone who was frequently pointed to as an example of “Black Excellence” and has been instrumental in many efforts to improve the experiences of Black students on our campus. At the time, it was a cost-benefit of him being investigated and punished for his behavior, and how that would change how our community was seen. While I know ultimately he doesn’t singlehandedly represent Black students and alumni of our university, I don’t think it would help us in our efforts towards racial justice either.\n\nI’m a strong supporter of defunding the police and making significant other changes to our criminal justice system. Our current systems don’t work for survivors of crime or their assailants. I didn’t report in no small part because I don’t want to perpetuate a broken system that profits on BIPOC bodies. As a survivor, I think I have a stronger sense that the system doesn’t work for anyone except for those in charge of it. We shouldn’t have survivors who aren’t willing to go to the police because they know they won’t be treated with dignity and respect. We shouldn’t have survivors who see their attackers be given punishments either too lenient or too harsh for their crimes, entirely because of who that attacker is. As a survivor who understands the flaws of the penal systems, I know the system is broken on both sides.",

            "Police have only ever compounded the trauma of sexual assaults for me. No one has ever gone to jail for sexually assaulting me, whether I was sex working at the time or not.\n\nAs an advocate for sex workers trying to report violence for the last five years, it has been a struggle to get police to even take reports at times. No one has ever gone to jail for sexually assaulting or sex trafficking any of the survivors who I have supported in reporting. I’m absolutely for defunding the police and redirecting funds to more effective strategies.",
            "Lane Lofaso, a 17-year-old from New York, told HuffPost he was in a sexually and emotionally abusive relationship for a year, starting when he was 15 years old. He said he plans to report his abuser soon.",
            "Defunding the police is something that should happen immediately. The money is not going to any of the right places, and officers are not trained properly to handle sexual assaults and speaking to victims/survivors.\n\nMy experience as a survivor definitely impacts my feeling and opinion on defunding the police and I’m glad that it does. Personally, I don’t think I will ever get justice. Sexual assault causes lifelong trauma and nothing will ever fix that. But the closest thing to that is making sure the perpetrator is punished and that’s where law enforcement comes in.",
            "Amanda Thomashow, a 31-year-old from Michigan, was sexually assaulted by former Michigan State University and USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar during a 2014 medical exam. At the time, she filed a Title IX complaint with MSU but the school concluded Nassar’s conduct was not sexual in nature. Her Title IX complaint was one of the few breadcrumbs that later led to Nassar’s downfall.",
            "My experience as a survivor has only informed me more on how important it is that we take funds away from the police and redistribute them into community services and education. My experiences with the police have been nothing but negative and terrifying. Those experiences only carried out my trauma longer than was necessary and it’s been very clear that they only care about my cases and the harm that’s been done to me if they can prosecute, put somebody in jail or get a fine out of them.",
            "Maya Siegel, a 20-year-old who founded the survivor-centered organization Space to Speak, told HuffPost she was raped by a boyfriend at 14 and later sexually assaulted by a different perpetrator at 18. She decided not to report to police because she was afraid of being victim-blamed.",
            "I didn’t report because I didn’t think I would be believed without evidence. Society is full of abuser sympathizers and judges that blame survivors for their clothes, alcohol consumption, or being in a relationship (and I was in a relationship with him at the time); I knew that I didn’t have a case. Additionally, even though I knew that physical evidence is gone in three days, it took me more than three days to comprehend what happened and tell my parents.\n\nI don’t think police are the answer, especially without proper education. After all, 85% of federal funding for domestic violence is dedicated to law enforcement; it should be redistributed to directly help survivors, an example would be helping them cover medical or legal expenses. It’s been six years and I am still working with doctors; I would have loved an emergency grant or further support.",
            "Riley Reed, a 20-year-old from Chicago, was sexually assaulted two separate times. Reed disclosed the assaults to a professor but did not report to police, knowing the process of reporting can oftentimes be just as traumatic as the initial assault.",
            "I didn’t go forward with a police report because I didn’t want to have to go through a long, arduous process… I didn’t want to feel victimized or be scrutinized with so many different questions… I didn’t feel like I had obvious evidence. Women especially are made to feel like it’s our fault and we brought it on ourselves.\n\nI fully support defunding the police. I think we need other resources that can help people in many different dangerous circumstances. The police don’t have the proper training to deal with trauma. The people that helped me the most through my process were counselors. People that are equipped with proper knowledge should be sent to deescalate or help situations that police so often fail to do.",
            "“Sabrina,” a 45-year-old woman from New York City, said she has been sexually assaulted multiple times, but the most traumatic was when she was sexually abused as a 9-year-old. Her family reported the abuse to the police but, looking back, she felt she was not in control of that decision because she was so young.",
            "In some ways, the urgency to go to the police (on my stepfather’s part) was as traumatizing as the actual attack. My mother did not want to call them. I did not want to call them. We did it because he definitely felt we should. What followed: The police blamed my mother, threatened to report her to CPS, I had to go to a hospital for an exam which was absolutely terrifying.\n\nI’m curious to know more about the details [of defunding the police]. But if it means reducing budgets and redistributing those funds to the community, then absolutely yes [I support it].",
            "Tani Ikeda, a survivor from Los Angeles, told HuffPost she was sexually assaulted when she was younger and entered into a four-year process with law enforcement and the criminal justice system to try to hold her rapist accountable.",
            "It felt like a secondary violence to have my memories scrutinized by police who asked me clinical details about my assault, like a crime scene from which they were extracting evidence. The way I dressed, the accuracy of my memory, my creative online poetry, and even my smile ― all became evidence that I was at fault for my own rape.\n\nHow can we practice transformative justice in our everyday lives and relationships? In a society that devalues human life, we can build more relationships that are based on curiosity and joy rather than gaining social status and career advancement. We center our own pleasure so what looks good on the outside also feels good on the inside. In elementary school, children who misbehave are given timeout. When we become adults, they go to prison. Instead of looking for people to punish, I am deeply invested in undoing the generational cycles of harm in our community through each of us working on ourselves.",
            "“Clare” is a 30 year-old-woman living in California. Growing up in Michigan, she was sexually and physically abused by her mother’s boyfriend for 12 years. She did not report the abuse but neighbors frequently called police for noise complaints.",
            "I was questioned by the officers a few times, always in front of my abusers where I did not feel safe to tell them the truth or ask for help.\n\nEvery time I see articles and posts about abolishing or defunding the police, I’m frustrated that this didn’t happen earlier, that I wasn’t saved, and that the system failed me over and over again. I could have been spared if trained social workers had been involved. The police didn’t save me from being molested and assaulted over and over again for twelve years. People argue that if we defund the police, who will be there to protect women from being raped on the streets? But they neglect the fact that it’s already happening, and it feels like each one of these people are saying that my pain, our pain, doesn’t matter, that it isn’t enough of a reason.",
            "Cassandra, an 18-year-old from Maryland, was raped by a classmate on New Year’s Eve in 2018 when she was 16 years old. She didn’t report her assault because her perpetrator used a condom and because she didn’t leave any marks on him. She also didn’t feel like she truly understood what happened to her until she left for college.",
            "I think we should focus on restorative justice and preventative justice instead of being reactionary and buying into a system that often perpetuates more harm instead of actually helping. My experience has helped me realize that our prison system and justice system is flawed in such a way that it doesn’t achieve meaningful justice. My rapist ― if he had been charged, tried, and locked up ― would have eventually gotten out with no better understanding of consent or what he did to me. He’d probably have lingering feelings or resentment towards me and the justice system while never acknowledging the harm he perpetrated against me. What I’ve realized is that rape is about power and entitlement. That feeling of entitlement never leaves when the punishment is simply prison time. Furthermore, within the prison system, sexual assault is commonplace. Prisons conduct strip searches, in addition to rape being prevalent in prisons. I personally believe that true justice is not achieved by perpetrating the same harm done to you onto the perpetrator and continuing the cycle of violence but rather promote healing and discussion. All I want is a public apology and an acknowledgment of what my rapist has done. I just want to be able to continue on with my life knowing that he knows what he did to me was wrong and he won’t do it again.",

            "Elizabeth Garcia wasn’t particularly religious when she first encountered Young Life, a Colorado-based evangelical youth ministry that seeks to win young souls for Christ. Back then, she was just another nervous high school freshman trying to fit in. Young Life took her in, connected her to a Christian community that cared about her, and taught her that Jesus welcomes all kids to his table.",
            "Over a decade later, Garcia learned firsthand that this welcome had a caveat. After serving as a Young Life volunteer and then a staff member, Garcia says she was forced to resign from her job after coming out as queer.",
            "Looking back, she called it a “bait and switch.”",
            "“As soon as I was asked to resign, immediately it was like, ‘They are not who I thought they were,’” she said.",
            "Garcia’s story is one of hundreds emerging from a new campaign, Do Better Young Life, that seeks to highlight the voices of LGBTQ people and other minorities who say they have been hurt by the ministry. Former participants and employees who are queer described a pattern of damaging behavior to HuffPost ― being recruited as children, finding community and belonging in the group, being encouraged into volunteer and staff positions, and ultimately, being pushed away after coming out. They said they lost their jobs at the ministry, were told to just “stop being gay,” were outed to co-workers without consent, and were treated like a threat to children simply for being queer.",
            "Organizer Kent Thomas, a 30-year-old former Young Life student and staffer from Tacoma, Washington, launched the campaign after learning that the ministry had used a photo of an employee on its Instagram to promote one of its camps ― an employee it had forced out for being queer. Thomas responded with an Instagram post on June 29 claiming that Young Life’s “partial inclusion” was even worse than overt exclusion. He encouraged others to share their stories online under the hashtag #DoBetterYoungLife.",
            "Since then, Thomas says, the group has collected over 400 stories from former Young Life students, volunteers or staff members who allege they experienced queerphobia, racism, sexism or other kinds of discrimination at Young Life. Some of these testimonies have been posted on the campaign’s Instagram and Twitter accounts. Nearly 7,000 people have signed a Change.org petition that lists more inclusive and transparent policies at Young Life as one of its demands.",
            "Young Life told HuffPost that it welcomes all young people as participants in its programs, regardless of “race, religion, ability, sexual orientation or identity.” But it expects leaders to align with its theology, which it said includes the belief that sex is reserved for a heterosexual married couple.",
            "U.S. courts have long given religious groups like Young Life plenty of leeway to hire and fire employees according to their religious beliefs. But the activists behind Do Better Young Life aren’t primarily concerned about the legality of what the ministry is doing. Instead, they insist there is something inherently immoral and even cruel about the way the ministry actively pursues young people, then rejects the ones who turn out to be queer.",
            "Former employees told HuffPost that more than the loss of their own jobs, they were motivated to speak up because they are worried about queer youth continuing to get plugged into the ministry.",
            "Garcia and others behind Do Better Young Life aren’t hopeful that the ministry will change its non-affirming theology. But what they are hoping for is greater transparency. As of now, Garcia said she doesn’t think that Young Life is a safe space for queer kids.",
            "“If you’re not affirming, you have to be more upfront,” she said of Young Life. “You need to be clear about that or you’re going to hurt a lot more people.”",
            "Winning Young Souls For Christ",
            "The overarching mission of Young Life, a nearly 80-year-old organization based in Colorado Springs, is to introduce Christianity ― specifically, a conservative interpretation of Christianity ― to unchurched middle school, high school and college-aged youth. Young Life does this by “going where kids are” and earning their trust. With the permission of school administrators, Young Life sends leaders, primarily college-aged students, to public schools during free periods or activities open to the public, such as lunch or sports games.",
            "According to former participants, Young Life leaders target and befriend “key” kids, usually “popular” kids, at public schools to ensure that Young Life comes across to the student population as a “cool” thing to participate in. During the school year, Young Life holds weekly gatherings, called “clubs,” where kids learn more about Christianity. Close to 370,000 kids attended Young Life clubs weekly during the 2018–2019 school year. Young Life camps, meanwhile, are the main attraction for many kids. Over 240,000 youth attended Young Life camps between 2018 and 2019.",
            "Thomas said that leaders aren’t immediately upfront with new kids or their parents about the ministry’s conservative religious mission. At club, leaders sometimes have kids sing along to secular songs before switching over to worship songs at the end, he said.",
            "“It’s absolutely never, ‘Come and you’ll get this message about Jesus and we want you to become a Christian.’ It’s, ‘There’s going to be this school game of dodge ball, or let’s get this gutter and fill it with ice cream, it’s going to be fun.’ And then at the end, Jesus talk,” he said.",
            "Once unchurched kids become emotionally invested in Christianity, they are taught that a key way to be like Jesus is to become “servant leaders,” former participants told HuffPost. That means older leaders will push teens to sign up for volunteer positions at Young Life while they are still in high school. It’s only when the teens start seeking out leadership roles in an effort to live out their newfound faith that they start hearing about Young Life’s non-affirming theology.",
            "In hindsight, Thomas said, he now thinks of Young Life’s methods as manipulative ― especially for the queer kids who naturally get caught in the wide net Young Life casts for its mission work at public schools.",
            "“I think it’s so much by design that Young Life gets youth roped in in a casual, social way, and then slowly, it gets more and more intense.”",
            "Old Beliefs, Repackaged",
            "Young Life told HuffPost that its position on sexuality and gender “aligns with historic Christian theology.” The group believes that “sexuality is a gift from God and that God guides us in how to use this gift, including that intimate sexual activity should occur within a marriage covenant between a man and a woman.”",
            "“We recognize that some thoughtful and committed Christians have different views, and we are committed to being in conversation with these and others – both inside and outside Young Life,” the group added.",
            "Evangelizing to Gen Z, the generation born after 1996, with this conservative set of beliefs has become an increasingly daunting task, given that generation’s affirming views. Roughly half (48%) of members of Gen Z say that allowing gay and lesbian couples to marry is a good thing for our society, compared to 27% of Baby Boomers, according to a Pew Research Center report published in April.",
            "As a result, there’s been a growing trend towards ambiguity among some conservative churches that want to attract young people, according to Jess Kotnour, a member of the leadership team at Church Clarity, a crowd-sourced database that scores congregations based on how clearly they communicate their actively enforced policies on gender and sexuality.",
            "These churches will present themselves as inclusive, but will ultimately refuse to ordain, hire, or marry queer people, Kotnour said. “They’ll have really nice websites, they have Instagram, and they look hip. They play into this idea that ‘We’re not the church your parents went to, we’re the cool church.’ But actually, it’s the same beliefs, but repackaged.”",
            "Church Clarity hasn’t started to officially score campus or other parachurch ministries. But after taking a brief look at Young Life’s website, Kotnour gave the ministry Church Clarity’s lowest score ― “undisclosed” because the group’s position on sexuality or gender diversity can’t be found in its statement of faith, mission statement, “about” page, or other main pages.\n\nSince Young Life isn’t affiliated with a specific religious denomination, new students and their parents must depend on the ministry’s website to glean information about where it stands. Being clear about these issues is particularly important when kids and parents are unfamiliar with evangelicalism and may not know what key phrases to look for, Kotnour said.\n\nYoung Life declined to answer questions about whether it would update its statement of faith to reflect its views on sexuality and gender diversity.\n\nThomas believes Young Life’s ambiguity around this issue is “100% purposeful.” If the ministry believes firmly that LGBTQ relationships are sinful, it shouldn’t be ashamed to make that clear from day one to both kids and parents considering getting involved in the program, he said.",
            "“Young Life is trying to have their cake and eat it too by pretending to youth that they’re affirming,” Thomas said. “The idea that a person would be barred from any activity just because they are queer is horrifying to so many young people. Young Life knows this, they’re not naive to that. And for that reason, they are toeing this very fine line.”",
            "A Pattern Emerges",
            "Garcia said she doesn’t think she fully grasped that Young Life was an evangelical ministry when she first heard about it back in 2005. She didn’t have much exposure to evangelicalism at that point in her life. Other than having her grandma’s funeral at a Catholic church, religion wasn’t a big part of her life.",
            "All she knew was that Young Life was something the popular kids at her public high school in Bradenton, Florida, participated in. Garcia remembers the girls on the school’s basketball team pushing her to check it out. Young Life leaders came to her school, got to know her, and encouraged her to attend the ministry’s week-long summer camp in North Carolina, Garcia said.",
            "That week changed the course of Garcia’s life. She still remembers seeing Young Life’s Windy Gap camp for the first time and being blown away by the beauty of the Appalachian Mountains, the rustic cabins, the zip line and the basketball courts. And then there was the community, the sense of belonging and acceptance that staff members worked hard to create for kids.",
            "By the end of camp, Garcia had gone from being ambivalent about religion to making an evangelical profession of faith ― standing up during a meeting and declaring that she had accepted Jesus as her personal savior.",
            "She stayed involved in Young Life for the rest of high school, going to weekly club meetings with friends, attending a local church and volunteering at camp.",
            "“I loved that kids come [to Young Life] and they feel so safe, they can be who they want, they can have a good time and forget about whatever else is going on in their lives,” she told HuffPost. “I thought that this is what Jesus would do, he wants everybody here and everyone to know that they’re safe and loved and that this life is good.”",
            "Garcia said she believed so deeply in the group’s mission that she turned down a basketball scholarship to a secular college in order to attend a Christian college in Florida, just so that she could learn how to be a better Young Life leader. Garcia went on to become a Young Life staff member, working at a camp in California before finally getting a job as a housekeeper at what had long been her dream location ― Young Life’s Lost Canyon camp in Williams, Arizona.",
            "By then, Garcia said, she had known for a long time that she was queer. She had struggled to repress her sexuality for years, but in 2017, with the help of a therapist, she said she felt ready to come out to herself and to the people she loved. She knew that Young Life was a conservative organization, but because of how inclusive and welcoming the organization had seemed for all this time, she said, she still believed that it wouldn’t prioritize its policies over people.",
            "That’s not what happened. Instead, Young Life gave Garcia an ultimatum ― pledge to remain celibate, or be forced to resign. It was presented as a choice, but it didn’t seem like a fair one to her, she said.",
            "“One of the biggest things I’ve learned over the years with Young Life is to be your most authentic self, your healthiest self. To love others, love yourself, and love God,” she said. “To love myself, I needed to accept this part of me. To hear that they were going to tell me to choose to live a life of celibacy, that’s not living an authentic life.”",
            "Several queer, former Young Life volunteers and staffers who are part of the Do Better Young Life campaign shared similar stories with HuffPost.",
            "Alyssa Silva, a 24-year-old former Young Life student and volunteer, told HuffPost she was a nonpracticing Catholic before she was introduced to Young Life in 2010. At her public high school in Lucas, Texas, Young Life was the “popular” thing to do, she said.",
            "In her junior year of high school, Young Life leaders asked her to help out with Wyldlife, the organization’s middle school ministry, she said. During high school, she said, she never heard Young Life leaders in her region explicitly talking to kids about the organization’s beliefs around sexuality and gender.",
            "Young Life’s non-affirming theology became clearer to her when she started volunteering with the ministry as a college student at Texas A&M University, she said. At meetings, the area director for the Brazos Valley region would tell college-aged leaders that if a kid in their care came out to them as gay or lesbian, the children should be told that these feelings stemmed from a “misplaced desire,” Silva said.",
            "When Silva decided to come out to that same area director in 2017, she knew she would need to step down. But his reaction still shook her. He told her she needed to “stop being gay” and that she was no longer “worthy or qualified” to serve as a leader, Silva said.",
            "“He told me that I was a wolf in a herd of sheep. He told me a lot of really hurtful things that I still think about to this day, and it’s been almost three years,” Silva said.",
            "The director outed her to the rest of the Young Life leadership team and she ended up being ostracized from the community that she had grown to love, she said.",
            "“It was truly devastating,” she said. “I was alone, I was terrified. There were days on days on days that I couldn’t get out of bed. I would go into these crazy crying spells where I just couldn’t stop. Eventually, I got to the point where I was suicidal. It was a really hard and dark time.”",
            "The Brazos Valley Young Life chapter did not reply to HuffPost’s request for comment on Silva’s story. Young Life’s central communications team also declined to explain if and how Young Life volunteers and staff are trained to respond when a queer student comes out to them.",
            "Studies have suggested that religiosity could be a protective factor against suicide attempts. But that protective effect hasn’t been documented among LGBTQ individuals. Data from a 2011 survey from the University of Texas at Austin’s Research Consortium, one of the few large-scale studies that investigated suicidal behavior, sexual orientation and religion among college students, suggested that increased levels of religiosity were associated with increased odds of suicidal ideation among queer youth.",
            "Josh Truitt, a 24-year-old former college volunteer for Young Life in Georgetown, Texas, told HuffPost that at first, he bought into the ministry’s position that it is wrong for Christians to be in same-sex relationships. But even then, he says, he was never fully accepted by the ministry as a gay, celibate Christian.",
            "Truitt said he wasn’t allowed to be open about his sexuality while volunteering for the group. When he tried to give a testimony at camp about how being gay doesn’t separate people from God’s love, staff members not only stopped him from speaking, they also started treating him as if he were a threat to children simply because he was gay, he said.",
            "Truitt said he also heard a speaker at a Young Life leadership conference say that it didn’t matter if a queer person was or wasn’t sexually active ― and that simply having same-sex attractions disqualified someone from being a ministry leader.",
            "After months of wrestling with depression and suicidal thoughts, Truitt said he decided to leave Young Life of his own accord.",
            "“I finally came to the realization, through a lot of therapy and a lot of tough conversations and reading everything under the sun, that God didn’t create me to go through life in a state of mental unhealth,” he said. “God created me to live life and live it abundantly. And that’s not what being closeted was.”",
            "Young Life presents itself as a ministry where the “weirdest, strangest, most out-there kids,” can feel safe and accepted, Truitt said. But he believes that in practice, it’s for the “whitest, straightest, most Protestant kids” at a school.",
            "Do Better Young Life organizers say that the ministry’s anti-queer policies are just one example of a culture that is unwelcoming to kids from marginalized communities. The group has shared stories from former participants who claim they were subjected to racist jokes and tokenization, classism, misogyny and other forms of discrimination.",
            "“I’ve been told things like, ‘You’re not meant to lead at this school. You’ll be more of an impact with the urban kids’ or things like, ‘You’re not like everyone else! You’re different!’ I’ve been used for racial jokes in front of hundreds of campers and I’ve fallen victim to making those jokes myself simply because I was being influenced by the wrong people,” one Black former Young Lifer wrote on Instagram.",
            "To address all of these issues, the ministry has announced it will convene a council of top leaders and “staff and non-staff” to review the stories of former Young Life leaders who say they were deceived and mistreated and “recommend the appropriate course of action in each case.”",
            "Young Life declined to answer HuffPost’s questions about whether the council will include people in same-sex relationships or those who identify as trans, as well as questions about when the review will be completed and how the results will be shared with kids, parents and the public.",
            "Young Life told HuffPost that the ministry is confident that its theology is faithful to “God’s vision for human sexuality.” The stories some former participants have shared “highlight the need to review how we train staff and volunteers to come alongside and love kids who identify as LGBTQ+ — without conditions, [judgment] or shame.”",
            "The organization insisted that “the vast majority of young people, including those who identify as LGBTQ+, have positive experiences in Young Life.” HuffPost requested to be connected to a current or former Young Life participant, volunteer or employee who is in a queer relationship or is gender diverse and had an overall positive experience with the organization. Young Life has not responded to that request.",
            "Truitt said his biggest concern now is making sure that others don’t experience what he did.",
            "“I never want someone to come out to [a leader at Young Life] and their canned response to be, ‘That’s sinful and you need to change,’” he said. “That will lead kids down deep dark tunnels that they don’t need to be in and that I found myself in when I was leading Young Life.”",
            "Three years after being pushed out of Young Life, Garcia said that the emotional and spiritual trauma that came with that rejection still feels fresh. She admitted there are some days when she still wishes she could go back and work at camp.",
            "But ultimately, Garcia said, she decided not to let the ministry decide whom she was going to love. She emphasized to HuffPost that she’s thankful for the lessons she learned from the pain and for the life she’s built for herself outside the ministry. Despite the harmful theology Young Life tried to pass on to her, she said she fully believes that “who I am is okay and good.”",
            "The Do Better Young Life campaign has shown her that she’s not the only one, she said.",
            "“I loved my life there,” she said about Young Life. “But it wasn’t worth compromising who I am. And that’s what I want for kids, I don’t want them to feel like they have to hide.”",
            "“I want people to know that they are seen and celebrated and loved.”",

            "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention put out new guidance this month on retesting and quarantining for people who have been infected with the coronavirus.",
            "The latest information suggests that a person is likely protected for up to three months once they’ve recovered from COVID-19. During that period, the CDC said, people who had COVID-19 might still continue to test positive, but they may not be infectious to others.",
            "“People who have tested positive for COVID-19 do not need to quarantine or get tested again for up to three months as long as they do not develop symptoms again,” the CDC said. “People who develop symptoms again within three months of their first bout of COVID-19 may need to be tested again if there is no other cause identified for their symptoms.”",
            "However, the agency clarified that this does not mean is that people who’ve had COVID-19 are immune from the disease for three months, nor does it affect a person’s antibodies.",
            "“This science does not imply a person is immune to reinfection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in the 3 months following infection,” the CDC said in a statement. “The latest data simply suggests that retesting someone in the 3 months following initial infection is not necessary unless that person is exhibiting the symptoms of COVID-19 and the symptoms cannot be associated with another illness.”",
            "There’s still not much we know about COVID-19 antibodies and reinfection. Since the virus is still so new, experts can’t say for certain how long someone can expect to be immune to the virus after they’ve been sick.",
            "Previous research does suggest that three months may be the duration of immunity. A study from China published in June found that a significant number of COVID-19 patients showed a decrease in immunity levels around two or three months after infection. However, the study size was small and examined only asymptomatic patients.",
            "Other experts believe what’s more likely is that antibodies wane over time but there’s still some level of protection. This is thanks to cells in charge of activating the body’s immune response, called B cells and T cells, which essentially “remember” how to fight off the virus and may re-trigger antibodies if a person is exposed to the virus again.",
            "“When the body generates an immune response [to a virus], T cells remember in case of a possibility of future reinfection, so that if presented with the virus again your body recognizes it and knows how to handle it,” Christine Bishara, an internal medicine physician and founder of From Within Medical in New York, recently told HuffPost.\n\nExperts have also noted that those who have reported being reinfected with COVID-19 may actually just not have fully recovered from their first infection.",
            "What This New Guidance Means For Us",
            "Does the new CDC guidance suggest that you’re free to return to your pre-pandemic life for a few months after you’ve recovered from COVID-19? Nope, sorry.",
            "While experts say it’s pretty unlikely you’ll be reinfected, it’s not 100% impossible. If you’ve recently been diagnosed with COVID-19, there’s also a chance you could still be contagious depending on where you are in the course of the illness. People with mild cases can potentially spread the illness for about 10 days after symptoms first appear. Those with more severe cases may be infectious for about 20 days after the initial signs of the illness.",
            "To reiterate, the new CDC guidance applies to those who have recovered.",
            "Until there’s a vaccine ― and maybe even beyond that point ― experts say it’s important to exercise health precautions like wearing a mask, social distancing, washing your hands frequently and staying home if you feel sick. These actions are just generally vital to overall public health during the pandemic.",
            "Experts are still learning about COVID-19. The information in this story is what was known or available as of publication, but guidance could change as scientists discover more about the virus. Please check the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the most updated recommendations."

            "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Top Democrats in the U.S. Congress on Sunday called on President Donald Trump’s appointed postmaster general to testify this month on changes that have stoked fears they are aimed at holding up mail-in ballots ahead of the November election.",
            "The Postal Service’s internal watchdog has begun investigating a wave of cost-cutting kicked off by Postmaster General Louis DeJoy that has slowed mail delivery around the country, alarming lawmakers ahead of the Nov. 3 election when up to half of U.S. voters could cast ballots by mail.",
            "Congressional Democrats called on DeJoy, a donor to Republican President Donald Trump, and U.S. Postal Service Chairman Robert Duncan to testify in an Aug. 24 committee hearing.",
            "“The President has explicitly stated his intention to manipulate the Postal Service to deny eligible voters access to the ballot in pursuit of his own re-election,” Democrats including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Oversight Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney said in a joint statement. “The Postmaster General and top Postal Service leadership must answer to the Congress and the American people as to why they are pushing these dangerous new policies that threaten to silence the voices of millions, just months before the election.”",
            "DeJoy did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
            "Democrats have accused Trump, who is trailing presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden in polls, of trying to hamstring the cash-strapped Postal Service to suppress mail-in voting.",
            "Trump himself on Thursday said he had held up talks with Congress over a fresh round of coronavirus stimulus funding to block Democrats from providing more funds for mail-in voting and election infrastructure.",
            "Trump later walked back those comments, saying he would not veto a bill that included funds for the Postal Service. White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows told CNN on Sunday said he would agree to $10 billion to $25 billion in fresh Postal funding. Democrats had sought $25 billion.",

            "WHITE HOUSE FEARS PELOSI",

            "“A number of states are now trying to figure out how they are going to go to universal mail-in ballots,” Meadows said. “That’s a disaster where we won’t know the election results on Nov. 3 and we might not know it for months and for me that’s problematic because the Constitution says that then a Nancy Pelosi in the House would actually pick the president on Jan. 20. So we need to make sure that we do it right.”",
            "Trump has repeatedly and without evidence said that a surge in mail-in voting would lead to fraud. Voting by mail is nothing new in the United States, as one in four voters cast ballots that way in 2016.",
            "The House could vote on a measure to prohibit the Postal Service from implementing any changes to the operations or level of service it had in place in January 2020, until the COVID-19 pandemic has ended.",
            "U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders told ABC’s “This Week” he would back that move.",
            "“The House should come back and make sure that the U.S. Postal Service is fully funded,” Sanders said. “This goes to the fact of whether or not we are a democracy.”",

            "WASHINGTON ― The U.S. Census Bureau unexpectedly announced it will end 2020 census field operations early, a decision that will disproportionately hurt Native American tribes that are already historically undercounted, hard to reach and rely on accurate census data for lifesaving federal dollars.",
            "The agency slipped the news into a press release last week: “We will end field data collection by Sept. 30, 2020. Self-response options will also close on that date to permit the commencement of data processing.”",
            "That’s a month earlier than the Census Bureau ― and any organization focused on a strong census count ― planned for all year.",
            "So what? It’s only a month, right? And why does the census matter anyway, beyond showing us how many people live here and where they live?",
            "The census is so much more than a headcount. Census data is used to draw congressional districts, which means, for example, the more that minorities are counted in a given area, the more likely they will be kept together as a community and have a voice in Congress. If fewer minorities are counted in a given area, those communities are broken apart and lumped into other districts.",
            "Census data is also used to decide how much federal money goes to every community. For each person who isn’t counted in the census, their community loses thousands of dollars every year for the next 10 years. That money would have otherwise been used for services like health care, education, infrastructure and housing assistance.",
            "Native Americans were the most undercounted population in the country the last time the census was taken in 2010. This time, it’s going to be even worse because of the Census Bureau’s decision to close up shop early.",
            "Why? People in remote areas, like many tribal communities, often rely on census takers coming to them in the final stage of data collection to do “nonresponse follow-ups.” They knock on the doors of people who haven’t responded to the census online or by mail, and they interview them. Many people on reservations don’t have internet access or reliable mail, so they get counted in person. But because of the coronavirus pandemic, reservations closed to the public for months. Now, with census field operations cut short, census takers simply won’t reach some of these communities at all.",
            "“It ensures a historic, devastating undercount for Native Americans,” said Natalie Landreth, senior staff attorney at the Native American Rights Fund. “It ensures it. We’re not guessing. We’ve run all the numbers, and we know it.”",
            "Tribes in remote areas rely entirely on federal dollars for health care, which the federal government is required to provide to millions of Native Americans under its treaty obligations. A census undercount means they will get a fraction of the federal money they are owed for the next 10 years, in an already chronically underfunded health care system overseen by the Indian Health Service, amid a pandemic that has ravaged tribal communities.",
            "Native Americans have long been undercounted. The official estimated undercount in the 2010 census was 4.9%, though Landreth said it was likely closer to 7%. But this year’s pandemic and the Census Bureau’s shortened timeline mean tribes will take a bigger hit.",
            "“It’s going to throw people who are already poor into more extreme poverty and diminish their political power so you never get anybody who represents your interests,” Landreth said. “Think of being powerless and poor. That’s what this does.”",
            "The 2020 census response rate is trackable on the Census Bureau’s website. It currently shows a 63.6% response rate nationwide among people who responded online, by mail or by phone. If you toggle the data, it shows a 20.5% response rate among tribes.",
            "In Alaska, which is home to 229 of the 574 federally recognized tribes in the country, the level of census data collection among tribes sounds abysmal. The state is so big and some tribes are so remote that census takers typically head into communities as early as January, much earlier than in the rest of the country. But bad storms early in the year delayed the process. That was followed by tribes’ shutting down for months because of the pandemic. Now that it’s August, a lot of locals aren’t home. They’ve left their villages for weeks of fishing and hunting as part of the seasonal subsistence cycle.",
            "On top of that, the Census Bureau sowed confusion among Alaskan tribes about how census data would be collected this year, said Nicole Borromeo, executive vice president of the Alaska Federation of Natives.",
            "“They had been trained to tell rural residents that they could only do it in person. Now they’re being told they can do it online or over the phone, when they had neither option before,” she said. “Then they said they’d be back in person. But instead, they’re just mailing them flyers and postcards. Then they said field operations are going to last through October. Now all of a sudden they’re ending at the end of September.”",
            "It doesn’t help that there is already a massive amount of distrust of the federal government among tribes due to decades of oppression and broken promises.",
            "“This could not be any worse for Alaska,” Borromeo added.",
            "Three major tribal advocacy groups last week issued a rare joint statement sounding the alarm on the Census Bureau’s “unwarranted and irresponsible decision” to cut short the census count.",
            "“Our tribal nations and tribal communities have been ravaged by COVID-19, and an extension of the census enumeration period was a humane lifeline during an unprecedented global health catastrophe that provided critically needed additional time to tribal nations to ensure that ... everyone in their communities are counted,” said the statement from the National Congress of American Indians, the Native American Rights Fund and the National Urban Indian Family Coalition. “For millions of American Indians and Alaska Natives, whether they live on rural reservations or in America’s large cities, an inaccurate census count will decimate our ability to advocate for necessary services for our most vulnerable communities.”",
            "The groups urged Congress to include language in the next COVID-19 relief bill to require the Census Bureau to stick to its original Oct. 31 deadline to end field operations.",
            "There is some support for this on Capitol Hill. Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) wrote to House and Senate leaders Tuesday urging them to extend the statutory deadlines to deliver census data to the president and states to the spring of 2021 from Dec. 31. That would extend the entire census process, not just field operations, which is what some census officials have said they need to do an accurate census count.",
            "“In July, the associate director of the census, Albert Fontenot, said, ‘We are past the window of being able to get those counts’ by year’s end,” said the letter from Murkowski and Schatz, which was signed by a total of 48 senators. “Extending the deadlines for the delivery of these files in the next COVID-19 relief package will ensure that the Census Bureau has adequate time to complete a full, fair and accurate 2020 census.”",
            "But congressional leaders are nowhere near a deal on the next COVID-19 relief bill. Congress doesn’t even return from a break until September. And in a depressing sign that the census itself has become a partisan issue, only two of the 48 senators who signed the Murkowski-Schatz letter are Republicans: Murkowksi and fellow Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska.",
            "HuffPost could only find one other GOP senator, Steve Daines of Montana, who publicly urged the Census Bureau to extend its deadlines.",
            "A spokesperson for Sen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.), who chairs the Committee on Indian Affairs, did not respond to a request for comment on whether he is concerned about census field operations ending early and hurting tribes.",
            "Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.), chairman of the House Subcommittee for Indigenous Peoples of the United States, said there’s only one reason why the Census Bureau is closing up shop early.",
            "“This is all politically motivated,” he said. “This is about Republicans trying to keep control over a changing demographic that they just can’t keep up with. ... Republicans understand if the census data comes back strong, when it comes to reelections, they’re going to have an even harder time holding power through a gerrymandered district.”",
            "It makes no sense to stop counting people early, and all signs point to corruption within the Trump administration, Gallego added.",
            "“They could ask for more money if they wanted,” he said. “They have given us no real reason for this. They’re just not going to count.”",
            "A Census Bureau spokesperson responded to a HuffPost request for comment by emailing a link to the agency’s press release announcing its plans to end its field operations early. The spokesperson did not respond to a follow-up email asking if politics are driving the agency’s decision.",
            "With Congress gone and hardly any Republicans making the issue a priority, there’s nothing stopping the Census Bureau from ending its count early. Unless something changes, tribal villages and reservations already wrestling with poverty and health disparities will have to brace for even fewer federal resources for another 10 years.",
            "“This is harming their day-to-day ability to live for the next decade,” Landreth said. “I’ve never seen anything like this.”"

Would you like to movie marathon with me? Come meet me!”",

            "The Duchess of Sussex, who once reportedly thought about becoming a journalist herself, sat down with Emily Ramshaw, co-founder and CEO of The 19th*, on Friday for a candid discussion at The 19th* Represents Summit.",
            "Ramshaw, former editor-in-chief of nonprofit media organization The Texas Tribune, spoke with the duchess about how The 19th* came to be and what a newsroom can look like with better representation. Meghan also spoke about the downfalls of clickbait and the “economy for attention” in media and what it was like to return to the U.S. after a decade away.",
            "Ramshaw opened with some of the challenges of founding The 19th*, especially in the midst of a global pandemic. But as she saw how COVID-19 personally affected women in terms of issues like job loss and child care and as the U.S. went through a racial reckoning, she realized her mission was more important than ever.",
            "The co-founder said The 19th* was really the first national news outlet to elevate the killing of Breonna Taylor after one of Taylor’s family members approached an editor there.",
            "Ramshaw said she hopes her team, which is 91% women, will set the “gold standard for the industry.” She added that there is a hunger for the kind of coverage The 19th* provides and the outlet has a “moral obligation to meet women where they are,” which is one of the reasons it’s letting people and organizations republish their stories for free.",
            "Ramshaw later switched gears to ask Meghan a few questions about her extremely personal experience with the media and how she thinks coverage would be different with more women and people of color at the helm of news organizations.",
            "“I think what’s so fascinating ― at least from my standpoint and my personal experience the past couple of years ― is the headline alone, the clickbait alone, makes an imprint,” the duchess said. “That is part of how we start to view the world, how we interact with other people.”",
            "Meghan added that there is “so much toxicity” in this “economy for attention,” something she and her husband, Prince Harry, often talk about. “That is what it monetizable right now when you’re looking at the digital space and media. If you’re just trying to grab someone’s attention and keep it, you’re going for something salacious versus something truthful.”",
            "“You want to have trust in journalism and you want to have trust in what you’re reading and hope that it’s fact,” she later said. “We’ve been so sadly comfortable with the idea that we are just getting all of this stuff and it becomes noise as opposed to truth and accurate journalism.”",
            "Ramshaw also asked Meghan, who moved back to her hometown of Los Angeles after about 10 years away, what it was like to be back in the U.S. at this moment in time.",
            "“It was so sad to see where our country was in that moment,” Meghan said of returning to LA as the country was mourning the deaths of Black Americans like Taylor, George Floyd, and Ahmaud Arbery.",
            "“I think at the onset, if I’m being honest, it was just devastating,” the duchess added. “If there’s any silver lining in that, I would say that in the weeks after the murder of George Floyd, in the peaceful protests that you were seeing, in the voices that were coming out, in the way that people were actually owning their role and acknowledging their role ... I can see that the tide is turning.”",
            "“It’s not new to see this undercurrent of racism and certainly unconscious bias, but I think to see the changes that are being made right now is something I look forward to being a part of,” the duchess added. “And being a part of using my voice in a way that I haven’t been able to of late. So ― yeah, it’s good to be home.”",
            "The 19th* is a nonprofit, nonpartisan newsroom with a focus on the intersection of gender, politics and policy. The organization’s mission statement is “to empower women — particularly those underserved by and underrepresented in American media — with the information, community and tools they need to be equal participants in our democracy.”",
            "It gets its name from the 19th Amendment, which, rather than outright giving women the right to vote, guaranteed that states couldn’t bar people from voting due to their sex. This provided enough leeway for states to find ways to continue to disenfranchise women after the amendment was ratified.",
            "The asterisk in the newsroom’s name is meant to symbolize that, in effect, only white women were ensured the right to vote after the amendment was ratified, while Black women’s right to vote wasn’t solidified until after the Voting Rights Act passed in 1965. And as Ramshaw said during her talk with the duchess, voter suppression is still very alive and real.",

            "The duchess told Glamour magazine last week in a statement announcing her role and participation at the summit that she was looking forward to asking Ramshaw about “what it means to build a media outlet with gender equity, diversity, and community at its core.”",
            "Meghan added that “The 19th*’s commitment to reporting and storytelling that lifts up those who are too often underrepresented in the media has never been more important.”",
            "Ramshaw told CNN that the duchess’s participation in the summit was Meghan’s idea. Ramshaw said she “nearly fell out of my chair” after receiving a call from the Sussex team.",
            "“The duchess basically said that the issues that we care about are issues that she’s really interested in this moment,” Ramshaw told CNN, adding that “those things include super-high-quality media, gender equity, racial justice.”",
            "The Duke and Duchess of Sussex made it clear that they wanted to renegotiate their relationship with the media following their step back as working members of the royal family in January, and they’ve certainly followed through.",

            "Is it safe to drink from a water fountain during the pandemic?",
            "There’s no evidence you can get COVID-19 from the water itself. But since the virus may linger on surfaces, experts say to avoid fountains if you can or to limit any direct contact when using them.",
            "In New York City, for example, posters instruct people to use gloves or a tissue to turn on water fountains. If you don’t have those handy and need to touch the fountain, experts recommend you wash your hands afterward and avoid touching your face until you do. And you shouldn’t let your face touch the spout when leaning in for a drink.",
            "Filling a water bottle is also better than drinking directly from the fountain, says Angela Rasmussen, a virus researcher at Columbia University. That helps ensure you don’t leave saliva on the fountain, making it safer for others.",
            "The precautions are recommended because surfaces are believed to contribute to the spread of COVID-19, even though experts say the main way the virus spreads is through droplets people spray when they talk, cough or sneeze.",
            "To minimize direct contact with fountains, schools and businesses should encourage everyone to bring their own water from home, says the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Fountains should still be cleaned and sanitized for those who need to use them, the agency says.",
            "The CDC also says schools and businesses should check fountains for other safety issues before they reopen. Prolonged closures could increase the risk for Legionnaires’ and other diseases associated with water, since standing water in plumbing systems can cause bacteria to grow.",
            "Experts are still learning about the novel coronavirus. The information in this story is what was known or available as of press time, but it’s possible guidance around COVID-19 could change as scientists discover more about the virus.

            "Living through a global pandemic has messed with our mental and emotional health in countless ways. If you’re looking for ways to cope, consider starting a journal.",
            "Mental health professionals have long touted the benefits of journaling: It can alleviate stress and act as a tool to help manage anxiety and depression. That’s important right now given that the vast majority — 90% — of American adults report dealing with emotional distress related to COVID-19, according to a survey from researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Harvard Medical School. And people who dealt with mental health conditions before the pandemic may have a more difficult time handling the stress of this crisis, experts say.",
            "Meera Lee Patel, author of “Create Your Own Calm: A Journal for Quieting Anxiety,” said a journaling practice can help clear a cluttered mind.",
            "“Journaling is a great way to release stress and neutralize anxiety, allowing you to remove the thoughts that are continually cycling in your head by placing them onto paper,” she told HuffPost. “Many find that after journaling, their minds are clearer, calmer and better equipped to evaluate solutions for the issue at hand.”",
            "Many of us tend to ignore or suppress difficult emotions. Journaling helps us “get acquainted with” these feelings, psychotherapist Kathleen Dahlen deVos said, so we can process them and find ways to move forward.",
            "“[We] learn that while it may still be uncomfortable to tolerate and ‘be with’ our feelings, we actually have the capacity to handle them,” she said.",
            "Plus, journaling is practically free, making it more accessible than other forms of self-care. Lauren Donelson — a writer and yoga teacher who’s studying to be a therapist — said she’s been journaling for seven years and recommends it to almost all of the patients she sees.",
            "“I can’t afford therapy every day, but I can check in on my mental health every day by doing some stream-of-consciousness journaling,” she said. “It helps me structure my mornings. This sacred time alone each morning has become really important to me over the years. It helps me to connect to myself. If I complain about the same issue for two weeks in my journal, I eventually get sick of myself and do something about it.”",
            "Another advantage of regular journaling? It can help you spot patterns in your thoughts or behaviors that don’t serve you, connecting the dots between what you think and do and how you feel. Keeping a journal can also help you track progress on your goals and observe your personal growth.",
            "There may be benefits to documenting life during this significant moment in history, too",
            "Between COVID-19 uprooting our daily lives, George Floyd’s death spurring a moment of reckoning on race and an upcoming presidential election, 2020 is a tumultuous year by all accounts. While certain memories of the last five months may stick out to you now, they’ll begin to fade over time — if they haven’t already. Keeping a journal can also act as a time capsule of sorts for you to revisit down the road.",
            "“It’s incredibly useful both for us personally and on a historical level to keep a daily record of what goes on around us during difficult times,” author Ruth Franklin told The New York Times in April.",
            "In a Washington Post opinion piece, “Write It Down. Keep A Pandemic Journal,” Columbia University journalism professor Ari L. Goldman notes that chronicling this time on social media isn’t the same as keeping a journal.",
            "“Facebook and Instagram are a conversation. They are for others. A journal is for you,” he wrote. “You deserve a record. Write it down so you will remember how you got used to this — and how you got through this.”",
            "As humans, we are hard-wired to look for meaning in our experiences, Dahlen deVos said. It gives our lives a sense of purpose and order. Journaling during a difficult time like the one we’re living through can help us “find peace in and acceptance of challenging experiences and learn from them,” she said.",
            "“We all want to know that our lives matter, that our lived and shared experiences have meaning,” Dahlen deVos said. “Documenting this moment in history may help us find and create meaning in the fear, grief and overwhelm we might currently be experiencing, and offer a bit of soothing by contextualizing this moment in time in the greater arc of our lives and histories.”",
            "Here’s how to start journaling — and stick with it",
            "Use a pen and paper instead of keeping a digital journal.",
            "“I find that writing, as opposed to typing, helps slow us down a bit so we can be more intentional and reflective, and also activates a more creative area of the brain,” Dahlen deVos said.",
            "Donelson recommends writing in an inexpensive journal if you’re someone who can be overly precious about things.",
            "“While I love a good $30 Moleskin, I’ve noticed I am more afraid to write something ‘bad’ if I invested in a fancy notebook,” she said.",
            "Write stream of consciousness for 5 minutes. Then gradually add more time.",
            "With this type of journaling, “you try to write whatever is on your mind even if it doesn’t make sense,” Donelson said.",
            "Set a timer, put pen to paper and just let the words flow out without judgment.",
            "“This writing isn’t meant to be ‘good’ writing,” Donelson said. “You don’t even have to re-read it if you don’t want to! The point is to just get whatever is in your head out onto the page. I suggest starting with five or 10 minutes a day. If you enjoy it, go for 20 minutes.”",
            "Or use a prompt to get the juices flowing.",
            "“If a blank page seems intimidating to you, there are many journals with insightful prompts and exercises that can help you get started,” Patel said.",
            "You can find plenty of ideas online, too.",
            "Write at the same time every day if you can.",
            "Whether you do it right when you wake up, during your lunch break or before bed, it doesn’t matter. Choose a time and stick to it.",
            "“I’m a morning person, so journaling first thing in the morning works really well for me,” Donelson said.",
            "Remember that your journal is just for you.",
            "You don’t need to impress anyone with your writing — not even yourself.",
            "“I would suggest keeping your journal private and trying to be as honest and real with yourself as possible,” Donelson said.",
            "And if delving into certain subjects is too painful for you, don’t pressure yourself to keep writing. It’s OK to take a break or stop journaling altogether if it’s not working for you.",
            "“Experiencing symptoms of hypervigilance, stress or distress are signals to discontinue your journaling exercise,” University of Wisconsin psychologist Shilagh A. Mirgain told UW Health.",
            "Don’t worry if you skip a day.",
            "“Instead of beating yourself up for missing a day or two — or 12 — of journaling, which only creates more disappointment and resistance within you, simply begin again,” Patel said. “It takes time for our brains to create new neural pathways, which means that the desire to journal will often follow after you’ve already taken the initiative to begin journaling.”"

            "Linxin Wen — the 29-year-old CEO and co-founder of Chowbus, a delivery app that specializes in high-quality Asian cuisine — is intent on providing customers with access to authentic Asian food, and helping mom-and-pop shops break through a system designed to benefit larger chain restaurants. Chowbus does this by providing “dish-focused” delivery service from independent Asian eateries that might not garner much attention on the likes of GrubHub and UberEats. The perspective of Wen — himself an immigrant who moved to the United States seven years ago — is unique, as seen through the prism of this Voices in Food story, told to Anna Rahmanan.",
            "Most Americans who aren’t interested in authentic Asian food aren’t interested only because they don’t know about it. That’s why so many Asian restaurants have a separate menu they give Americans, featuring non-traditional dishes like “orange chicken” that Americans are more familiar with. They think they have to [do that] to survive.",
            "The reality is, Americans often love authentic Asian dishes once they’re introduced to them. Whenever I’ve brought American friends to eat at some obscure Chinese mom-and-pop restaurants they’ve never heard of and I’ve ordered for the table, everyone has loved it.",
            "Most of the time, they don’t know which dishes are good. That means that, too often, they order the same thing over and over again. For example, when they eat Chinese, they order chicken and broccoli. When they eat Thai, they order pad Thai — and so on. By taking the time to figure out what a restaurant’s four to five best dishes are and featuring those [on our app, alongside] professional photographs that help newcomers get a better sense of what the dish will look like, we help all kinds of people discover new flavors they otherwise wouldn’t have felt confident ordering.",
            "One of the biggest struggles for independent restaurants has been getting their name out there. That’s been a problem since long before the pandemic — and it’s one of the major reasons those restaurants sign on with big delivery services that promise to bring them droves of new customers. The problem is, too often those droves of new customers don’t materialize. That’s partly because, on most of the major apps, independent restaurants are deprioritized and pushed so far down in the feed that people can hardly find them. Or, sometimes, the delivery apps do bring in new customers but high commissions and other fees mean only a very small amount of that new revenue goes to the restaurant.",
            "We don’t allow big chains on the platform, only authentic, independently owned restaurants. We [also] don’t let restaurants pay to appear higher in our feed; it’s a flat rate for everyone. If you want to support your community and small businesses, you should order from an independently owned restaurant versus a big chain. Also, the food tends to be better, fresher and more authentic [at mom-and-pop eateries].",
            "A lot of our restaurant partners saw business fall off in the first month or two of the COVID-19 outbreak. But it’s hard to say if that was due to anti-Asian racism or just because people were afraid to eat out in general given the fear they’d catch the virus. In any case, business has rebounded for a lot of these restaurants, in many cases above and beyond where it was pre-COVID-19, so if there was a backlash, it’s long gone by now. Actually, some restaurants are making more money by just doing delivery. Asian food travels well and has a lot of variety, so I think it’s getting better — which is what I want to see.",
            "I came to the United States seven years ago to pursue my master’s degree and, through hard work and some luck, here I am today. Like many immigrants that come to the U.S. to pursue their dreams, I’ve faced challenges, whether direct or indirect, whether intentional or unintentional. My goal is to bring people together through food, whether that’s providing Asian immigrants with a sense of home through their favorite dim sum or introducing others to a new culture through Szechuan cuisine. My hope is that Chowbus can take a small part in bringing people together."

            "The man on the phone told her that he, his wife, and their three children, all Mexican immigrants like Cruz, were exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19. The man had it the worst. His feverish body ached. He could barely move. He didn’t have a car, but told her he was was willing to walk 20 miles to the nearest testing site, which was near Montgomery.",
            "But he needed Cruz’s help ensuring that he would have appointments for all five of them once the family arrived. No one at the testing site spoke Spanish, and he didn’t speak English. He also had questions: Did it cost anything? If so, he hadn’t worked in weeks, so would they take a payment plan? Do they require identification? He’s undocumented. Could getting tested lead to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid at their home?",
            "“I’ve never heard a man cry like that,” Cruz said.",
            "Across the South, advocates say state officials are routinely failing to provide services and public health information in Spanish, the United States’ second-most common language and the primary tongue of millions of people across the region. That failure has proven disastrous in a community that disproportionately works essential jobs, lives in multigenerational households and, in many cases, fears seeking medical care could jeopardize legal status or expose undocumented people to ICE.",
            "Tennessee, home to 322,000 Hispanic people, confirmed its first coronavirus case on March 5, but the state Department of Health didn’t roll out a Spanish-language website until July 22.",
            "North Carolina waited until July 16 to launch a Spanish COVID-19 website, despite a Hispanic population topping 1 million and Latinos suffering the highest infection rate of any minority in the state.",
            "Even Florida ― where Spanish predates English, more than one-quarter of the population is Latino and nearly 30% of the population speaks a language other than English at home ― offered scant Spanish-language materials as the virus spread across the state.",
            "‘No Se Habla’ Is Nothing New",
            "Latino immigration to the Deep South soared in the 1990s, and has continued to grow since. The Latino population in Alabama has, by the state’s own estimate, increased 208% in the past three decades.",
            "Between 2007 and 2014, counties in Alabama, Georgia and Louisiana experienced some of the country’s highest upticks in Latino population, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of Census data. Large percentages of those communities are foreign-born, including nearly half of Hispanics in Florida, 44% in Georgia and 37% in Alabama.",
            "Yet while some counties have expanded language services to accommodate those communities, many statewide efforts have focused on limiting undocumented immigrants’ access to public benefits.",
            "Alabama passed one of the nation’s most restrictive anti-immigrant laws in 2011, giving police vast leeway to interrogate any suspect’s legal status and barring the undocumented from using any state or local public services. Florida last year banned so-called “sanctuary cities” for undocumented immigrants. North Carolina’s Republican-dominated legislature, meanwhile, passed a bill last year forcing all county sheriffs to assist in ICE efforts to detain or deport immigrants.",
            "The United States has no official language. But 29 states have enacted laws or constitutional amendments making English the official language, according to a tally by language policy expert James Crawford. Of those, at least 10 are states in the Southeast, including Alabama, Georgia and the Carolinas.",
            "That rigid, ideological objection to accommodating the existing populations of the states left public officials unprepared to provide crisis information to residents in those communities, said Genesis Castro, a program manager at the Latino Community Fund of Georgia.",
            "“If the governments were already doing the outreach they needed before COVID, if they already did outreach with immigrants in mind, we wouldn’t be where we are,” Castro said by phone.",
            "Some Georgia counties, such as DeKalb and Fulton, have provided adequate information and translation at testing sites, she said, but the state effort is “very decentralized.”",
            "“We need to make sure there is more information available to all community members and provide translation services, whether it’s English to Spanish, Creole, Mandarin or Korean,” said Genny Castillo, a regional director at the nonprofit Southern Economic Advancement Project.",
            "The lack of outreach in Spanish has contributed to huge infection rates in many states. In Durham County, North Carolina, the Hispanic population’s share of overall COVID-19 infections increased from 7% in March to 15% in April to 70% in May before peaking at 75% in June, said Dr. Viviana Martinez-Bianchi, the director for health equity at Duke University’s community health department.",
            "Those figures demonstrated a disastrous cycle, she said. Latinos working essential jobs faced greater exposure to the virus early on, then came home to households where children, grandparents and cousins may live under one roof. In mixed-status households, where some family members fear any interaction with law enforcement could risk arrest and deportation, going to a testing site where a local sheriff was directing traffic or seeking help at a hospital seemed like a threat. That not only hastened the virus’s spread, but caused in many cases deadly delays in treatment.",
            "“People are still arriving too late, when the disease is too advanced,” Martinez-Bianchi said.",
            "Public service announcements that allayed those concerns and communicated what to do in plain, spoken Spanish could dispel those rumors and make clear that immigration status would not be checked at testing sites or hospitals.",
            "Not Just Spanish",
            "Cruz said the risk of ICE arrest remains one of the most commonly asked questions she gets on the hotline. She’s done her best to ease those worries. But there are more troubling problems.",
            "In some places where written Spanish information is provided, the language is too complex and requires a baseline understanding of health science to make sense to the average reader. Many immigrants from Central and South America who have called the hotline, speak indigenous dialects as their primary language, and cannot read or communicate easily in Spanish or English.",
            "The lack of Spanish speakers at testing sites also leaves advocates like her in the awkward position of trying to translate by phone when they get to the appointments she helped them set up. That was the case with the man who walked 20 miles to get to a testing site. He kept her on the line to translate the entire interaction.",
            "It’s a heavy burden for volunteer hotline operators and organizations whose budgets are already stretched thin providing services amid an economic depression.",
            "Cruz’s group, the ACIJ, has spent its entire $50,000 emergency fund ― normally reserved for helping families separated by ICE raids ― on food and emergency financial aid to those in need. She said it expects the fund to be depleted this week. The group is now holding fundraisers and applying for grants.",
            "“I tear up sometimes,” she said. “The whole experience has been very humbling.”",

            "Five months into the COVID-19 pandemic, people are very much testing the waters when it comes to travel. While RV rentals and short-distance road trips are on the rise, many travelers are also making longer journeys and staying overnight away from home. This has led to a common question: Is it safer to stay at a hotel or rental property like an Airbnb in the coronavirus era?",
            "For starters, experts are strongly advising against any unnecessary travel during this time, particularly given the outbreaks in various hotspots throughout the U.S.",
            "“I still do not think that people should be traveling and should really try to stay home,” said Krutika Kuppalli, an infectious diseases physician and vice chair of the IDSA Global Health Committee.",
            "“Avoid travel as much as possible,” advised Jagdish Khubchandani, a professor of health science at Ball State University.",
            "But, if you must make the trip, the answer to your lodging question depends on a number of factors and requires some personal research.",
            "“As we have learned during this COVID-19 pandemic, there is really no absolutely safe haven,” said Daniel Berliner, a physician at the virtual health platform PlushCare. “Life’s realities, however, do and will include venturing away from the relative safety of one’s home. When in a necessary travel situation, taking the steps to make where you stay clean and safe will lead to peace of mind and markedly reduce the risk of becoming ill as a result of your trip and your hotel or Airbnb/home rental stay.”",
            "Below, health experts offer their advice for determining if a hotel or Airbnb is the best way to go during the pandemic ― and explain how to mitigate the risks involved in either choice.",
            "Assess the facility’s policies.",
            "“When deciding to stay at a hotel vs. an Airbnb, I would think about things like cancellation policies, cleaning policies, how they handle things like what happens if the prior individual or group staying there is found to have COVID-19,” said Kuppalli.",
            "Another thing to check is how much time the hotel room or rental property stands empty in between guests. Many hotels and rental property owners keep spaces vacant for a number of days after a guest checks out for extra protection.",
            "“You want to make sure you understand what the cleaning, disinfection and infection prevention policies are for the facility and what they types of precautions they are taking,” Kuppalli said.",
            "Many believe that major hotel chains have an advantage due to greater accountability, regulations and published policies.",
            "“Public health at a hotel is regulated by the health department, and cleaning will likely be more detailed, especially in chains with multiple locations,” said Brian Labus, a professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas’ School of Public Health. “Home rentals do not have this same level of oversight. Major chains have also been very open about the steps they are taking to protect their guests, and you often find detailed plans on their websites. You just won’t find this in a home rental.”",
            "Still, Airbnb has taken steps to adopt COVID-19 compliant cleanliness standards and urging individual property owners to work toward those standards.",
            "“As we are all human, we know breakdowns can occur ― whether it be in a hotel corporate operation with large numbers of employees or in an Airbnb/home rental environment with owners having different backgrounds and levels of maintenance skills,” Berliner said.",
            "Consider the number of people you’ll encounter.",
            "“Hotels can be riskier due to larger number of people moving around,” said Khubchandani. “They cannot force people to stay at a distance in elevators, around the lobby, near the check-in counter, etc.”",
            "Hotels have attempted to mitigate these risks with measures like virtual check-in, elevator capacity limits and spaced out lines. Still, you can’t deny that there are more humans around ― from staff to visitors to fellow guests.",
            "“If you are the only guest in a home rental, you will only have contact with other people when you leave,” said Labus. “A hotel will have more guests and you may come in contact with more of them.”",
            "Analyze your health situation.",
            "As with any decision about leaving home during the COVID-19 pandemic, it’s important to assess your personal health situation.",
            "“Lodging is just one piece of the puzzle, so if you are concerned about protecting yourself from COVID, you need to look at your entire agenda and consider your individual health status,” said Labus. “If you have recently recovered from a COVID infection and are immune (at least temporarily), you will evaluate things differently than if you are older and have a number of high-risk conditions.”",
            "You should also consider if others in your household are at risk of developing complications if they contract the coronavirus. Your exposure could put them in harm’s way as well.",
            "Come and go at “off peak” hours.",
            "If you do decide to make the trip and stay in a hotel or Airbnb, there are ways to mitigate the risks involved.",
            "“In regards to the number of people in and out of a building at a hotel, those are things you can try to mitigate by arriving and leaving at ‘off peak’ hours,” Kuppalli said.",
            "This lowers the number of people likely to be in the lobby or elevator around the same time as you.",
            "Wear a mask and keep your distance.",
            "“All standard precautions for COVID-19 must be followed rigorously,” said Khubchandani. “Stay at a distance from others, wash your hands more often, carry a sanitizer, use sanitizers available around hotel and property, don’t touch your face much, wear a mask, don’t take support of surface, don’t touch many objects, e.g., on check-in counter, etc.”",
            "Berliner advised treating your hotel or home rental as you would your own home where visitors are only allowed when they meet your standards for mask-wearing, social distancing and self-quarantine.",
            "“You need to use these same standards, that you require for your guests, while you reside in your newly cleaned and safe hotel room or home rental,” he said.",
            "“I would be particularly careful when in elevators and would make sure to wear a mask,” advised Kuppalli. “If you are touching the elevator buttons, make sure to use hand sanitizer after doing so, or use something like a pen or pencil to choose your floor. I would also be careful in communal locations inside where the ventilation is not good. If eating at restaurants in hotels, I would try to eat outside rather than inside.”",
            "Ensure accountability.",
            "“For the actual individual traveler, we need to ensure that the place we stay, whether a hotel or Airbnb/home rental, feels and looks clean,” Berliner noted. “If not, make the management aware and have them fix any shortfalls. You can always change stay locations if your comfort level is not met.”",
            "If you arrive at a hotel or Airbnb and something doesn’t look like it’s been cleaned and sanitized, Berliner advised alerting management or the homeowner so that they are aware and can address it.",
            "Sanitize surfaces and yourself.",
            "“I recommend that you take your own disinfecting wipes with you and regardless of where you stay that you clean down high-touch surfaces when you get to where you are staying,” Kuppalli said. “This would include door handles, light switches, closet doors, faucets, counters, remotes, telephones, curtain rods, drawer handles. I would also have hand sanitizer with you so you can make sure to constantly clean your hands and have masks to protect yourself when in public spaces.”",
            "Khubchandani added that you should shower regularly when entering the property from the outside and also give yourself a thorough cleaning after you return home.",
            "Take precautions when you leave your lodging.",
            "No matter where you decide to stay, the biggest risk occurs when you leave your accommodations for meals or other activities. The fact that you are traveling doesn’t exempt you from taking the same protective steps you take at home.",
            "“The greatest risk of infection comes from being in close contact with other people, especially if they are not wearing masks,” Labus noted. “Staying in a hotel or home rental is only part of the travel process, and you have to consider more than just your lodging when it comes to protecting yourself. It doesn’t matter where you stay if you have multiple high-risk exposures as soon as you leave your room. If you will be participating in large group gatherings where social distancing rules are rarely followed, the risk from your lodging is not the main concern.”",

            "Dozens of stores, banks and other businesses were broken into and burglarized. More than 100 people were arrested and at least 13 officers were injured, according to police. The unrest followed an officer-involved shooting on Sunday.",
            "Democratic Mayor Lori Lightfoot described the overnight chaos as an “assault on our city,” and called on state prosecutors to hold those involved accountable.",
            "“This had nothing to do with legitimate, protected First Amendment expression,” Lightfoot said during a news conference Monday morning. “What occurred in our downtown and surrounding communities was abject criminal behavior, pure and simple.”",
            "“These were not poor people engaged in petty theft to feed themselves and their families,” she added. “This was straight-up felony criminal conduct.”",
            "Looting in Chicago’s Magnificent Mile shopping district and other areas of the city’s downtown area began around 11:30 p.m. Sunday, police said.",
            "Video captured by local reporters and bystanders showed people breaking windows to enter and burglarize various stores, including a Nordstrom, Best Buy, Pandora and 7-Eleven. Some individuals who participated in the looting could be seen piling into cars with stolen goods and fleeing the scene.",
            "Photos of the vandalism showed anti-police graffiti in some areas.",
            "Authorities believe the looting may be connected to an officer-involved shooting that occurred in the city’s Englewood neighborhood on Sunday afternoon, Chicago Police Superintendent Dan Brown said during the news conference Monday.",
            "Officers had responded to a report of a man with a gun, Brown said. The suspect, a 20-year-old man, allegedly fled the scene when officers approached him. The suspect allegedly fired a gun at the officers as he was running away, and police returned fire and struck him. The suspect was transported to a hospital and is expected to survive his injuries, Brown said.",
            "The shooting wasn’t captured on police body cameras, a spokeswoman for the Chicago Police Department told reporters Sunday afternoon.",
            "Earl Allen, the brother of the suspect, has disputed the police’s account of the altercation. Allen told The Chicago Sun-Times that he and his brother had been walking with a group of people when one of the individuals made a comment to officers in a police vehicle, prompting a pursuit.",
            "Police released a photo of the gun they allegedly obtained from the suspect, but Allen denied that it belonged to his brother.",
            "Following the shooting, there was a “very intense interaction” between police at the scene and a crowd that had gathered nearby, Brown said Monday.",
            "Social media posts shared in the wake of the shooting encouraged people to loot downtown later that night, Brown said. Police dispatched about 400 officers to the areas expected to be targeted.",
            "Some of the stores damaged overnight were still in the process of recovering from looting that occurred during the nationwide anti-racism protests following the death of George Floyd in police custody in May.",
            "But city officials rejected any suggestions that the most recent looting was part of a similar protest. Brown said what unfolded was “pure criminality” and “violence against police.”",

            "At one point early Monday, shots were fired at officers from a passing vehicle while they were arresting suspected looters downtown, police said. Officers returned fire, Brown said. No officers were injured. It wasn’t immediately clear if anyone inside the vehicle was struck by gunfire.",
            "As the unrest unfolded overnight, authorities tried to cut off access to the downtown area by closing streets, raising bridges and asking the Chicago Transit Authority to halt service. By late Monday morning, CTA service had resumed and bridges were lowered. Some streets remained closed.",
            "Downtown access will be restricted from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. until further notice, and there will be an increased police presence in the area, Brown said during the news conference Monday morning.",
            "Rumors circulated that the unrest was sparked by the police killing of a 15-year-old boy on Sunday, but officials denied such claims, calling them “blatant misinformation.” The origin of this unsubstantiated theory is unclear.",

But the couple’s official matchmaker for their first blind date is still an enigma.",
            "“Despite reports that Violet Von Westenholz had set up the date, it was mostly Meghan’s pals Misha Nonoo and Markus Anderson who were in on the first meeting,” says a passage in the book, seen by HuffPost. Nonoo is a fashion designer, and Anderson is the global membership director of Soho House.",
            "The authors added: “The couple themselves prefer to keep the story of their matchmaker a mystery, even to close friends” and that “Meghan’s only clue to pals at the time was that her first encounter with Harry was ‘serendipitous.’”",
            "A short time later, Harry got down on one knee to pop the question. Meghan called the proposal “just an amazing surprise” in an interview with the BBC after the engagement announcement on Nov. 27, 2017.",

            "So much has changed since the first cases of the coronavirus emerged in the United States earlier this year, with masks and social distancing now becoming the norm of everyday life (or they should be, anyway). But perhaps the most fluid part of the pandemic has been in trying to understand and predict the virus’ life span to begin with.",
            "“This is such a complex disease that even immunologists can’t fully know everything about it,” said Christine Bishara, an internal medicine physician and founder of From Within Medical in New York.",
            "One of the areas that’s been confusing most recently is COVID-19 antibodies ― proteins found in the blood that signal if you’ve had a past infection and therefore have built up immunity from the virus. Here, experts explain how the knowledge around antibodies has changed, how accurate tests are and what the latest research behind antibodies tells us about a future vaccine.",
            "Antibodies do disappear, but it’s completely normal",
            "“When our body is exposed to a virus, it goes through a very complex immune response, which includes different types of cells including B cells and T cells,” Bishara said. T cells help regulate the activity of B cells, while it’s the B cells that produce the antibodies that attach to cells that have been infected by a virus.",
            "However, these antibodies take time to appear once you’ve been infected with any virus, including the coronavirus.",
            "“It typically takes one to three weeks to see antibodies,” said Steven Schnur, a cardiologist and internist at Mount Sinai Medical in Miami and founder of Imhealthytoday.org, a doctor-designed program for helping workplaces reopen from the pandemic safely. “Once they do appear, antibodies tend to wane after three months.”",
            "But this doesn’t mean that once antibodies start vanishing you’re no longer immune to the coronavirus. That’s because those B cells and T cells that have been created in response to the virus have long-lasting memory and immunity, regardless of what your antibody levels drop to, Schnur said.",
            "Many who may have been ‘reinfected’ with coronavirus likely never recovered in the first place",
            "Right now, experts say it’s pretty unlikely that you can catch the virus again after you’ve recovered.",
            "“There are a lot of anecdotal stories, but research has not found any individuals that have been truly reinfected,” Schnur said. “When people get sick again after six weeks or two months it’s really the same virus and same initial infection that has lingered longer than 10 days.”",
            "Viruses can tend to be dormant for a bit, which can make them more drawn out symptomatically, Bishara added. This is supported even further in the characteristics behind those T cells and B cells.",
            "“When the body generates an immune response [to a virus], T cells remember in case of a possibility of future reinfection, so that if presented with the virus again your body recognizes it and knows how to handle it,” Bishara said.",
            "Antibody testing seems like a good idea in theory, but may not be entirely accurate",
            "There are a few flaws in antibody testing that are now coming to light. First, there were a number of antibody tests that shipped to labs and medical offices in the U.S. without any review from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Results of the tests varied, making it impossible to confidently tell patients whether they had antibodies.",
            "But even antibody tests currently on the market aren’t as accurate as the medical community would like to see.",
            "“A majority of antibody tests are checking for B cell types, specifically the antibodies immunoglobulins G (IgG) and M (IgM),” Bishara said. “Those are the ones that usually appear after an infection, but they take some time to do so. Part of the problem comes from when an antibody test is given, because if the body hasn’t developed these antibodies yet, the test may come back as a false negative.”",
            "Those who are asymptomatic may also have an issue when it comes to testing because the body isn’t launching as big of an immune response as someone who presents with more severe symptoms. A small study from China published in the journal Nature Medicine found that 40% of patients who were asymptomatic or had very mild symptoms and tested positive for the virus did not show any antibodies in the blood.",
            "“For someone to think that they can walk around without proper precautions because they have antibodies is inaccurate,” Schnur said. “Whether or not you think you have antibody levels, you still need to social distance and wear a mask.”",
            "However, if you’re still set on getting an antibody test, Schnur recommends one done as a finger stick (and double-check that it’s not on the FDA’s “removed” list). If you get a positive test, do another one at a different lab to confirm.",
            "“Only if you have two positive results from two different labs is the positive predictive value over 90 or 95%,” he said.",
            "Decreased antibody levels in the body won’t affect the efficacy of a vaccine",
            "Vaccines in general have a sliding scale of longevity depending on the type of disease it’s for, Bishara said. Diseases like smallpox and polio have been essentially eradicated with a single vaccine dose, while the flu vaccine is required every year. Just because the coronavirus antibody levels may decrease over time doesn’t mean a vaccine won’t be effective. It all comes down to whether the virus is able to mutate.",
            "“When it comes to the flu, someone may still get the flu even if they’ve gotten their flu shot because of its ability to change,” Schnur said, “though that person may not suffer symptomatically the same as someone who didn’t get the vaccine at all.”",
            "Since the coronavirus is still so new, it’s impossible to know how much it will modify itself. But Schnur said as of right now it looks like it doesn’t mutate as fast or as often as something like influenza, meaning a vaccine would be effective longer.",
            "“A vaccine may not give us lifetime immunity, but it will probably last several years,” he said.",
            "Experts are still learning about the coronavirus. The information in this story is what was known or available as of press time, but it’s possible guidance around COVID-19 could change as scientists discover more about the virus. Please check the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the most updated recommendations."

            "One police officer was killed and dozens of people hurt in the confrontations, which played out in streets that were wrecked from Tuesday’s blast at the port that devastated much of the city and killed nearly 160 people. Dozens were still missing and nearly 6,000 people injured.",
            "The disaster has taken popular anger to a new level in a country already reeling from an unprecedented economic and financial crisis and near bankruptcy.",
            "Activists who called for the protest set up symbolic nooses at Beirut’s Martyrs’ Square to hang politicians whose corruption and negligence they blame for the explosion.",
            "The blast was fueled by thousands of tons of ammonium nitrate that had been improperly stored at the port for more than six years. Apparently set off by a fire, the explosion was by far the biggest in Lebanon’s troubled history and caused an estimated $10 billion to 15 billion in damage, according to Beirut’s governor. It also damaged 6,200 buildings and left hundreds of thousands of people homeless.",
            "“Resignation or hang,” read a banner held by protesters, who also planned to hold a symbolic funeral for the dead. Some nooses were also set up along the bridges outside the port.",

Some also entered the environment ministry.",

Near parliament, protesters tried to jump over barriers that closed the road leading to the legislature.

We want the death of the old Lebanon and the birth of a new one,” said Tarek, a 23-year-old university student who had prepared a mix of water and paint in a bottle to throw at the police. No peaceful protest would bring about change, he said.",
            "Sandy Chlela, a 35-year old from Kousba in the north, disagreed with Tarek. She said she had no illusion that the protests would bring change, but the demonstrations were a necessary expression of anger and puts some pressure on the politicians.",

            "The candidate, Matt Lieberman, is a lawyer, former educator and the son of former Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman. Lieberman is running in the all-party special election to replace Sen. Johnny Isakson, who retired in 2018.",
            "Lieberman told HuffPost he wrote the book, titled “Lucius” after the name of the imaginary slave, in the wake of the 2017 white nationalist violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, as “an honest examination of enduring racism against Blacks — which is real, harmful and totally infuriating.”",
            "The main character, an elderly white southern man named Benno, regularly deploys the N-word and says some members of the Ku Klux Klan were “basically good people.” The 213-page novel, in which the racist main character tells the story of his life to a narrator with a biography similar to Lieberman’s, ultimately suggests Lucius functioned as a sort of pet for Benno.",
            "“I know my approach to this delicate subject is not palatable for every reader,” Lieberman wrote in a statement. “I expected some readers to react with disgust.”",
            "On that front, Lieberman was right. James Woodall, the president of the state NAACP chapter, told HuffPost in a phone interview the book contained “racist tropes.” He said Lieberman should drop out of the Senate race.",
            "“In my personal opinion, this would just exacerbate a tough time for us as a state. He should drop out of the race,” Woodall said. “If he wants to be an author or a writer, he should just do that.”",
            "Lieberman is one of two prominent Democrats running in the all-party primary, which is set for Election Day and also features two high-profile Republicans. If no candidate earns a majority of the vote ― the likely outcome ― the race will be decided by a January runoff between the top two vote-getters.",
            "There are four major candidates in the race. Two well-known Republicans, Sen. Kelly Loeffler and Rep. Doug Collins, have already spent millions of dollars attacking each other. But polling indicates Lieberman and the other Democratic candidate, Rev. Raphael Warnock, remain little-known in the state.",
            "Democratic leaders, including Stacey Abrams and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, have endorsed Warnock, who is Black.",
            "One of the epigraphs Lieberman chose for Lucius is a famous passage from James Baldwin’s “I Am Not Your Negro”: “What white people have to do is try and find out in their own hearts why it is necessary to have a ‘[N-word]’ in the first place, because I’m not a [N-word]. I’m a man. But if you think I’m a [N-word], it means you need it.” (The quote appears in the epigraph without expurgations.) “Lucius” seems to be Lieberman’s response, an attempt to promote racial healing by trying to understand why white people have enslaved, disenfranchised and dehumanized Black people.",
            "In his statement, Lieberman testified to his good intentions: “However my book is dissected, let me be clear: my heart’s aim was to get people thinking about the centuries long scourge of slavery and racism and its impact in modern America. I was alarmed and deeply discouraged by what I saw in Charlottesville ― so much so that I wrote these 45,000 words as a response in story form.”",
            "No amount of good intentions, however, would be enough to rescue “Lucius.” The book’s narrator, Mordecai “Tree” Weissman, is a middle-aged white Jewish man from Connecticut who lives in Atlanta in 2017, much like Lieberman. While volunteering at a nursing home in 2015, he meets Benno Johnson, a 90-year-old white man who believes that he owned a slave named Lucius for most of his life, despite the fact that slavery was abolished well before his birth. Most of the novel takes the form of Benno recalling his life with Lucius to Tree, describing how his parents “gave” him Lucius when both men were boys, and how the two spent their lives together before Lucius’ death.",
            "Benno characterizes Lucius not only as cheerful and obedient, “like my pup” and a “damned good slave,” but as having a supernatural ability to communicate with animals and insects, and to give Benno the power of comprehension by holding his hand. In fact, Benno claims, Lucius believes that Black people evolved along with the rest of the animal kingdom and sit at the top of the food chain, and white people evolved separately. Because they evolved along with the rest of the animals, he explains, “the Negro is connected in like a soul way to all those critters and all those animals he’s passed on through.”",
            "Depicting Black people as having a closer connection to the animal kingdom and as having mystical powers they can impart to white protagonists is a textbook example of the magical Negro trope, in which Black characters are portrayed as vessels for wisdom or supernatural powers that can provide enlightenment or aid to white protagonists.",
            "Woodall specifically pointed to the portrayal of Lucius as a magical Negro as “troubling.”",
            "“If this is his imagination, if this is how he constructs a world, where he’s a white savior and he needs a magical Negro to help save him, I would urge him to reconsider his place in this world,” Woodall said.",
            "Lucius’ own words, as performed by Benno, are written in a broad, stereotypical dialect. In one scene, Benno describes him making conversation with the moon: “‘How is you up there, Mistuh Moon?’ ... And then maybe he’d say something like ‘What did da sun say to da moon? No ... that’s not right, Mistuh Moon. Mistuh Sun said “wake up!” to da moon.’ And then he’d quietly laugh again. ‘Gotcha, Mistuh Moon. I gotcha on dat one.’”",
            "Lucius is ultimately killed by a hunter with a bow and arrow, shot through the neck while he and Benno are running through the man’s property with a herd of deer. After he dies, and Benno says an emotional goodbye, he tells Tree, “one of the first things I thought was that it was legal. Schiffer had the right. We were deer, and he was allowed to hunt us.”",
            "Tree frequently interjects with his own musings on race. Though he takes pains to distance himself from Benno’s more troubling statements, his own views are also packed with racial stereotypes and appeals to colorblindness. In one passage, he remembers playing basketball with friends during his childhood in New Haven, describing himself and his white neighbor as “the more skilled shooters, more technique oriented defenders and rebounders,” while their Black playmates were “faster, jumped higher, and were slightly ― only slightly ― more aggressive.” He then reveals that one of his Black friends ended up serving time in prison.",
            "Though Tree sometimes expresses discomfort internally with Benno’s more overly racist statements, he consistently excuses them. He even reasons, during Benno’s sympathetic description of the Klan, that a Black aide at the old age home who overheard the conversation probably “cut Benno some slack as a resident and an old man; that’s the world he came up in.” Tree upholds Benno as a charming and warm-hearted person, if emotionally stunted. Tree quickly begins to like Benno, who he describes as having “a spark in his eye that would appeal to anyone” and having “carried the sweetness of childhood with him all this way.”",
            "Benno is also presented as admirable for his sincere affection for Lucius and the more genteel words in which he expresses his racist beliefs.",
            "Though Benno does admit to demeaning treatment like having Lucius sleep on a pallet on the floor throughout his life, his conception of himself as a mythical good slave owner is rarely challenged in the book. Tree believes that he not only lacked racial animus, but “loved Lucius”; in a scene near the end of the book, and the end of their long lives, Benno tells Lucius, “You know I wouldn’t want to keep you if you wanted to go, right?” Lucius and Benno hold hands and call each other “brother.” This framing perpetuates the harmful idea that slavery could be practiced in a gentle and mutually beneficial way, whitewashing the reality of a system of violent, terroristic subjugation.",
            "Tree also theorizes that Benno “secretly crave[d] the validation of that happy submission from our loved ones ― be they spouses or children or, as a last resort and most typically, a dog or a cat?” The idea of the slave, according to this argument, is to fulfill the same human emotional need as a pet.",
            "In his statement, Lieberman defended his novel as “not palatable” because of “the sorts of racism reflected in ‘Lucius.’” However, it is ultimately a romanticized portrayal of white supremacy. Benno, Tree believes, “filled the world he made with a love for Lucius, which he imagined to be reciprocal. If Lucius wasn’t real in our world, and if Benno loved him and was loved by him in the only world in which the friendship lived, well, it’s hard for me to get upset.”"

            "More than 900 workers at a single meatpacking plant in South Dakota were infected with the coronavirus over the course of just five weeks, showing how quickly it can rip through an essential workforce toiling away in close quarters.",
            "Those numbers come from a report released Thursday examining the Smithfield pork facility in Sioux Falls, which was home to one of the worst COVID-19 clusters in the country this spring. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state officials studied the outbreak to learn how it got so out of control.",
            "The CDC report shows the outbreak was somewhat worse than previously believed. State officials had earlier put the total number of infections at 853, according to the Argus Leader. The actual number was 929, which translates into one of every four workers at the 3,635-person plant.",
            "At the peak of the outbreak, the workforce was averaging 67 new cases a day. Two workers eventually died. In addition to the cases among employees, at least 210 contacts of workers contracted the virus. In total, 39 workers and nine contacts ended up hospitalized.",
            "The CDC did not openly criticize Smithfield for its handling of the crisis and did not name the company in its report. But the findings suggest the pork producer was slow to deal with the situation and didn’t put many controls in place until it was too late.",
            "The researchers concluded that what happened at the Sioux Falls plant shows how the coronavirus “can spread rapidly in meat processing facilities because of the close proximity of workstations and prolonged contact between employees.” Employers need to have “a robust mitigation program ... consistent with published guidelines” in order to mitigate the spread of the virus.",
            "Keira Lombardo, a Smithfield executive vice president, said in a statement that the company’s coronavirus response has “focused exclusively” on keeping employees safe and maintaining the food supply. She said the company took “aggressive action” that preceded the guidance on meatpacking safety released by the federal government in late April.",
            "Lombardo also said so many cases were detected at the plant because of a “significantly disproportionate testing rate.” The CDC report acknowledged that workers at the Sioux Falls facility were tested at a higher rate than the community at large.",
            "Nationally, the coronavirus has hit the largely immigrant workforces inside meat and poultry plants particularly hard. So far, at least 65 workers have died and more than 14,000 have been infected or exposed to the virus, according to estimates from the United Food and Commercial Workers union, which represents workers at many plants.",
            "Workers at meatpacking plants across the country have reported laboring practically shoulder to shoulder even during the pandemic. The CDC found that the “attack rate” ― the proportion of people in a given population infected with the virus ― was highest in departments where people could not work at least six feet apart.",
            "Not surprisingly, hourly workers were nearly twice as likely to be infected as salaried workers inside the Smithfield plant. The latter, researchers wrote, “typically had workstations that could be adjusted to maintain distancing and did not work in close proximity to other employees on the production line.”",
            "Showing just how rapidly the outbreak escalated, researchers found that the attack rate throughout the facility increased fivefold each week during the first three weeks. After Smithfield temporarily shuttered the plant, the rate of new infections dropped significantly among workers, to roughly 10 per day within a week.",
            "The study’s authors said that the virus likely spread in non-work areas of the plant as well, like locker and break rooms, and that workers may also have transmitted it to one another while carpooling or living together. They cautioned that whether a given worker contracted the virus inside the plant or out in the community could not be known. The Rapid City Journal reported that the Smithfield plant accounted for about 41% of coronavirus cases within the community during that time.",
            "The first known worker to get sick developed symptoms on March 16. By March 28, around two dozen other workers showed signs of the coronavirus. Smithfield did not begin screening employees for fever and installing barriers inside the plant until April 3. By April 4, there were more than 240 cases in 23 different departments at the plant.",
            "The CDC changed its guidance to recommend people wear a mask in public on April 3, which is the same day Smithfield first made them optional at the plant, according to the report. But the company did not make masks mandatory until April 13, weeks after the outbreak first emerged.",
            "By then, the facility was already beginning a phased closure that would stop production for several weeks.",
            "It was not until April 26 that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, in conjunction with the CDC, released guidance for meatpacking plants on how to contain the virus. They suggested protocols like installing barriers, staggering break times and encouraging face coverings. The guidance was not enforceable by law.",
            "Smithfield reopened the Sioux Falls plant on May 7."

            "NEW YORK ― A chain-link fence runs along 20th Avenue through northwest Queens. To the South are blocks of brick multifamily homes, where grandmothers tend fig trees in verdant front yards and proud immigrant parents celebrate high school graduations with gaudy banners hung from balconies. North of the fence, power plants burn the oil and natural gas that feeds New York City’s insatiable thirst for electricity.",
            "That fence is about to become a battle line in the fight over the city’s energy future.",
            "One of the companies on the complex, NRG Energy, has quietly revived plans to replace its 50-year-old oil-burning generators with new gas-fired units, part of a $1.5 billion makeover the utility giant says will allow it to comply with state pollution rules while meeting electricity demand.",
            "But the new cadre of climate-change hard-liners who unseated incumbents in this summer’s primary wants to upend that. The group of more than half a dozen campaigned for the New York State Legislature on platforms that included shutting down fossil fuel generation and bringing private utilities under government control.",
            "“This is what it means to live out your belief in the Green New Deal,” said Zohran Mamdani as he squinted through the fence on a sunny recent Saturday morning. The 28-year-old democratic socialist unseated 10-year incumbent Assemblywoman Aravella Simotas in the Democratic primary for the 36th Assembly District last month.",
            "New York City’s roughly 15 “peaker” plants ― which produce extra generating capacity when the city’s demand eclipses the regular supply, like during a heatwave ― are aging, and they run primarily on oil and gas. As the city looks to shrink its output of planet-heating gases, the plants seem like low-hanging fruit.",
            "The peakers are used infrequently but are expensive. The stations run for an average of 6% of the year, or about 500 hours, the clean-energy research group Strategen Consulting estimated. The city paid the plants’ owners $4.5 billion from 2010 to 2019 just to keep the units on standby, according to another analysis, from the newly formed PEAK Coalition, an alliance of five clean-energy and environmental justice groups. The vast majority ― $3.9 billion ― went to three out-of-state companies: Houston-based NRG, the Boston-based private equity fund ArcLight Capital and New Jersey-based private equity firm LS Power Group.",
            "Some of the peaker plants are more than 50 years old. State regulators estimate the older combustion turbines emit at least 30 times more nitrogen oxide, a smog-causing gas that causes respiratory problems, than do new units.",
            "Air quality concerns are particularly acute in western Queens. The area, belted with highways and rimmed by power plants, already suffers higher rates of tiny but dangerous air pollution particles, known as particulate matter 2.5, that lodge in soft lung tissue and trigger asthma and cancer. The blocks that slope down toward the utility complex in Astoria have long been known as “Asthma Alley.”",
            "Power companies say those concerns highlight the need to update old oil-fired peakers with new, more efficient gas-burning models. NRG also pointed to the tropical storm that battered New York last Tuesday, causing the worst outages since 2012′s Superstorm Sandy.",
            "The primary election added new political star power to that fight. State Senate nominee Jabari Brisport and Assembly hopeful Marcela Mitaynes ― two democratic socialists and activists whose districts overlap with a separate project in Brooklyn’s Gowanus neighborhood ― won stunning upsets, securing the Democratic slot on ballots that haven’t gone for Republicans in generations. Both candidates last week joined a rally outside the Gowanus plant to demand a stop to the gas repowering.",
            "“We shouldn’t be building any new fossil fuel infrastructure,” Brisport said by phone Friday. “The fact that these peakers are trying to expand their footprint just flies in the face of our attempts to decarbonize our economy.”",
            "Brisport and other opponents say building new gas units guarantees their use for decades to come, making it harder and more expensive to end the city’s dependence on fossil fuels.",
            "But renewables like wind and solar aren’t viable on their own. The sun doesn’t always shine, and wind is intermittent. And the city has limited space to build out the number of solar panels and turbines that would be needed to match the generating capacity of a fuel-burning peaker. That is what makes battery storage appealing. Last October, the state utility regulator approved construction of a 316-megawatt battery at the LS Power-owned Ravenswood Generating Station in Long Island City, the Queens neighborhood just south of Astoria. Once completed, the unit will be the largest utility battery in the state, and the first major foray into energy storage in the Northeast.",
            "New York is aiming to build 1,500 megawatts of battery storage by 2025 as part of its efforts to adhere to a major new climate law passed last year. The legislation, known as the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, or CLCPA, mandated that New York generate 100% of its electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040. Meanwhile, battery technologies “have been proven and prices have come down,” said Dennis Wamsted, an analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.",
            "“You could make a very good argument that we should be replacing the oil-fired peakers and most of the gas ones with storage,” Wamsted said by phone. “It is totally within the realm of possibility to make it happen.”",
            "Fears Over Reliability",
            "But the law doesn’t bar new fossil fuel construction outright and remains open-ended about how to reach its targets. The New York Independent System Operator, the nonprofit that manages the state’s electrical grid, warned last year that a system devoid of fossil fuels is significantly more fragile. When a single fossil fuel plant goes down, its outage generally doesn’t impair the ability of other plants to burn fuels and produce electricity.",
            "“On the contrary, individual wind and solar generators may be simultaneously affected by regional weather conditions, such as extended periods of low wind,” NYISO concluded in its 2020 Power Trends report.",
            "Storage resources, meanwhile, “are currently limited in their ability to supply the grid for such durations on a daily basis due, in part, to the time needed for recharging,” it said.",
            "“To ensure reliability, you need to have some kind of system that will turn on very quickly to meet those peak load hours in case the wind dies or clouds reduce the amount of solar output,” Casey Kopp, a regional power market analyst at the energy research firm Wood Mackenzie, said by phone. “Storage is such a new product that it’s hard to understand whether it can really serve that peaking capability.”",
            "A growing body of research projects how the country could rapidly transition off fossil-fueled electricity production. One recent study from the group Rewiring America found that the United States could generate virtually all its electricity from wind, solar and nuclear by 2035 and keep global warming within the range the Paris Agreement hoped to set, even without drastically altering other facets of American life.",
            "But that assumes a grand federal program on the scale of the World War II-era New Deal ― something even a rich state like New York could not do on its own.",
            "One solution would be to bring more renewables generated outside the city limits onto the grid, which is divided in the state. The upstate region generates 88% of its power from zero-emissions sources, primarily hydroelectric dams and nuclear reactors, according to NYISO data. Downstate in the city, Hudson Valley and Long Island, that figure is just 29%. And that percentage could decrease even more next year, when the Indian Point nuclear power plant shuts down.",
            "Laying new transmission lines from the sparsely populated upstate region to the metropolitan downstate could balance out the problem and make the city less reliant on fossil fuels. But building transmission lines, like fossil fuel pipelines, is costly and difficult, as the projects cross multiple jurisdictions and offer property owners ample recourse to block construction.",
            "Developers first pitched the Champlain Hudson Power Express, once described as “essentially a 333-mile extension cord down the Hudson River from Quebec to New York City,” in 2008. In 2020, a year before it was scheduled to come online, the proposal remains the subject of heated debate. Last November, Riverkeeper, a state environmental group, withdrew its support for the project. In June, the Sierra Club called for more reviews of the proposal.",
            "Offshore wind turbines offer what some see as an easier route, since transmission lines would run under open waters. Last year, the state granted contracts to build two massive wind farms off Long Island, set to generate a combined 1,700 megawatts of electricity. The projects have vast potential to both transform the industrial waterfront in Brooklyn and Queens with thousands of wind service and maintenance jobs and to provide much of the city’s electricity needs. But the turbines aren’t expected to come online until 2024, and that assumes none of the hiccups and delays that notoriously dog infrastructure projects in the Empire State.",
            "Peaker plant owners, meanwhile, are up against a deadline. New state regulations on nitrogen oxide emissions come into force in May 2023. The rules would require older, oil-fired units to shut down or obtain a waiver to continue operating.",
            "“We need to reach the (CLCPA) goals, but we also need to keep the lights and air conditioning on as we work to get there,” said John Reese, the senior vice president of Astoria Generating Co., the ArcLight-owned firm that runs the peaker plant in Gowanus. “Electric reliability is critical ― as everyone who lost power during the recent storm can attest to ― and building new infrastructure in New York is difficult, expensive and time-consuming.”",
            "New, More Hawkish Legislators",
            "On its website, NRG said the repowering in Astoria would lower peak emissions by “up to 99% per hour” and “use technology that can be fully converted to zero-carbon fuel in the future.” That could mean the company plans to eventually run the gas turbines on hydrogen, a cleaner fuel that is increasingly popular in Europe but that the federal Department of Energy describes as “still in its infancy.”",
            "In a letter urging state regulators to halt the project, four groups ― 350.org Brooklyn, New York Communities for Change, Food & Water Watch and the New York City chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America ― accused NRG of promoting the potential of hydrogen “in an attempt to obfuscate” the near-term plans.",
            "The groups asked the state Department of Environmental Conservation to submit the project to review under a provision of a 2011 law requiring power plants to study pollution effects and hold public hearings on repowering proposals.",
            "But NRG received its initial approval for the project before that law was in place. At the time, there was strong support for the repowering project. Last year, the state Department of Public Service ruled that the project did not require additional review.",
            "It’s unclear how much legal leverage Mamdani, Brisport and others would have in the state Legislature. But they’re already considering potential approaches. Mamdani and Brisport said they’d consider bills to prohibit new fossil fuel infrastructure in the state. Both also support the Democratic Socialists of America’s campaign to bring New York City’s electric utility, Consolidated Edison, and gas provider, National Grid, under government control, a process that would likely mean buying out the local infrastructure.",
            "Mamdani and Brisport see clear mandates from voters to go big.",
            "Brisport campaigned hard on climate issues and beat Tremaine Wright, a party-backed assemblywoman, in the race to replace legislative stalwart Velmanette Montgomery, the retiring 35-year Senate incumbent.",
            "Unlike other democratic socialists who unseated dynastic Assembly legislators entrenched in outer-borough political machines, Mamdani defeated Simotas, a telegenic 41-year-old with a liberal voting record. It marked perhaps the first major example of a democratic socialist triumphing over a mainline progressive ― and, in his view, showed voters’ appetite for dramatic change.",
            "“When you dig yourself into a hole, you just stop digging,” he said. “Yet what these people are saying is ‘dig slower.’”"

            "BOSTON (AP) — For the second time in a decade, a New Hampshire woman has a new face.",
            "Carmen Blandin Tarleton, whose face was disfigured in an attack by her ex-husband, became the first American and only the second person globally to undergo the procedure after her first transplant began to fail six years after the operation. The transplant from an anonymous donor took place at Boston’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital in July.",
            "The 52-year-old former nurse is expected to resume her normal routine, which all but ended when the first transplant failed a year ago.",
            "“I’m elated,” Tarleton told The Associated Press, in an exclusive telephone interview from her home in Manchester. She is still healing from the operation so photos are not being made available of her new face.",
            "“The pain I had is gone,” she said. “It’s a new chapter in my life. I’ve been waiting for almost a year. I’m really happy. It’s what I needed. I got a great match.”",
            "More than 40 patients worldwide have received face transplants, including 16 in the United States. None of the American patients had lost their donor faces until Tarleton.",
            "But in 2018, a French man whose immune system rejected his donor face eight years after his first transplant underwent a second. The doctor who did the transplant, Dr. Laurent Lantieri of the Georges Pompidou European Hospital in Paris, said that patient is “doing very well.”",
            "Dr. Bohdan Pomahac, who did Tarleton’s first face transplant, was hesitant to do another and favored doing reconstruction surgery instead. But his team became convinced of the merits of a second transplant after Tarleton described how much the first one improved her life.",
            "“She really wanted to try one more time,” said Pomahac, who led the 20-hour, second surgery. A team of around 45 clinicians removed the failing transplant and then prepared sensory nerves and blood vessels in the neck for the surgical connection. The face was then transplanted and Tarleton will gain sensory and motor function in the coming months.",
            "Unlike her first transplant, the donor this time around was considered a much better tissue match. Because of her previous injuries before the first transplant, 98% of donors were incompatible matches. Even then, the first face led to several cases of acute rejection, in which the body attacks the new face and strong drugs are needed to suppress the immune system.",
            "“Now, I am very optimistic and hopeful that it will last a lot longer than the first transplant,” said Pomahac, who has described the match as miraculous. “But, of course, that is wishful thinking, speculation. I don’t know. She really got lucky.”",
            "Brian Gastman, a plastic surgeon at the Cleveland Clinic who led its last two face transplants, said Tarleton’s case illustrates the limitations of these procedures.",
            "“When you look at most organ transplants, there is a shelf life,” Gastman said. “We are getting to the point where these face transplantations are hitting against the maximum number of years someone can have one in.”",
            "Tarleton was burned on over 80% of her body and blinded in 2007 when her estranged husband, Herbert Rodgers, beat her with a baseball bat and doused her body with lye because he thought she was seeing another man. In 2009, Rodgers pleaded guilty to maiming Tarleton in exchange for a prison sentence of at least 30 years. He died in prison in 2017.",
            "The first transplant transformed Tarleton’s life. She got off strong medications for her pain, took up the piano and was able to travel and give inspirational speeches — often talking of how she had forgiven Rodgers. She also became close friends with the daughter of her first donor, a 56-year-old woman who died of a stroke. She also got a synthetic cornea in her left eye.",
            "But by last year, the face was failing. She began experiencing scarring, tightness and pain because of a loss of blood flow to her face. Black patches appeared on her face. Her eyelids contracted and her lips began disappearing, making it difficult to eat. She was mostly housebound and resumed taking strong pain medications.",
            "“I couldn’t do anything,” she said. “I was pretty much in pain.”",
            "She requested in October to be put the hospital’s list for a second face. That process took much longer, in part, because she was taken off the list for two months because of the coronavirus pandemic. She was added back on when the state allowed elective surgeries to resume.",
            "Now that she has her new face, Tarleton is hoping to once again travel and give inspirational speeches — those will be on Zoom until there is a coronavirus vaccine. For now, she is still getting used to her new appearance.",
            "“This face looks very different than my first one and I can appreciate that. It’s a different person,” she said, adding the new face allows her to “fit in a little better, don’t get stared at so easily.”",

            "Reality Winner’s mom is blasting the fact that felons who worked for President Donald Trump are free while her daughter is still behind bars and caught COVID-19.",
            "Winner, 29, was sentenced in 2018 to five years in federal prison for leaking a classified National Security Agency document to the media that exposed Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.",
            "The former U.S. Air Force linguist and intelligence specialist who worked as an NSA contractor was denied compassionate release from a Texas medical prison in April. She tested positive for the coronavirus last month, along with at least 510 female inmates at the Federal Medical Center, Carswell in Fort Worth. The facility has one of the largest COVID-19 outbreaks in the nation, with some 40% of the prison population infected.",
            "Winner appears to be doing better now after suffering significant pain from the virus, her mom, Billie Winner-Davis, told HuffPost in an interview Wednesday.",
            "Winner-Davis called her daughter’s treatment “cruel” and “vindictive” in contrast to former Trump aides who sparked national security concerns over their links to Russia and have since been released from prison or have avoided it altogether.",
            "“They didn’t want that information out there; they wanted to set an example to others,” she said of the White House’s interest in keeping her daughter behind bars.",
            "“This has really opened my eyes to how very corrupt our government is, and it’s way worse under Trump,” she told HuffPost.",
            "Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort, who owed at much as $17 million to pro-Russian interests while working on the campaign, was released in May to home confinement to serve out his 7.5-year sentence because of the risks of COVID-19 in prison. He served less than 30% of his sentence for conspiracy, fraud and tax evasion behind bars.",
            "The U.S. Department of Justice is also currently battling to dismiss a case against Trump’s former national security adviser Michael Flynn, even though he pleaded guilty — twice — to lying to FBI agents about his secret negotiations with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S.",
            "Former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates testified Wednesday before a Senate committee that Flynn undermined U.S. interests in calls shortly before Trump took office as he assured the ambassador not to worry about sanctions. “The purpose of the sanctions was both to punish and deter” Russia from interfering in U.S. elections, Yates testified. When Flynn said “nevermind on those sanctions,” it undercut that message, said Yates.",
            "And Trump just weeks ago commuted the 40-month sentence of longtime adviser and felon Roger Stone, who communicated with Russian intelligence officers during Trump’s presidential campaign, according to the FBI. Those officers were linked to the publication of Democratic emails hacked in a Kremlin-backed operation to manipulate the U.S. presidential election.",
            "The NSA document Winner leaked has been linked to a story in The Intercept about a monthslong hacking effort by Russian military intelligence to undermine the election. It included details about a cyberattack on at least one U.S. voting software supplier and phishing emails to more than 100 local election officials.",
            "Winner-Davis said her daughter believed getting the document out was the right thing to do at the time. “She felt like the truth had to be told, and she’s not the type to walk away,” her mom told HuffPost.",
            "Winner spotted the document she later leaked as she was reading classified information sent to workers with top security clearance, according to a transcript of her FBI interrogation in 2017 at her home in Georgia, where she was working at the time. The word-for-word transcript has since been made into a play (check out the video up top).",
            "“Seeing that information that had been contested back and forth and back and forth in the public domain for so long, trying to figure out, like, with everything else that keeps getting released and keeps getting leaked, why isn’t this getting out there? Why can’t this be public?” Winner told an agent.",
            "“To sit back and watch ... and think, ’Why do I have this job if I’m just going to sit back and be helpless? … I just thought that it was the final straw.”",
            "Winner’s penalty for leaking a classified document was the longest known sentence in American history for leaking a document to the press under the Espionage Act, sparking outrage from First Amendment advocates.",
            "“Reality Winner’s long prison sentence is proof that the U.S. government cares more about hiding information from the public than it does about its citizens’ rights to the First Amendment,” Margaux Ewen, the North America bureau director of Reporters Without Borders, said in a statement at the time.",
            "PEN America said that Winner’s sentence had “troubling ramifications for national security whistleblowers and the public’s access to information.”",
            "Winner-Davis is relieved her daughter is doing better after her COVID-19 diagnosis. “She sounded much better this week and started to laugh again,” she said.",
            "Those with COVID-19 are considered “recovered” after 10 days at the prison, though they’re not tested again, Winner-Davis said. But newly ill inmates are mixed in with the rest of the population, risking more contagion, she said.",
            "The Federal Medical Center, Carswell has been locked down since early April because of COVID-19. Inmates are not allowed to go outside and typically eat in their crowded cells, said Winner-Davis. It’s no longer possible for her daughter to work outside her cell or to participate in extra programs, such as taking college classes, she said.",
            "“Reality, like many other non-violent first offenders, doesn’t deserve this,” Winner-Davis told CNN last month. “This is torture. This could possibly even be a death sentence.”",
            "Winner is due to be released from prison in November 2021."

Then, the same judge ordered the pipeline to shut down while the monthslong reviews take place. Last month, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit staved off the latter order.",

            "The Army Corps of Engineers, which is expected to greenlight the pipeline to keep pumping oil, must submit its reasoning for continued operation to the lower court that originally ordered the shutdown.",
            "“This is something that kicks the can down the road three months, maybe four months, or however long the Army Corps can drag this out,” Brandon Barnes, a senior energy litigation analyst at the research firm Bloomberg Intelligence, said by phone.",
            "The Army Corps isn’t expected to complete its review of the pipeline until the middle of next year.",
            "If Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden defeats President Donald Trump in November, the new administration could dramatically reverse the pipeline’s fortunes, particularly if Democrats retake control of the Senate. Once in office, Biden could slow the review process by probing the Trump administration’s decisions on the pipeline. He could also direct the Army Corps of Engineers to abandon the oil route.",
            "The Obama administration, in which Biden served as vice president, blocked construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline in December 2016 after months of protests at which heavily militarized security forces attacked peaceful demonstrators.",

His lawsuit was filed the same day that prosecutors filed a motion to revoke his bond over an alleged travel violation.",
            "In the lawsuit filed Tuesday, Garrett Rolfe argues that he was improperly fired on June 13, one day after Brooks’ death, because there had been no investigation or pre-disciplinary hearing and he did not receive proper notice. This violated the city’s municipal code and his constitutional rights, the suit claims.",
            "Rolfe has been charged with 11 counts, including felony murder and aggravated assault. His suit argues, however, that his use of deadly force was lawful and in response to Brooks, who was Black, having displayed “violent, unlawful, aggressive resistance to a lawful arrest.”",
            "Brooks, 27, was fatally shot after police were called to the Wendy’s over reports of a man sleeping in his car in the restaurant’s drive-thru lane. After taking a sobriety test and being questioned by officers, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said he ran away while pointing a Taser at one of the officers.",
            "An autopsy concluded that Brooks was shot twice in the back. His death has been listed as a homicide.",
            "Rolfe’s suit also takes issue with the fact that the second officer at the scene, Devin Brosnan, has not been fired, and was instead placed on administrative duty. Brosnan has been charged with aggravated assault and violating his oath. Like Rolfe, he is free on bond.",
            "Rolfe is “entitled to receive equal treatment under the law as compared to other officers who are similarly situated,” states the lawsuit, which requests a judge to hold a hearing and to order his immediate reinstatement with back pay, seniority and other benefits.",

            "When Amanda Reyes thinks back on how she was radicalized, it probably started with the IUD. In 2008, at 20 years old, Reyes was studying humanities at the University of Alabama and working part time at the campus Starbucks. Reyes, who was in a long-term relationship, needed a reliable form of birth control. After researching online, she decided on the Mirena, an IUD that can prevent pregnancy for up to seven years. It was pricey, though, so for three months she ate only peanut butter sandwiches and ramen noodles to save up.",
            "When it came time for her appointment at the university medical center, things did not go to plan. The male doctor, Reyes recalled, was reluctant to do the procedure. What if her boyfriend wanted her to get pregnant sooner? he asked. He left her in the examination room for hours, claiming problems with her insurance, Reyes said, and then he took off for the day without letting her know.",
            "Reyes did not get her IUD. The university medical center did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.",
            "The experience was a wake-up call, she told me over a Zoom call last month.",
            "“This guy – who had no idea what my life was like outside that room – was making decisions for me based on what he thought was best,” Reyes said. “It was ridiculous.”",
            "These days, Reyes works to ensure that other people are guaranteed the agency that she was denied as a college student. She runs the Yellowhammer Fund, an Alabama-based reproductive justice organization that envisions “a society in which individuals and communities have autonomy in making healthy choices regarding their bodies and their futures.” The fund, which helps people obtain abortions, burst onto the national stage in 2019 after Alabama enacted the most extreme abortion ban in the country.",
            "Although a judge blocked the law before it could go into effect, people who were outraged by the ban and looking for a concrete way to get involved flooded the relatively unknown nonprofit with donations. Within two weeks, the fund’s bank account swelled from a few thousand dollars to $2 million.",
            "All of a sudden, the scrappy nonprofit had the money to dream big. And it did.",
            "On May 15, exactly one year after the abortion ban was signed into law, the Yellowhammer fund purchased the West Alabama Women’s Center, an abortion clinic that provides about half of the abortions in the state. As long as abortion remained legal, people would have a guaranteed place to get one, Reyes said. On Aug. 1, she took on the role of clinic director. At 32, she is among the youngest administrators of an abortion clinic in the country.",
            "Reyes is part of a new generation of activists fighting to enshrine reproductive rights in their communities. Their work comes at a time of heightened attacks from anti-abortion extremists who believe the time is ripe to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion nationwide. Still, crusaders like Reyes think it is a mistake to focus their efforts solely on abortion. True reproductive freedom, they say, requires an intersectional approach.",
            "The Makings Of An Activist\n",
            "Reyes, who is Latina, was born in a tiny town in Texas to teenage parents. She has thought at length about how her mother could have had an abortion if she wanted — it was the ’80s and abortion was fairly available in the area — but had decided to raise her instead.",
            "“My mom’s experience really informs my perspective,” Reyes said. “You should have the choice to do whatever it is that you want to do, and you should be supported in that choice.”\n",
            "When Reyes went off to college in Alabama, she was introduced to the concept of reproductive justice in a class taught by Brittney Cooper, an author and expert in Black feminist thought. Coined in the 1990s by a group of Black women, the term “reproductive justice” refers to an intersectional framework that positions reproductive rights within social, political and economic contexts. While the mainstream reproductive rights movement focused on a woman’s right to choose, reproductive justice proponents argued that for many marginalized people without the money or resources to access abortion, there was no real choice at all.\n",
            "Reyes learned this firsthand after she began volunteering as a clinic escort at the West Alabama Women’s Center, an abortion clinic in Tuscaloosa. There, she met women who were turned away because they were too far along — they hadn’t had the means to make it to the clinic earlier. She also saw people who would have gone through with their pregnancies if only they could have afforded to raise kids.\n",
            "In 2016, with the election of President Donald Trump, Reyes decided she wanted to do more. She founded the Yellowhammer Fund, a nonprofit that helps people overcome the logistical and financial barriers keeping them from getting abortions. It also functions as a reproductive justice organization, offering assistance to pregnant people in whatever form they need.\n",
            "“We want to make sure that people can get abortion care when they need it,” Reyes said. “But we also recognize that a lot of these people would be making different choices if they had more resources available to them.”",
            "Shot Into The Spotlight",
            "In May 2019, Alabama’s Republican governor, Kay Ivey, signed the Human Life Protection Act into law. It banned abortion in nearly all cases and threatened doctors who performed the procedure with felony charges and up to 99 years in prison.",
            "The legislation was temporarily blocked by a judge, but not before it triggered mass outrage across the country. For people yearning to take action, donating to the Yellowhammer Fund emerged as a viable option. By the end of the year, the group had amassed $3.35 million.",
            "Like many nonprofits newly flooded with cash, the organization soon came under scrutiny for how it was managing its money. In 2019, the group provided more than $250,000 to fund nearly 1,100 abortions in Alabama. But it also used money to invest in other services, such as breastfeeding support and birth doulas.",
            "To her detractors, Reyes counters that her organization never hid its intentions to expand beyond basic abortion funding.",
            "“Because we were such a small organization, people were so willing to believe that we either had no idea what we were doing or that we were taking advantage of people and doing whatever with the money,” she said.",
            "Jenise Fountain, an activist in Birmingham who offers practical support to Black mothers living in poverty, recalled getting an unexpected call from Reyes in 2019 saying the Yellowhammer Fund was donating $10,000 to assist her work.",
            "At the time, Fountain was running a backpack drive, stocking school backpacks with supplies for children in need. She had never heard of the Yellowhammer Fund.",
            "“One thing Amanda does extremely well is to be intersectional,” Fountain said during a phone call with me. “She’s funding full-spectrum reproductive justice — and that includes if you have a child already.”",
            "Fountain said she admired Reyes’ dedication to learning from activists who are on the ground working with vulnerable communities.",
            "“Since we’ve been in contact, she’s always asking, ‘What do you need to address the issues in your area? What are your moms’ needs? What can I do to help?’” Fountain said. “She listens.”",
            "Reyes has also worked to bring the perspectives of trans and nonbinary people into Yellowhammer Fund’s work.",
            "“She was like, y’all come to the table,” said TC Caldwell, a trans activist working with TKO Society, a nonprofit that provides essential support services for LGBTQ people living in Alabama. “Because our voices had been erased for so long, she made sure there was room not only for TKO Society, but for people like me.”",
            "The Yellowhammer Fund donated condoms and emergency contraception to the TKO Society so that they could give it to their clients for free, Caldwell added.",
            "“You don’t really realize the need until you offer it,” they said. “Amanda understands reproductive justice is more than just access to abortion — it’s holistic.”",
            "In May of this year, the Yellowhammer Fund revealed its big-picture plans for abortion access in the state when it purchased the West Alabama Women’s Center. For Reyes, it was a type of homecoming. It was the same abortion clinic she had volunteered at as a college student.",
            "Running The Clinic",
            "When I last spoke to Reyes, she was at the West Alabama Women’s Center, working in her office. As a woman in her early 30s, Reyes is somewhat of an anomaly in the abortion world — the industry is dominated by aging activists who got into the reproductive rights movement decades ago and never left.",
            "“There hasn’t been a pipeline of mentorship that has allowed many people under 50 to take on these roles,” Reyes said. “This is a problem with our movement and who we consider ‘the right people’ to take on leadership roles, but also a problem with access to money.” Young people often don’t have access to the network of donors and investors needed to take on the financial risks that come with running an abortion clinic, she added.",
            "Gloria Gray, the previous owner of the West Alabama Women’s Center, had long wanted to retire but struggled to find the right buyer. Then came the Yellowhammer Fund.",
            "“We had the opportunity. We had the resources,” Reyes said. “And what better way is there to improve abortion access in the state than to actually have a hand in providing those abortions?”",
            "Owning and operating an abortion clinic is exceedingly difficult work, especially in states that are hostile toward reproductive rights. Clinic staff must battle anti-abortion protesters, state efforts to restrict access to abortion, constant litigation and stigma from within the community. It can also be dangerous. Violence at abortion clinics is on the rise, according to a report by the National Abortion Federation, a professional association of abortion providers. In 2019, members of NAF reported an increase in intimidation tactics, invasions and other activities aimed at disrupting services.",
            "The Very Rev. Katherine Ragsdale, who serves as president and CEO of NAF, said she was excited for Reyes to take a leadership position.",
            "“Having young people moving into ownership and administration is a great thing to see for those of us who hope someday to be able to retire,” she said.",
            "Reyes was already getting a sense for how hard it was going to be as administrator by the time we spoke. The coronavirus was sweeping the state, and at her clinic, anti-abortion protesters amassed outside, not wearing face masks and violating social distancing guidelines.",
            "She described how protesters were filming her staff performing health safety protocols with patients before they entered the clinic. Anti-abortion activists regularly gathered evidence they believed could be used against the clinic and filed complaints with the state, Reyes said. She knew that the pandemic gave them ammunition, and she was doing everything she could to ensure the clinic would remain open.",
            "Because of the constant scrutiny, “we have to have a better and stricter protocol than anyone else,” she said. “But that means we see less people, and it’s even more difficult to get an abortion.”",
            "Reyes has ambitious plans for the future of the clinic. She also has help.",
            "In August, the West Alabama Women’s Center announced that it had a new medical director: Leah Torres, an OB-GYN who is unapologetic about her abortion activism. Torres will replace Dr. Louis Payne, who is in his 80s. With Torres at the helm, the clinic will introduce full-spectrum reproductive and sexual health services, including well-person exams, contraceptives, STI testing, prenatal care and trans health services, the clinic said in a press release.",
            "Reyes’ vision of creating a comprehensive reproductive health care center is finally coming into fruition.",
            "“I want to make the clinic even more patient-focused right than it already is,” she said. “We can build toward providing empowering health care to people.”",

            "Last week, a group of medical professionals calling themselves America’s Frontline Doctors stood in front of the U.S. Supreme Court and insisted that hydroxychloroquine is a “cure” for the coronavirus despite medical studies to the contrary.",
            "In addition to that claim about the anti-malarial drug, their press conference also pushed such potentially harmful misinformation as the idea that mask-wearing isn’t necessarily a good choice. A day later, Vice President Mike Pence reportedly met with the doctors.",
            "As Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious diseases expert, has said repeatedly, there’s little concrete evidence that hydroxychloroquine is effective as a COVID-19 treatment ― even if President Donald Trump continues to promote it. Last month, the Food and Drug Administration warned against using hydroxychloroquine to treat coronavirus patients, following reports of “serious heart rhythm problems” and other health issues in those who received the drug.",
            "Still, in part thanks to a retweet by the president, the doctors’ clip went viral. It racked up tens of millions of views, even in the face of a widespread effort by social media companies to remove the video and penalize some who shared it, including presidential son Donald Trump Jr.",
            "What may have been more startling, though, was what the news media found out about Stella Immanuel, the doctor who led the press conference. Immanuel, who works as a primary care physician and pastor in Houston, doesn’t just believe hydroxychloroquine is a valid coronavirus treatment. She also believes that gynecological issues like endometriosis and cysts are caused by people having sex in their dreams with demons and witches, that alien DNA is currently used in medical treatments and that gay Americans practice “homosexual terrorism.” Online, Immanuel hawks a prayer she claims can remove “generational curses” passed on from ancestors and transmitted through the placenta.",
            "The fact that so many Americans may have fallen for claims made by Immanuel and the other doctors ― most of whom are only debatably “on the frontlines” of the COVID-19 crisis ― without knowing much about their backgrounds or possible political motives is deeply troubling to Lydia Kang, a practicing physician and co-author of “Quackery: A Brief History of the Worst Ways to Cure Everything.”",
            "“I was incredibly fearful for the health of those people who would trust her for two reasons: Her thinking agreed with their own, and they were looking to a medical professional to substantiate their own beliefs,” Kang told HuffPost.",
            "“Many people feed upon hope, which is important, but it can be frightening when that hope leads to believing things that could be incredibly harmful,” she said.",
            "As unnerving as it was that so many Americans shared the video, it was actually a good thing that Immanuel has a history of using her platform to promote conspiracy theories, said David H. Gorski, a surgical oncologist and professor of surgery at Wayne State University School of Medicine. Gorski is also the managing editor of Science-Based Medicine, a medical blog that exposes non-scientific research and practices.",
            "“The sex with demons and other claims provided the press a good ‘in’ to debunk and discredit her as a source,” he said. “If the astroturfers had chosen a less disreputable figure, it might have been more difficult to counter the message.” (Astroturfing is the practice of masking the sponsors of a message or organization, whether it’s a political, religious or advertising group, to make it appear as though the message or group had organically sprung from grassroots efforts.)",
            "That being said, Gorski added that “it’s very depressing how easily Americans bought into Immanuel’s message even knowing her history of bizarre claims.”",
            "Still, the fact remains that Immanuel does have a full medical license in Texas, USA Today reported pointing to the Texas Medical Board’s online records. She told the board she has a primary specialty in pediatrics and a secondary specialty in emergency medicine. Her bizarre beliefs and the products she sells on her site may ― or, worse, may not ― come as a surprise to patients she’s had.",
            "It makes you wonder: What kind of questionable beliefs might your doctor have that aren’t endorsed by the medical community ― and how can you dodge doctors like Immanuel the next time you’re in the market for a general practitioner or specialist?",
            "Below, Gorski, Kang and other medical experts share how to tell if a doctor might be a quack.",
            "A few signs your doctor may be pushing some dubious beliefs:",
            "They sell their own supplements and treatments.",
            "It’s a significant warning sign if a doctor puts their patients on unconventional mixes of medications and supplements, some of which they sell, Kang said.",
            "“One major red flag is when a physician directly touts their own brand of medicines or supplements to take out of their own store,” she said. “It’s a serious conflict of interest.”",
            "They rely on single-person testimonies, social media or TV endorsements rather than peer-reviewed data.",
            "Many of the doctors we spoke to cited television’s Mehmet Oz and his show “Dr. Oz” as an example of a physician using their platform to hawk questionable treatments. Though Oz has an Ivy League medical degree, a 2014 study in the peer-reviewed British Medical Journal found that in 40 randomly selected episodes from Oz’s show, his health recommendations were based on evidence just 46% of the time.",
            "If you’re concerned about your doctor making dubious health recommendations, ask yourself if their claims are supported by scientific evidence. In place of hard evidence, your doctor may claim they have anecdotal evidence that something works ― or that it’s been endorsed by this expert or that celebrity, including TV doctors. That’s not enough.",
            "“Be wary if they mention social media endorsements or they talk about testimonials and single-patient stories,” said Arthur Caplan, director of the division of medical ethics at NYU Grossman School of Medicine.",
            "Any doctor worth their salt should be citing peer-reviewed articles and scientific studies that rely on well-designed clinical trials, not patient anecdotes and their own personal experience, Caplan said.",
            "They say their treatment is a “miracle cure” with an unbelievably high success rate.",
            "Be leery of a doctor who promises a 100% (or ridiculously high) cure rate. If it sounds too good to be true, it usually is too good to be true, Gorski said. He used the example of certain clinics that claim they have a 90% cure rate for stage IV cancer.",
            "They speak in absolutes.",
            "Does your doctor tend to make sweeping generalizations or speak in absolutes? For example, “All mainstream doctors have it wrong” or “I’m the only one who can help you.” That’s another major red flag, Kang said.",
            "“A good doctor will carefully weigh the pros and cons of any treatment, and are careful about promising anything as a ‘perfect fix,’” she explained.",
            "When the treatment goes wrong, they blame the patient.",
            "Because quack doctors often make overbroad claims about their treatments and products ― “it’s worked for everybody I’ve prescribed it to” ― any instances where the cure-all doesn’t work has to be the patient’s fault.",
            "“They’ll usually blame failure of their treatment on the patient’s failure to adhere to their protocol closely enough,” Gorski said.",
            "How to do your due diligence when selecting a doctor:",
            "Look at rating sites with a healthy dose of skepticism.",
            "To avoid a quack, Googling can be helpful, but stay skeptical when searching, Kang said. Be aware, for instance, that anyone can add a review on those health score websites where you see how many stars your doctor has, just like you would rate a restaurant on Yelp.",
            "People can give a one-star or five-star rating without any proof as to “who they are, whether they actually saw the doctor, or how many times they vote,” Kang said.",
            "Gorski suggested that Yelp-like sites rating medical professionals are inherently biased toward negative reviews.",
            "“Patients should know that it is the very nature of rating sites that those who’ve had a negative experience will be more likely to want to post a review than those who’ve had a positive or at least acceptable or decent experience,” he said.",
            "It’s often wiser to look at ratings put out by medical institutions themselves, Kang said, because they’re usually vetted to ensure that only patients who’ve seen the doctor vote and they vote only once.",
            "Find out where they went to medical school and what they studied.",
            "When sizing up a physician, especially a specialist, look up their credentials. Have they completed the proper training in their specific field?",
            "“For example, a plastic surgeon without true training in plastics (via a residency and/or fellowship) or not board certified in plastic surgery would be a concern,” Kang said.",
            "Check to see if their claims are supported by other doctors.",
            "If you’re reading up on a treatment a doctor promotes online or elsewhere, look to see if it has garnered support from other doctors. Stay away if the doctor is making health claims outside of peer review and then marketing their product to laypeople.",
            "“Look to see if they’ve published anything and be ready to get a second opinion if you have doubts,” Caplan said. “Are they a solo practice ― no peers checking them? Do they advertise and if so, are they making sweeping promises in their ads?”",
            "If they have a social media presence, look to see what kind of information they’ve shared.",
            "These days, many medical professionals have Twitter or Facebook pages where they comment on trending medical news. If your doctor has a public profile, read it to get a better feel for their beliefs, Kang said.",
            "A quick Google search of Immanuel, the pastor-physician who led the press conference last week, would have pulled up her Twitter page, where she’s been tweeting about witchcraft and “21 day water fasts to demolish satanic embargo to our progress” since as far back as 2012.",
            "Of course, not every social media page is going to be medically focused.",
            "“Keep in mind, not all doctors tweet and Instagram about health topics alone,” Kang said. “They show their personal lives ― we are normal people, after all! we go on vacation and hang out in swimsuits sometimes! ― and political beliefs.”",
            "But if a doctor is selling dubious products to their patients, they’re probably also posting about it, which allows you to weed that person out from the get-go."

            "WASHINGTON (AP) — The House Oversight Committee has invited the new postmaster general to appear at a September hearing to examine operational changes at the U.S. Postal Service that are causing delays in mail deliveries across the country.",
            "The plan imposed by Louis DeJoy, a Republican fundraiser who took over the top job at the Postal Service in June, eliminates overtime for hundreds of thousands of postal workers and orders that mail be kept until the next day if postal distribution centers are running late.",
            "Rep. Carolyn Maloney, a New York Democrat who chairs the Oversight panel, said the Sept. 17 hearing will focus on “the need for on-time mail delivery during the ongoing pandemic and upcoming election,” which is expected to include a major expansion of mail-in ballots.",
            "President Donald Trump has warned that allowing more people to vote by mail will result in a “CORRUPT ELECTION” that will “LEAD TO THE END OF OUR GREAT REPUBLICAN PARTY,” even though there’s no evidence that will happen. Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and other top administration officials frequently vote absentee themselves.",
            "Last week, Trump even floated on Twitter the prospect of delaying the Nov. 3 election — an idea lawmakers from both parties quickly shot down.",
            "Trump said Monday that the cash-strapped Postal Service is ill-equipped to add the expected influx of mail-in ballots to its responsibility to deliver mail and packages from the boom in internet shopping.",
            "“I don’t think the post office is prepared for a thing like this,” Trump said at the White House.",
            "Trump also has called the Postal Service “a joke” and said package shipping rates should be at least four times higher for heavy users like Amazon. But shipping and packages are actually a top revenue generator for the Postal Service, and critics say Trump is merely looking to punish Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos in retaliation for unflattering coverage in The Washington Post, which Bezos owns.",
            "The Oversight committee intended to have the hearing with DeJoy this week, Maloney said, but was told DeJoy could not attend because of a meeting of the Postal Service’s Board of Governors. DeJoy has confirmed his availability for the September session, she said.",
            "The hearing comes as the Postal Service is reeling from mail delays and financial problems, even as record numbers of mail ballots are expected in the presidential election because of the coronavirus pandemic.",
            "Postal Service officials, bracing for steep losses from the nationwide shutdown caused by the virus, have warned they will run out of money by the end of September without help from Congress. The service reported a $4.5 billion loss for the quarter ending in March, before the full effects of the shutdown sank in, and expects losses totaling more than $22 billion over the next 18 months.",
            "“The Postal Service is in a financially unsustainable position, stemming from substantial declines in mail volume and a broken business model,″ DeJoy said in a statement last week. “We are currently unable to balance our costs with available funding sources to fulfill both our universal service mission and other legal obligations. Because of this, the Postal Service has experienced over a decade of financial losses, with no end in sight, and we face an impending liquidity crisis.″",
            "Bills approved by the Democratic-controlled House would set aside $25 billion to keep the mail flowing, but they remain stalled in the Republican-controlled Senate. Congress has approved a $10 billion line of credit for the Postal Service, but it remains unused amid restrictions imposed by the Trump administration.",
            "The Postal Service and Treasury Department announced an agreement in principle on loan terms last week, with a formal agreement expected in the next few weeks. Even with the loan, the Postal Service “remains on an unsustainable path and we will continue to focus on improving operational efficiency,″ DeJoy said.",
            "Besides cutting overtime, the new plan halts late trips that are sometimes needed to ensure on-time delivery. If postal distribution centers are running late, “they will keep the mail for the next day,″ Postal Service leaders say in a document obtained by The Associated Press. “One aspect of these changes that may be difficult for employees is that — temporarily — we may see mail left behind or mail on the workroom floor or docks,″ another document says.",
            "Democratic lawmakers have demanded answers from DeJoy following complaints from constituents about mail service delays and other problems.",
            "“It is essential that the Postal Service not slow down mail or in any way compromise service for veterans, small businesses, rural communities, seniors and millions of Americans who rely on the mail – including significant numbers who will be relying on the Postal Service to exercise their right to vote,” a group of Democratic senators wrote in a letter to DeJoy last week.",
            "The senators, including Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and Michigan Sen. Gary Peters, the top Democrat on a panel that oversees the Postal Service, said any changes to Postal Service operations “must be carefully considered to ensure they do not limit service for Americans who rely on the mail for essentials, especially during a pandemic.″",
            "In a separate letter, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., asked DeJoy to clarify whether the Postal Service plans to close some post offices and reduce hours at others in his rural state. Signs at some locations announced proposed closures as soon as Aug. 22 or 24, Manchin said, calling any such action a violation of both federal law and Postal Service rules that require 120 days’ notice before any closures.",
            "“In many areas where reliable broadband is not an option, the Postal Service is their only link to medicine, Social Security checks and family members,″ Manchin said. “Under new social distancing mandates, the Postal Service has become even more essential in keeping rural communities connected and economically viable.″"

            "The zoo and hundreds of others across the country were ordered to close in March — the start of the busiest season for most animal parks — forcing administrators to deal with the pandemic’s financial impact through layoffs and pay cuts. Even as they reopen, zoos and aquariums from Alaska to Florida are seeing few visitors, prompting administrators to plead for support from their communities to avoid permanent closure.",
            "The Oakland Zoo has laid off more than 100 employees, primarily those who work with guests. Another 200 who care for animals and provide veterinary services and safety for the public and animals are still working and represent part of the zoo’s $1.2 million a month in costs, Parrott said.",
            "California officials this month allowed the zoo to reopen its outdoor areas Wednesday, but the animal park still faces a big challenge. Guests provide more than 90% of revenue through tickets, concessions, rides, gifts and parties. But attendance and revenue in Oakland — and around the country — are falling short.",
            "“Members are hitting 20% to 50% of their normal revenue targets,” said Dan Ashe, president of the national Association of Zoos and Aquariums.",
            "About 75% of the 220 U.S. zoos and aquariums represented by the association have reopened, but without additional assistance, they’re facing “very difficult decisions about further furloughs or layoffs and then ultimately about their survival,” Ashe said. Six in 10 members applied for assistance from the federal government’s coronavirus relief package, but that financial support runs out this month.",
            "Dino Ferri, president of the Central Florida Zoo & Botanical Garden, said he wakes up at night trying to figure out how he will make up the $1.5 million his park lost during its two-month closure that ended in May. Normally those are the busiest months for the zoo, which depends on visitors for 80% of its revenue.",
            "The Sanford, Florida, zoo is home to 350 animals and is visited by 40,000 school kids each year. With schools closed, major events canceled and few tourists, the zoo is struggling to bring in even half of the $450,000 a month it needs to keep the park running, Ferri said.",
            "The park is now allowed to open to as many as 1,000 people at a time and Ferri had hoped for a busy summer, but only about 350 visitors a day are showing up.",
            "“People are afraid,” Ferri said. “We expected a boom from people who are not traveling and are doing staycations, but the uptick in cases in the state of Florida and all the stuff on the news are keeping people at home.”",
            "As a result, he has laid off 40% of staff, cut leadership team salaries, including his own, and launched a campaign to raise $1.5 million by December to restore the zoo’s operating budget to pre-virus levels.",
            "“We’re looking at cutting our education department and at more salary reductions across the board, more layoffs,” Ferri said. “We just have to keep trying to stop the bleed.”",
            "In Seward, Alaska, three-quarters of past visitors to the Alaska SeaLife Center — an aquarium and research center that runs Alaska’s only marine mammal rescue program — have been tourists who arrive by plane or cruise ship. With most cruises canceled, there are few people to see the octopus, and the site’s rare Steller sea lions.",
            "SeaLife Center President and CEO Tara Riemer said the aquarium, built partly with funds from a settlement after the Exxon Valdez oil spill, is seeing only about 25% of its typical number of pre-pandemic visitors. She expects a $3 million budget shortfall this year.",
            "“If we don’t have enough money to make it through the winter, we have no option but to send these animals away and close the facility,” Riemer said.",
            "Closing zoos and aquariums is an expensive task. Just finding new homes for animals is now even more complicated with so few flights and so many animal parks and aquariums struggling financially.",
            "SeaLife has not laid off any staff but it has significantly lowered expenses by freezing the hiring of seasonal and other workers and cutting salaries by 10%.",
            "Riemer said she remains optimistic. She and her staff are focused on raising at least $2 million by the end of September by reaching out to foundations, seeking government grants and turning to Alaskans and others for support.",
            "The city of Seward has pledged $500,000 if the center raises $1.3 million. In a heartening sign, the center sold 500 new memberships, costing from $60 to $155 each, in a single day — more than a quarter of the number normally purchased in a year.",
            "“I am optimistic that we’ll be able to pull together these funds because there are a lot of people in Alaska who are trying to figure out how to help us,” Riemer said.",

            "Britney Spears’ dad, Jamie Spears, has spoken out against an ongoing theory that his daughter is being controlled.",
            "Over the weekend, the elder Spears talked to the New York Post about the #FreeBritney movement that’s bubbled up all over the internet and insisted: “All these conspiracy theorists don’t know anything. The world don’t have a clue.”",
            "Since 2008, after Britney Spears was was involuntarily committed to a psychiatric hospital, her father and attorney Andrew Wallet were given a temporary conservatorship over the pop star that has since become permanent. The conservatorship means that the singer’s financial affairs and daily life is managed by someone else.",
            "The hashtag #FreeBritney was created as part of on ongoing effort and plea from fans to remove that conservatorship, which many believe is holding the singer “hostage.” While fans have been calling for Britney Spears’ freedom since the conservatorship took effect, the movement exploded over the last few months as fans have spent a lot of time in lockdown to prevent the spread of coronavirus watching and rewatching many of Britney’s videos to look for coded messaging. As a result, they’ve come up with all sorts of explanations for Britney’s behavior on Twitter and TikTok.",
            "Jamie Spears stepped down from his role in the conservatorship last year, leading to his daughter’s care manager, Jodi Montgomery, to step in. A hearing had been scheduled for July 22 to observe the status of conservatorship, but was reportedly thwarted by “Zoombombers” popping into the confidential Zoom call about the issue. The judge postponed the hearing as those not legally involved were in attendance. Seen below, many protesters showed up outside a Los Angeles courthouse on the day of the hearing to share their thoughts on the conservatorship.",
            "Jamie Spears pushed back on the rhetoric about his daughter from fans to the Post, claiming “it’s up to the court of California to decide what’s best for my daughter. It’s no one else’s business.” He also addressed the rumors that he’s stealing money from his daughter: “I have to report every nickel and dime spent to the court every year. How the hell would I steal something?”",
            "The 68-year-old also shared that he loves his daughter and that the conservatorship is “our business.”\n\n“It’s private,” he said.\n\nBritney’s father speaking out amid the controversy comes on the heels of his other two children, Bryan and Jamie Lynn Spears, also chiming in publicly on the matter.\n\nDuring an appearance on the “As Not Seen on TV” podcast last month, Bryan Spears claimed that his sister’s conservatorship is “a great thing for our family.”\n\n“We kind of came together and not everybody agreed with it either; everyone had their own opinion like, maybe we should do it this way or that way,” he said. “But at the end I think we made the right choice.”",
            "Also last month, Jamie Lynn Spears spoke out on Instagram about mental health and addressed her big sister without mentioning her by name.",
            "The youngest Spears shared screenshots of people expressing sympathy for Kanye West after he posted some troubling tweets and wrote: “If you deal with mental illness or care for someone dealing with mental illness, then you know how important it is to respect the situation with privacy for the person, and the family trying to protect their loved ones, no matter how it may appear to the public, and as the public we must learn to do the same.”\n\nWhen a follower mentioned Britney Spears in the comments and insisted Jamie Lynn Spears address the pop star’s “OBVIOUS mental illness,” the younger Spears fired back: “You have no right to assume anything about my sister and I have no right to speak about HER health and personal matters. She is a strong, badass, unstoppable woman, and that’s the only thing that is OBVIOUS.”"

The governor said the state is anticipating power outages and asked residents to have a week’s supply of water, food and medicine on hand. Officials wrestled with how to prepare shelters where people can seek refuge from the storm if necessary, while safely social distancing to prevent the spread of the virus.",

His presence will no doubt be missed by those he faithfully served.”",

            "WASHINGTON ― The North Dakota Republican Party voted this spring to approve its 2020 platform and included language calling LGBTQ people unhealthy, dangerous, manipulative to children and “voyeurs who wish to prey on members of the opposite sex.”",
            "But in a bizarre twist, after it started getting press attention last week, the same GOP officials who voted on the homophobic language are now condemning it and saying they don’t know who wrote it or where it came from.",
            "The anti-LGBTQ section of the platform, referred to as Resolution 31, is as offensive as it is outdated in its claims about queer people. You won’t find it on the party’s website anymore because the party pulled it down. But a reporter for The Forum of Fargo-Moorhead nabbed a copy of the platform before it disappeared.",
            "Resolution 31 is titled “In Opposition to Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Anti-Discrimination Bills,” which it refers to as “SOGI bills.” It includes statements such as this:",
            "“SOGI bills grant protection to voyeurs who wish to prey on members of the opposite sex.”\n\n“SOGI laws empower those practicing LGBT behaviors to assume positions of mentorships of minors often over objections of parents influencing their emotions and thereby recruiting for their lifestyles.”\n\n“SOGI bills seek to pacify those made uncomfortable as a result of their gender dysphoria by compromising the potential comfort and safety of an untold number of innocent individuals.”\n\n“Proponents of SOGI bills routinely advance the false narrative that they ‘just want the same rights and protections [you] already have.’ Every right and protection enshrined in statute applies to every North Dakotan equally. There is no legal remedy against suffering discrimination as a result of the heterosexuality of any given subject.”\n\n“Many LGBT practices are unhealthy and dangerous, sometimes endangering or shortening life and sometimes infecting society at large.”",
            "The last line reads, “Therefore, be it resolved: The Republican Party of North Dakota opposes the passage of legislation which adds sexual orientation and gender identity to our Century code as protected classes.”",
            "More than 700 state GOP delegates voted on this language in April, with the full platform approved 621-139 by a mail-in vote because of the coronavirus pandemic. It was circulated among all levels of Republican leadership in North Dakota, including the governor, the GOP party chair, state legislators and the North Dakota congressional delegation. And yet, nobody raised concerns with it until last week, when it started getting press attention. Now it’s all apologies and an apparent mystery where this language came from.",
            "North Dakota Republican Party Chair Rick Berg said Monday that he was sorry about Resolution 31 and directed the party’s executive committee to vote to disavow it. But he didn’t say who put it in the platform in the first place.",
            "The party suggested that delegates who voted for the platform weren’t actually voting for its anti-LGBTQ section as they voted for the entire platform, not individual resolutions.",
            "“As leaders of the State Party, we would like to offer a sincere apology for the inclusion of these unacceptable, hurtful sentiments as part of our official business,” Berg said in a statement.",
            "The party added in a statement that participants were asked to vote on more than 50 resolutions but that delegates did not consider each resolution individually for a vote.",
            "Asked if Berg reviewed his party’s platform before voting on it in April and why the platform wasn’t on the party’s website anymore, North Dakota Republican Party executive director Corby Kemmer told HuffPost the group had no further comment beyond the official statement.",
            "Republican Gov. Doug Burgum recently criticized the platform’s anti-LGBTQ language, calling it “hurtful and divisive.” And the state’s only congressional representative, Kelly Armstrong, and its GOP senators, John Hoeven and Kevin Cramer, said they were disappointed by the anti-LGBTQ rhetoric, The Forum reported. They all voted on the platform in April.",
            "A Burgum spokesman did not respond to a request for comment on whether the governor or his staff read the platform before voting on it and how Resolution 31 ended up in it.",
            "State Rep. Josh Boschee, who is the House Democratic leader and the only openly LGBTQ member of the North Dakota legislature, said the current situation of GOP officials scrambling to rebuke homophobic language that they just voted to approve is as bonkers as it sounds.",
            "“It’s even more insane than it usually is here,” Boschee told HuffPost. “No one seems to know where it came from. I grew up Catholic, so we’d call it lying.”",
            "He mocked Republicans for being “afraid of their own shadow” on Twitter.",
            "He said it’s not hard to see who helped put that language together: The GOP’s resolutions committee. Each of the state’s 47 legislative districts has a representative in that committee, and they were all involved in discussions on Resolution 31, he said.",
            "Republican state Rep. Mike Lefor, the chair of the resolutions committee, did not respond to a request for comment about the origins of the resolution.",
            "Boschee gave credit to the governor for being a “good partner” on LGBTQ issues and said he’s been receptive to meeting with community LGBTQ groups. But Boschee said the governor needs to do a lot more work within his party and that he’s been telling some of his GOP colleagues in the state House who are friends that they’re going to be tied to their party’s hateful anti-LGBTQ platform until someone confesses to writing it.",
            "″It’s easy to say I want nothing to do with this,” Boschee said. “It’s time to do the hard work of standing up for LGBTQ families. You need to spend time listening to LGBTQ North Dakotans about what their reality is and how this clearly does not help them and their image of North Dakota.”"

            "Barack Obama delivered a forceful criticism of the way the Senate conducts business on Thursday, calling the filibuster a “Jim Crow relic” and telling the chamber to get rid of the 60-vote requirement needed to pass major legislation.",
            "The former president made his appeal for Democrats in Congress to do everything in their power to protect voting rights during the funeral for civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis, arguing drastic action was needed to properly complete Lewis’ life’s work.",
            "“You want to honor John? Let’s honor him by revitalizing the law he was willing to die for,” Obama said while delivering a eulogy for the Georgia congressman, who died last week at age 80 and was famously beaten by state troopers during a march for voting rights in Selma, Alabama, in 1965. “Naming it the John Lewis Voting Rights Act is a fine tribute, but John wouldn’t want us to stop there, just getting back to where we already were.”",
            "“If all this takes eliminating the filibuster, another Jim Crow relic, in order to secure the God-given rights of every American, then that’s what we should do,” he added.",
            "Obama’s speech could be a watershed moment in Democratic politics. He is by far the highest-ranking member of the party to openly embrace the filibuster’s elimination, and his move prompted Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, the grandfather of the modern progressive movement, to adopt the same stance. If Democrats win the White House and the Senate and maintain control of the House in November, which polls show is a strong possibility, removing the filibuster would dramatically expand the potential for major new legislation.",
            "The former president’s comments will likely encourage Democrats who are pushing the party to go bold in the case of a November sweep, and could put moderates who defend the filibuster in an awkward position. It could effectively ensure that democracy reform is at the top of a crowded Democratic Party agenda in 2021.",
            "The former president called for a host of reforms aimed at revitalizing the nation’s democracy and expanding the right to vote, and said Congress should be prepared to eliminate the filibuster in order to pass those reforms.",
            "The Supreme Court essentially gutted the Voting Rights Act in a 2013 decision decided along ideological lines. Obama said Congress should fix the decision, but also make every American automatically registered to vote, extend the franchise to people who have completed their criminal sentences, add additional polling places and opportunities for early voting, and make Election Day a national holiday.",
            "Obama also called for “equal representation in our government” for citizens of Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, neither of which has voting representation in Congress; and for legislation to end political gerrymandering.",
            "Obama did not move to eliminate the legislative filibuster while he was president, even as Republicans deployed it to stop or delay virtually all of the president’s legislative priorities, but has spoken about its negative influence.",
            "“Adding the filibuster, I think, has made it almost impossible for us to effectively govern at a time when you have at least one party that is not willing to compromise on issues,” Obama said during an appearance on the podcast of one of his former advisers, David Axelrod.",
            "The filibuster was first regularly deployed by segregationist Southern Democrats in the first half of the 20th century to block civil rights legislation, stymieing anti-lynching legislation and other proposals to protect and expand civil rights.",
            "Both parties have chipped away at the filibuster in recent years. Under Obama, Democrats eliminated the 60-vote requirement for confirming most presidential nominees. Republicans eliminated the ability to filibuster nominations to the Supreme Court in 2017 in order to secure Neil Gorsuch’s seat on the nation’s highest court.",
            "Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, who served as Obama’s vice president, was a long-serving senator who was known for respecting the institution’s traditions, but has recently expressed some interest in eliminating the 60-vote requirement, which has long been used to block progressive policy priorities.",
            "“We’re going to have to remember what John said: ‘If you don’t do everything you can to change things, they’re going to remain the same. You only pass this way once,’” Obama said.",
            "Obama’s comments appeared to have had an immediate impact. Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats and has long resisted calling for a formal end to the filibuster, said it was time to do away with the 60-vote requirement.",
            "“President Obama is absolutely right,” Sanders said. “It is an outrage that modern-day poll taxes, gerrymandering, ID requirements, and other forms of voter suppression still exist today. We must pass a comprehensive agenda to guarantee the rights and dignity of everyone in this country. And that means, among other things, reauthorizing and expanding the Voting Rights Act, for which Congressman John Lewis put his life on the line.”",
            "“As President Obama said, if that requires us to eliminate the filibuster, then that is what we must do,” Sanders concluded."

            "“And, by the way, naming it the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, that is a fine tribute. But John wouldn’t want us to stop there, just trying to get back to where we already were. Once we pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, we should keep marching to make it even better.”",
            "Obama’s eulogy was an implicit rebuke of President Donald Trump as well as Chief Justice John Roberts, who wrote the Supreme Court opinion that gutted the Voting Rights Act in 2013 and whose defining achievement on the bench has been the erosion of voting rights.",

            "The former president traced the entire arc of Lewis’ long and storied career, which began when Lewis was on the front lines of the civil rights movement as a college student.",
            "“Sometimes we act as if this was inevitable. Imagine two people, Malia’s age, younger than my oldest daughter, on their own, to challenge an entire infrastructure of oppression,” Obama said. “John was only 20 years old, but he pushed all 20 of those years to the center of the table, betting everything, all of it, that his example could challenge centuries of convention and generations of brutal violence and countless daily indignities suffered by African Americans.”",
            "He went on to describe Lewis’ long congressional career and his work until the very end of his life.",
            "“As an old man, he didn’t sit out any fight,” Obama said. “He knew that the march is not over, that the race is not yet won.”",
            "Throughout the eulogy, Obama drew parallels between Lewis’ life’s work and the current political moment, including the violent police response to the anti-racism and anti-police brutality protests around the country this summer — showing how the past is prologue and that history continues to repeat itself.",
            "“He knew from his own life that progress is fragile, that we have to be vigilant against the darker currents of this country’s history, of our own history, where there are whirlpools of violence and hatred and despair that can always rise again,” Obama said.",
            "He referred to former Alabama governor and notorious segregationist George Wallace. “Today, we witness with our own eyes, police officers kneeling on the necks of black Americans. George Wallace may be gone, but we can witness our federal government sending agents to use tear gas and batons against peaceful demonstrators.”",
            "“We may no longer have to guess the number of jellybeans in a jar to cast a ballot. But even as we sit here, there are those in power who are doing their darnedest to discourage people from voting by closing polling locations and targeting minorities and students with restrictive ID laws and attacking our voting rights with surgical precision, even undermining the postal service in the run-up to an election that’s going to be dependent on mail-in ballots so people don’t get sick,” he continued.",
            "“I know this is a celebration of John’s life. There are some who might say we shouldn’t dwell on such things. But that’s why I’m talking about it,” Obama explained.",
            "On Thursday morning, Trump, who was not present at the service and who Lewis warned was not a “legitimate president,” falsely suggested he could move the date of the November election because the COVID-19 pandemic could mean that more people vote by mail.",
            "As he often does, Obama did not name Trump, but the current president loomed large as his predecessor warned of the importance of the November election and urged Americans not to take their right to vote for granted.",
            "“Even if we do all this, even if every bogus voter suppression law is struck off the books today, we’ve got to be honest with ourselves, that too many of us choose not to exercise the franchise,” Obama said. “We can’t treat voting as an errand to run if we have some time. We have to treat it as the most important action we can take on behalf of democracy — and like John, we have to give it all we have.”",
            "Obama also argued that while Lewis’ life was extraordinary, it also reflected the ways ordinary people can change the world. “America was built by John Lewises,” he said.",
            "“The life of John Lewis was, in so many ways, exceptional. It vindicated the faith in our founding, redeemed that faith, that most American of ideas, the idea that any of us, ordinary people without rank or wealth or title or fame, can somehow point out the imperfections of this nation and come together and challenge the status quo, and decide that it is in our power to remake this country that we love until it more closely aligns with our highest ideals,” Obama said.",
            "“What a radical idea,” he added. “What a revolutionary notion, this idea that any of us ordinary people, a young kid from Troy, can stand up to the powers and principalities, and say: ‘No, this isn’t right, this isn’t true, this isn’t just. We can do better.’”"

            "Customers visiting the Geek Squad desk at Best Buy weren’t always the most polite, recalls Sarah Tremblay, who worked at two store locations in Long Island, New York, until recently. They were often freaking out because their laptop or their phone wasn’t working.",
            "“No one is coming there because they’re having their best day, and they tend to take it out on you,” Tremblay told HuffPost recently. That was expected, but the sexual harassment, the assault, the stalking — that was not OK, she said.",
            "In a lawsuit filed in New York state court Thursday, Tremblay says she was repeatedly harassed by customers. Male customers groped her, kissed her and even stalked her, according to the complaint. A male colleague also made lewd comments. Tremblay repeatedly complained to her store manager, but he did nothing about her complaints.",
            "She reported the harassment to human resources at Best Buy headquarters in Richfield, Minnesota. They suggested she file a police report and even take a leave of absence to deal with the anxiety that Tremblay said she was experiencing. Yet, shortly after that, Tremblay was fired in 2018. The ostensible reason was that she had not sent all her customers online surveys about their shopping experience. She told her managers at the time that she only did this if a customer behaved poorly toward her.",
            "Tremblay was promoted several times over the years at Best Buy, her pay rising from $12.75 an hour to a little more than $20 by the time she left. She was even included in a group of retail employees who were fast-tracked for corporate roles. In her lawsuit, she says that she was let go in retaliation for complaining about mistreatment.",
            "“I was devastated,” she told HuffPost. Best Buy’s mistreatment was somehow worse than the harassment. “I felt hurt and betrayed. I never imagined I’d be retaliated against.”",
            "Best Buy did not respond immediately to HuffPost’s request for comment after the suit was filed on Thursday.",
            "Tremblay, age 34, had worked in retail for years by the time she got to the big-box consumer electronics store in 2014, but never experienced anything like the treatment she received working on the Geek Squad, she said.",
            "At her first store, men would make comments about her appearance, but she was often able to hide out in a back room. But when Tremblay transferred to a different location, things took a turn. The only woman on a team of 10, she was often singled out.",
            "On one occasion, in 2018, while helping a man with his laptop, the guy suddenly put his arm around her, grabbed her hip and forced his mouth onto her neck, “slobbering on it,” according to the filing.",
            "When she told her supervisor, he suggested she take a minute to compose herself before heading back out on the store floor. He didn’t summon security or take any kind of action, according to the complaint. The man returned a few hours later, snuck up behind Tremblay and whispered, “I love you,” in her ear.",
            "When Tremblay told her supervisor again what happened, he laughed, according to the complaint. “People are always trying to hug you, I didn’t think it bothered you so much,” he said, according to the complaint.",
            "She raised the issue with the store’s general manager and was told the harassment was part of working with the public. Her manager also told her that Black workers at Best Buy were often harassed and they’d learned to live with it. Tremblay said she was shocked. She called a corporate hotline, put her complaint in writing and sent it to an HR executive.",
            "Secret Court",
            "Two years after she had been working at Best Buy, Tremblay was forced to sign an agreement waiving her rights to sue the company. Until recently, her lawyers believed this meant she would have to take her case to arbitration — essentially a private courtroom where the company has the upper hand. However, in 2018, at the height of the MeToo movement, New York state banned forced arbitration in sexual harassment or discrimination cases.",
            "And earlier this month, New York state judge Louis Nock ruled in favor of a woman who was trying to sue luxury goods company LVMH Moet for sexual discrimination despite an arbitration agreement.",
            "Heartened, Tremblay’s lawyers at Brooklyn, New York, firm Crumiller P.C. decided to push forward with a lawsuit.",
            "“Our original plan was just to arbitrate, which we do regularly — it’s not optimal, but until last week, we understood that such agreements would be upheld, so we didn’t waste time going into court,” said Susan Crumiller, the firm’s founder. She expects that the issue of whether this case can go to court will be appealed.",
            "This is not the first time former Geek Squad members have complained about mistreatment. The company was sued by a former female employee for race and sex discrimination in New York City in 2016.",
            "Current and former Best Buy employees, do you have a story of harassment to share? Email emily.peck@huffpost.com.",
            "Last month, after nationwide protests over police brutality, Best Buy CEO Corrie Barry wrote an open letter pledging to “do better” when it comes to diversity and inclusion.",
            "Tremblay is hoping she means it.",
            "At the very least, even if her lawsuit doesn’t work out, Tremblay said she hoped the company would develop some kind of code of conduct for dealing with bad customer behavior.",
            "“Even some comic book stores have something like that,” she said.",
            "In an open letter to Barry that she wrote earlier this month ― when her lawsuit seemed destined for arbitration ― Tremblay asked to at least be able to argue her case in open court.",
            "“As a victim, being silenced is hard, on a personal level; but to think that my efforts could have no benefit to future female Best Buy employees, who may suffer exactly as I have suffered, is unspeakably disheartening,” she wrote. “It is the ultimate disempowerment.”"

(The gear is most commonly worn in health care settings, on top of a surgical mask or N-95 respirator). But interest seems to be growing: Google Trends data shows a large spike in searches for the term “face shields” over the last two months. And the new curiosity about face shields has raised questions about how well they protect against COVID-19.",

            "However, some experts — such as Eli Perencevich, a professor of internal medicine and epidemiology at the University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine — believe that face shields could potentially be more effective than cloth face masks in the community setting. In an opinion piece Perencevich co-authored for the Journal of the American Medical Association in April, he and his colleagues cited a 2014 study from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) that looked at how well face shields protected a simulated health care worker against influenza (a different respiratory virus). They found that the face shield reduced immediate viral exposure to the flu by 92% when worn within 6 feet of a cough.",
            "That said, there are no studies that examine how well face shields protect other individuals from the wearer’s own respiratory droplets, should they be infected — which is the main reason the CDC recommends facial coverings be worn in public in the first place.",
            "“We don’t have the research to say that [face shields] will offer protection for those around you, should you be sick,” Saskia Popescu, an infection prevention epidemiologist at George Mason University, told Self magazine.",
            "Face shields may offer some benefits...",
            "Though studies on the efficacy of face shields are limited, they may have some advantages over cloth face masks.",
            "They protect your eyes, in addition to the nose and mouth.",
            "A face mask covers the lower part of the face but leaves the eyes exposed.",
            "With a face shield, “you get the additional coverage of your eyes, another mucous membrane that may act as a portal of entry for the virus,” Erin Sorrell, an assistant research professor in Georgetown University’s department of microbiology and immunology, told HuffPost. “However, research needs to be done to quantify the risk for ocular route of exposure.”",
            "A proper face shield should extend down below the chin, around the sides of the head to the ears and have no gap between the headpiece and the forehead.",
            "They allow you to see people’s mouths and other facial expressions.",
            "We all depend on non-verbal communication — like facial expressions — when interacting with others. But the ability to read lips is particularly important for those who are hard of hearing.",
            "Krutika Kuppalli, an infectious diseases physician and vice chair of the IDSA Global Health Committee, had an ear injury a couple of years ago that affected her hearing. Working in environments where masks are necessary can be challenging at times, she said.",
            "“When people are wearing masks, you lose that ability to verbally read people’s mouths and the facial cues when they’re talking,” she said. ”When you lose that, it can make it very difficult to communicate.”",
            "They’re easier to clean and safely reuse.",
            "Disposable face coverings, like surgical masks, should be discarded after use. Cloth facial coverings can be reworn but need to be washed (ideally in a washing machine) and dried after each use, which takes time.",
            "“With face shields, you can reuse them indefinitely and they’re easily cleaned with soap and water or other household disinfectants,” Kuppalli said.",
            "They may be more comfortable to wear, making you less likely to touch your face.",
            "“People who wear these homemade cloth masks are invariably touching their face constantly to adjust it, and we know that touching your face is one routine mechanism for infecting you,” Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, told NBC News. “When you’re wearing a face shield, you’re less likely to touch your face.”",
            "Face shields may also be a more comfortable option for people who wear glasses or who have trouble breathing while wearing a mask, Sorrell added. Plus, pulling your mask up and down without washing your hands first can lead to contamination.",
            "“A properly worn face shield is much more effective than a face mask that is removed when speaking or worn under your nose or around your neck,” Sorrell said. “If you aren’t going to wear and use a face mask properly, you are not going to be protected or protect others.”",
            "...But they have other limitations and disadvantages, too.",
            "Unlike masks, which “provide a closer seal to the wearer’s face,” Sorrell said, face shields are open on the sides and bottom of the face, which may allow particles to seep in or out.",
            "“If you’re facing sideways or I’m behind you, maybe you’re sitting at a desk and I’m standing, there’s other scenarios you can imagine where droplets can come around a face shield,” William Lindsley, a NIOSH bioengineer who conducted the influenza study, told The New York Times.",
            "That’s why some public health officials recommend draping a piece of cloth along the bottom of the face shield to create a better barrier, Sorrell noted.",
            "While a face shield may do a good job at blocking larger viral particles, Lindsley said that cloth facial coverings or medical masks offer more protection from tinier ones.",
            "“A face shield is good against the really big stuff [particles] that you can kind of see,” he told NBC News. “But as the stuff gets smaller and smaller, it’s just easy for that to go around the face shield and be inhaled.”",
            "Until we have more research, a face mask is your best bet.",
            "“We don’t have enough large-scale data to show the true effectiveness of face shields against COVID-19 compared to face masks,” Sorrell said.",
            "For now, if you’re going to wear a face shield, you should do so in addition to — not in lieu of — a face mask.",
            "However, “the average person who wears a face mask correctly and maintains social distancing does not need the added layer of a face shield,” Sorrell noted.",
            "And, of course, any protective gear should be used in conjunction with other safety measures, such as physical distancing and frequent hand washing, not in place of them.",

            "“You’re never ready for the kind of news we are grappling with this morning,” Dan Calabrese, the editor of Cain’s website, wrote. “But we have no choice but to seek and find God’s strength and comfort to deal with it.",
            "“Herman Cain ― our boss, our friend, like a father to so many of us ― has passed away. He’s entering the presence of the Savior he’s served as an associate minister at Antioch Baptist Church in Atlanta for, and preparing for his reward.”",

            "His diagnosis came less than two weeks after he attended President Donald Trump’s campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Cain, who co-chaired Black Voices for Trump, tweeted a photo of himself without a mask at the event, which was attended by several thousand people.",
            "Calabrese pushed back on speculation at the time that Cain might have contracted the virus at Trump’s rally, noting he’d done plenty of traveling beforehand ― including to Arizona, where cases have soared.",
            "Cain joined Trump in actively campaigning against masks. In a tweet sent just before he was admitted to the hospital earlier this month, he praised Trump’s decision not to mandate mask-wearing at the president’s July 4 outdoor rally at Mount Rushmore.",
            "“Masks will not be mandatory for the event, which will be attended by President Trump,” Cain wrote. “PEOPLE ARE FED UP!”",

            "Cain rose to prominence in the Tea Party movement after a highly successful corporate career at Pillsbury, Burger King and finally as CEO of Godfather’s Pizza.",
            "His 2012 presidential run gained early traction, aided by the catchy simplicity of his “9-9-9” tax plan. He ultimately suspended the campaign, however, after sexual harassment charges resurfaced and he was accused of having an extramarital affair. Cain vehemently denied any wrongdoing amid the controversy.",
            "Trump offered his condolences to Cain’s family Thursday, eulogizing him on Twitter as “a Powerful Voice of Freedom and all that is good.”",

            "There’s no denying 2020 has been an unpredictable year. But in a very welcome twist, the 72nd Emmy Award nominations are pretty standard.",
            "On Tuesday, host Leslie Jones and virtual presenters Josh Gad, Tatiana Maslany and Laverne Cox announced the Television Academy’s Emmy nominees. “Watchmen” reigned supreme with 26 nominations, beloved “Schitt’s Creek” actors were honored and Netflix programs popped in all across the board.",
            "Still, there were plenty of snubs ― Merritt Wever! Reese Witherspoon! ― and a few exciting surprises ― Zendaya! Cousin Greg! Even “The Mandalorian”!",
            "Below, HuffPost reporters break them all down.",
            "SNUB: Reese Witherspoon, Lead Actress in a Drama Series and in a Limited Series or Movie",
            "Over the past few years, Reese Witherspoon has seemed like the most omnipresent actress working today. She had three shots at Emmy nominations this year: “The Morning Show,” “Big Little Lies” and “Little Fires Everywhere.” Maybe overexposure cursed her. Witherspoon lost out across the board, missing two potential shots in the drama field (“Morning,” “Lies”) and another for a limited series (“Fires”). All three shows were spotlighted in other categories, so it’s not as if voters didn’t appreciate the material. Still, her snootier-than-thou characters in “Big Little Lies” and “Little Fires Everywhere” were fairly similar, and co-star Jennifer Aniston outshined her in “The Morning Show” at every turn. Witherspoon, who has also become a producer extraordinaire, may have been the victim of industry fatigue. — Matthew Jacobs",
            "SURPRISE: Zendaya, Lead Actress in a Drama Series",
            "Zendaya was obviously phenomenal in Season 1 of HBO’s “Euphoria” as Rue, a recovering drug-addicted teenage girl navigating life and love. This is the kind of performance that should get an Emmy nomination. It was the first time we got to see Zendaya play a character with real edge, with complexity, with dark humor ― a far cry from her Disney Channel days. So yes, she should have been nominated but it’s kind of wild that she actually was. If you look at Emmy noms, especially for acting, they tend to stay very consistent, very safe ― you rarely see newcomers. But this year, the Emmys tied the number of nominees to the number of submissions, resulting in more slots in certain categories and offering up the chance for new faces. To see such a young first-time nominee from a show that was popular but also super divisive is pretty cool. ― Zeba Blay",
            "SNUB: Tom Pelphrey, Supporting Actor in a Drama Series",
            "Tom Pelphrey stole the show in “Ozark” Season 3 as Laura Linney’s on-screen brother Ben Davis, who grapples with bipolar disorder amid the tensions of his family’s drug cartel dealings. Although he was thought to be a shoo-in for a nomination, Pelphrey’s name was left out in a seriously stacked category. The roster of nominees includes Giancarlo Esposito (“Better Call Saul”), Matthew Macfadyen, Nicholas Braun and Kieran Culkin (“Succession”), Bradley Whitford (“The Handmaid’s Tale”), Billy Crudup and Mark Duplass (“The Morning Show”), and Jeffrey Wright (“Westworld”). ― Leigh Blickley",
            "SURPRISE: Nicholas Braun, Supporting Actor in a Drama Series",
            "As expected, the second season of HBO drama “Succession” got a lot of well-deserved Emmy love across the board, netting 18 nominations, which somehow still doesn’t seem like enough. As HuffPost’s resident Succession Correspondent, I was pleasantly surprised to see Nicholas Braun’s *chef’s kiss* performance as Cousin Greg included in the supporting actor category, alongside co-stars Kieran Culkin and Matthew Macfadyen, whose nominations had been more expected. As the misfit on the outside looking in at the Roy family and its business empire, Cousin Greg is both the show’s comic relief and as close to a moral center as it has. Whether he’s being pelted with water bottles, fumbling through congressional testimony, or raising concerns about the Roy family’s malfeasance, Braun carries it off with seamless aplomb. — Marina Fang",
            "SNUB: “Pose,” Drama Series",
            "While Billy Porter rightly received a nomination for his stellar performance as Pray Tell on the FX drama series “Pose,” it’s frustrating that for yet another year the rest of the “Pose” cast and creators have been snubbed. The show received no directing or writing noms, particularly for producer Janet Mock. MJ Rodriguez, arguably the heart of the show, has yet to be recognized for her acting. Neither have supporting stars Dominique Jackson or Indya Moore. Angelica Ross, who turned in a poignant and moving final performance as Candy, was the best thing about Season 2. It’s great that a gay Black man like Porter is receiving this kind of recognition. But given the fact that the majority of the characters and stories on “Pose” are about uplifting Black trans women, it’s a shame that these women (and non-binary folks like Moore) aren’t receiving an equal share of that recognition. ― ZB",
            "SNUB: “Late Night with Seth Meyers,” Variety Talk Series",
            "Emmys, it’s time for a closer look. Why have you yet again snubbed “Late Night with Seth Meyers” in the variety talk series category? The show repeatedly gets nominations for writing for a variety series, so we know you know it exists. Both awards go to John Oliver’s “Last Week Tonight” every year, rightfully so for that show’s ability to dive deep into various topics. But “Late Night” does deep dives multiple times per week with its “A Closer Look” segment. They have so many deep dives there’s now a pirate-like sea captain in the background of the show. Arrrr you kidding me, Emmys? Additionally, “Late Night” writer Amber Ruffin’s poignant segments recalling disturbing police encounters are in a league of their own when it comes to late-night TV. Emmys, by snubbing “Late Night,” you just lost all credibility. Ya burnt. — Bill Bradley",
            "SURPRISE: Octavia Spencer, Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie",
            "I’m mostly surprised by this because I couldn’t get through “Self-Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J. Walker.” Several writers have articulated — better than I can in this blurb — their problems with the series overall. I suppose Spencer did as well as anyone could with the script. But the series was full of Black stereotypes and didn’t do justice to Madam C.J. Walker’s story and legacy. Just ask her great-great-granddaughter, A’Lelia Bundles. ― Erin E. Evans",
            "SNUB: Pamela Adlon and “Better Things,” Comedy Series",
            "Creator, writer, director and star Pamela Adlon’s heartfelt, deeply lived-in FX comedy is consistently daring in its format-breaking episodes and singular vision, so it was maddening to see the entire show, but especially Adlon, excluded.",
            "In the sixth episode of its most recent season, Adlon’s character, Sam, goes to New Orleans to attend a friend’s wedding. The dream-like episode takes place over one weekend, following Sam as she day-drinks, takes in street performances and gazes at the ornate houses in the Garden District. As viewers, we, like Sam, get to escape. Coincidentally, the episode aired during the height of the COVID-19 quarantine, lending it an added sense of longing and wistfulness. The gorgeous episode perfectly encapsulated what makes the show and Adlon’s vision so great. — MF",
            "SNUB: Zoë Kravitz, Lead Actress in a Comedy Series",
            "Many more people likely watched Zoë Kravitz get away with murder on “Big Little Lies,” but it’s downright criminal that she wasn’t recognized for her performance on Hulu’s “High Fidelity” reboot. Kravitz takes the mic from John Cusack as the melancholic record store owner Rob in a reimagining of the 2000 comedy, which also starred her mother, Lisa Bonet. But that’s where the comparisons end. Instead of churning out another derivative reboot, the creators reinvented the story of a lovelorn music fiend not only to suit Kravitz’s strengths but also to show us her potential. Here the actor not only carries the emotional weight of the series, as her character traverses her romantic history, but she’s also allowed, for once, to be funny, trading barbs with friends, fuckboys and future soulmates alike. Her performance is incredibly lived-in, as the series forgoes traditional pacing for an endearing hang-out vibe, which finally allows Kravitz to relax into her many talents. ― Cole Delbyck",
            "SURPRISE: Paul Mescal, Lead Actor in a Limited Series or Movie",
            "In a slight twist, Paul Mescal earned a lead actor nomination for his nuanced portrayal of Connell in Hulu’s “Normal People.” Slipping by the likes of Russell Crowe (“The Loudest Voice”) and Aaron Paul (“El Camino”), Mescal proves you don’t need to be an established Hollywood actor to earn some well-deserved recognition. His heart-wrenching and honest performance in “Normal People” deserves all the praise. ― LB",
            "SNUB: “The Good Fight,” Drama Series",
            "Once again, the Emmys failed to recognize that “The Good Fight” is one of the best shows on TV. Having recently concluded its fourth season, the starry “Good Wife” spin-off has been lost in the netherworld of CBS All Access, which is a shame because Christine Baranski, Delroy Lindo, Audra McDonald, Cush Jumbo and Sarah Steele just delivered series-best work. The lack of attention paid to “Fight” is evidence of the overall streaming bloat. A program this great should not be a throwaway. — MJ",
            "SNUB: Susan Kelechi Watson, Supporting Actress in a Drama Series",
            "Justice for Susan Kelechi Watson! She still hasn’t been nominated for an Emmy for her role as Beth Pearson in the addictive and emotional roller-coaster series “This Is Us.” Yet she continues to wow in her role just as much as her on-screen husband, Sterling K. Brown, who earned another nomination this year. — EEE",
            "SNUB: Merritt Wever and Kaitlyn Dever, Lead and Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or Movie",
            "In “Unbelievable,” the consistently great Merritt Wever shines as a tireless, patient and compassionate police detective trying to connect the dots in a series of sexual assault cases. Kaitlyn Dever, who has proven that she’s one of the most versatile young actors working today, plays a sexual assault survivor in an investigation completely mishandled by a different police department. Both give quietly powerful performances in the Netflix limited series, which treads carefully in illuminating sexual trauma without sensationalizing it and which was widely hailed as one of the best shows of 2019. While the limited series categories have become impossibly competitive, these two omissions are just so glaring. The Emmys recently expanded the comedy and drama series categories because there is so much more good TV these days. I wish they’d do the same here. — MF",
            "SURPRISE: “The Mandalorian,” Drama Series",
            "The Force is stronger with “The Mandalorian” — referred to from here on as “The Baby Yoda Show” — than we thought. Even more unlikely than a helmet-haired bounty hunter teaming up with a 50-year-old green baby, somehow “The Baby Yoda Show” eked out a nomination for outstanding drama series. What? Star Pedro Pascal’s armor must have some stealth mode because “The Baby Yoda Show” wasn’t really on the radar in that category, which also includes “Better Call Saul,” “The Crown,” “The Handmaid’s Tale,” “Killing Eve,” “Ozark,” “Stranger Things” and “Succession.” But the live-action “Star Wars” series has a lot of heart, and a lot of Baby Yoda, which clearly connected with fans and critics. (The show received 15 noms overall.) Now all that’s left is to get Baby Yoda a nod for best actor in “The Baby Yoda Show” Season 2. Do or do not, Emmys. There is no try. — BB",
            "SNUB: “Never Have I Ever,” Comedy Series",
            "“Never Have I Ever” isn’t historically the type of show the Emmys would recognize: It’s a Netflix teen rom-com, with a mostly non-white cast featuring a lead performance from an actor with no prior credits. While none of those things should be disqualifying, they’re perhaps likely why the Mindy Kaling-created series, which has much more to offer than your average high school comedy, was overlooked across major categories. Beneath the surface, there is a quietly revolutionary story that finally puts an Indian American teen (Maitreyi Ramakrishnan) at the forefront, as the series explore topics like grief, marriage and identity through an intergenerational lens. While Ramakrishnan is certainly the breakout star, Poorna Jagannathan’s turn as her widowed mother struggling to parent her daughter and keep herself afloat stuck with me long after the final episode. It’s a powerful counterpoint to the tired Indian mother stereotypes we’ve seen onscreen before and a performance that deserves to be in future awards contention. ― CD",
            "SNUB: Kay Oyegun, “The Dinner and the Date” for “This Is Us,” Writing for a Drama Series",
            "I still think about this episode of “This Is Us,” especially the conversation between Malik’s parents, Darnell and Kelly (portrayed perfectly by Omar Epps and Marsha Stephanie Blake), and Beth and Randall (Susan Kelechi Watson and Sterling K. Brown). It felt exactly like a real conversation among Black parents, with cutting dialogue and subtle jabs, who will say and do anything to protect their children. When Darnell pulls off his shirt to reveal his tattoos and reads Randall for filth, I lived and died all in the same moment. — EEE",
            "SNUB: “Survivor,” Competition Program",
            "After a controversial Season 39 last fall, 2020 marked the return of the glory days of “Survivor.” “Winners at War,” earned the series its highest ratings in years and entertained quarantined viewers as it featured 20 former champions battling it out for the title of “best of the best” and a $2 million prize. Although the long-running reality series hasn’t been nominated in the competition program category since 2006, the highly entertaining Season 40 ― starring the likes of Yul Kwon, Sandra Diaz-Twine, Rob Mariano, Parvati Shallow, Jeremy Collins and Tony Vlachos ― deserved a bit more recognition. (At least there’s still “Top Chef.”) ― LB",
            "SNUB: “The Clark Sisters: First Ladies of Gospel,” Limited Series or Movie",
            "This Lifetime biopic about the legendary gospel group The Clark Sisters should have been nominated for best television movie. At the peak of the pandemic — in New York City, anyway — watching this movie felt truly like the communal balm a lot of us needed, especially if you grew up in the Black church. Aunjanue Ellis truly embodied the spirit and tenacity of Dr. Mattie Moss Clark, the matriarch of the Clark family who helped them reach superstardom status. She deserves some recognition as well. ― EEE",
            "SURPRISE: Quibi, Short Form categories",
            "Quibi, Jeffrey Katzenberg’s struggling streaming platform that launched smack in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic, earned 10 nominations in the short form categories. Yep. That’s all. ― LB",
            "Despite Hollywood’s continued shutdown amid the coronavirus pandemic, the Emmys are moving forward with a presumed virtual ceremony hosted by Jimmy Kimmel on ABC Sept. 20."

            "Pence’s office did not publicize the meeting nor respond to requests for comment, but several members of the group tweeted Tuesday evening that the meeting had just occurred. “Just finished a great meeting with Vice President Mike Pence and his Chief of Staff,” wrote James Todaro, a member of the group who trained as an ophthalmologist. “We are doing everything to restore the power of medicine back to doctors. Doctors everywhere should be able to prescribe Hydroxychloroquine without repercussions or obstruction.”",
            "Todaro, who also presents himself as a cryptocurrency entrepreneur, co-authored a widely circulated Google Docs file proclaiming the benefits of hydroxychloroquine in March. It claimed to be affiliated with Stanford Medical University and several other institutions, but HuffPost reported in March that wasn’t true. Google removed the document for violating its terms of service, but not before it gained the attention of Fox News and other right-wing media outlets, which began promoting the document. Trump advocated for the drug shortly after.",
            "The Monday press conference by America’s Frontline Doctors, whose website went live only days ago and is now offline as of Wednesday, contained numerous pieces of potentially harmful misinformation, including falsely claiming a “cure” for COVID-19 and telling people they don’t need masks.",
            "Simone Gold, who founded the group, is a frequent guest on Fox News and has spoken at anti-lockdown rallies around the country. Gold tweeted that she and other members had met with Pence to advocate for hydroxychloroquine and discuss “censorship of doctors.” (Gold did not respond to a request for comment from HuffPost.)",
            "Despite the lack of evidence for the medical claims in the video and highly questionable expertise of some of the group’s members, the White House appears to be lending it legitimacy by inviting the group to meet with Pence. In addition to Pence meeting with the group this week, Trump also praised the video in a Tuesday press conference.",
            "Hydroxychloroquine has become a fixture among right-wing media and anti-lockdown activists following Trump’s early promotion of the drug in March as a “game changer.” Although the drug is still being studied, several high-quality studies have shown that hydroxychloroquine provides no benefit in treating COVID-19. Both the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health have warned about use of the drug or abandoned trials due to unlikelihood of success, and the government’s own top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, stated on Tuesday that evidence suggests it is not an effective treatment.",
            "“The overwhelming prevailing clinical trials that have looked at the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine have indicated that it is not effective in coronavirus disease,” Fauci said.",
            "The America’s Frontline Doctors group heavily promoted the use of the drug at their event, which was organized by Tea Party Patriots, a wealthy Republican donor-backed nonprofit organization that has partnered with other right-wing dark money groups to form a coalition pushing for the rapid reopening of the United States economy.",
            "Many of those groups, including Tea Party Patriots itself, received substantial funding from the conservative megadonor Charles Koch and his late brother David. Marc Short, Pence’s chief of staff who also attended the meeting, was a longtime president of Freedom Partners, which is the Koch political operation’s main fundraising vehicle.",
            "There was no mention from the group’s social media if the Pence meeting included Dr. Stella Immanuel, an evangelical minister and pediatrician who has promoted bizarre claims that extraterrestrial DNA is used in medical treatments, blamed satanic influence for a range of ills and warned that dream-world sex with demons can make you sick. Immanuel claimed during the press conference to have cured hundreds of patients using hydroxychloroquine, but has provided no proof for her statements.",
            "Trump, whose reelection chances have grown increasingly poor as the pandemic goes on and case numbers in the United States continue to grow, has returned to promoting hydroxychloroquine as a potential quick fix solution. Trump offered support for the doctors group and specifically described Immanuel as “very impressive” during his Tuesday press conference.",
            "As Trump offered praise for the fringe group, coronavirus deaths in the United States surpassed 150,000 people on Wednesday, the largest death toll in the world and one of the highest rates per capita. Several states reported record-high average deaths this week, as cases continued to surge.",

            "President Donald Trump’s press conference quickly unraveled on Tuesday as he struggled to defend a video he’d retweeted that is full of false claims about the coronavirus and complained about his low approval rating.",
            "Reporters asked Trump repeated questions about his continued support for hydroxychloroquine as a COVID-19 treatment a day after he retweeted several conspiracy theories about the drug. Multiple clinical trials have found hydroxychloroquine is not an effective coronavirus treatment, despite the president’s suggestions to the contrary.",
            "“Many doctors think it is extremely successful,” Trump claimed when asked about the retweets, adding, “I happen to believe in it. I would take it. As you know, I took it for a 14-day period, and I’m here. ... It’s safe. It doesn’t cause problems.”",
            "Trump was also forced to answer for a video he retweeted on Monday that showed a group of self-proclaimed medical experts claiming that social distancing and masks were not necessary to curb the spread of COVID-19 and alleging that officials were suppressing the use of hydroxychloroquine for political reasons. The event was hosted and funded by the right-wing nonprofit Tea Party Patriots, which has been organizing projects to promote that narrative.",
            "A reporter pointed out to Trump ― who’d just recently encouraged Americans to wear protective masks (in line with Dr. Anthony Fauci and other real experts in infectious diseases) ― that one of the main doctors featured in the video is a full-blown conspiracy theorist: “She’s also made videos saying that doctors make medicine using DNA from aliens and that they’re trying to create a vaccine to make you immune from becoming religious.”",
            "The president all but shrugged his shoulders.",
            "“She was on air, along with many other doctors,” Trump said. “They were big fans of hydroxychloroquine, and I thought she was very impressive. ... She said that she’s had tremendous success with hundreds of different patients.”",
            "In reality, studies have found that hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug, is not effective for COVID-19 treatment or prevention. After Trump began touting it in March, leading to panic-buying of the medication, the Food and Drug Administration had to post a caution against anyone using it to treat COVID-19 outside a hospital or clinical setting ― because it can trigger serious heart rhythm problems. The doctors speaking in the video presented no evidence of any patients they’ve successfully treated.",
            "After fumbling through his answer about the video, Trump quickly walked off the podium, ending the briefing after less than 30 minutes. In the past, his coronavirus-related briefings have lasted for over an hour.",
            "But the president appeared eager to wrap up the event on Tuesday, complaining several times that he was being unfairly maligned. At one point he suggested that health experts were not backing hydroxychloroquine to spite him.",
            "“It doesn’t seem to be too popular,” Trump said of the drug. “You know why? Because I recommend it. When I recommend something, they like to say don’t use it.”",
            "Trump, who typically maintains that he’s very well-liked by voters, also complained to reporters that Fauci, the country’s leading infectious disease expert who frequently contradicts Trump, is more popular than he is.",
            "“He’s got this high approval rating, so why don’t I have a high approval rating with respect ― and the administration ― with respect to the virus? We should have it very high,” Trump said.",
            "“They’re highly thought of,” he said of Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx, who are both on the White House’s coronavirus task force. “But nobody likes me. It can only be my personality, that’s all.”",
            "Only about one-third of the public approves of the federal government’s response to the pandemic, a new HuffPost/YouGov survey found last week, marking a new low. Trump’s ratings on the pandemic are similarly dismal, with just 38% of the public approving and 58% disapproving."

            "Democratic National Committee delegates voted 105-60 against including marijuana legalization in the party platform on Monday.",
            "The draft version of the platform supports decriminalizing marijuana use and legalizing medical marijuana, adding that it should be left up to the states “to make their own decisions about recreational use.”",
            "The platform was unlikely to ever endorse full legalization, since Joe Biden, the presumptive nominee, does not back the policy. He supports federal decriminalization, which would take away incarceration for possession.",
            "But Dennis Obduskey, a delegate who introduced the legalization amendment during the meeting of the DNC’s platform committee, noted that the current document is a step back from the 2016 platform, which supported “providing a reasoned pathway for future legalization.”",
            "Both Obduskey and Iowa County Supervisor Stacey Walker, who served as a member of the joint Biden-Bernie Sanders criminal justice task force, argued that the current federal laws disproportionately affect Black people.",
            "“I’m imploring all of you to approach this with an open mind and heart. Do something big here,” Walker said. “Take one small but meaningful step toward changing the course of history. If my Black life matters to you, you will consider this amendment. We want to get in good trouble today, and I urge you to do the right thing and support it.”",
            "A 15-person panel, including backers of both Biden and Sanders, initially put together the 80-page platform. Many of the planks came directly from the recommendations of the joint policy task forces the two teams put together this summer as an effort to show a united front against President Donald Trump.",
            "On Monday, the official platform committee of about 180 delegates met virtually to further make changes to the document. The next step is for the nearly 4,000 members of the DNC to vote by mail on whether to ratify it ahead of next month’s national convention.",
            "Public support for marijuana legalization has steadily risen, with about 66% of Americans backing it. It’s even more popular with Democrats (76%) and is legal in 11 states plus the District of Columbia.",
            "John Fetterman, the progressive lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania, was shocked last week when he saw that the draft platform didn’t back legalization, as he expressed on Twitter.",
            "DNC delegates also overwhelmingly opposed an amendment backing “Medicare for All,” the health care system pushed by Sanders allies. At least 600 delegates have pledged to oppose the party platform if it doesn’t include support for the policy, although that won’t be enough members to block ratification.",
            "In the initial drafting process, however, Sanders allies did get a nod to Medicare for All into the platform, which they considered a victory. It states that the “party welcomes advocates who want to build on and strengthen the Affordable Care Act and those who support a Medicare for All approach; all are critical to ensuring that health care is a human right.”"

            "In a video posted to Twitter Wednesday afternoon, Gohmert said he tested positive for the virus during a routine test given to him upon his arrival at the White House earlier that morning. He said he is asymptomatic and that he has been wearing a mask in recent days, including during Tuesday’s House Judiciary Committee hearing with Attorney General William Barr.",
            "“I’ve worn a mask more in the last week or two than I have in the whole last four months,” he said, then suggested that his mask may have inadvertently caused his infection since he was frequently adjusting it with his hands.",
            "“I can’t help wonder if that puts some germs in the mask,” he said. “Now that I apparently have it, I will be very, very careful to make sure that I don’t give it to anybody else.”",

            "“But I’m also sorry [for] my members who are concerned because he has been showing up at meetings without a mask and making a thing of it,” she added. “Hopefully, now, he will look after his health and others.”",
            "Gohmert, an eight-term representative, said last month that he would not wear a facial covering, which health officials recommend to prevent the virus’s spread. He argued in an interview with CNN that he is tested regularly for the virus and has never had it.",

            "If only. Nearly five months into the pandemic, the virus is clearly here to stay. Summer, sadly, isn’t a magic bullet. As temperatures rise, COVID-19 cases, deaths and hospitalizations are also on the rise in several states. A vaccine is still a hypothetical. Some experts say widespread mask-wearing could slow down infection rates, but the battle over face masks in public has only intensified. It’s all very concerning, to say the least.",
            "Still, those concerns haven’t stopped many Americans from looking for means to escape. Over the weekend, videos posted to social media showed massive crowds gathered in front of the stage at a Chainsmokers concert in the Hamptons in New York.

            "“If you do break social distancing, consider not posting photos of your group hang or your mask-free beach day,” Pietzman said. “Not because you’ll get dragged — though you might! — but because of the effect it has on your followers.”",
            "It’s weird to see people partying it up, going to Florida’s Walt Disney World or New York’s Fire Island in the middle of a pandemic. But as Peitzman said in his Twitter thread, what’s weirder is forcing yourself to square those images with your own begrudged acceptance of reality. What pandemic are they living in? Because it’s certainly not everyone’s.",
            "“My reaction to these photos is often anger, but buried under that’s a seed of doubt,” Peitzman wrote. “I spend all day reading studies and tracking the numbers of new cases and hospitalizations and deaths, and STILL, I see enough maskless pics and think, maybe I’m the crazy one. It wears you down.”",
            "In spite of warnings from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, people clearly have very different takes on what is safe to do and what’s too risky. That’s especially true of younger generations. The belief up until now has generally been that younger people were less likely to have severe consequences from exposure to the coronavirus, which has led some to behave as if they’re invincible. That’s a dangerous gambit; as the first wave of the virus begins to resurge, the average age of U.S. coronavirus patients is actually shifting lower.",

            "Quarantine fatigue has many of us subscribing to a kind of magical thinking.",

            "It’s foolish for several reasons. You may have put your faith in “herd immunity” and say, “If I get it, I get it, I can’t stop living my life anymore.” But what about your family? Newman asked.",

            "“More collective communities focus on what is beneficial to others or to the community at large,” Wesner said. “This relates to something as simple as deciding to wear a face mask. Deciding not to wear a face mask, despite the recommendations shows that I’m thinking about my own wants and needs and that I’m not demonstrating care or concern for others or how my decisions will impact others.”",

We’ve never needed a break so badly: We’re working without respite ― or if we were laid off earlier in the pandemic, we’re exhaustively looking for work. To add insult to injury, we’re seeing other countries that have had a better handle on the virus start to reopen with few hiccups. “Why can’t that be us?” we think.",

            "“There are many situations in life that are so difficult, stressful or traumatic that going to a place in which we pretend problems aren’t there or things aren’t as bad can be helpful psychologically,” she said. “We need hope, we need a sense of belonging. And sometimes the facts don’t give us that.”",
            "But denial also means we underestimate risk, which can end up creating a more dangerous situation, Aldao said. When we crave escapism, it’s really about finding a healthy balance between escape and reality.",
            "“A little bit of distraction ― or perhaps some denial ― can be helpful at times, but ultimately, we grow and thrive when we face those things that are difficult,” Aldao said.",
            "“In the case of COVID, understanding the risks we take and being OK with that ... is a more balanced, psychologically healthy approach than pretending the risk is zero,” she explained.",

            "The book asserts that the brothers’ division began with the Duke of Cambridge’s comments about Harry’s new relationship with Meghan Markle. William apparently worried that Harry was “blindsided by lust,” when he first met the “Suits” actor, and cautioned him against moving too fast.",
            "“Don’t feel you need to rush this,” William cautioned his brother, according to the book excerpts. “Take as much time as you need to get to know this girl.”",
            "Harry was put off by the talk ― particularly the words “this girl” ― and “could see through William’s words,” the authors wrote. An anonymous friend quoted in the book said of William: “He was being a snob.”",
            "The brothers became distanced after the talk, and invites from the Cambridges for Harry to see his niece and nephew “dried up,” the book says. The relationship became even more strained after Harry and Meghan’s royal wedding.",
            "Royal aides and courtiers also apparently had a lot to say about Meghan when she arrived on the scene. The book says some palace employees distrusted her and called her “Harry’s showgirl.” One said “she comes with a lot of baggage,” according to the book.",

The majority of the stuff is created out of nothing but as brothers, you know, you have good days, you have bad days.”\n\nBradby spoke about the brothers’ relationship in an interview with “Good Morning Britain” in January.\n\n“There are lots of people, who would love there to be ― including I think the brothers themselves ― love them to be closer again,” Bradby said. “And with any luck that will happen. But with families, we all know stuff happens, things are said.”\n\nOn the day of Bradby’s interview, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced their plans to step back as working members of the royal family and pursue financial independence. They officially stepped down on March 31 and have been staying in Los Angeles with their son Archie.",

            "authors": "Carol Kuruvilla",
            "date": "2020-07-26"
        },
        "articleContent": [
            "Robert Jones, CEO of the Public Religion Research Institute, comes from a line of white American Christians that stretches back before the Revolutionary War. His ancestors weren’t large plantation owners or Confederate generals, or ― as far as he knows ― active members of the Ku Klux Klan. For much of his life, Jones believed the “unremarkable” nature of his family’s background meant that white supremacy wasn’t a part of their history.",
            "But he’s recently started to tell a different kind of story ― one that acknowledges that white privilege shaped his family’s sojourn on American soil.",
            "His ancestors were wealthy enough to own slaves, Jones said. The family settled in Georgia on land the government seized from indigenous Creek and Cherokee people. They became Southern Baptists, part of a denomination founded in 1845 on the belief that it was perfectly moral for Christians to be slave owners.",
            "Decades later, after Jones’s great-grandfather was killed in a clay mining accident, co-workers allegedly killed an innocent Black worker in retaliation. Jones still remembers how satisfied his great-uncle appeared while retelling that story, as if this arbitrary and unjustified act of racial violence helped balance the scales after a white man’s death.",
            "It wouldn’t be hard for many white Christians to find examples of white supremacy’s claims on their own family’s trees, Jones said. But white Christians’ image of themselves and their religion has been warped by what Jones calls “white-supremacy-induced amnesia.”",
            "Jones wrestles with that amnesia in his new book, “White Too Long: The Legacy of White Supremacy in American Christianity.” He argues that white Christians ― from evangelicals in the South to mainline Protestants in the Midwest to Catholics in the Northeast ― weren’t just complacent onlookers while political leaders debated what to do about slavery, segregation and discrimination. White supremacist theology played a key role in shaping the American church from the very beginning, influencing not just the way denominations formed but also white Christians’ theology about salvation itself.",
            "HuffPost spoke with Jones about his book earlier in July. Just as his own family history would be incomplete without acknowledging the influences of white supremacy, Jones said it’s impossible to talk about American Christianity without recognizing that racism helped shape the church.",
            "How did your own eyes open to the ways that white Christianity and white supremacy are entangled?",
            "I grew up in Jackson, Mississippi. I was deeply immersed in white Southern Baptist evangelical culture. I was that kid who was always at church, four to five times a week. I have a degree from a Southern Baptist college, and I have a Master of Divinity degree from a Southern Baptist seminary. But it wasn’t until I was in grad school in my 30s that I really began to examine the history of my denomination’s direct ties to slavery.",
            "Along with that, in my day job as CEO of PRRI, we’re repeatedly confronted with public opinion data that suggests white Christians really have a blind spot in seeing racial injustice and particularly structural racism. So it was a combination of really reckoning with my own family’s history, together with seeing patterns in the data that just made it so clear that this is not a story of some distant past, but this is very much still in the DNA of white Christianity today.",
            "So what is the story that white Christians tell themselves about the church’s relationship to white supremacy?",
            "They tell themselves that their version of Christianity is God’s means of bringing salvation to the lost world. That they are the embodiment of everything that is good about America, that they are pillars of the community. But that story doesn’t stand up to very much scrutiny.",
            "Along with the good that white Christian churches have done — building hospitals, orphanages and other civic institutions — they have also pronounced the blessings of God on slavery. They were the main legitimizers of a massive resistance to civil rights and have very consistently been on the wrong side of those issues. You can certainly point to the abolitionist movement and say, yes, that has Christian roots. But the bigger picture is that there were many, many more white Christians resisting desegregation than were on the abolitionists’ side of things.",
            "The legacy of this ― the proof in the pudding ― is what public opinion looks like today. White Christians ― evangelicals, mainline Protestants and Catholics ― are 30 percentage points more likely than religiously unaffiliated whites to say the Confederate flag is more a symbol of Southern pride than a symbol of racism. If you ask whether the killings of Black men by police are isolated incidents or part of a pattern, white Christians are twice as likely as religiously unaffiliated whites to say these are isolated instances. They have a very difficult time connecting the dots and seeing the structural justice issues at stake.",
            "You spend some time in the book explaining that white mainline Protestants and white Catholics were also complicit in white supremacy. Why did you feel that it was important to point that out?",
            "It’s important not to dismiss this as a question of Southern culture. In the book, I developed a racism index, a broad index of 15 different racial attitude questions. I put those into a statistical model that controlled for things like Southern regionalism, Republican identity, education level, all kinds of things that could be driving these attitudes that have nothing to do with Christian identity. Even when I controlled for all of those things, white Christian identity in itself is directly connected to racist attitudes.",
            "Some of this data gets dismissed by white Christians who say those numbers are muddied because they include people who just claim to be Christian but never darken the door of a church. But the data refutes that quite soundly. In fact, among white Christians overall, there’s a positive relationship between their religious identity and holding more racist views. Perhaps most disturbing is that among white evangelicals, the relationship between holding racist views and white Christian identity is actually stronger among more frequent church attenders. That ought to be a cause for a deep soul-searching among white Christians overall and among white evangelicals in particular.",
            "How do you think racism helped shape white American Christians’ theology about salvation?",
            "I think it’s helpful to go back and imagine what early church history in the U.S. looked like in the colonies. There was this sense that white people were God’s chosen instruments to civilize the U.S. and the world. It would not be unusual for white slave owners to bring enslaved people to church with them on Sunday morning. Whites would sit in the front and enslaved people would sit in the back. That context certainly shapes the way Christian theology and practices form. You’re not going to preach a lot of liberation, freedom and equality from the pulpit. You’re going to preach more about obedience to the master and fulfilling your roles, those kinds of things. I think that fundamentally distorted American white Christianity from the beginning.",
            "One of the ways this happened is that salvation became this very hyper-individualized concept. So it becomes about a person’s individual relationship to God through Jesus, and it’s very much about personal morality and piety. It was this very privatized and cordoned off way of thinking about spirituality and Christianity. This developed by necessity and by design, as a way of thinking about salvation that would be consistent with a world that was already committed to the idea of white supremacy.",
            "I’d like to get your thoughts on how white supremacy influenced how white Christians think about the purpose of government. In my own reporting, I’ve seen white evangelical Christians express the idea that, when it comes to issues such as immigration and policing, it’s the government’s God-given duty to keep the country safe, while it’s individual Christians’ duty to be charitable and care for the poor. Do you think this way of thinking has racist roots?",
            "I do think whenever white Christians declare or draw lines between what is biblical and what is political, I would look for white supremacy to be at work. This kind of boundary drawing is a way of delegitimizing certain kinds of claims and privileging other kinds of claims. One of the most prominent recent examples is from the 1960s, when the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. and other African American ministers were using churches as places for civil rights organizing.",
            "Jerry Falwell Sr. came out and said that this was not a legitimate thing for a pastor to be doing, that pastors should only be preaching the gospel from the pulpit, that these kinds of organizing things are political and shouldn’t be the concern of the church. Not too many years later, Falwell suddenly changed his mind. The one thing that really made him change his tune on this was that Bob Jones University, an evangelical university, was threatened with losing its federal funding because it didn’t allow interracial relationships. Evangelicals at the time were making very explicit claims defending the separation of races, and all of a sudden, that was a biblical issue.",
            "What is biblical, what is political, often tends to be driven by self-interest. In the case of white Christian churches, I think it’s always appropriate to ask, “What kind of interest is that? Is it an interest that is privileging the position of white Americans over Americans of color?” And if it is, then it’s a straightforwardly white supremacist interest that’s being reflected in those distinctions.",
            "There still seems to be a lot of skepticism and resistance in white Christian spaces to words such as “social justice,” “white privilege” and “systemic racism.” At the same time, over the past few weeks, I’ve seen evangelical news sites emphasizing reconciliation, forgiveness, people coming together. Where do you think that comes from?",
            "The easiest thing for white Christians to reach for is reconciliation. While I think that’s a laudable goal, if it’s reached for too quickly, I think it’s actually disingenuous. Too often, the formula for white Christians is white apology or lament plus Black forgiveness equals reconciliation. What’s missing in that equation is any conversation about justice and repair. If you’re a white Christian, heading straight for reconciliation is the quickest way to protect the status quo without doing the hard work and without really dealing with the past.",
            "It’s surprising to me in some ways because if there’s anything I heard and that white Christian churches emphasize is this idea of repentance. But repentance, in the biblical sense of the word, is never just about apology. It’s about making things right. I think the real test of authenticity for white Christians who want to lament this past is whether they’re willing to walk through the valley of repair and justice in order to get to that destination of reconciliation or whether they want to skip that part of the journey.",
            "How do you think white Christian churches have responded to George Floyd’s death and the Black Lives Matter protests? Do you think the message is sticking, or are you seeing more evidence of what you call in the book the “white Christian shuffle”?",
            "I called it the white Christian shuffle because there does tend to be this one step forward, two steps back movement. Particularly at moments like this one, where there’s a high social expectation that something will be said, something will be done, the question is whether it’s something authentic or something to just check the box and move on.",
            "In my home state of Mississippi, the legislature finally voted to remove the Confederate battle flag from the state flag. Before that happened, the Mississippi Baptist Convention had a press conference and actually called on the legislature to do that. Now that’s a pretty big deal. But in my view, we can’t pretend we’ll get on the right side of the battles around symbols without dealing with the way white Christians built white supremacy into their theology and for so many years used Christian theology as a way to legitimize the worldview that put those monuments up in the first place.",
            "What do you think it would it look like if white Christians began reckoning with that theology?",
            "Part of what I hope the book will do is help white Christians tell a truer story about themselves. If it’s an older church, the questions are pretty obvious: “Where were we on the issue of civil rights? Where were we on the integration of our own congregation? Where are we now on the issue of mass incarceration?” Even for newer congregations that are predominantly white, it’s worth interrogating things as simple as, “Are we in an all-white suburb, and if so, why? Has there been a conversation about police killings of African Americans or about Black Lives Matter that isn’t just about the dangers of rioting but actually about the pain that African Americans are feeling at this moment?”",
            "The second step after that reflection is to ask, “How can we be in community with African Americans and other people of color in our communities? How can we be allies on issues of racial justice?” Those conversations themselves will begin to challenge some of the ways in which white Christian theology has blinded white Christians to these issues.",
            "A defensive reaction is a real temptation for white Christians at the moment. One of the biggest moves white Christians could make is to try to find some deep sense of humility and to listen and resist the urge to rebut and defend and to try to take in the witness that our African American brothers and sisters are trying to bring to white Christians.",
            "This interview was condensed and edited for clarity.",
            "CORRECTION: Due to transcription errors, this article previously misstated the number of questions on Jones’ racism index, and how much more likely white Christians are to say the Confederate flag is a symbol of Southern pride rather than racism."

            "The “Old Guard” star has cemented herself as one of the foremost action stars around, but she long had to prove that she could run faster, kick harder and drive better than her male co-stars.",
            "Take for instance, the 2003 remake of “The Italian Job,” for which Theron recently revealed she was scheduled to train for six weeks longer than her male co-stars, including Wahlberg, Jason Statham and Edward Norton.",
            "“There was a real pressure to pull off those stunts with the actors. … There was a very unfair process that went with that,” Theron said in a Comic-Con at Home career retrospective. “I was the only woman with a bunch of guys, and I remember vividly getting the schedule in our preproduction, and they had scheduled me for six weeks more car training than any of the guys. It was just so insulting.”",
            "The discrepancy in their preproduction schedules “put a real fire under my ass,” Theron said, which made seeing her male co-stars struggle on-set that much more gratifying.",
            "“I was, like, ‘All right, you guys want to play this game, let’s go,’” she recalled. “I made it a point to out-drive all of those guys. I vividly remember Mark Wahlberg, halfway through one of our training sessions, pulling over and throwing up because he was so nauseous from doing 360s.”",
            "The heist thriller’s most memorable action set-pieces feature the cast as they drive a fleet of Mini Coopers through various global locales. Theron recalled being particularly proud of maneuvering the vehicle for one stunt in “a reverse 360 or maybe 180 in a warehouse with props everywhere.”",
            "“I did that stunt completely on my own,” she said. “It was a huge moment for feeling, like, ‘Yeah, we can do all this stuff, and women are so unfairly thought of or treated in genre.’”",
            "The experience filming “The Italian Job” helped Theron come to terms with the “misconception around women” in action films, propelling her to seek out and create roles in big-budget projects such as “Aeon Flux,” “Mad Max: Fury Road” and “Atomic Blonde” in order to upset the norm.",
            "“When I started my action career, it was so important to sell the authenticity of, ‘Yes, I can fight, and I can take this guy down, and I can survive this,’” Theron said. “There was such a level of wanting to prove that to audiences who for years said, ‘No, a woman could never fight a guy that size.’”",

            "On July 2, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) issued a statewide mask requirement to dampen a surge in coronavirus cases. Under the order, most Texans would have to cover their faces when entering buildings open to the public, like grocery stores.",
            "The following day, managers at a Sprouts Farmers Market in Texas received a memo related to the new policy. When it came to customers who refused to mask up, the mandate wouldn’t be a mandate after all.",
            "“If customer doesn’t have a mask, we offer them one. If customer still refuses, let them shop,” stated the July 3 memo, a copy of which was provided to HuffPost. “WE ARE NOT KICKING OUT CUSTOMERS WHO DON’T HAVE A FACE COVERING. That is not Sprouts policy.”",
            "A Sprouts spokesperson told HuffPost the company implemented a strict requirement for masks the following week, on July 11. The policy applies to the chain’s 300 stores nationwide and is posted at entrances for customers to see.",
            "“The wellbeing of our team members, our customers, and our communities remain our top priority and we’re continually updating our response to COVID-19 as the pandemic quickly evolves,” the spokesperson, Diego Romero, said in an email.",
            "But the chain’s initial reaction to the Texas order reflects how many grocers and retailers have been slow to take strong stands on masks for customers. A worker who obtained the memo said employees at their Sprouts location were told the store would rather take a fine than press the issue with a stubborn customer who refused to put on a mask.",
            "“I didn’t think that was OK,” said the worker, who asked to speak anonymously for fear of getting in trouble. “Customers still come in, some without masks. They expect courtesy clerks to say, ‘You have to wear a mask.’ But who’s going to listen to a person on the bottom of the totem pole?”",
            "The worker said several customers came in without masks on a shift just this week but were still allowed to shop.",
            "Romero noted that the Texas order provides an exemption for people with a medical condition or disability that prevents them from wearing a mask, and said Sprouts would not be in a position to question such an assertion from a customer.",
            "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, along with other public health experts and worker advocates, have been recommending employees and customers don masks in retail settings for months. The more we learn about the coronavirus, the more evidence we see that face coverings can help slow its transmission, by preventing people who are infected from spreading the disease through droplets.",
            "But the Trump administration has refused to implement a federal requirement, leaving the issue to states and private corporations to figure out.",
            "Many grocers and retailers have held out on requiring customers to wear them as a condition of entering the store, even though it could protect the health of their workers and their families. There are plenty of reasons that could explain why: Companies are afraid to wade into a politicized issue, despite the urgings of experts; they don’t want to escalate tensions with potentially hostile customers; and they don’t want to lose business to more lax competitors.",
            "The United Food and Commercial Workers, a union that represents 900,000 grocery workers, had been urging chains to adopt mask requirements in the spring. “I’m pretty aggravated about it,” the union’s president, Marc Perrone, told HuffPost way back in April. “They weren’t telling customers or workers to wear masks while they were inside these transmission points.”",
            "According to the union, roughly 7 in 10 members in a recent internal poll said their employers were not enforcing mask mandates. At least 93 of the union’s members have died of the coronavirus since March.",
            "Only last week did Walmart, the country’s largest brick-and-mortar retailer, announce that customers would be turned away at the door if they weren’t wearing masks. Other companies like the grocer Kroger and the department store Kohl’s made similar pronouncements.",
            "But even at some chains with clear mask mandates, the requirements ultimately remain little more than requests. CNN reported Friday that Walmart, Home Depot and other retailers are still allowing maskless customers in the store despite masks being mandatory. A Walmart list of talking points for managers echoed the Sprouts memo, saying if someone refused to cover up, “let them continue to shop.”",
            "A Sprouts worker in Colorado said for several weeks customers were allowed to enter her store and shop without a mask despite a local ordinance that made masks a requirement earlier in the pandemic. (Colorado did not issue a statewide mandate until this month.)",
            "“We were told by managers that we did not need to enforce the mask policy regardless of the fact that the city I live in said everybody needed to wear a mask in public places,” said the worker, who asked not to be named. “I was told by management … ‘We’re not the police, so you don’t need to say anything about it.’”",
            "The worker said the new corporatewide requirement has been an improvement, with customers being told to do curbside pickup if they won’t wear a mask. But enforcement often falls to cashiers and greeters whose job shouldn’t involve tussling with belligerent customers.",
            "She said a large man recently refused to cover his mouth with the mask that hung around his neck, saying he was sick of wearing it. The confrontation grew tense, and she had to threaten to call a manager.",
            "The worker said there is no security guard at her location and often the greeter is just a teenager.",
            "“They should have security at every single store,” she said. “I think they really need to reiterate to managers that they need to be willing to stand up for their employees. I’ve seen people berating employees over masks in ways that are completely verbally abusive, and there’s nothing that happens with that customer.”"

            "The entertainment news outlet quotes Saxon’s wife, Gloria, as confirming that the actor died of pneumonia on Saturday in Murfreesboro. He was best known for starring with Bruce Lee in “Enter the Dragon” and appeared in several “Nightmare on Elm Street” movies.",
            "Born Carmine Orrico, the son of Italian-American parents, Saxon grew up in Brooklyn, New York, and began modeling while still a teenager. He then caught the eye of legendary talent agent Henry Willson, who spotted Saxon on the cover of a magazine and brought him to Hollywood. Willson was credited for representing and helping to develop the careers of male stars like Rock Hudson and Tab Hunter, the outlet said.",

            "Saxon won a Golden Globe for best supporting actor in 1966 for his role alongside Marlon Brando in “The Appaloosa.”",
            "Speaking of the popularity of the “Nightmare on Elm Street” franchise in a 1987 interview, Saxon said, “I am intrigued by horror and fantasy-type things because I think it is a way of magnifying some part of the human mind that is exhibited or projected in a highly distorted way.”"

            "GENEVA (AP) — The U.N. weather agency warned Friday that average temperatures in Siberia were 10 degrees Celsius (18 Fahrenheit) above average last month, a spate of exceptional heat that has fanned devastating fires in the Arctic Circle and contributed to a rapid depletion in ice sea off Russia’s Arctic coast.",
            "“The Arctic is heating more than twice as fast as the global average, impacting local populations and ecosystems and with global repercussions,” World Meteorological Organization Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said in a statement Friday.",
            "He noted that Earth’s poles influence weather conditions far away, where hundreds of millions of people live.",
            "WMO previously cited a reading of 38 Celsius in the Russian town of Verkhoyansk on June 20, which the agency has been seeking to verify as a possible record-high temperature in the Arctic Circle. It comes as fires have swept through the region, with satellite imagery showing the breadth of the area surface.",
            "The agency says the extended heat is linked to a large “blocking pressure system” and northward swing of the jet stream that has injected warm air into the region. But WMO also pointed to a recent study by top climate scientists who found that such a rise in heat would have been nearly impossible without human-caused climate change.",
            "WMO said information collected by the U.S. National Snow and Ice Data Center and the U.S. National Ice Center showed the Siberian heat wave had “accelerated the ice retreat along the Arctic Russian coast, in particular since late June, leading to very low sea ice extent in the Laptev and Barents Seas.”"

            "I definitely consider myself more than an average fan of hummus. Dips in general are typically my go-to nosh option, whether I’m entertaining guests or snacking solo. But hummus in particular has always held a very special place in my heart.",
            "Discovering unique incarnations of it and finding new twists on recipes to whip up at home are the stuff dreams are made of, in my book. Though my commitment to hummus may not extend as far as teeth-cleaning or hairstyling like Adam Sandler’s character in ”Don’t Mess With The Zohan,” my love of the creamy Middle Eastern spread definitely runs deep.",
            "The silky texture, subtle nutty flavor and protein-packed nutritional profile are just a few qualities that have secured hummus a spot at the very top of my dip list. Its fiber-filled and potassium-rich nature (due to its chickpea base) further fuel my devotion. My staunch loyalty to hummus was never called into question until the COVID-19 lockdown and my subsequent need for extended power walks. That’s when I discovered bessara.",
            "When I stumbled across Zooba ― a fast-casual Egyptian restaurant in Manhattan’s Nolita ― while taking a fresh-air walk in late May, I noticed a large poster in the window showing a neon green-hued dip with the words “NOT HUMMUS” written in large red letters above it. The description of something called bessara was printed underneath, and I immediately thought, “NOT HUMMUS? What does that mean? Why the need for such distinct disassociation, and why would you want to distance yourself from hummus in the first place, bessara?” This I had to try.",
            "After promptly ordering and sampling the dish, which was served alongside an eerily familiar-looking flat bread (not called pita, of course), my next thought was, “Wow.” Bessara was absolutely delicious and it was definitely not hummus.",
            "Equally velvet-like but thinner in consistency, the taste of bessara is something altogether different from hummus. With a much more pronounced tang than its chickpea counterpart, bessara, which is made from fava beans, has an intriguing touch of bitterness that instantly awakens the taste buds the way a bite of pungent cheese would. There is also an undeniable pop of lemon and a punch of fresh herbs.",
            "I was immediately hooked on the beautiful explosion of flavor and needed to know more about this addictive dip. After pressing the cashier, who referred me to the manager for further explanation, I learned that bessara is considered “classic Egyptian street food” and that in Cairo, where Zooba’s owners are originally from, as well as throughout North Africa, the dish is a popular appetizer at fast-casual restaurants, falafel spots and grill restaurants ― much like hummus, which is a staple at similar establishments across the Middle East, Europe and here in the U.S.",
            "Aside from its pureed fava bean foundation, the bessara variation on Zooba’s menu owes its signature bright-green tint to fresh cilantro and parsley. The mild smoky aftertaste results from the infusion of cumin, and this contemporary take on a classic bessara recipe is made with dried fava beans as opposed to the customary fresh variety. Executive chef and co-founder Moustafa Elrefaey told me he decided to “revisit the traditional recipe with an updated flavor profile so that patrons wouldn’t have to reckon with the raw bean aftertaste.”",
            "Elrefaey, who actually grew up enjoying generations-old family recipes for both hummus and bessara, said he “personally prefers bessara” not only because it’s native to his birthplace, but because he finds the dip “lighter and more flavorful.”",
            "As a recent bessara convert myself, I agree wholeheartedly. But don’t take my word for it ― try Elrefaey’s recipe for yourself and taste the difference.",

            "The coronavirus pandemic has been devastating for the Black community, with data showing disproportionate rates of illness and deaths due to socioeconomic factors like insufficient access to health care, crowded and multigenerational living situations, and preexisting medical conditions that increase susceptibility of infection. On top of that, the ongoing police violence targeting Black and brown people ― and the nationwide protests that have since followed ― has triggered a wave of racial trauma that’s difficult to process.",
            "“It creates this perfect storm where you need as much in your toolkit as possible,” AZA Allsop, a psychiatry resident and neuroscience researcher at Yale University, told HuffPost.",
            "Allsop said that now, more than ever, those in the Black community need accessible coping tools. Allsop developed a meditation and mindfulness practice to cope with stress during grad school, and is now working to bring this toolkit to the Black community through free online guided meditation sessions.",
            "Allsop quickly realized that his anxieties arose from “a combination of being in a very high-stress environment but then also having to deal with racial trauma.” After finding that a consistent month of daily meditation eradicated his panic attacks, he became a proponent of sharing his knowledge so others could benefit, too.",
            "Candice Nicole Hargons, a professor of psychology at the University of Kentucky and director of the Center for Healing Racial Trauma, said that practicing meditation and mindfulness is vital to processing and recovering from racial trauma, which can cause ”muscle tension, heart racing, shallow breathing and fatigue.”",
            "“Meditation practices attend to the mind and body,” Hargons explained. “It helps us, first, recognize what our body and mind are experiencing without judgment, and second, release the tension through breath work and meditative practices. It regulates the autonomic system and other stress responses. These stress responses can be either over- or under-active when you experience racial trauma.”",
            "“Especially for Black people in this country, it’s really important to think about because a lot of the other diseases we have, like diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, have all been shown to vary with stress and to decrease with meditation,” Allsop added. “Engaging in these interventions can lower things like blood pressure and lead to better control of a lot of physical conditions and help with our overall wellness.”",
            "A 2019 study in the journal Behavioral Brain Research found that as little as 13 minutes a day of meditation over an eight-week period improved attention and mood for people who were new to the practice. The study also saw reduced anxiety among subjects ages 18 to 45.",
            "But incorporating mindfulness into daily life isn’t exactly simple. Allsop said there may be a barrier to entry in the Black community, due to cultural, religious and socioeconomic reasons. For one, many “identify as Christian and sometimes meditation practices could be seen as going against a Christian form of spirituality, if one isn’t properly informed about what the practices really are,” he said.",
            "Moreover, “depending on what kind of community you live in, the environment and what mechanisms are available for you, even if you wanted to do self-care, how can you do that if your environment is unsafe or you don’t have money and you can’t go somewhere or hire an instructor?”",
            "Below, the experts share some accessible mindfulness and meditation resources and how to start a regular practice:",
            "Start a daily practice by doing meditation first thing in the morning.",
            "According to Kresence Campbell, psychotherapist and owner of Holly Street Counseling Wellness Services, beginning the day with meditation can “help to start you off with level headedness and it can help you with mood management,” giving you an emotional head start to face whatever challenges the day ahead brings.",
            "“Meditation can help you focus on the here and now and slow down a lot of the buzzing thoughts you have in your mind, and deep breathing helps to increase the flow of oxygen to the brain, which helps release endorphins and calm your body,” Campbell said.",
            "In 2016, soon after the police killings of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile, Hargons created a 17-minute Black Lives Matter Meditation for Healing Racial Trauma, which anyone can access online at her website.",
            "Hargons recommends its daily use in the morning as a “prevention practice,” that serves as a “hedge against the wear and tear of daily racism.” She also recommends using it as an “intervention following a racist stressor when we need something to help us recover from a race-based stress reaction or more chronic racial trauma.”",
            "Campbell also provides low-cost virtual guided meditation at Holly Street Counseling, and recommends the book ”True Refuge” by Tara Brach for those who are just getting started with the practice. Allsop recommends free daily guided meditations through New Haven’s One Village Healing or downloading the Liberate Meditation App to use on your own. Starting out with just three to five minutes of meditation after waking up is a great foundation to build on, with a goal to get up to 10-15 minutes (or more) in a session.",
            "Use a quick grounding exercise during moments of acute stress.",
            "In addition to dedicating a little time every day to meditation, mindfulness tools can be very grounding during moments of high anxiety.",
            "“The stress hormone, cortisol, can manifest in your body, causing pain and discomfort and compromising your immune system,” Campbell said. “During this pandemic, we want to make sure your immune system is as strong as possible so we’re not making ourselves more susceptible to something that’s going on in the world in addition to having all these racial tensions.”",
            "If a moment is particularly stressful, Campbell recommends the DBT 5-4-3-2-1 method to counteract any panic. List five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell and one thing you can taste.",
            "“It helps ground you and puts you in the present, and not focus on the past or the future,” she explained.",
            "Deep belly breathing, where you put one hand below your diaphragm and one on your chest, focusing on the body’s sensations, also works to calm the brain and body.",
            "Practice mindfulness in the form of creative pursuits or other activities.",
            "Research shows that crafts (think knitting or coloring) can put the brain in a meditative state. Exercise also releases endorphins and reduces stress, providing a healthy break that is a coping mechanism in and of itself.",
            "Allsop suggested taking time for creative outlets ― like journaling, playing or listening to music or engaging in a spiritual practice like prayer. All of these activities can provide time for reflection as well as emotional catharsis.",
            "“Taking the time to sit with the negative emotion can be a process that begins healing,” he said.",
            "Regular mindfulness will help limit some future stressors.",
            "Part of mindfulness is about creating more self-awareness around the response to physical and emotional stress triggers. Campbell gives the example of seeing something upsetting on your social media feed, and then noticing your chest tightening or that you’re struggling to focus.",
            "“Those are the times you want to take a deep breath, do some counts, in addition to turning it off and limiting exposure to that,” Campbell said. “Stopping and recognizing those feelings going on in your body, being self-aware, that’s another thing mindfulness and meditation help you achieve.”",
            "Campbell reminds clients that meditation and mindfulness is not going to be the quick fix but rather one coping mechanism for negative experiences. Improving mental health, especially when dealing with a diagnosis, can also include going to therapy, engaging in positive lifestyle habits and sometimes taking medication."

            "Most of us will have had a drink or two on an empty stomach at one point or another – the after work trip to the bar where you didn’t have chance to grab food beforehand, or your friend’s wedding reception where you filled up on Prosecco before the starters came out.",
            "But what’s happening in the body when you drink without eating first?",
            "Keith Grimes, a general practitioner for online doctor service Babylon Health, explains that when someone drinks alcohol, it is absorbed into the blood stream from the small intestine – the part of the bowel that starts where the stomach ends.",
            "“About 80% of the absorption of alcohol happens here, and it happens quickly,” he says. “The stomach plays an important role in determining how quickly alcohol makes it into the small intestine.”",
            "If your stomach is empty, this happens faster. But if your stomach is full of delicious grub, alcohol enters your bloodstream more slowly ― and generally more safely.",
            "Tony Rao, a consultant for the United Kingdom National Health Service and a specialist in alcohol and mental health, says eating food usually coats the stomach and slows down absorption of alcohol ― but not always. Fatty foods tend to be the exception.",
            "How fast the alcohol enters the bloodstream depends on stomach “motility,” he explains, which is basically a fancy term for how fast the stomach empties.",
            "Eating unhealthy, fatty foods can increase motility, which results in alcohol entering your bloodstream quicker. “So, eating your kebab and chips may result in alcohol being absorbed sooner than, say, drinking a glass of milk,” he says.",
            "The type of alcoholic drink you have can also determine motility. “Stronger drinks such as spirits and fizzy alcoholic drinks increase motility and speed up alcohol absorption,” Rao says. “Sugary drinks and caffeine reduce motility and delay it.”",
            "People who eat a meal before drinking tend to be better off, because the rate of alcohol absorption into the bloodstream slows down ― and the body works to adsorb it in a more manageable way.",
            "Experts advise against drinking on an empty stomach because of the impact it can have on the body. “The short-term effects of drinking on an empty stomach, particularly stronger alcoholic drinks, can mean a more rapid rise in blood alcohol,” Rao says. As this happens, you’ll feel more drunk quickly and will struggle with thinking clearly and coordinating your body movements.",
            "“Binge-drinking on an empty stomach is dangerous, as the rapid rise in blood alcohol can increase the toxic effects of alcohol on the brain,” he adds.",
            "Alcohol can also irritate the lining of the stomach when combined with stomach acid, which can worsen when the stomach is empty.",
            "In very rare cases, if a person is fasting or starving, significant alcohol consumption can trigger a serious complication called alcoholic ketoacidosis, Grimes says. This is where the metabolism of the body is disrupted and can lead to severe nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain.",
            "The condition requires hospital treatment. “Tragically, we saw a young, fit woman die from this,” he says, referring to the death of a 27-year-old from the UK, who passed away suffering from reported alcoholic ketoacidosis. News reports suggest she had been drinking alcohol on an empty stomach.",
            "For those who do end up drinking and forget to eat, Grimes advises keeping the strength of your drink low and drinking it slowly, or with a still, non-alcoholic mixer. “If possible, have some snacks as an accompaniment,” he suggests.",

Rivera, who grew up in a Puerto Rican family in Washington state, closed his restaurant in March and has kept the business going by creating interactive in-home experiences and selling pantry products. After Goya’s CEO, Robert Unanue, appeared at the White House Rose Garden in July to express praise for President Donald Trump, shoppers boycotted Goya and Rivera’s social media started “blowing up,” creating a flood of orders for his sazon and other Puerto Rican pantry items as customers demanded an alternative to Goya. Growing up with Goya products, Rivera was just as angry and heartbroken as other consumers who were lifelong consumers of the largest Hispanic-owned brand in the U.S.",
            "In response to Unanue’s commentary, Rivera ramped up his Puerto Rican pantry line; the first thing he did was offer a discount in solidarity and resistance to Unanue’s words, and he began shipping his pantry products around the U.S. Below, Rivera shares his strong opinions on recent matters.",

I flipped everything. And I put out an ad [for our pantry products] saying, “Here’s what we do,” and people just started buying like crazy. It’s insane to me, because I’ve grown up around Goya my entire life. It’s like any other brand that people had gotten used to over a lifetime.

            "People in the White House are putting up photos of cans of Goya and acting we give a shit about us. You can’t say that you gave a shit about that culture or the cuisine.

They’ve done charitable stuff forever, and there are 5,000 people who work for them. Do you want them to lose their jobs?” And that’s not my point. My point is, my spices aren’t hurting anyone ― I’m not going around to a protest with 20 guns in my pocket, I’m over here just saying, “Don’t fucking buy from those people. They’re full of shit. Buy from me, I make this stuff, and I’m not a piece of shit.”",

            "WASHINGTON ― Allies of Russian dictator Vladimir Putin hoping to give President Donald Trump a second term in office appear to have a new partner: Republican Ron Johnson, who is using his Senate committee to renew debunked allegations against presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden.",
            "Johnson, a second-term senator from Wisconsin who chairs the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, is leading an investigation into the former vice president nearly identical to the one Trump pushed for in Ukraine that led to his impeachment earlier this year, and which echoes allegations being made in Russian-owned propaganda outlets.",
            "On Wednesday, Johnson denied being part of any Russian effort. “This is all being fabricated by Democrats. Have them point to something that we’ve released that’s Russian disinformation,” he told HuffPost. “We’re gathering information, but I’m not aware of anything that is Russian disinformation.”",
            "One former pro-Russian Ukrainian lawmaker, though, told The Washington Post that material showing the former vice president’s efforts to get a Ukrainian prosecutor fired has been turned over to Johnson’s committee. Oleksandr Onyshchenko is among a group of pro-Russian Ukrainians, including one graduate of a KGB school, who have ramped up claims against Biden and released batches of edited audiotapes. They have said more material would be released closer to the election, when it would be more useful to Trump.",
            "The effort mirrors Putin’s role in 2016, when emails stolen by his intelligence services from the Democratic National Committee and from a top campaign aide to nominee Hillary Clinton were released through WikiLeaks on a near daily basis in the final month before the election. Then-candidate Trump had been informed starting with an August intelligence briefing that Russia was behind the email thefts, and that connection was announced publicly on Oct. 7 by the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.",
            "Despite this, Trump began using the material anyway, starting with his Oct. 10 rally straight through Election Day, citing it in his rally speeches and news interviews as proof that Clinton was corrupt.",
            "Clinton and her campaign, while occasionally pointing out that Putin would prefer a Trump presidency, never made a serious effort to publicize Russia’s role in the WikiLeaks material. Four years later, the Biden campaign is taking a much more aggressive stance.",
            "“I am putting the Kremlin and other foreign governments on notice. If elected president, I will treat foreign interference in our election as an adversarial act that significantly affects the relationship between the United States and the interfering nation’s government,” Biden said in a statement Monday. “If any foreign power recklessly chooses to interfere in our democracy, I will not hesitate to respond as president to impose substantial and lasting costs.”",
            "On Wednesday, his campaign hit Johnson directly.",
            "“As Ron Johnson demonstrated over the last 24 hours, he is complicit in a foreign attack against the very sovereignty of our elections, and that kind of assault against our democracy cannot stand,” Biden spokesperson Andrew Bates said in a statement to HuffPost. “Donald Trump himself has attempted to launch several foreign influence operations, including when he got himself impeached trying to force Ukraine to spread this same long-debunked, hardcore rightwing conspiracy theory.”",
            "Trump in 2019, through his emissaries in the State Department and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, tried to coerce the new Ukrainian president into announcing investigations of Biden, whom he and his campaign feared would be the strongest Democratic challenger against him. Trump eventually withheld $391 million in military aid to the country, which remains under siege from Russia, as leverage but released the funds after the hold became public.",
            "Trump wound up getting impeached by the House for abusing his power and then trying to cover it up, but Johnson and every other Republican senator except Utah’s Mitt Romney permitted Trump to remain in office.",
            "Trump and his campaign continue to push a claim that Biden, during his years as vice president, tried to protect his son’s role at a Ukrainian energy company by getting a prosecutor who was investigating the company and its owner fired. In fact, the prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, was widely viewed as corrupt, and his dismissal was a priority for the Obama administration, the European Union, the International Monetary Fund and others who saw it as a necessary step to increasing Western investment into the former Soviet republic. Indeed, Shokin had dropped an investigation into the energy company, Burisma, by the time he was fired ― meaning that Biden’s push to remove him actually endangered his son’s income stream rather than protected it.",
            "During House hearings leading to Trump’s impeachment, officials from Trump’s own administration testified that Biden was carrying out both United States and Western European policy when he pressured the Ukrainian leader at the time into dismissing Shokin.",
            "Fiona Hill, a Russia expert on Trump’s National Security Council, said a related claim by Trump ― that it had been Ukraine that had interfered in the 2016 election, and on behalf of Clinton; not Russia on Trump’s behalf ― was Russian propaganda.",
            "“In the course of this investigation, I would ask that you please not promote politically driven falsehoods that so clearly advance Russian interests,” Hill testified during a House impeachment hearing, addressing Republican members who were trying to protect Trump."

            "Britney Spears’ sister, Jamie Lynn, is speaking up for the pop star amid growing concerns about her mental health, calling her a “strong, badass, unstoppable woman.”",
            "Fans of Britney Spears, who have long expressed concern for her well-being, have been particularly vocal of late due to the “Glory” singer’s eyebrow-raising Instagram activity and the renewed attention to her conservatorship, which prohibits her from independently making any major personal or financial decisions.",
            "On Tuesday, Jamie Lynn Spears addressed the conversation surrounding her big sister without mentioning her by name. The “Zoey 101” alum called for compassion for celebrities struggling with their mental health in response to Kanye West’s troubling Twitter rants.",
            "“If you deal with mental illness or care for someone dealing with mental illness, then you know how important it is to respect the situation with privacy for the person, and the family trying to protect their loved ones, no matter how it may appear to the public, and as the public we must learn to do the same,” she wrote on Instagram alongside screenshots of various celebrities expressing sympathy for West. “I pray this doesn’t bring shame to anyone dealing with mental illness, you are not alone, and you are loved. Sending all my love and prayers to all of you ♥️.”",
            "But then her followers quickly turned the conversation to Britney in the comments, with one fan demanding that Jamie Lynn address her sister’s “OBVIOUS mental illness.” (Instagram account CommentsByCelebs picked up on the back and forth.)",
            "“You have no right to assume anything about my sister,” she replied, “and I have no right to speak about HER health and personal matters.”",
            "“She is a strong, badass, unstoppable woman, and that’s the only thing that is OBVIOUS,” the “Sweet Magnolias” star added.",
            "In a separate exchange, Jamie Lynn pushed back against a different person who criticized her refusal to clear up misconceptions about her sister, suggesting that Britney is the one who “does not want that to happen.”",
            "“I would never speak out just to clarify things to the public, when the person it pertains to does not want that to happen,” Jamie Lynn wrote. “I’d rather take all the hate, than speak about someone else’s personal matter that they want to be private.”",
            "In April 2019, Spears reportedly received treatment at a mental health facility for 30 days to address emotional distress over her father’s health issues. Back then, she wrote in an Instagram post, “We all need to take time for a little ‘me time.’”",
            "On Wednesday, her family goes back to court in Los Angeles over Britney’s conservatorship, according to The Blast.",
            "The pop star is expected to make an appearance via video, per Us Weekly, alongside her father, Jamie Spears, who stepped down as her conservator in September 2019 after more than a decade due to “personal health reasons.” Her longtime “care-manager,” Jodi Montgomery, has acted as conservator since then.",
            "But Britney’s mother, Lynn, has repeatedly attempted to be included in the conservatorship as well. Six days ago, she filed documents to receive special notice on “all matters” in regards to her daughter’s finances and multimillion-dollar trust, according to Entertainment Tonight.",
            "As it stands now, Montgomery will remain in control at least until August 22. The conservatorship was extended in April when a Los Angeles judge ruled that all matters were on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic."

Oklahoma Highway Patrol troopers suspected him of being involved in a hit-and-run, but Pearson — a then-64-year-old Deaf Black man whom his daughter described as “gentle and kind” — had no idea why he was being pulled over.",
            "He parked his car and placed his hands on the steering wheel as a trooper approached his vehicle with a gun drawn. Pearson couldn’t hear what the trooper was saying and reached for a placard he kept in his car that explained his disability. But before he could grab it, the trooper punched him in the face.",
            "Pearson was dragged from his car, severely beaten and put in a chokehold; one of his arms was ripped from its socket. He experienced brain and eye damage from the encounter, but he survived.",
            "Deborah Danner was a 66-year-old Black woman with schizophrenia. In 2016, an NYPD officer shot her in her Bronx apartment while responding to her neighbor’s call that she had been behaving erratically. She did not survive.",
            "Chillingly, Danner wrote an essay four years before her death about the dangers of people with mental health conditions interacting with police that predicted her fate.",
            "“We are all aware of the all too frequent news stories about the mentally ill who come up against law enforcement instead of mental health professionals,” she wrote. “And end up dead.”",
            "The circumstances of Danner’s death echo those of Breonna Taylor’s. Louisville, Kentucky, police officers shot the EMT eight times in March after bursting into her home on a “no-knock warrant” related to a drug investigation.",
            "Pearson’s story shares DNA with so many other stories about police violence toward Black people at traffic stops, like Philando Castile and Maurice Gordon.",
            "Yet conversations and media coverage surrounding both Pearson and Danner’s cases zeroed in on their disabilities and largely treated their race as irrelevant.",
            "Conversely, prominent victims of police brutality like Sandra Bland, Freddie Gray, Eric Garner, Elijah McClain and Tanisha Anderson all had disabilities or underlining health issues that may have played significant roles in their deaths — yet these aspects of their identities tend to get glossed over.",
            "In cases of police violence against Black disabled people, the media tends to focus on either the victim’s race or the victim’s disability, instead of examining the overlap between the two identities, said Vilissa Thompson, a Black disabled social worker and activist who is a consultant for the Movement 4 Black Lives. This gives the public an incomplete story.",
            "The “erasure of people’s disabilities when we talk about them” is a major issue when it comes to Black disabled victims of police violence, Thompson told HuffPost. “Either the complete erasure or omission, or leaving it as a footnote and not understanding the connection between race [and] disability … and who is being disproportionately impacted within the Black and disabled communities.”",
            "There is no reliable national database tracking how many Black disabled people experience and die from police violence. In fact, there’s not even a public federal database tracking who dies in police custody in general. But the data we do have sheds some light on how the combination of being Black and disabled may have dire consequences when interacting with law enforcement.",
            "In 2015, The Washington Post began work on a real-time database that tracks fatal police shootings. A 2016 report by the Post compared that data with the most recently available U.S. census figures and found that Black Americans were 2.5 times more likely than white people to be shot and killed by law enforcement.",
            "And the Ruderman Foundation, a philanthropic foundation with a focus on disability advocacy, has estimated that one-third to one-half of all people killed by police are disabled.",
            "The brutal killing of George Floyd has sparked nationwide protests and heated conversations about racial justice and police violence over the past few months. But the issue of disability has been largely ignored, even though disability can increase a person’s risk of death or injury by police, especially if that person is also Black.",
            "For instance, the movements and actions of disabled people can be misinterpreted as out of the ordinary or threatening to law enforcement.",
            "Heather Watkins, a Black disabled activist based in Boston, gave the example of how police could easily misinterpret the speech patterns of someone who has cerebral palsy.",
            "“[If] they’re talking, then someone might consider them drunk,” Watkins said. “I’ve had friends who have cerebral palsy that say that they’ve been targeted for appearing inebriated.”",
            "Police interactions can turn dangerous when a disabled person cannot immediately respond to an officer’s demands for compliance the same way that a non-disabled person would. And when law enforcement’s default is to respond violently to someone who doesn’t immediately obey demands, a disabled person is certainly at risk. For a Black disabled person, this risk is compounded by biased officers’ perception of them as more threatening than non-Black people.",
            "Disabled people also often face indifference ― from police, courts and the general public ― about the legal rights afforded to them by the Americans with Disabilities Act, which prohibits discrimination against disabled people, including discrimination by police.",
            "“I’ve been in court cases where lawyers — police brutality lawyers — had no clue about the Americans with Disabilities Act,” said Leroy Moore, a Black disabled activist who is the chair of the Black Disability Studies Committee for the National Black Disability Coalition. “The ADA doesn’t count in court cases around police brutality. And if it does, it gets thrown out constantly.”",
            "Black Americans are five times as likely as white Americans to say they’ve been unfairly stopped by police because of their race, according to a 2019 Pew survey.",
            "Disabled people also wind up encountering police even though they are not posing a threat. They get the cops called on them for what others perceive as strange behavior or by family, friends or neighbors requesting so-called wellness checks on their mental health condition. In numerous instances, these situations have ended up deadly for people with disabilities.",
            "“Both people of color and people with disabilities are more likely to come in contact with law enforcement,” said Britney Wilson, a Black disabled civil rights attorney. “And both groups have higher chances of negative things happening as a result.”",
            "Lisa “Tiny” Gray-Garcia, founder of Poor Magazine and a self-described “formerly houseless incarcerated” person, told HuffPost that the tendency to silo a victim’s identities is “absolutely idiotic.”",
            "“The connection or the intersectionality of disability, racism, white terrorism and poverty are almost always interlinked,” she said.",
            "Black Americans are, in fact, more likely than white Americans to be disabled, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Due to centuries of systemic racism, Black Americans tend to make less money and therefore are more likely to live in less affluent neighborhoods. These communities often have worse access to health care, worse access to healthy food, worse air quality and other environmental factors that contribute to residents developing disabilities, mental health conditions and other health issues.",
            "Black Americans also often don’t have access to unbiased medical and mental health care. Because of this and the barriers to health care in general, disabilities and other health conditions that Black Americans develop can go undiagnosed and untreated.",
            "And the fight for justice is harder when Black disabled people feel they are not fully accepted by either the Black or the disability community.",
            "“We don’t feel safe in either community because we experience harm by both communities,” said Thompson, who created the Twitter hashtag #DisabilityTooWhite four years ago. “In many ways, where do we belong? We have the disabled community where the white folks or non-people-of-color can be anti-Black or racist, and you have the Black community where Black folks are ableist. So where do we (A) fit? And (B) feel safe enough to even proclaim that our lives matter too?”",
            "Thompson said she’s experienced racism from white disabled activists.",
            "“They feel if you talk about anything other than disability, you’re taking away from the movement and it’s a distraction,” she said. “I think that a lot of white disabled people are not comfortable with understanding and knowing that they have white privilege even though they’re also disabled. So I think there’s a reckoning internally with many of them in seeing how you can be the oppressor and be oppressed at the same time.”",
            "There’s also a stigma against disability within the Black community, which Wilson attributes in part to centuries of oppression.",
            "“If you want me to go back to the slave trade,” she said, “we were brought here based on our ability to produce. That’s something that inherently links race and ability. That’s the function of capitalism, it’s instinctively and intrinsically tied to race and ability,” Wilson said. She also discussed this idea in a 2016 article she wrote for The Nation.",
            "“When you already have one societal strike against you,” Wilson said, referring to race, “who’s going to sign up for two?”",
            "Proposed solutions to police brutality ― both against Black disabled people and in general ― are wide-ranging, and advocates often don’t agree on what strategies are best.",
            "Gray-Garcia and Moore, who work closely together through Poor Magazine, stressed the importance of people not calling 911 about behavior they may perceive as suspicious.",
            "“Most humans in the United States have been told that the way to solve all their problems is to call those three numbers,” Gray-Garcia said. She described a situation in which an Indigenous man died in police custody after someone called 911 to report he was having a mental health crisis on the streets.",
            "“The reality is somebody called those numbers because they wanted to, quote, ‘help him.’ Their heart wasn’t necessarily wanting to get him killed. But that’s the system we have.”",
            "Some initiatives aimed at decreasing police violence, particularly toward people with disabilities or mental health issues, include programs to enhance police training or to redirect some 911 calls to other kinds of responders.",
            "The White Bird Clinic in Eugene, Oregon, for instance, runs a program called CAHOOTS (Crisis Assistance Helping Out on the Streets) that redirects non-emergency 911 calls that involve mental health, substance abuse and homelessness to a team of medics and crisis-care workers.",
            "The Arc, one of the country’s largest disability rights organizations, launched its own program in 2015 that teaches criminal justice professionals how to identify people with disabilities in order to interact with and accommodate them better.",
            "But not everyone agrees these reforms are enough. Gray-Garcia and Moore argue that solutions focused on better training for law enforcement won’t work and believe the police should be disbanded entirely.",
            "“Let’s expand our search for models and talk about actual livable models without the police when we’re having this conversation,” said Gray-Garcia, pointing to efforts outside the U.S.",
            "Both also think that in order to combat police violence, American society needs to grapple with a myriad of issues facing marginalized communities.",
            "“There’s not one big answer for everything. It’s the small things that are going to make it happen,” Moore said. “So there’s the solution ― educating the community about mental health, about disability, about the ADA, about being a neighbor, about reshaping your disabled neighbor as a person.”",
            "Gray-Garcia underscored that the situation is messy and it will take all people — regardless of race, ability, gender or class — to do the hard work needed to create change.",
            "“It’s a mind shift,” she said. “It’s not a simple answer. And that’s the hardest part. Because you’re looking for a nice clean line for your story.

            "In the early months of the coronavirus pandemic, Hélène Barcelo, the deputy director of the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute in Berkeley, California, was strolling around a park when she spotted a family of four all masked up. Well, almost all masked up: The mom was wearing a protective covering. So, too, were the children. But the father’s mask was hanging from his neck.",
            "Barcelo is currently studying face mask usage, so the scene at the park piqued her interest. Later on, she brought it up when Skyping with her colleague Valerio Capraro, a senior lecturer in economics at Middlesex University in London.",
            "“When I mentioned it, Valerio shared a similar story,” Barcelo told HuffPost. “He lives in London and saw several couples where the female was wearing a mask, while the male was not. So, we thought: ‘Perhaps there’s something in there, with men.’”",
            "Spurred on by what they saw, the pair recently released a study that probes why men are more mask-resistant. The researchers polled 2,459 U.S. participants and found that men were more likely to opt out of wearing masks, believing them to be “shameful,” “a sign of weakness,” and “not cool” — in spite of the data showing that men are at higher risk than women of dying from a coronavirus infection.",
            "The researchers also found that men were less likely than women to believe they would be seriously affected by the coronavirus.",
            "“This was quite unexpected and somewhat ironic, given the fact that official statistics show that men are more likely than women to die from COVID-19,” Barcelo said.",
            "Equally surprising to the researchers is that in counties where wearing a face mask was mandatory, those gender differences almost disappeared, though men still expressed the same negative emotions toward masks.",
            "“In other words, in counties where wearing a face mask is mandatory, men dislike wearing it as they do in counties where wearing a face mask is not mandatory, but at least it increases their intentions to wear it,” she said.",
            "That’s an especially important takeaway, given how slow some government officials have been to enact mask mandates and even to mask up themselves.",
            "In spite of the CDC’s recommendation to wear masks in public places, Vice President Mike Pence notoriously went maskless while touring the Mayo Clinic facilities that support COVID-19 research and treatment. Though he later said he regretted the decision, his mask usage has still been spotty since.",
            "After months of refusing to wear a mask in public and even questioning their efficacy, President Donald Trump seems to have come around to face coverings. On July 11, four months into the pandemic and with more than 134,000 Americans dead, the president finally slipped on a mask during a visit to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.",
            "Then, earlier this week, he shared a photo of himself wearing one.",
            "“We are United in our effort to defeat the Invisible China Virus, and many people say that it is Patriotic to wear a face mask when you can’t socially distance,” Trump tweeted, making a racist reference to the coronavirus.",
            "“There is nobody more Patriotic than me, your favorite President!” he added.",
            "Still, the president has said he won’t endorse the mask mandate lawmakers like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) have pushed for. And hours after tweeting the mask photo, he was seen mingling with supporters at a fundraiser, mask-free.",
            "Inconsistent messaging, yes — but progress nonetheless, given Trump’s previous personal stance on face masks. (According to The New York Times, the president complained privately to staff that he thought it would make him look weak and would draw attention to the public health crisis.)",
            "Trump and other men’s waffling on wearing a mask ― or their outright refusal to wear one ― isn’t surprising, said Shane G. Owens, a psychologist and the assistant director of campus mental health at Farmingdale State College SUNY.",
            "“The results of the study reflect what we would expect, given gender roles in the U.S.,” Owens told HuffPost. Traits like “self-reliance, individualism, strength and courage” are stereotypically associated with masculinity, and in the eyes of many American men, “wearing a mask runs counter to most of those traits,” Owens said.",
            "For many men rejecting the mask, “there’s a sense of rugged individualism and a desire to appear impervious to harm,” Owens said.",
            "He said the study’s findings made a lot of sense when you contextualize them with men’s low prioritization of medical care and their health. Think of how many men shrug off annual check-ups with their doctor.",
            "Owens was surprised by the study’s finding that appealing to men’s sense of family responsibility didn’t much increase their intention to wear masks, whereas appealing to their sense of community did.",
            "“Maybe these men are thinking, ‘I don’t need anyone to tell me how to protect my family,’” Owens said.",
            "Kurt Smith, a therapist in Roseville, California, works primarily with men. He told HuffPost that he believes the demand for conformity on masks ― and sometimes, shaming people if masks aren’t worn ― causes some men to dig their heels in deeper.",
            "“For example, I know people who’ve been screamed at in stores for not wearing a mask,” Smith said. “No one deserves to be treated this way. I think it just fuels further resistance.”",
            "Couple that with the optics of wearing a mask ― “it makes me look unmanly,” some feel ― and you’ve got a solid recipe for mask resistance.",
            "“Masculinity can hinder men in a lot of ways — asking for directions, going to counseling, and wearing a mask for the coronavirus fits right in with these,” he said.",
            "A shame-based approach won’t work in convincing guys like that, Smith said, but friendly peer pressure might.",
            "“Not wearing one can actually be more uncomfortable than doing so as you stick out so much when surrounded by so many people who are,” he said.",
            "Talking about some of the nonmedical benefits can help buy-in, too, Smith said. They make you look kind of cool, like you’re going incognito, he joked.",
            "Anecdotally, women sure seem to find a man in a mask attractive. Look at how much praise “Wonder Woman” actor Chris Pine got for wearing a mask after making a bookstore run in this viral tweet from a few weeks ago.",
            "Sharing photos of good looking, masked-up actors won’t work for everyone, but Owens does think some kind of PSA campaign featuring public figures men admire wearing masks could be helpful.",
            "“Get people guys idolize to wear masks,” he said. “An advertisement that shows men’s favorite sports team or other public figures wearing masks might be useful. Face coverings that sport the logos of favorite teams are a phenomenal idea.”",
            "As the aforementioned study suggests, it also helps to appeal to people’s sense of community or patriotism.",
            "Authorities relied heavily on patriotic messaging during the 1918 influenza epidemic, according to Alex Navarro, assistant director of the Center for the History of Medicine at the University of Michigan and one of the editors-in-chief of the American Influenza Epidemic of 1918-1919: A Digital Encyclopedia.",
            "As Navarro told the Los Angeles Times recently, when the first mandatory mask orders in 1918 were met with opposition, public service announcements by the Red Cross and other groups urged people to “do their part,” deeming those who refused to get on board “slackers.”",
            "This time around, Navarro said a focus on getting America back on track economically may be more effective.",
            "“The message is, ‘We cannot have a normal economy until we get the pandemic under control,’ and that is not going to happen 100% until we get a vaccine,” he told the Times. “But we can get much closer to having it under control if people comply with social distancing and wearing a mask while in public.”",
            "Barcelo and Capraro said they’re working on more research that suggests Americans respond particularly well to messages telling them to “rely on their reasoning” rather than their emotion. That was true of men and women, Barcelo said.",
            "Still, as their first study showed, the biggest motivator of all remains a mandatory mask order.",
            "“We did see that in counties where wearing face covering was mandatory, both men and women said they’d comply with that rule,” she said. “Making it mandatory everywhere would seem like an effective way to get through.”",
            "Experts are still learning about the novel coronavirus. The information in this story is what was known or available as of press time, but it’s possible guidance around COVID-19 could change as scientists discover more about the virus. Please check the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the most updated recommendations."

            "“MacGyver” star Lucas Till is speaking out about the toxic work environment that former showrunner Peter Lenkov created on the CBS series, revealing that he was left “suicidal” by the alleged abuse and body-shaming.",
            "The actor is one of a handful of cast and crew members who’ve come forward about Lenkov’s “unacceptable” behavior in a new Vanity Fair piece published Monday, two weeks after the network ended its relationship with the onetime “MacGyver,” “Magnum P.I.” and “Hawaii Five-0” boss.",
            "“I’ve never worked this hard in my life, and I am fine with hard work,” Till told Maureen Ryan, a former HuffPost employee, in the piece. “But the way Peter treats people is just unacceptable. I was suicidal that first year on the show, because of the way he made me feel. But the way he’s treated the people around me ― that’s just my breaking point.”",
            "Till, who has starred on the reboot of the action series for four seasons, alleged that Lenkov repeatedly criticized his physique, which drove the actor to contact CBS’s human resources department.",
            "“There was always something about my appearance that wouldn’t please him like when I was in a hospital gown and our producer…thought it was funny that [Lenkov] said my legs were ‘fucking hideous’ and we can never show them again,” Till wrote in an email to CBS HR, according to Vanity Fair.",
            "Till alleged that Lenkov also raged against him for looking like a “little fucking boy” in one scene, which was a sore spot for the actor, now 29, who said he’s struggled with his appearance as a leading man given his age.",
            "“Just hire a 35-year-old then,” he recalled thinking, adding that he’s “struggled with maintaining ‘man weight’ on the show because of the stress, no time to work out, and an unpredictable schedule for proper nourishment.”",
            "An unnamed “MacGyver” source told Vanity Fair that Lenkov “has a thing against” Till, who changed “dramatically throughout this period.”",
            "“I hated seeing this happen with him because he’s a great guy, and there’s nothing wrong with him or his body,” the source added.",
            "A representative for Lenkov called Till’s claims “100 percent false and untrue” per Vanity Fair, adding that Lenkov “has championed him from the very beginning and has been nothing but supportive of him.”",
            "Elsewhere in the piece, Lenkov’s former employees accused him of particularly targeting women on staff, including threatening their jobs, not giving them fair script credits and, in the case of “MacGyver” actor Meredith Eaton, pressuring her to return to work too soon after a serious injury.",
            "Earlier this month, following an investigation into multiple complaints, CBS fired Lenkov with a year left on his multimillion-dollar deal as a top showrunner on the network.",
            "In response to the allegations of manipulative and abusive behavior by Lenkov, CBS said, “Our studio is committed to ensuring safe and respectful production environments. Over the past year, we have assigned human resource production partners to every show, expanded staff training and increased reporting options. We will continue to evolve our practices with continued focus on building trust with all who work on our sets. Every complaint is taken seriously, every claim is investigated, and when evidence is clear that policies were violated and values not upheld, we take decisive action.”",
            "While Lenkov has denied all accusations of abuse and mistreatment, he broadly apologized in his own statement.",
            "“Now is the time to listen and I am listening. It’s difficult to hear that the working environment I ran was not the working environment my colleagues deserved, and for that, I am deeply sorry,” he told The Hollywood Reporter earlier this month. “I accept responsibility for what I am hearing and am committed to doing the work that is required to do better and be better.”",
            "In the wake of Lenkov’s departure, “MacGyver” executive producer Monica Macer was tapped as the new showrunner for the upcoming fifth season, while “Magnum P.I.” executive producer Eric Guggenheim will now oversee that series, which was renewed for a third season. “Hawaii Five-0” ended its run in April after 10 seasons.",

            "Dad and “Fowl Language Comics” artist Brian Gordon isn’t afraid to weigh in on the issues dominating the national discourse, from racial injustice to mask-wearing to premature reopening amid the COVID-19 pandemic. This summer, he’s drawing comics about a big question now hitting families: what to do about the 2020-2021 school year.",
            "“Like many of us, my wife and I are struggling with the prospect of sending our kids back to school in the fall, especially considering that our home state of Kansas has uncontrolled spread of the virus,” he told HuffPost.",
            "Gordon, who deals with the added complications of a blended family (four children and additional co-parents), said that two of his kids will continue remote schooling, but they’re still trying to determine what makes the most sense for the other two. Last week, he illustrated the debate over schools reopening in a ... fiery comic.",
            "“Our kids miss school and they miss their friends, and we know that being in school is good for them emotionally and intellectually,” he said. “But first and foremost, we want them to be well and, frankly, stay alive. We’re grappling with the same Catch-22 that all parents are dealing with, so this topic felt very relevant for a comic.”",
            "Gordon’s school reopening comic has received nearly 40,000 likes on Instagram and sparked some heated debate in the comments. He suggests it was meant to add to the discussion, not resolve it.",
            "“There are clearly strong opinions on all sides of this issue and I get it,” he said. “Reopening schools is a complex issue. There were many fans who loved the comic and felt supported and heard, and then there were those who challenged me to propose a better solution than what already exists. Believe me, if I had one, I’d be the first to shout it out to the world.”",
            "“I’ve also gotten a fair amount of comments suggesting that I ‘stick with the funny stuff,’” Gordon continued. “But unfortunately, all of our lives have become decidedly unfunny lately, and as a comic that reflects the life experience of being a parent, I’d be remiss to skip over the tough stuff. Rest assured, I look forward to writing about less catastrophic matters eventually.”",
            "Ultimately, he hopes that parents and teachers who see his school reopening comic feel understood and less alone as they face a “hard and crummy and unwinnable” situation.",
            "“I also hope it illuminates just how unconscionable it is to send hordes of kids and teachers into a school building when many adults aren’t willing to hold in-person meetings themselves,” he added. “For my part, I’m going to do right by what I think our family needs and can handle. That’s all any of us can do.”"

            "About 30 years ago, Shirley Raines felt lost and looking for meaning after the tragic loss of her toddler son. A friend invited her to feed the homeless, and as female clients complimented her hair and makeup, a light bulb went off.",
            "She offered to bring beauty products whenever she came out, and after weeks of supplying beauty goods for the cisgender and transgender women on the streets, Raines realized this was her purpose.",
            "She’s now 52 years old, and three years ago she founded the nonprofit organization Beauty2theStreetz, comprising a team of roughly 20 volunteers who visit the backstreets of Los Angeles ― and the Skid Row neighborhood, which has one of the largest homeless populations in the nation ― to provide food, hot water, hygiene products, beauty services and community for those in need.",
            "Raines recognizes that the lack of a home doesn’t mean the lack of humanity, and provides not just basic necessities but the things that make us feel inherently human, like a hot shower and the hope-inducing feeling of looking in the mirror and loving what you see.",
            "As a self-professed “hood stylist,” Raines has impressive styling skills without any formal cosmetology training, but she’s made it a point to add licensed cosmetologists to her team. Her twin sister is a licensed makeup artist who volunteers her services alongside licensed stylists and barbers who help with the more technical aspects of hair care, such as cuts and color.",
            "Though she considers her self-taught skills good enough to make people look fabulous, Raines believes the homeless men, women and children she serves should also have access to professional services. And she does her best to offer choices to her clients because choice is something that has often been taken away from them.",
            "Pre-coronavirus, Beauty2theStreetz would serve about 30 clients a day, four days a week, providing hot meals as they waited for their requested styling services and sending clients off with their choice of snacks and clothes before leaving. When government officials urged people to stay home due to the coronavirus pandemic, Raines and her team followed the guidance and ceased operations.",
            "A few of Raines’ clients were able to access social media and let her know they were hurting without her. Shelters had started accepting fewer residents, leaving more people homeless, and without regular access to news outlets, many were uninformed about the latest COVID-19 developments.",
            "To continue serving the population but reduce risk of contagion, Raines and her team made arrangements to set up at a local McDonald’s for roughly six hours once a week on Saturdays, still supplying clients with food and styling services but now adding masks, hand sanitizer and general information about the pandemic to their list of options.",
            "When it came to managing the coronavirus in these communities, Raines said, “We quickly understood that when the world said, ‘Everybody stay in, we got you,’ they didn’t mean the homeless.”",
            "Beauty2theStreetz relies on donations from Patreon subscribers and thousands of followers on Instagram and Twitter. The 600-700 masks Raines distributes each Saturday are either sewn or purchased by social media followers who send them directly to Raines. Makeup brands NYX cosmetics and Thrive cosmetics have been donating makeup for a long time, and ManicPanic and L’Oreal have supplied hair color. Raines has also received hand sanitizer donations from brands such as Orly, GreenerWays and toothpaste from Bite.",
            "The organization has even caught the attention of celebrities like Miley Cyrus and Brie Larson, who have not only shared Raines on their own Instagram pages but made donations themselves. Though she’s applied for grants, Raines suspects the reason she’s never received any is that people don’t view her services as a necessity; but these makeovers, as Raines puts it, are “more than something superficial.”",
            "Even if some people can’t understand the power of a shower and makeover, Raines is reassured of her impact when she looks at her clients. “Nothing else is gonna work for you unless you love yourself and feel good about yourself; and this is helping them get to that level of feeling confident and clean enough and beautiful enough to go into a place and put in a job application or go into an establishment and put in a housing application.”",
            "Just as Raines’ services bring joy to her clients, they have brought joy to her as well. Raines said clients have eased the process of mourning her son because “all the love and care and all the things I have that I can’t give him, I still can give it to other people’s kids, as well as my other five living kids. I kind of adopted a whole community and it’s really helped me to find a purpose, find a reason for my pain.”",
            "As someone whose calling found her by chance, Raines suggests anyone looking to be of service to others should get familiar with their clientele and pay attention to both their needs and their wants.",
            "“Being organic is very important,” she said. “I would advise you to go out there and take care of the needs, and the wants will organically appear. If you’re gonna be committed to your community, you have to go out there and build the relationships with them. You have to invest that time with them. They have to learn to trust you and you have to get to know them. That’s the only way it’s gonna succeed.”"

But administration panned more virus testing money and interjected other priorities that could complicate quick passage.",

Rather than easing, the pandemic’s devastating cycle was happening all over again, leaving Congress little choice but to engineer another costly rescue. Businesses were shutting down again, schools could not fully reopen and jobs were disappearing, all while federal aid expired.",

            "The package from McConnell had been quietly crafted behind closed doors for weeks and was expected to include $75 billion to help schools reopen, reduced unemployment benefits alongside a fresh round of direct $1,200 cash payments to Americans, and a sweeping five-year liability shield against coronavirus lawsuits.",

            "Trump was also reviving his push for a payroll tax break, which was being seriously considered, said another Republican. Both spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private talks.",
            "The new push from the White House put the administration at odds with GOP allies in Congress, a disconnect that threatened to upend an already difficult legislative process. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi already passed Democrats’ vast $3 trillion proposal and virus cases and deaths had only increased since.",
            "Trump raised alarms on Capitol Hill when he suggested last month at a rally in Oklahoma that he wanted to slow virus testing. Some of Trump’s GOP allies wanted new money to help test and track the virus to contain its spread. Senate Democrats were investigating why the Trump administration had not yet spent some of $25 billion previously allocated for testing in an earlier aid bill.",
            "The payroll tax Trump wanted also divided his party. Senate Republicans in particular opposed the payroll tax break as an insufficient response to millions of out-of-work Americans, especially as they tried to keep the total price tag of the aid package at no more than $1 trillion.",
            "Trump said Sunday in the Fox News interview that he would consider not signing any bill unless it included the payroll tax break, which many GOP senators opposed.",
            "“I want to see it,” he said.",
            "As McConnell prepared to roll out his $1 trillion-plus proposal, he acknowledged it would not have full support. This would be the fifth virus aid package, after the $2.2 trillion bill passed in March, the largest U.S. intervention of its kind.",
            "The first round of virus aid is running out.",
            "A federal $600-a-week boost to regular unemployment benefits would expire at the end of the month. So, too, would the federal ban on evictions on millions of rental units.",
            "With 17 straight weeks of unemployment claims topping 1 million — usually about 200,000 — many households were facing a cash crunch and losing employer-backed health insurance coverage.",
            "Despite flickers of an economic upswing as states eased stay-at-home orders in May and June, the jobless rate remained at double digits, higher than it ever was in the last decade’s Great Recession.",
            "Pelosi’s bill, approved in May, included $75 billion for testing and tracing to try to get a handle on the virus spread, funneled $100 billion to schools to safely reopen and called for $1 trillion to be sent to cash-strapped states to pay essential workers and prevent layoffs. The measure would give cash stipends to Americans, and bolster rental and mortgage and other safety net protections.",
            "In the two months since Pelosi’s bill passed, the U.S. had 50,000 more deaths and 2 million more infections.",
            "“If we don’t invest the money now, it will be much worse,” Pelosi said."

            "Trader Joe’s announced that it has been working on repackaging its international food products for “several years” after a widespread petition called out the grocery chain out for their “racist branding and packaging.”",
            "A petition created earlier this month took aim at Trader Joe’s “ethnic foods” and noted that they belie “a narrative of exoticism that perpetuates harmful stereotypes.”",
            "“For example, ‘Trader Ming’s’ is used to brand the chain’s Chinese food, ‘Arabian Joe’ brands Middle Eastern foods, ‘Trader José’ brands Mexican foods, ‘Trader Giotto’s’ is for Italian food, and ‘Trader Joe San’ brands their Japanese cuisine,” reads the petition. “The Trader Joe’s branding is racist because it exoticizes other cultures - it presents ‘Joe’ as the default ‘normal’ and the other characters falling outside of it - they are ‘Arabian Joe,’ ‘Trader José,’ and ‘Trader Joe San.’”",
            "The petition also took issue with the chain’s founder, Joe Coulombe, taking “inspiration in building the Trader Joe’s brand from a racist book and a controversial theme park attraction, both of which have received criticism for romanticizing Western Imperialism and fetishizing non-Western peoples.” The petition points to the chain’s website, which claims Coulombe was inspired by the book “White Shadows in the South Seas” and the Disneyland Jungle Trip ride.",
            "Spokesperson Kenya Friend-Daniel told NPR on Monday that the brand “made the decision several years ago to use only the Trader Joe’s name on our products moving forward” and “had hoped that the work would be complete by now but there are still a small number of products going through the packaging change and we expect to be done very soon.”",
            "Friend-Daniel also told the publication that repackaging had been in progress before the petition and was not in response to it.",
            "She said the controversial approach to naming “may have been rooted in a lighthearted attempt at inclusiveness.” However, Friend-Daniel said, “we recognize that it may now have the opposite effect — one that is contrary to the welcoming, rewarding customer experience we strive to create every day.”",
            "In a statement to CBS News, the brand added: “While this approach to product naming may have been rooted in a lighthearted attempt at inclusiveness, we recognize that it may now have the opposite effect — one that is contrary to the welcoming, rewarding customer experience we strive to create every day.”",
            "While many of the offending product packaging has already been changed, according to the brand, Trader Joe’s also told the publication they plan to finish changing over all packaging “very soon.”",
            "Trader Joe’s did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.",
            "The chain is one of many who has been faced with reassessing their brand’s racist history and/or marketing. In the wake of the police killing of George Floyd and nationwide protests against racial inequality in America, brands like Aunt Jemima, Uncle Ben’s, Cream of Wheat, Mrs. Butterworth, and more have reevaluated their names, mascots and imagery to not perpetuate racism and stereotypes."

            "More than 460,000 signatures appeared as of Sunday on an online petition that calls for putting the name of late Rep. John Lewis on the Selma, Alabama, bridge where police beat civil rights marchers bloody in 1965.",
            "Lewis, who died Friday after a months-long battle with pancreatic cancer, led hundreds of activists across the Edmund Pettus Bridge ― named for a Confederate general and Ku Klux Klan leader ― during a civil rights march on March 7, 1965. Police charged at the marchers, beating them with clubs and firing tear gas at them in an incident that became known as “Bloody Sunday.”",
            "The John Lewis Bridge Project, launched last month, seeks to rename the bridge that crosses the Alabama River after the civil rights icon and to remove “other existing signs of the Confederacy.”",
            "The death of Lewis —a Democrat who represented Georgia’s 5th Congressional District ― further ignited support for it.",
            "“It’s far past time to rename the Edmund Pettus Bridge after Rep. John Lewis, a civil rights icon that nearly gave his life on that bridge,” Michael Starr Hopkins, a political strategist who created the project, said in a statement.",
            "“Edmund Pettus was a bitter racist, undeserving of the honor bestowed upon him,” Hopkins added. “As we wipe away this country’s long stain of bigotry, we must also wipe away the names of men like Edmund Pettus.”",
            "As of Sunday afternoon, the online petition calling for the bridge’s renaming had garnered more than 460,000 signatures, which was more than 50,000 signatures higher than the previous day.",
            "Several high-profile figures have signed the petition, including Ava DuVernay, who directed the 2014 film “Selma,” an Oscar-nominated historical drama that centered on the civil rights marches in Alabama.",
            "Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.) echoed the call to rename the bridge in an interview with NBC’s “Meet the Press.”",
            "“I think you ought to take a nice picture of that bridge with Pettus’ name on it, put it in a museum somewhere dedicated to the Confederacy, and then rename that bridge and repaint it, redecorate it: the John R. Lewis Bridge,” Clyburn said.",
            "He added: “Take his name off that bridge and replace it with a good man — John Lewis, the personification of the goodness of America — rather than to honor someone who disrespected individual freedoms.”",
            "Some Selma residents — including civil rights activists — have voiced reluctance about changing the bridge’s name. A resolution to rename the structure in 2015 was defeated in the Alabama House of Representatives, The New York Times reported.",
            "“As a daughter of Selma, I understand the complexities surrounding the renaming of the bridge,” Rep. Terri Sewell (D-Ala.) told the Times. “And while I personally can think of no better name than that of John Lewis, I ultimately believe the Selma community should decide who it is named after.”"
