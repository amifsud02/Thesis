        "HAMPSTEAD, N.C. ― Before Hurricane Florence, Hampstead’s Cross Creek was a typical Pender County subdivision, filled with one- and two-story homes with nice yards.",
        "There is a community soccer field at the entrance of the neighborhood, and Harrison Creek, which is usually more of an unassuming trickle of water at this time of year, curved around the back of the community and gave people a place to canoe or kayak. It’s a short drive to the beach and just a 25-minute drive from Wilmington.",
        "But when Hurricane Florence barreled through the region and dropped 8 trillion gallons of rain, Harrison Creek overflowed, flooding 70 of the 250 homes in the community. Thirty more households were displaced by other storm-related damage.",
        "Greg Lovell of Oakmont Drive said the storm itself “wasn’t too bad.” Eight trees fell in his yard, and people had to use chainsaws to cut escape routes out of the neighborhood as the eye of the hurricane passed. But days after the storm, waters continued to rise, and conditions worsened.",
        "Lovell scoured the neighborhood for tow straps and managed to pull 33 cars, trucks and minivans away from the floodwater. He and others launched boats from their driveways to rescue neighbors trapped in their homes by the rising water. After four days, he and his neighbors turned to social media and personal contacts for more help ― help they still need nearly a month later.",
        "Like many neighborhoods in the region, Cross Creek is still struggling with the damage. The electricity has been restored. Grocery stores and gas stations have returned to normal business. The schools will eventually reopen. But Hurricane Florence will be with them for months and years to come. And as of Tuesday, Hurricane Michael threatens to bring even more wind and rain to the region as it travels north.",
        "Among the Cross Creek residents who lost their home are Amy Helms and her fiancé, William Arnold. The house has been gutted to the studs, after 7 feet of water flooded the garage and 4 feet of water stood in the house. A 10-foot pile of drywall and insulation, appliances and furniture separate the house from the road.",
        "Despite it all, Helms said, “God has looked out for us.” They have flood insurance, and she said she believes that in “six months to a year, we can move back in.”",
        "Arnold camped in the neighborhood soccer field for days, while Helms worked at the local fire station. The field soon filled up with tents, RVs and portable toilets as more people needed a place to go. The Coast Guard helped with some rescues, though residents said they didn’t see anyone from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The initial days were hellish — inescapable heat, fear of leaving their campsites and flooded homes unattended, even deer carcasses floating in the floodwaters.",
        "As the water receded and some people could move back into their homes, the soccer field became a donation center and makeshift kitchen where local restaurants, church groups and families serve meals to residents and volunteers.",
        "Helms and Arnold relocated to a campground in nearby Sneed’s Ferry. Other displaced families fanned out to wherever they found places to stay.",
        "The soccer field is now divided into various stations. There is a “Molly Maid” tent for housecleaning supplies, an “Ace Hardware” tent, a “Food Lion” tent and a “Petco” tent for dog and cat food. Coolers are filled with ice and cold drinks. Cases of water overflow from a tractor trailer. Three cargo containers and a racecar trailer are constantly reorganized with incoming donations.",
        "Resident Sarah Robles, who recently relocated here from Long Island in New York, is running the soccer field donation center. She stepped into the role because of her willingness to issue directions. “Are you going to Pizza Hut?” she asked a neighbor. “Tell ’em it’s for the soccer field. They’ll work with you.”",
        "Like most residents, Iris Derrick of Knollwood Drive did not have flood insurance. She estimated her total loss at $450,000.",
        "“We weren’t in a flood zone,” she said. “We applied for FEMA, but you can’t count on that.”",
        "“I don’t know what the future holds,” said Derrick. “Some are talking about walking away. I mean, how do you pay a mortgage, pay rent and float a loan to rebuild your house?”",
        "Like many of her neighbors, she tries to spend little time dwelling on her situation and to think about others. Her family is among “the lucky ones,” she said. The Derricks found a rental property in Brunswick County and have been making the hour-and-a-half commute to check on their house regularly.",
        "“Our neighbors were going to send their kids to college,” she said, “but now they don’t have a home.”",
        "She was grateful for the faith-based and community groups that have come in to help, like the Billy Graham Association, Samaritan’s Purse and Renovation Church. She mentioned the 16 teenagers from Myrtle Grove Church who worked for hours pulling “wet, stinky, nasty filth out of the freezers in my garage” and dragging it to the street.",
        "Pockets of volunteers can be seen throughout Cross Creek. There are 40 to 50 volunteers from Samaritan’s Purse, an evangelical Christian humanitarian organization, who have come from different parts of the country to provide relief. Many of them worked in the aftermath of previous hurricanes like Irma, Sandy and Katrina, and they have become a family.",
        "“We get paid love,” said Cindy Backer, a volunteer from Alabama, “and we get a free T-shirt.”",
        "Billie Jo Hopkins, the mission director of Christian Fellowship Church in Elm City, North Carolina, and her husband loaded up vans and trailers with 4,200 pounds of water and 40 cases of Gatorade, along with other supplies because they saw a post on Facebook.",
        "“The Lord just laid in on my heart,” she added.",
        "“The sun might be out,” her husband said, “but the hurricane isn’t over.”",
        "Ted Wilson of Cushing, Oklahoma, brought the Cimarron Baptist Association chainsaw team. They have been working in many neighborhoods around the Wilmington area and came to Cross Creek after people requested their help.",
        "The people of Cross Creek expressed optimism about the future, despite the current circumstances.",
        "Lovell isn’t giving up on his neighborhood. “I’ll send thousands and thousands of emails and Facebook posts,” he said. “My house didn’t get flooded or destroyed, but I’m not giving up. People — Christian or non-Christian — they have faith in their neighbor.”",
        "“If you want to see something great happen,” he said, “it comes through pain.”"

    "articleContent": [
        "A Missouri judge upheld most of the state’s voter ID law on Tuesday, but struck down one provision that required voters to sign a sworn affidavit if they wanted to vote but did not have one of the favored forms of photo identification.",
        "Under the state law, which went into effect in 2017, people must show a Missouri driver’s or nondriver’s license, a passport or a military identification card ― all of which have photos ― before they can cast their ballot. If they don’t have any of those, they can show a number of other prescribed forms of identification that may not have photos. Under the problematic provision, the latter voters also had to sign a document swearing that they didn’t have “a form of identification approved for voting.” If they lied on the form, they could face criminal prosecution.",
        "In his ruling, Senior Judge Richard Callahan of the Cole County Circuit Court blocked the state from requiring the affidavit because he said it was confusing.",
        "“The affidavit plainly requires the voter to swear that they do not possess a form of personal identification approved for voting while simultaneously presenting to the election authority a form of personal identification that is approved,” he wrote. “All of this occurs in an affidavit in which the first line informs the voter that they are required to ‘solemnly swear or affirm,’ and lest they forget, reminds them in the last line that a false swearing subjects them to criminal prosecution.”",
        "Critics of voter ID laws say they unfairly discriminate against minority voters, who are less likely to possess the kinds of photo IDs that states tend to require.",
        "Callahan’s decision comes in the final weeks of a closely watched Senate race between Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill and her challenger, Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley. The suit was filed by Priorities USA, a Democratic group, on behalf of a Missouri voter in her 70s.",
        "The law also directed the Missouri secretary of state to advertise the voter ID requirements to the public. But Callahan said Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft (R) had incorrectly suggested in those ads that a photo ID was required to vote. The judge blocked the state from issuing any further materials making that suggestion.",
        "“As the state concedes, a photo identification card is not a requirement for voting; however, the print message promulgated by the State could clearly lead voters to believe that they would be unable to cast a ballot without presenting a photo identification card. Certainly, several local election authorities were led to so believe, as evidenced by their web sites and training materials,” the judge wrote.",
        "Ashcroft’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
        "Overall, Callahan said, the voter ID law was “within [the state legislature’s] constitutional prerogative under the Missouri Constitution.” He also upheld a provision of the law that allowed state officials to throw out someone’s ballot if that person did not have any acceptable form of ID and their signature did not match the one on file.",
        "Voters in Missouri approved a constitutional amendment mandating voter ID in 2016. It is one of 34 states that require people to show identification at the polls, though the kind of identification and the process if someone lacks ID vary from state to state."

        "A group of 30 Catholic sisters has embarked on a bus tour of America, urging Catholics to consider more than their faith’s stance on abortion when heading to the polls this November.",
        "The Network Lobby for Catholic Social Justice, a progressive Catholic lobbying group, launched its “Nuns on the Bus” tour on Monday in California, with help from House Minority Leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.)",
        "The overarching focus of this year’s Network bus tour is to hold congressional Republicans accountable for voting in favor of the Trump administration’s sweeping overhaul of the U.S. tax code, which delivered the biggest boosts to the wealthy, while offering modest benefits to working-class voters. Experts claim it could add at least $1 trillion to the debt.",
        "In addition, the sisters are taking aim at Republicans’ proposals to balance tax breaks for the rich with major cuts to entitlement programs, like Medicare and Medicaid. The GOP has also proposed imposing stricter work requirements on people who receive food stamps.",
        "Pelosi, a Catholic, said during a launch event in Santa Monica that there was no justice in the Republicans’ tax law.",
        "“Pope Paul VI, he said, ‘if you want peace, work for justice’ — and there is no justice in this tax bill,” Pelosi said during the rally, according to Religion News Service. “There is no economic justice. There is no social justice. There is no environmental justice. There is no budget justice.”",
        "Sister Simone Campbell, Network’s executive director, told HuffPost that the Catholic faith has been “hijacked” by those who have made the issue of abortion a “political sound bite” that trumps all other elements of Catholic social justice teaching.",
        "Speaking from the bus en route to Las Vegas, Campbell pointed to an apostolic exhortation Pope Francis released earlier this year that stated that though Catholics should be “clear, firm and passionate” in their “defense of the innocent unborn,” the lives of the poor and oppressed are “equally sacred.”",
        "“I’ve been really upset that one party has used that [Catholics’ views on abortion] for their political gain and denied the full story of their faith,” Campbell said. “We’re on the road to tell the full story of the faith. It’s much bigger than one issue.”",
        "The Catholic sisters plan to hold various rallies, town halls and roundtable discussions in 21 states over 27 days, focusing on districts where Republican incumbents chose to support Trump’s tax law. (No Democratic member of Congress voted in favor of the bill.)",
        "The tour will end with a “Fiesta for the Common Good” outside President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.",
        "This is the sixth time since 2012 that Catholic sisters from Network have gone on a national bus tour. This year’s group includes women from a wide array of Catholic religious orders, ranging in age from 28 to 86 ― though most of the participants are older.",
        "Campbell said she’s encouraging people she meets on the road who oppose the GOP tax law to add their signatures to the bus itself. She hopes that by the time the bus reaches Mar-a-Lago, it will carry signatures from people across the country who have pledged to work for a more just tax policy.",
        "Overall, Catholic voters are split between the Republican (46 percent) and Democratic (47 percent) parties, according to the Pew Research Center. White Catholics tend to lean Republican (54 percent), while Hispanic Catholics are more likely to lean Democratic (64 percent).",
        "Campbell said she realizes tax legislation is a topic that most people have trouble becoming passionate about. But she hopes to speak to voters across the country about how Trump’s tax law poses an “existential threat to everything we care about in our nation.”",
        "“We care for the 100 percent, not just those at the top,” Campbell said. “While it’s true that those at the bottom need some additional revenue, let’s not do that at the expense of everything else that supports them.”"

        "WALTHAMSTOW, London ― It’s Friday night, and Hoe Street Central Bank is hosting a party to sell a new kind of bond. Piles of banknotes are on display in the opened vault and cocktails flow. But it is not a real bank. Nor is it real money. HSCB – as the bank’s also known in a nod to the global banking corporation HSBC – is a project founded by local artists Hilary Powell and Dan Edelstyn.",
        "With so many misconceptions about the way money and debt are created, the couple wants to shine a light on how the financial system traps people within a cycle of debt, driving inequality.",
        "The bank has been printing and selling its own money since December 2016 and it will use the proceeds to buy $1.3 million of local debt. The new bonds produced and sold this month aim to raise money to fund the bank’s next big event: putting paperwork related to that debt into a cash-in-transit van (used to move money about) and exploding it.",
        "Edelstyn says the stunt, which is inspired by the film “The Italian Job,” is symbolic and intended to attract attention to an issue that is often perceived as dry and complex. “Debt is so elastic and abstract. To get it into people’s imagination you have to do something fun and exciting,” he said.",
        "The couple – who together are making a feature documentary about the project – started printing fake banknotes to sell as artwork in their garden shed almost two years ago. They saw it as a way of illustrating how banks create money out of thin air – or in the artists’ case, some pulp and ink.",
        "It is a common misconception that commercial banks lend money deposited by savers, when in fact the banks create money to make loans. This means that whenever money is created, so is debt. Because the majority of lending goes toward property or financial markets, this drives up property prices and makes a crash more likely, explains Fran Boait, executive director of campaigning group Positive Money.",
        "With stagnant wages failing to keep up with the rising cost of living in the United Kingdom over the past decade and cuts to public services as a result of austerity, people are often forced to take out loans to pay for bills and basic subsistence. They then have to take out additional loans to pay back the interest on their existing loans, and a cycle begins.",
        "Of course, it’s not just the U.K. which has high levels of personal debt. American households have $13.3 trillion of debt, a figure which has been rising consecutively for four years. Although the economy is booming, wages are not keeping up, and 44 percent of Americans say an unexpected expense, such as a medical bill of a few hundred dollars, would be a struggle to cover. Around 2.5 million households turn to payday loans, often with massive interest rates, every year.",
        "“Money should be a tool to make our lives easier, but the way it is designed is trapping people in debt and not resulting in good outcomes,” said Boait.",
        "In March, the artists found the perfect space to expand their operation – a former bank branch that has been turned into a co-working space. They have decorated it to look like an old-fashioned bank interior, with green bankers’ lamps and wooden desks with drawers stuffed full of printing and paper-making paraphernalia. Framed prints of their work adorn the walls, while freshly printed notes are pegged to a line dry. When we first meet, Powell, who wears an apron with a “governor” name badge pinned to it, stains copies of the HSCB banknotes in hot tea.",
        "The notes feature the faces of the heads of four local services that have been hit by austerity cuts – a food bank, a homeless kitchen, a primary school and a youth program.",
        "The couple has raised $52,000 from the sale of the notes so far, with purchasers including overseas collectors in Texas and Germany and the Museum of London. Half of the money raised goes to the causes run by the people featured on the banknotes, while the other half has been used to buy up and abolish $1.3 million payday loan debt owed by local people.",
        "The artists have been able to do this via the secondary debt market. When individuals are no longer able to pay their credit card bills or loans, banks cut their losses and sell the debt on to third parties for pennies on the dollar. These third parties are then able to pursue the bad debt for the full amount. Or they sell on to other debt collectors, who then get the right to collect in full.",
        "Powell and Edelstyn were inspired by a similar scheme in the United States called Rolling Jubilee. Born out of the Occupy Wall Street movement, the fund has raised more than $700,000 that has been used to cancel more than $31 million of student loans and medical debt. In a similar stunt, John Oliver, host of HBO’s “Last Week Tonight,” eradicated nearly $15 million worth of debt owed to hospitals in Texas, calling it the biggest TV giveaway in history.",
        "Other than an area postcode, Powell and Edelstyn do not know the circumstances behind the debt they are cancelling. And that is irrelevant to them anyway, since the point of the project is draw attention to the ubiquity of debt, rather than “moralizing” on how people spend their money – or lack of it, said Powell.",
        "“There’s a narrative around that it’s just silly, poor people getting into debt, when it’s actually affecting wider swaths of society and everyone is only one step away from it,” she said.",
        "“The problem is it’s the people at the bottom with all the debt and people at the top with the money,” said Edelstyn. He hopes the project will highlight the “hypocrisy” of bankers and politicians telling people they should manage their money better. “People at the top don’t need to manage their money better because they’ll get bailed out by the people at the bottom anyway,” he said, referring to the taxpayer-funded bank bailouts following the financial crash.",
        "The artists are reaching the dénouement of their project – blowing up a van overlooking London’s financial district in December this year. They are calling the stunt Big Bang 2, in reference to the 1986 deregulation of the financial market in the U.K. known as the Big Bang. Proceeds from the sales of the bonds will cover the production costs of the stunt and they hope to display the blown-up vehicle somewhere in the financial district.",
        "Donating money and buying back debt helps individuals, but it does not, of course, stop people going into debt in the first place.",
        "Education is key here, said Boait. “Public education has been underplayed as a really important part of how social change happens,” she added. “If we understand things it’s a lot more difficult for the politicians or bankers to pull the wool over our eyes.”",
        "Writing to political representatives or organizing local campaigning groups on the issue are “small steps” that can help lead to positive social change, she added.",
        "Powell and Edelstyn are seeing this momentum. They have had economists and academics visit and they have been invited to do talks at universities. People across the country have been in touch about setting up their own versions. The couple has ambitions to turn the space into an activism and cultural hub looking at other social, economic and environmental issues, such as energy. Having received a few small grants at the start of the project, the couple has applied for more to help them expand it.",
        "Given the amount of interest their project has received, they are confident the model can affect change. “When we first started this, no one was really talking about [how money debt is created] on the airwaves. People don’t dare talk about these issues in political circles unless there’s an appetite for them in culture,” said Powell.",

        "Two Democratic senators asked Wednesday for the Government Accountability Office to launch an investigation into the practices and policies of virtual charter schools. The request comes on the same day the Center for American Progress released a report outlining stark academic shortcomings at these schools and a disproportionate focus on profit over quality.",
        "The virtual charter schools have come under scrutiny in states including California and Ohio. But now Democratic Sens. Patty Murray (Wash.) and Sherrod Brown (Ohio) are calling for a more comprehensive look at how these schools work in the 27 states that house them. About 300,000 students attend these online public schools of choice. The enrollment has been steadily increasing over the years.",
        "“There is almost no research on whether virtual charter schools meet student needs, especially for students who require specific accommodations, including English learners and students with disabilities,” says the letter from the senators.",
        "Brown and Murray are asking the GAO to shed light on issues surrounding student outcomes, school funding and spending, rigor of academic courses, recruitment tactics and the relationship between enrollment growth and student performance.",
        "The new report from the liberal Center for American Progress is providing a critical look at these schools. It looked at both for-profit virtual charter schools and virtual charter schools that are managed by for-profit companies, focusing on companies like K-12 Inc. and Connections Education. K-12 Inc. has strong ties to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who had invested in the company and has championed its brand of school choice. But researchers, who looked at five states in the report, say that students at virtual charter schools are suffering poor academic outcomes while company executives get rich.",
        "In 2017, for example, Idaho Virtual Academy, an online school with connections to K12 Inc., had a 44 percent graduation rate, compared with the state’s 80 percent graduation rate. While leaders connected to virtual schools often stress that they typically serve severely economically distressed children, the students attending Idaho Virtual Academy did not appear to be significantly poorer than those in the state at-large, according to the report.",
        "Representatives of K12 Inc. were not provided with a copy of the report prior to its publication, but they emphasized that the students they serve often come to their school already behind. K12 Inc. is the largest for-profit virtual school company in the country.",
        "“When [students] get to us, they’re not going to graduate with their normal class because they weren’t going to graduate with their class at the school they came from,” K-12 CEO Nate Davis told HuffPost by phone. “We have to remediate them.”",
        "In a statement, Davis criticized the report for attacking the virtual school model rather than trying to “understand why parents are choosing online charter schools and how to best address students’ needs.”",
        "The Center for American Progress report also criticizes these schools’ use of public dollars. Unlike traditional public schools, these institutions are designed to turn a profit, which means they place a disproportionate emphasis on recruiting new students. Financial records indicate that K12 Inc. spends over $30 million on marketing and advertising to recruit students, according to the report. Top company executives can also earn millions of dollars. Executives are eligible for lucrative bonuses so long as less than 10 percent of K-12 Inc. schools are in jeopardy of closure.",
        "Indeed, Davis told HuffPost that “schools’ ability to meet academic performance and stay open” is a measure that has been used in determining executive compensation. In the past, state proficiency scores have also been used as a measure.",
        "Representatives of Connections Education noted that its own recent report had different results than CAP’s analysis. It found that its students performed similarly to those in schools with highly mobile populations.",
        "But Meg Benner, author of the CAP report, said she hopes that for-profit charter schools start to receive more scrutiny, as do for-profit colleges.",
        "“Overall the research is clear: The academic progress of for-profit charter schools, and online ones in particular, are really abysmal,” Benner said.",
        "This story has been updated with a statement from Nate Davis."

        "Sophie Turner and Maisie Williams, who play sisters on HBO’s mega-hit “Game of Thrones,” sure know how to unwind.",
        "Turner reflected Saturday on her time on the set of “GoT” at New York Comic Con 2018. And, although she didn’t offer any concrete details of the upcoming eighth and final season of the show, she did give some interesting behind-the-scenes tidbits about how she and Williams, who is also her close friend, relax after a day of shooting.",
        "“We’re kind of like loners on ‘Game of Thrones,’ just because the past few seasons Maisie and I have sleepovers every night when we’re shooting. Or every night whenever both of us are in town. We just used to sit there and eat and watch stupid videos and smoke weed,” she said, according to Vulture. “I don’t know if my publicist will kill me for saying this. We’d get high and then we’d sit in the bath together and we’d rub makeup brushes on our faces. It’s fun.”",
        "No word on if they used a Mother of Dragons bath bomb or if they’re more sativa and indica girls, but Turner did offer a little insight into what her character, Sansa Stark, will be going through next season.",
        "“I know I say this every season, but Sansa really comes into her own this season. The past few seasons for her and the whole series for her, she’s kind of been somewhat lost as a matter of where she wants to be, who she wants to be, who she wants to surround herself with, and this season she is very, very self-assured. She knows what she wants. She knows what she stands for. She knows who she wants to be around, and she faces threats to that this season. But, well, we’ll see how that goes.”",
        "If her depiction seemed a bit vague, it actually makes a whole lot of sense. The 22-year-old actress also emphasized the crazy precautions the show has taken to keep spoilers from leaking out while at Comic Con.",
        "“The secrecy is crazy,” Turner said. “We have a whole different name for it when we’re shooting it. I think this season it was like the Tree of Life or something.”",
        "Turner also mentioned that names are changed on the script and the call sheets and that something called a “drone killer” shoots down anything that flies over the show’s sets.",
        "“I don’t know how it does it. It creates like this field around, and the drones just drop,” she said. “Also, we shoot fake scenes. We got into costume in Croatia because we know the paparazzi lurk around there, so we would spend like half a day doing nothing.”",
        "Fun! And by that description alone, we’re thinking she and Williams’ smoked a whole lot of indica to deal with that."

    },
    "articleContent": [
        "After a whirlwind of testimonies, investigations and protests leading up to Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation to the Supreme Court on Saturday, the embattled justice now begins his lifetime position ruling on the country’s most contentious cases.",
        "While President Donald Trump’s pick for the highest court in the land has been scrutinized over how he’ll vote on issues relating to reproductive rights, climate change and other hot-button issues, the cases Kavanaugh is scheduled or likely to hear this term will give Americans their first insight into how far he’ll swing the court to the right now that swing voter Justice Anthony Kennedy is out of the picture.",
        "Here are five interesting cases in which Kavanaugh could be the deciding vote.",
        "Protecting people from being tried for the same crime twice",
        "Gamble v. United States, one of the first cases the Supreme Court has agreed to hear, centers on the constitutionality of the “separate sovereignty exception” to the Fifth Amendment’s double jeopardy clause.",
        "In simpler terms, that’s a controversial loophole in the rule that a person cannot be tried for the same crime twice. The exception under question holds that because the federal and state government are “separate sovereigns,” the double jeopardy clause does not apply.",
        "There’s been some speculation that removing the loophole may or may not benefit Trump and others under scrutiny in special counsel Robert Mueller’s ongoing investigation, but the case centers on a separate incident that could have major implications for the prison system.",
        "It was brought to the Supreme Court by Terance Martez Gamble, a man convicted under Alabama state law for being a felon in possession of a firearm and sentenced to one year in prison. When he was later found guilty under federal laws as well and sentenced to another 46 months, Gamble challenged the charge as violating double jeopardy protections and called on the court to re-evaluate its stance that state and federal governments are separate sovereignties over Americans.",
        "The American Civil Liberties Union has long denounced the exception, arguing that the “increasing use of joint state-federal task forces increases the risk that states will simply take a first bite at the apple and then hand the file to the feds for a second,” among other concerns.",
        "Limiting who can be charged under the Armed Career Criminal Act",
        "In another case with implications for lengths of prison sentences, the Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case dealing with which state robbery crimes should be considered violent felonies under the Armed Career Criminal Act, a statute that set a minimum sentence of 15 years for crimes involving firearms if the offender already has three serious or violent felony convictions on their record.",
        "The case, Stokeling v. United States, was brought forth by Denard Stokeling, who in 2016 received a federal conviction of being a felon in possession of a gun. He’s arguing that an unarmed robbery he was convicted of in Florida in 1997 should not be classified as a violent crime, thus disqualifying him from being sentenced under the ACCA.",
        "The Supreme Court’s decision is expected to have significant implications for how theft crimes are defined and will provide some clarity on how federal courts should interpret widely varying state definitions of those crimes.",
        "Detaining immigrants during deportation proceedings",
        "The Supreme Court has also agreed to decide in Nielsen v. Preap, a case that will determine whether thousands of longtime U.S. residents face indefinite detention without a bond hearing.",
        "The class-action lawsuit brought forth by a group of immigrants who have been detained under a provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act that authorizes federal authorities to detain anyone subject to deportation.",
        "At issue in this case is whether ― after being released from imprisonment ― “criminal aliens” who have been convicted of certain crimes may be detained in the federal government’s custody without bond hearings until their cases are resolved. The policy keeps immigrants in detention for months or years in some cases before they’re ever able to challenge their deportation.",
        "“Does the statute really deny bond hearings to all of them ― longtime residents of the U.S. who were convicted of minor offenses 5, 10, 15 or more years ago?” The Atlantic wrote in a lengthy exploration into the issue on Monday. “What if a person has long ago been released and has returned to a community, established a family and put down roots, and lived a blameless life since that brush with the law? In other words, what if the immigrant would otherwise be a prime candidate for bond?”",
        "Applying civil rights protections in LGBT discrimination cases",
        "One case that may be added to the Supreme Court’s docket this term would determine whether the federal civil rights law that bans workplace sex discrimination also applies to sexual orientation.",
        "In Zarda v. Altitude Express, Inc., a skydiving company asked the Supreme Court to hear an appeal in the case it lost in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit earlier this year. That decision found that the company violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 when it fired him for being gay.",
        "“Because sexual orientation is a function of sex and sex is a protected characteristic under Title VII, it follows that sexual orientation is also protected,” the court ruled.",
        "This marks the second time that Altitude Express has asked the Supreme Court to make a higher judgment in its case.",
        "Allowing religious symbols on public property",
        "Another issue that could be added to the Supreme Court’s docket concerns a set of rulings that barred the display of large crosses on public property.",
        "In two lawsuits out of Maryland likely to be considered as one case if they’re granted an appeal before the Supreme Court, and a similar one out of Florida whose parties are hoping to bypass lower courts so that it may be considered with the Maryland cases, the Supreme Court may consider how far the government may go in preventing religious symbols on public property.",
        "The case could be an interesting test for where this more conservative Supreme Court could land on concerns about the separation of church and state."

        "One of the women who confronted Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) in an elevator to tell him about her own sexual assault shared a message of staunch resilience after the Senate confirmed accused sexual assaulter Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court in a 50-48 vote Saturday.",
        "“When we band together and tell our stories, we can change the future of this country,” Ana Maria Archila said in a statement calling Kavanaugh’s confirmation a “sham process.”",
        "“We have told the truth about sexual predator Brett Kavanaugh. We have made clear the Republican Party has no respect for our bodies, our choices, or our voices,” said Archila, executive director of the Center for Popular Democracy.",
        "She had not spoken out about her sexual assault before the confrontation, which CNN caught on camera. Archila and another woman, Maria Gallagher, a recent college graduate, stopped Flake and his aides before the elevator doors could close and laid into him for potentially supporting Kavanaugh.",
        "“What you are doing is allowing someone who actually violated a woman to sit on the Supreme Court!” Archila shouted at Flake. “What are you doing, sir? This is the future of our country!”\n\nGallagher demanded Flake not avert his eyes.\n\n“Look at me when I’m talking to you!” she shouted. “You’re telling me that my assault doesn’t matter.”",
        "In an unexpected move, Flake, who is retiring from the Senate, pushed his Republican colleagues to ask the White House to open an FBI investigation into the accusations against Kavanaugh late last month. He said that the elevator confrontation “struck a chord” with him and he found the tension between Republicans and Democrats worrisome.",
        "Yet Republicans said the completed FBI report contained no corroborating information, while Democrats blasted it as woefully incomplete because of tight restrictions the White House reportedly placed on the investigation. Flake ultimately voted yes on Kavanaugh.\n\nAfter Saturday’s confirmation vote, Archila said on CNN that she feels “we have elected officials that don’t know how to listen,” citing the number of people who showed up at senators’ offices to speak with them.\n\n“I was in that elevator deadly afraid that my children will have fewer rights than I do today,” she added.\n\nKavanaugh’s confirmation was thrown into disarray last month when the first sexual misconduct allegation against the judge was revealed. Christine Blasey Ford, a California professor, soon came forward as the accuser, saying that when they were teenagers in 1982, Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed and tried to remove her clothing while grinding against her. When she tried to scream, he covered her mouth, she said.\n\nTwo other women, Deborah Ramirez and Julie Swetnick, later came forward with allegations against Kavanaugh, all of which he denied.\n\nArchila said in an op-ed piece for USA Today that she was inspired by Ford’s courage to come forward and subsequently testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\n“Women will not be silenced. Women will not be afraid. And on election day, women will vote,” Archila said after Kavanaugh was voted onto the nation’s highest court. “When we cast our ballots this November, we will elect true leaders who respect our bodies and our interests.”",
        "Archila went on to commend those who protested ― many of whom were arrested ― at demonstrations on Capitol Hill and around the country, saying, “We’re just getting started.”",
        "Kavanaugh’s confirmation was all but guaranteed on Friday afternoon when Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) announced her support, joining fellow swing senators Joe Manchin (D-W.V.) and Flake. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) was the lone Republican who joined Democrats in voting against Kavanaugh.",
        "“In our resistance we exemplified the true spirit of popular democracy ― imaginative, informed and sustained participation by all of us,” Archila said.",
        "She concluded: “November is coming.”",
        "This story has been updated with Archila’s comments to CNN.",

        "Shortly after Kavanaugh’s appointment was confirmed, King shared a photo of a sleeping baby wearing a bow and wrote, “Soon, babies like this little angel will be protected in the womb by law.”",
        "The identity of the baby in the tweet was unclear.",
        "King, whose white supremacist views the GOP has largely ignored, is one of the most vocal opponents of abortion in Congress.",
        "Like other Republicans, he sees Kavanaugh as a justice who would sweeten the chances of reversing Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that affirmed women’s constitutional right to legal abortion.",
        "But while Kavanaugh’s past rulings on access to abortion and contraception may hint at an end to Roe v. Wade, his presence on the Supreme Court doesn’t necessarily guarantee it.",
        "Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who supports abortion rights but voted to confirm Kavanaugh, argued during a speech on the Senate floor on Friday that Kavanaugh was not going to vote to overturn Roe v. Wade.",
        "Collins said he privately assured her that “decisions become part of our legal framework with the passage of time and that honoring precedent is essential to maintaining public confidence.”",
        "During his hearing in early September, Kavanaugh also described Roe v. Wade as “settled Supreme Court precedent” and acknowledged that it was “reaffirmed many times,” making it a “precedent on a precedent.”",
        "People responded to King’s tweet to highlight the hypocrisy of sharing a photo of a baby girl while supporting policies that hurt women’s access to health care, opposing commonsense gun laws in light of school shootings, and supporting a Supreme Court nominee who was accused of sexually assaulting a girl when he was a teenager.",
        "King’s behavior on Twitter has been suspect in recent months, making him appear to be an outright white supremacist. The Republican has promoted the views of prominent white nationalists, including Lana Lokteff, host of media outfit Red Ice (designated by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a hate group), and British neo-Nazi Mark Collett.",
        "Just last month, he disparaged Kavanaugh’s accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, by sharing a meme that suggested she was lying about her assault for Hillary Clinton.",
        "King, who has served eight terms in Congress, is up for re-election this November against Democrat J.D. Scholten."

        "Brett Kavanaugh is likely being confirmed to the Supreme Court. And for many, that news feels devastating.",
        "Several women have publicly accused Kavanaugh of sexually harassing or assaulting them when he was in high school and college in the 1980s. The discussion surrounding those accusations has been particularly difficult for sexual assault victims, who have heard politicians dismiss survivors’ pain amid a barrage of news coverage and heated conversations about Kavanaugh. The judge’s controversial Supreme Court bid has also triggered memories that many survivors have worked extremely hard to move past.",
        "The Kavanaugh hearing “may cause individuals to re-remember the abuse, have memories and flashbacks. People may also experience guilt and shame if they reported or did not report. Anger and helplessness are also common,” said Elizabeth L. Jeglic, a licensed clinical psychologist, psychology professor at John Jay College and a sexual violence prevention researcher.",
        "If you’ve been struggling with Kavanaugh’s nomination and recent news that the Senate is likely voting him onto the Supreme Court, here are some expert tips for self-care right now:",
        "1. Practice deep breathing.",
        "“Our breath is one of the simplest and most effective tools we have to calm our nervous system,” said Liz Arch, a certified domestic violence counselor advocate and creator of Primal Yoga.",
        "She noted that when someone is stuck in a trauma response, events from the past can replay in their nervous system as if they are happening in the present.",
        "“Conscious breathing can help pull us out of the past by giving us a direct anchor to the present moment,” Arch said, adding that it’s important to take deep breaths from your abdomen.",
        "“When we’re anxious, stressed, or panicky, our breath becomes shallow and rapid and shifts into our upper chest. Learning to breathe into our belly ― known as diaphragmatic breathing ― in particular taps into our parasympathetic nervous system and stimulates the vagus nerve, which has a calming effect on body and mind.”",
        "2. Recognize your emotions and allow yourself to feel them.",
        "“Naming feelings is the only way I have found to keep from drowning in them,” said Alle C. Hall, a writer from Seattle who experienced sexual assault trauma and described the journey of accepting what happened as being “a process.”",
        "“I keep my feeling list very simple: Joy, shame, pain, anger, sad and lonely,” Hall said.",
        "Whenever she finds herself stewing over the Kavanagh vote, she puts her survival practice into action, she says. “Just now, I went to my Facebook page and posted, ‘I feel sad.’ And I feel a surge of energy and personal power. Never fails.”",
        "3. Take a social media breather.",
        "“The group-think will be strong and can add to self-righteousness or toxic indignation in the immediate aftermath,” said Nancy Irwin, a trauma specialist and primary therapist at Seasons in Malibu. A Facebook and Twitter hiatus “can allow us to be in acceptance, which is more easily done in calm, quiet and solitude,” she said.",
        "Try turning off all social media notifications from your devices, temporarily deleting apps from your mobile devices and tablets, and putting your phone in airplane mode whenever you’re not using it.",
        "4. Limit your news consumption.",
        "“I have been encouraging my clients to not watch the news for a while, as they are being triggered by the constant coverage and this contributes greatly to the feelings of despair and sadness,” said Ginger Poag, a licensed clinical social worker and trauma specialist who has been helping women to cope with the Kavanaugh media coverage over the past few weeks.",
        "“I am getting many phone calls where women have been triggered by the news, and trauma that occurred 30 years ago is coming up for them once again. Many of the women have never told anyone of the abuse,” Poag said, noting that staying away from the headlines can help you stop fueling the fire.",
        "5. Empower yourself through action.",
        "“Watching the news as a bystander can feel radically disempowering and can shut us down into freeze or collapse,” Arch said. “If scrolling through your news feed for hours makes you feel helpless or hopeless, take action instead.”",
        "Taking action can include signing petitions, attending rallies and donating to causes and organizations that feel supportive and empowering.",
        "“Find ways to mobilize, even if it’s simply getting together with a group of trusted friends to laugh, cry, hug or shout,” Arch added.",
        "6. Recognize the potential for positive change.",
        "The country is extremely divided now, but that also means that people are talking about these polarizing issues and are becoming inspired to take action in the face of political despair. If you’re feeling down, take a moment to recognize the good that could potentially come from the news of Kavanaugh’s likely confirmation.",
        "Michael Brustein, a clinical psychologist in New York City, noted that it’s important to stop and realize that many people are very upset and that you are not alone.",
        "“The political regression may spur social progress, as it may elicit more civil engagement from the underserved,” he said.",
        "7. Don’t be afraid to ask for help.",
        "“Sexual assault victims everywhere can find themselves triggered by news reports about current events and be reminded of their own abuse histories,” said Nikole Benders-Hadi, a board-certified adult psychiatrist at Doctor On Demand. “The confirmation process of Brett Kavanaugh and how it has evolved to include sexual assault allegations is one such example, and I do worry about the mental health impact on my patients.”",
        "Benders-Hadi recommended that anyone feeling particularly triggered by current events reach out to friends and family for support “to help you process new emotions that are surfacing.”",
        "She also has one tip for those who find themselves in a support system role: “The most important thing we can do for all victims of assault is to support and validate their feelings,” she said.",
        "8. Find a healthy distraction.",
        "“I encourage my clients to try to fill their time with something positive, such as getting coffee with a friend or taking a walk in nature, which is very healing and therapeutic,” Poag said.",
        "This can help you keep your mind off a traumatic or upsetting event and shift your focus. Irwin suggested going to a movie, preferably a comedy.",
        "“Our heart muscles have been tensed and strained heavily over the past few days and weeks. Comedy and laughter can relax and restore,” she added.",
        "9. Limit alcohol consumption.",
        "Oftentimes we turn to alcohol if we are feeling overwhelmed or anxious, but experts say that in times like these, self-medicating is not the answer.",
        "“It is important to not drink during this period of time, because our emotions become more intensified with alcohol, and in turn, can cause us to feel worse and out of control,” Poag said.",
        "10. Call a sexual assault prevention hotline.",
        "“Sexual assault prevention lines are there for support even if the abuse happened a long time ago,” Jeglic said.",
        "The National Sexual Assault hotline offers free, confidential help by trained staff members who can provide support, information and referrals.",
        "“These resources can be an important step in addressing any feelings of re-traumatization that can take place in response to current events,” added Jhumka Gupta, a public health researcher and assistant professor at George Mason University’s Department of Global and Community Health who studies the public health impacts of violence and sexual assault on women.",
        "11. Make an appointment with a mental health professional.",
        "“My grave concern is that trauma survivors are being triggered by current events to the point that they are having difficulty functioning or finding themselves experiencing persistent or intolerable suffering. It is necessary to have professionally managed trauma therapy if you are in this category,” said Drew Pinsky, a trauma expert and host of KABC Dr. Drew Midday Live.",
        "Pinsky added that if you have had previous treatment and are now having trouble functioning, it would be a good idea to revisit the care of a mental health professional.",
        "“Trauma-informed treatment works, and without treatment, your nervous system is literally stuck in the traumatic experience, often experiencing the event biologically, again and again,” he said.",
        "Trauma survivors may resist treatment because they have an incorrect sense than an incident is behind them or that talking to a professional will mean that the trauma will have to be relived or revivified to resolve, Pinsky said.",
        "“That is not the case,” he said. “Well-trained professional will make sure you are only exposed to tolerable doses.”",
        "He said that whether it’s your local county services, a local university or another training facility, there are numerous treatment options available. You deserve to feel OK.",

        "More than 6,000 sexual assault kits that could potentially bring justice to thousands of rape victims in Washington state have not been tested, according to the state attorney general’s office.",
        "In a Wednesday press release, the office of Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson said it determined there was a statewide backlog of 6,460 evidence kits after collecting inventory information from 208 law enforcement agencies in the state. Many of the kits have been in storage for years, with the oldest untested kit dating back to 1982.",
        "The medical evidence kits contain biological samples collected from people who reported that they were assaulted. Authorities booked the kits into evidence but never submitted them to a crime lab for a DNA analysis.",
        "“Sexual assault survivors deserve justice,” Ferguson said. “Each sexual assault kit tells a story from a survivor that must be heard.”",
        "Washington state is among numerous other places where untested sexual assault kits have piled up. End The Backlog, a nonprofit organization that aims to address the issue, estimates there are hundreds of thousands of untested kits in storage facilities across the country.",
        "Ferguson has been working to address the problem in his state. Late last year, his office received a $3 million grant from the U.S. Department of Justice to deal with the backlog. Since then, the office has received roughly $750,000, or one-quarter of the grant money, to conduct an inventory of the untested kits. The state legislature has also dedicated funding to the backlog.",
        "The attorney general reported two types of rape kit backlogs. The first is the “unsubmitted” sexual assault kit backlog, which consists of kits that sit in evidence storage facilities because DNA analysis was never requested.",
        "The second type of backlog occurs in crime lab facilities and involves “backlogged” sexual assault kits that have been submitted and are awaiting testing.",
        "The findings are frightening.",
        "The kits could contain DNA from suspects who could be identified through the FBI’S national DNA database system. The central repository of DNA information contains biological evidence not only from sex offenders, but also from individuals arrested or convicted of federal offenses or other qualifying crimes, which vary by state.",
        "The Seattle Times reported that King County prosecutors demonstrated the value of testing old rape kits on Monday, when they charged 53-year-old Darin Lamont Bolar in the sexual assault of a teenager in Seattle more than a decade ago.",
        "The victim’s rape kit, which contained evidence collected in 2007, was not tested until last December. Between 2007 and now, prosecutors said, Bolar was able to commit additional “violent and sexually aggressive crimes,” according to the Times.",
        "With backlogged rape kits now inventoried, Ferguson said his office will request the remainder of the federal grant money to pay for testing. Once the kits are tested, authorities can use DNA evidence to reopen cases, he said.",
        "Testing the kits could “identify serial rapists, link cases across the country, provide critical links that could solve homicide cases and provide answers to victims and their families,” the attorney general’s office said.",

        "WASHINGTON ― Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said Friday she plans to support Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, paving the way for his confirmation.",
        "Collins announced her decision at the end of blistering 45-minute speech in which she defended Kavanaugh’s judicial record, criticized his opponents, and laid to waste Christine Blasey Ford’s claim that he sexually assaulted her.",
        "“I believe that [Ford] is a survivor of sexual assault and that this trauma has upended her life,” Collins said, before offering a series of criticisms of Ford’s allegations. “I do not believe that these charges can fairly prevent Judge Kavanaugh from serving on the court.”",
        "The long-awaited announcement comes as a blow to Democrats and women’s groups who view the appellate court judge as a serious threat to the Affordable Care Act and reproductive rights, which Collins claims to support.",
        "Women’s groups also hoped Collins would have voted to reject Kavanaugh’s nomination based on the allegations of sexual assault that were leveled against him late in the confirmation process. Last month, the Maine lawmaker called for a pause in the process to hear from Ford, the woman who accused Kavanaugh of groping her in high school when they were both teens. The FBI conducted a limited investigation of the allegation, but the report proved inconclusive.",
        "The Senate is expected to hold its final confirmation vote on Saturday. With Collins and Jeff Flake of Arizona, another wavering GOP senator, on board, Kavanaugh’s bid to the high court appears to be all but assured. Shortly after Collins’ speech, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), another potential swing vote, announced his support of Kavanaugh.",
        "Nominated by President Donald Trump in July to replace former Justice Anthony Kennedy, the 53-year-old Kavanaugh is viewed by legal experts as a reliable conservative who will tilt the balance of the Supreme Court to the right for decades.",
        "Collins, a blue state lawmaker, faced an intense lobbying campaign organized by progressive groups aimed at persuading her to reject Kavanaugh based on his record as a federal appellate court judge and other issues. Causing particular concern to the groups were comments Kavanaugh has made praising Supreme Court Justice William Rehnquist’s dissent in Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that legalized abortion rights nationwide.",
        "In addition to millions of dollars spent on anti-Kavanaugh TV ads in Maine, activists sent Collins’ offices 3,000 coat hangers, a symbol of the dangerous method for terminating a pregnancy used when abortion was illegal and many women resorted to risky procedures.",
        "In Friday’s announcement, Collins dismissed concerns that Kavanaugh would vote to gut Roe.",
        "“Protecting this right is important to me,” she said, before arguing that Kavanaugh’s stance on judicial precedent would protect Roe. She did not mention the judge’s public criticism of the landmark ruling nor his recent vote against an undocumented teenager who was seeking an abortion.",
        "She also pointed to opposition from women’s rights groups on other Supreme Court justices who were nominated by Republican presidents but ended up later voting to enshrine reproductive rights.",
        "“Suffice it to say, prominent advocacy organizations have been wrong,” she said.",
        "Opponents also seized on an email Kavanaugh wrote in 2003 as an official in President George W. Bush’s administration in which he seemed to question whether Roe was “settled law.” The email appeared to contradict assurances Collins said Kavanaugh gave her in a meeting in August that he accepted the settled law notion about Roe.",
        "“He often describes Roe as precedent upon precedent,” Collins said earlier this month, referring to Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing testimony. She further repeatedly expressed confidence he would not vote to overturn the landmark decision.",
        "Along with not being swayed by the concerns over Kavanaugh’s views on abortion rights, she apparently discounted claims from Democrats that he could be expected to rule in favor of overturning the Affordable Care Act and against upholding its insurance protections for people with preexisting medical conditions.",
        "Collins was one of three Senate Republicans who helped defeat the GOP effort to repeal Obamacare in 2017, and progressives hoped she would step up in its defense once more.",
        "She also didn’t share objections raised by Democrats about the secretive, unprecedented process Republicans used to vet Kavanaugh’s record.",
        "During his 2003-2006 tenure at the White House working for Bush, he controlled the flow of papers to the Oval Office as staff secretary. During that pivotal time after the Sept. 11 terror attacks, the Bush administration dealt with controversial issues like detainee treatment and the Iraq War. Democrats wanted to know whether Kavanaugh expressed his opinions in any documents or emails on such controversial matters as the torture of detainees.",
        "“I don’t see a need for those,” Collins told HuffPost in July, referring to Kavanaugh’s staff secretary records.",
        "Collins not only voted for Trump’s previous Supreme court pick, conservative Neil Gorsuch, but for all of the president’s scores of nominees to lower federal courts. That includes one who compared Roe v. Wade to the infamous 1857 Dred Scott decision that ruled slaves could not be U.S. citizens.",
        "Collins, 65, is up for re-election in 2020 and some progressives are eyeing a concentrated effort to defeat her as a way to hold her accountable for her record on judicial appointees. But Collins, first elected to her seat in 1996, has worked hard to sustain her popularity among Maine’s voters.",

        "STOCKHOLM (AP) — Three researchers who “harnessed the power of evolution” to produce enzymes and antibodies that have led to new drugs and biofuels have been named winners of the Nobel Prize in chemistry.",
        "Half of the 9-million-kronor ($1.01 million) prize goes to Frances Arnold of the California Institute of Technology. The other half is shared by George Smith of the University of Missouri and Gregory Winter of the MRC molecular biology lab in Cambridge, England.",
        "The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which chose the winners on Wednesday, said Arnold conducted the first directed evolution of enzymes, whose uses include “more environmentally friendly manufacturing of chemical substances such as pharmaceuticals and the production of renewable fuels.”",
        "Smith developed a method to evolve new proteins and Winter used the method to evolve antibodies, which are disease-fighting proteins in the blood.",
        "The first pharmaceutical based on Winter’s work was approved for use in 2002 and is employed to treat rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and inflammatory bowel diseases, the academy said.",
        "Reached by The Associated Press Wednesday, Smith credited others for the work that led to his breakthrough.",
        "“Very few research breakthroughs are novel. Virtually all of them build on what went on before. It’s happenstance. That was certainly the case with my work,” he said. “Mine was an idea in a line of research that built very naturally on the lines of research that went before.”",
        "Smith said he learned of the prize in a pre-dawn phone call from Stockholm. “It’s a standard joke that someone with a Swedish accent calls and says you won! But there was so much static on the line, I knew it wasn’t any of my friends,” he said.",

        "A prominent evangelical university in California has reinstated an outright ban on queer relationships after it briefly gave LGBTQ students hope they could date and fall in love on campus as freely as their straight classmates.",
        "Azusa Pacific University, one of the oldest Christian universities on the West Coast, claims its board of trustees never approved an administrative decision last month to lift a ban on romantic same-sex relationships in the school’s standards of conduct agreement.",
        "As a result, the board of trustees sent out a statement on Friday that reaffirmed its “biblical and orthodox ” view of marriage.",
        "About 200 LGBTQ students, allies and faculty gathered at the school on Monday to denounce the school’s quick reversal, according to the San Gabriel Valley Tribune.",
        "Alexis Diaz, a senior who identifies as queer, told HuffPost that seeing the ban on queer relationships lifted, only to be reinstated, makes her feel even more deeply rejected by her school. The prospect of openly being in same-sex relationships gave LGBTQ people a “taste of freedom, a taste of what it feels like to be affirmed and humanized,” she said.",
        "When the school reversed the policy, Diaz said, she was “really, really upset.”",
        "“It just shows we’re not a priority. It shows that we’re just a flimsy thing to just throw around.”",
        "Below, Azusa Pacific University students demonstrate for LGBTQ rights.",
        "Erin Green, a recent APU graduate, said the university has “completely violated” LGBTQ students’ trust and “exploited” their stories. Green, the co-executive director of the queer Christian advocacy group Brave Commons, said she had participated in a yearlong discussion between LGBTQ students and administrators before APU finally lifted the ban.",
        "“We poured our hearts out, were vulnerable and relived our trauma telling our stories, telling stories of previous students who were damaged or hurt in some way by the institution ... for being gay or being in a same-sex relationship,” Green told the San Gabriel Valley Tribune.",
        "“They looked us in the eye and said this policy is harmful, it’s discriminatory, it’s stigmatizing and we’re going to get rid of it,” she added. “And we trusted them.”",
        "For years, LGBTQ students at APU have participated in a private, unofficial support group called Haven. With help from Brave Commons, Haven members started a dialogue with school administrators last year about APU’s ban on queer relationships.",
        "The university eventually agreed to change the student standards of conduct agreement in time for the fall 2018 semester, student newspaper ZU News reported in September. The school’s updated statement on sexuality still claimed that only heterosexual marriages are approved by God and that sex should only happen in those marriages. But the standards of conduct agreement notably removed language that prohibited LGBTQ students from being in public, romantic same-sex relationships.",
        "“A change in policy does not change practice,” the university stated at the time. “We assessed our student code of conduct and made adjustments, much like other Christian schools have.”",
        "ZU News also reported in September that APU’s Office of Student Life was working with students to create a formal, school-sanctioned version of Haven.",
        "As news spread about the changes at APU, the university started receiving backlash from conservative sites and pundits. Albert Mohler, president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, called the change a “complete reversal and repudiation” of the Christian understanding of romance. Conservative commentator Rod Dreher claimed the university had “surrendered” its core conservative values.",
        "Rev. Kevin Mannoia, APU’s graduate and faculty chaplain, told HuffPost last week that media outlets had misconstrued the school’s intentions and that APU hadn’t departed from its conservative values.",
        "Mannoia said APU has “never punished people or students” for behavior that falls outside its code of conduct. When administrators hear about behavior that doesn’t align with the school’s moral code, Mannoia said, students are invited to have conversations with counselors who explain the school’s position. He admitted that some students may have felt pressure from school administrators during these conversations.",
        "APU’s current student standards of conduct policy states that “Students may not engage in a romanticized same-sex relationship.” Students who violate the standards of conduct are subjected to a disciplinary process that could, after investigations and appeals, result in sanctions as serious as loss of campus employment, student housing privileges, suspension or expulsion, according to APU’s website.",
        "Diaz told HuffPost she doesn’t personally know any student who has been called in for counseling over being in a queer relationship. But she says they’ve heard stories about LGBTQ students being disciplined over the issue ― and as a result, many queer students are fearful about coming out or exploring that part of their identities.",
        "It’s a fear that straight students on campus don’t have to worry about, she said.",
        "“Students fear being who they are and fear being in a relationship with someone,” Diaz said. “And that’s not equitable.”",
        "HuffPost spoke to Mannoia before Friday, when the board of trustees reinstated the ban on queer relationships. But even then, he had indicated that administrators wouldn’t treat queer relationships equally.",
        "“A guy and a girl walking across campus holding hands, we understand that. It is leading toward the environment we think is appropriate, given our understanding of Christian marriage,” Mannoia told HuffPost. “A guy and a guy walking across campus, that may become an issue, and one of our student life folks, if it comes to their attention, would probably invite a conversation.”",
        "“Are they going to be kicked out? No, that would be inconsistent with the kind of place we want to be,” he said.",
        "APU did not immediately respond to HuffPost about whether it still plans to create a safe space for LGBTQ students on campus.",
        "The way APU handled the issue was “extremely unprofessional,” Diaz said.",
        "“If they didn’t approve it in the first place, where was the miscommunication in the middle? That’s really frustrating,” she said. “You can’t say one thing and go back on your word. You lose the trust of students.”",
        "Albert Tate, a member of APU’s board of trustees, told the San Gabriel Valley Tribune that the university does not want to force LGBTQ students back underground. He said the university is working to craft a new policy that doesn’t make them feel persecuted.",
        "“When we took out the language, everyone else filled that gap with their own language and interpretations, and it was hurtful to LGBTQ students, our faculty, our constituencies outside,” Tate said. “We reinstated that language with the intention to strategically partner with our LGBTQ students to find the best language possible to capture our heart and intent.”",
        "“For anybody on our campus to feel persecuted in any way, shape, form or fashion obviously is not what we want,” Tate added.",
        "But Green said queer students’ trust in the school has been deeply damaged.",
        "“They said we could put our trust in them, and we did that,” Green said. “And this is how they treat us, an already marginalized community — push us back down into the fringes.”"

Formally known as 2015 TG387, the nickname came from the “TG” part of the designation along with the fact that it was first seen around Halloween of 2015, according to the Carnegie Institution for Science.",
        "The organization also released an artist’s conception of The Goblin:",
        "The dwarf planet is currently about two-and-a-half times farther from the sun than Pluto is right now, but it’s in an elliptical orbit so extreme that it will eventually be some 67 times the distance from the sun as Pluto and into the Inner Oort cloud.",
        "With a diameter of just 186 miles, The Goblin is also on the small side, even for a dwarf planet.",
        "“We think there could be thousands of small bodies like 2015 TG387 out on the solar system’s fringes, but their distance makes finding them very difficult,” the University of Hawaii’s David Tholen said in a news release. “Currently we would only detect 2015 TG387 when it is near its closest approach to the sun. For some 99 percent of its 40,000-year orbit, it would be too faint to see.”",
        "Scientists said The Goblin’s orbit ― and the orbits of similar objects at the far reaches of the solar system ― suggest they are being shepherded by the gravity of Planet X. That’s a theorized, but as yet unseen, planet several times the size of Earth somewhere on the edge of the solar system."

        "Despite a decline in border crossings over the past few years, the Trump administration is holding more undocumented children (a record 13,000, five times more than last year) for longer periods (an average of 59 days, up from the 35-day average in the final year of the Obama administration).",

In early August, officials told Cruz that she’d have to wait a month to get fingerprinted. She managed to get it done sooner, on Aug. 21, by going to the fingerprinting office to ask in person, and her partner provided his fingerprints soon after.",
        "But six weeks later, she still hasn’t heard anything about her daughter. So on Monday, Cruz sued the Department of Health and Human Services and its Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) in federal court.",
        "Cruz, who was granted asylum last year, is due to give birth to a son in a few weeks. She feels added urgency to reunite with her daughter before then, according to court documents filed by the New York Civil Liberties Union. Her daughter, who fled Honduras because she feared for her safety, is now in a New York facility where she told her mother she has been hit and groped by other children, the lawsuit says. She often cries and begs to go home.",
        "“I would go to the moon and back to get my daughter out of detention, because I am her mother and I love her and I know she is suffering,” Cruz said in a declaration filed in court. “I want to bring her home with me to give her stability and show her that not everything is bad, not everyone in the world wants to hurt her.”",

        "HHS does not comment on pending litigation, a spokesperson said.",
        "Previously, fingerprinting was not being required of most parents because it deterred relatives of detained children from coming forward and was deemed unnecessary given other vetting measures, according to Mark Greenberg, an HHS official in the Obama administration who is now a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute. The government also added a requirement that fingerprints be taken of all adults who lived in the same household as the sponsor.",
        "The heightened scrutiny that ORR is applying to potential sponsors is part of the agency’s broader alignment with immigration enforcement efforts under the Trump administration. In one of the most sweeping changes, ORR signed an information-sharing agreement with Immigration and Customs Enforcement in May. ICE has already arrested 41 people as a result of that agreement and immigrant rights advocates say that many undocumented family members who sponsor unaccompanied minors are now afraid to come forward.",
        "The government’s intensive sponsor vetting process has created a serious backlog that means children are stuck in detention for longer than is necessary. And for mothers such as Cruz, it means months of worried separation.",
        "“She feels like she went from one trauma to another, and she does not understand why this is happening to her,” Cruz said of her daughter in her declaration. “She always tells me she doesn’t know what crime she committed to deserve this or why she is a ‘prisoner.’”",

        "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump engaged in tax schemes that included cases of fraud in which he and his siblings helped their parents dodge millions in taxes, the New York Times reported on Tuesday.",
        "The Times investigation, which the White House said was “misleading,” showed Trump received the equivalent today of at least $413 million from his father’s real estate business.",
        "The Times, citing a “vast trove” of confidential tax return and financial records, reported that much of that fortune came to Trump because he helped his parents evade taxes, setting up a fake corporation with his siblings to disguise millions of dollars in gifts from their parents.",
        "During his presidential campaign, Trump promoted himself as a self-made real estate mogul who started out with only a “very small” loan from his businessman father, Fred Trump.",
        "Reuters has not been able to verify the report.",
        "In a statement, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders called the story “misleading” and said that “many decades ago the IRS reviewed and signed off on these transactions.”",
        "Trump lawyer Charles Harder told the Times: “President Trump had virtually no involvement whatsoever with these matters.”",
        "Harder added: “The affairs were handled by other Trump family members who were not experts themselves and therefore relied entirely upon the aforementioned licensed professionals to ensure full compliance with the law.”",
        "James Gazzale, a spokesman for the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance, said the department “is reviewing the allegations in the New York Times article and is vigorously pursuing all appropriate avenues of investigation.”",
        "The U.S. Internal Revenue Service did not immediately reply to a request for comment.",
        "Citing tax experts, the Times reported it was unlikely Trump would face criminal prosecution because the acts were past the statute of limitations. There is no time limit, however, on civil fines for tax fraud, according to the paper.",
        "The Times reported that its findings were based on more than 200 tax returns from Fred Trump, his companies and various Trump partnerships and trusts. The records did not include Donald Trump’s personal tax returns. Unlike other White House candidates and presidents in recent decades, Trump has declined to release his tax returns.",
        "According to the newspaper, the report was also based on interviews with Fred Trump’s former employees and advisers and more than 100,000 pages of documents describing the inner workings of his business empire.",
        "“The investigation also draws on tens of thousands of pages of confidential records - bank statements, financial audits, accounting ledgers, cash disbursement reports, invoices and canceled checks,” according to the Times."

        "President Donald Trump’s deal to tweak the trade agreement among the United States, Mexico and Canada won early praise for changes meant to raise wages and improve safety regulations on cross-border trucking.",
        "But on Monday, environmental groups panned the accord to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement, arguing it includes “corporate giveaways” for fossil fuel giants, excludes binding agreements on lead pollution and contains no mention of human-caused global warming.",
        "Neither “climate” nor “warming” are among the words in the 31 pages of the new deal’s environment chapter.",
        "NAFTA was long criticized for encouraging companies to shift polluting operations to Mexico, the poorest country with the laxest environmental rules in the trilateral trade agreement. Particular complaints focused on the investor-state dispute settlement process, a system in which companies have been historically afforded broad corporate rights that override local environmental regulations.",
        "The new deal limits those rights, with one major exception: U.S. oil and gas companies. Under the rules, firms that have, or may at some point obtain, government contracts to drill or build infrastructure like pipelines and refineries in Mexico ― such as ExxonMobil Corp. ― can challenge new environmental safeguards Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador has vowed to erect.",
        "“It’s like saying, ‘From here on, we’re going to protect the henhouse by keeping all animals away, except for foxes, they’re cool,’” Ben Beachy, director of the Sierra Club’s living economy program, said in a phone interview.",
        "That’s not the only giveaway for the oil and gas industry. The updated deal, which requires congressional approval, preserves a provision that requires the U.S. government to automatically approve all gas exports to Mexico, despite another rule mandating regulators consider the public interest.",
        "“We urge Congress to approve” the revised deal, said Mike Sommers, chief of the American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry’s biggest lobby. “Retaining a trade agreement for North America will help ensure the U.S. energy revolution continues into the future.”",
        "The deal, rebranded the United States Mexico Canada Agreement, tosses aside a standard set of seven multilateral environmental agreements that undergirded the last four U.S. trade deals. USCMA includes enforcement language taken from just one of the environmental accords, weakens the language from another two and makes zero mention of the other four.",
        "“Trump’s trade agreement with Mexico and Canada is a corporate giveaway intended to sharply limit the powers of government to protect people and the planet,” said Doug Norlen, director of economic policy at the nonpartisan Friends of the Earth. “This agreement is an attack on our ability to hold Big Oil and Gas accountable for the damage they cause to our communities.”",
        "USCMA also includes a section on good regulatory practices that Beachy said “would be better named deregulation.”",
        "The rules essentially give corporations an extra opportunity to challenge proposed regulations before they’re finalized, and ask for existing regulations to be repealed.",
        "“We expect that, after Trump is out of office, we’re going to have to work hard to re-regulate,” he said. “Even after Trump leaves office, Trump’s NAFTA (revision) could extend his polluting legacy for years.”"

        "HALEDON, N.J. ― Every night at 11 p.m., after her sons have long gone to bed, Zarmina Noori drags a chair away from her kitchen table and into her youngest son’s bedroom. She places it next to the twin-sized bed where 14-year-old Ahmad sleeps hooked to the machine that helps him breathe. Then she sits down, holds her iPhone in one hand and a cup of black tea in the other, and waits for the phone to ring.",
        "Noori hasn’t gotten a full night’s sleep in years. Ahmad suffers from spina bifida, a neural birth defect that often results in damage to the spinal cord and nerves. He has hydrocephalus, or extra fluid in and around the brain, and neuromuscular dystrophy, the progressive loss of muscle mass. He can’t speak or see properly and requires 24-hour care. A home nurse takes care of Ahmad during the day, but for the past 10 years, Noori has been the one looking over the boy at night.",
        "Everything would be easier if Noori’s husband were there to help. But Mohammad Hamid Ayoubi can only call. He is stuck on the other side of the globe, waiting for the U.S. government to approve his application to join his wife. Each night, as they FaceTime, she tells him how much she needs him and asks him if his application has been approved yet. Each time, his answer is the same: no.",
        "Ayoubi worked as an interpreter for the U.S. military in Afghanistan, including in the volatile Kandahar province, but was forced to leave after militants threatened his life. He is seeking to come to the U.S. on a visa, but his application has been pending for two years.",
        "President Donald Trump’s administration has decimated the U.S. refugee resettlement program, shrinking the number of people admitted and adding vetting requirements that slow down the process. Noori and Ayoubi fear that even though Ayoubi aided the U.S. effort in Afghanistan, he won’t be allowed to join them in New Jersey, and they won’t ever learn why.",
        "“We are a family. We need to be together,” said Noori, who met Ayoubi when they were both refugees in Turkey. “I married to be together, not to be separate.”",
        "“He worked with American soldiers and for the American people. They know my husband. I don’t know why they won’t give him a visa,” she continued. “If Trump was not president, maybe my husband would be here right now. I think Trump is making my husband not come.”",
        "Fleeing Afghanistan",
        "Noori and Ayoubi did not know each other before they both arrived in Turkey from Afghanistan in 2013. Noori and her sons fled Kabul when increased suicide bombings terrorized the Afghan capital. “Boom everywhere. At the schools and at the hospitals and the mosques,” she said, describing the atmosphere. “Every day I am nervous, [thinking about] what time [my sons] are leaving and what time they are coming back. Every time this happens, I think, when can I leave Afghanistan?”",
        "Ayoubi, meanwhile, was working as an interpreter for the U.S. military in Afghanistan when he received a call from an unknown number ― someone who told him working with infidels was forbidden and that he had a week to quit his job, Ayoubi said. He thought it might be a joke, but received another call a week later saying he could be beheaded.",
        "When Ayoubi quit and went back to his hometown, the threats continued. His family worried Afghanistan wasn’t safe for him anymore and encouraged him to leave for Turkey in July 2013.",
        "Once in Turkey, Noori and her youngest son left the city of Isparta once a week at sunrise for a six-hour bus ride to the Turkish capital of Ankara, where the boy could receive medical treatment. Outside the local hospital during one of these trips, Ayoubi overheard Noori speaking Dari to her son. He told her he was also a refugee from Afghanistan. Within months, they were married.",
        "When Noori met Ayoubi, her family felt whole again. Her sons welcomed their new stepdad. Ayoubi cherished the boys as his own. The couple didn’t talk much about what came before and tried to focus on what was to come. “We started a new life to be happy and to enjoy,” Ayoubi told HuffPost from his home in Turkey. “We built a new life.”",
        "There was one problem. Noori had applied for refugee status for her and her sons, since it was hard to get Ahmad the right care in their town in western Turkey. By the time Noori and Ayoubi married, her resettlement application with the United Nations was much further along than Ayoubi’s. The resettlement agency warned that merging the applications could slow both of them down, and advised Noori to petition for her husband to join her after she entered the U.S.",
        "Noori and her sons were approved for resettlement to the U.S. in 2014. But the moment was bittersweet. Ayoubi’s application to be recognized as a refugee was still pending, and the family was forced to leave him behind. On a hot June day in 2015, Noori and her sons said goodbye to Ayoubi.",
        "“We were crying a lot,” Noori recalled. But Ayoubi soothed them and told his wife that it would only be a few months before he would join them.",
        "Caught In Bureaucratic Limbo",
        "Noori petitioned for Ayoubi to join her in the U.S. in 2016, under a visa for spouses and unmarried children of refugees. He went for an interview at the U.S. Embassy in February 2017, but since then, his case hasn’t progressed. As of late September 2018, his application is still under administrative processing.",
        "The U.S. government has not explained what’s causing the delay ― it usually doesn’t comment on individual cases ― but refugee resettlement has plummeted under Trump, who likened Syrian refugees to a Trojan horse and vowed to ban Muslims from the U.S. before taking office.",
        "It was never easy to come to the U.S. as a refugee, but the Trump administration plans to cap the number of refugees entering the country to 30,000 for the next fiscal year ― the lowest number in the history of the program. There are nearly 2.5 million refugees from Afghanistan who are, like Ayoubi, registered with the United Nations refugee agency.",
        "Increased vetting measures, many of them imposed as part of Trump’s travel ban orders, have slowed the refugee admissions process. The U.S. government reduced the number of officials who conduct refugee interviews and added new background check requirements for certain refugees.",
        "The number of refugees admitted this year to the U.S. from Afghanistan, where the U.S. has been at war since 2001, is likely to be about one-third of what it was in 2016.",
        "Ayoubi’s other efforts to join his family are also stalled. The U.S. has special visas available to Afghans and Iraqis who worked with the U.S. military during the wars. Ayoubi has tried to reach out to people he knew from the U.S. military to serve as references, but he hasn’t gotten any replies.",
        "Shoshanna Malett, an attorney with the Immigration and Refugee Program at Church World Service who is assisting the family in their reunification efforts, could only speculate as to what is causing the holdup in Ayoubi’s application. There are rumors that “administrative processing” is code for security screening and that there is a backlog, but she doesn’t know.",
        "It’s “maddening” to see a family separated, especially when a sick child is involved and the person left behind has worked with the U.S. military, she said.",
        "“You couldn’t paint more of a humanitarian picture,” Malett argued. “And I can’t get him out.”",
        "Starting Over Alone",
        "It’s been more than three years since Noori last saw her husband. Her eldest sons have made a lot of progress in America: Ali and Amir Rajabi are nearly fluent in English and are both enrolled in school full-time ― Ali at Passaic Community College and Amir in a local high school.",
        "But Noori has yet to catch up. She is uncomfortable speaking English and has no community supporting her. She’s navigating medical bills, rent, learning English and raising her three sons alone. This wasn’t the plan, she said. The plan was for Ayoubi to help lead their new life in America.",
        "“Here, there is no friends. No Afghan family. I’m not in contact with any families or people. I only have my sons and the nurse,” Noori said. “I can’t go outside because I don’t understand [English.] I can’t drive. I can’t pass tests because the driver test is in English and my English is no good. It’s really, really hard. If [Ayoubi] is here, everything would be fast.”",
        "It’s difficult to be unable to do anything for each other and only see each other’s faces on the phone, Ayoubi said. They’re running out of energy.",
        "All Noori can do is wait.",
        "“[I need him] to be here with me, to be together with me,” said Noori. “He jokes with me. We talk. We laugh. But right now, I have nothing.”"

        "Identity theft is a constant threat these days. With the number of major data breaches that have occurred in the past few years, such as the unprecedented Equifax breach in 2017, you’ve probably experienced some form of financial fraud by now.",
        "You might keep a close eye on your own finances for just that reason, but there’s someone else who is especially susceptible to becoming an identity theft victim: your kid.",
        "Fortunately, a new law went into effect on Sept. 21 that lets you freeze your credit ― a helpful preventative measure ― for free. Here’s how and why you should freeze your child’s credit, too.",
        "Child Identity Theft Is A Growing Problem",
        "A study by Javelin Strategy and Research found that more than 1 million children were victims of identity theft in 2017. Two-thirds of those victims were under the age of 8.",
        "If they’re lucky, parents might receive a notice addressed to their child from a collection agency or the IRS to tip them off. Usually, though, it’s not until child victims are much older that the fraud is discovered. By that time, extensive damage has already been done.",
        "“When you commit fraud on an adult, that adult is busy building their life ― buying a house, getting a car. Credit checks are more likely to occur and they’re more likely to discover the fraud,” said Jerry Linebaugh, founder of JLine Financial in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. “But in the case of a 2-year-old, they’re not going to check their credit for at least a dozen years. That’s a long time that [criminals] can go out there and not only use that fraudulent account, but sell the identity.”",
        "By the time that child actually needs to access credit, whether it’s to receive some sort of federal benefit, rent their first apartment or take out a student loan, their credit has been wrecked.",
        "Placing a freeze on your child’s credit file can prevent fraudsters who accessed their personal information from actually using it.",
        "What Is A Credit Freeze?",
        "When you freeze your credit, you restrict access to your credit reports. If anyone tries to apply for a credit card, take out a loan, rent an apartment, open a cell phone account or do anything else in your name that requires someone to pull your credit report, they’ll be unable to do so as long as the freeze in place. Then, when you do want to apply for credit, you have to “thaw” your credit file first.",
        "In the past, instituting a credit freeze was a tedious and somewhat pricey process. It required you to contact each credit bureau individually, place a freeze on your file with that particular bureau and pay around $10, depending on where you lived. If you didn’t freeze your credit with all three major bureaus ― Experian, Equifax and TransUnion ― your personal information was still susceptible to fraud. If you wanted to unfreeze it, you’d have to go through that same process again. Then to re-freeze ... well, you get it.",
        "However, once the Equifax data breach occurred, the process of freezing credit with the company went from a moderate inconvenience to total nightmare. Phone lines were jammed and the site kept crashing; people waited until the middle of the night to try and get through with still no success. In fact, following the breach, less than 1 percent of customers bothered to freeze their credit.",
        "Fortunately, things have calmed down since then. And if there’s any silver lining to the whole situation, it’s that Congress responded by creating the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, which now requires the credit bureaus to provide credit freezes for free. And they have to do it fast: Freezes are to be implemented by the next business day, and unfreezing (also free) should take no more than an hour. Parents can freeze the credit file of any minor under the age of 16; those age 16 and older are treated as adults and can freeze their own credit.",
        "Credit Freeze vs. Credit Lock",
        "Linebaugh noted that there’s an important distinction to make when it comes to credit freezes and similar-sounding credit “locks.”",
        "Equifax began offering credit locks for free following the company’s data breach. It’s a service similar to that already offered by TransUnion (also free) and Experian (available as part of a credit monitoring bundle, the cheapest of which costs $9.99 a month).",
        "A credit lock is similar to a credit freeze in many ways, but there are two key differences.",
        "First, it’s much easier to unlock a credit report than it is to unfreeze it. Secondly, it absolves the credit bureau from any legal responsibility should the lock fail. That’s because federal law governs credit freezes, but not credit locks. So if there’s a problem ― the freeze wasn’t placed as requested, or your information is leaked ― you might have legal recourse. A credit lock, on the other hand, is a proprietary product and service agreements state there’s no guarantee the tool is foolproof.",
        "Now that credit freezes are free, there’s little incentive to choose a credit lock to protect your information",
        "How To Freeze A Child’s Credit",
        "The Javelin Study found that data breaches are even more of a risk for minors than they are for adults. Last year, at least one minor in 11 percent of households had their data compromised as a result of a breach. Among those who were notified their information was breached, 39 percent became victims of fraud, compared to 19 percent of adults who were notified.",
        "However, if there’s a credit freeze in place, fraudsters will be blocked from opening any new accounts in a child’s name. But before you can freeze your child’s credit, the first step is to find out if he or she has a credit file in the first place.",
        "The credit bureaus don’t keep data on minors under the age of 14. After all, your toddler probably hasn’t taken out any loans. “There shouldn’t even be a credit file there,” said Linebaugh. “If there is, it’s usually fraudulent.” The only exception is if you added your child as an authorized user on a credit card or put any other credit in their name.",
        "If there isn’t any credit file for your child, you’ll have to create one so that you can freeze it. To find out if your child has any credit information on file with the bureaus, you’ll need to contact each credit bureau individually and follow their process (minors 14 years old and up can visit annualcreditreport.com to request their own credit reports).",
        "Experian: Start by filling out this form and mailing it, along with an extensive list of documents, to the address listed on the form. Alternatively, you can fill out the form and upload all the documentation via Experian’s online platform. Once you’re ready to freeze your child’s credit, you can do so online.",
        "Equifax: Contact Equifax’s minor child department in writing (details here) to find out if your child has a credit file. To place or lift a credit freeze, fill out the minor freeze request form and mail it to Equifax along with required identification.",
        "TransUnion: Start by filling out a child identity theft inquiry form. TransUnion will let you know if it finds a credit file, and if so, will launch an investigation into the matter. To place a freeze on your child’s credit, submit a request online.",
        "If it turns out your child does have an existing credit report on file with any of the bureaus, you should also take the following steps in addition to placing a credit freeze:",
        "Contact each credit bureau and place a fraud alert on your child’s files.\nFile a police report.\nFile a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\nSubmit a fraud report to the Federal Trade Commission.",
        "Remember, a credit freeze can prevent criminals from opening new accounts in your child’s name, but it can’t undo existing damage. If your child’s sensitive personal information, such as their birthdate and Social Security number, already fell into the wrong hands, there might be years’ worth of cleanup to do. But considering how easy (and free!) it is to freeze your child’s credit, there’s no reason to skip this step. It only saves you a potential headache."

        "The new law exempts law enforcement, members of the military and people with hunting licenses from the restriction.",
        "It was one of dozens of bills Brown took action on.",
        "Democratic Sen. Anthony Portantino pointed to the shooting at a Florida high school earlier this year that killed 17 people as the reason for his bill banning gun sales and transfers to people under 21.",

        "The American Civil Liberties Union, which typically does not endorse candidates for political or judicial office as a matter of policy, announced Saturday its opposition to Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court.",
        "The organization’s national board of directors passed a resolution opposing Kavanaugh, citing “credible allegations” that the nominee “engaged in serious misconduct” against Christine Blasey Ford and others.",
        "“The standard for such an appointment should be high, and the burden is on the nominee,” the board’s resolution stated. “That burden is not met as long as there are unresolved questions regarding the credible allegations of sexual assault.”",
        "ACLU President Susan Herman clarified that the organization is nonpartisan and does not oppose Kavanaugh based on how he might vote on the Supreme Court.",
        "“We oppose him in light of the credible allegations of sexual assault against him,” Herman reiterated.",
        "Blasey testified Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh locked her in a room and sexually assaulted her in 1982. The judge responded to the accusation directly afterward with an angry, emotionally charged statement that said Senate Democrats “destroyed” his reputation and his family.",
        "Blasey’s testimony, Kavanaugh’s response, subsequent allegations by other women and the “inadequate” investigation into the nominee’s past behavior all led the board of directors to doubt Kavanaugh’s fitness to serve on the nation’s highest court, the board said.",
        "While the ACLU frequently comments on politics, it said Saturday’s announcement marks only the fourth time in its 98-year history that its board has voted to oppose a Supreme Court nominee. It did not endorse or oppose then-nominee Neil Gorsuch in 2017. Upon Kavanaugh’s nomination in July, the ACLU released a statement warning that the judge could help President Donald Trump “undermine civil liberties and civil rights.”",

        "Americans are modestly less likely to believe Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony than they are to believe his accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, a new YouGov survey finds.",
        "But Thursday’s Senate hearings, during which Blasey alleged Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her in high school and Kavanaugh denied the accusation, did little to shift overall opinions about the judge’s nomination, the survey ― among the first published in the wake of the testimony ― suggests.",
        "“We found a country deeply divided in their reactions to the hearings.” YouGov’s Douglas Rivers and Joe Williams wrote Saturday. “The largest group believed Ford was telling the truth and Kavanaugh was not. A smaller, but still substantial group, believed the opposite. Hardly anyone believed both were telling the truth. Where you came out depended mostly on where you came in.”",
        "Americans said, 41 to 30 percent, that they believed Ford was telling the truth; they were split, 35 percent to 38 percent on whether Kavanaugh was similarly honest. (Those who reported having personally watched at least some of the hearings ― a majority of the country ― said, 52 to 36, that they believed Blasey. They were split 44 to 46 on whether they believed Kavanaugh.)",
        "Results were deeply divided along partisan lines: Seventy-three percent of Democrats, and just 14 percent of Republicans, believed Blasey was telling the truth; 74 percent of Republicans, and just 11 percent of Democrats, believed Kavanaugh. Even controlling for partisanship, there were some modest differences between men and women’s reactions ― 69 percent of Republican men said they felt Blasey was not telling the truth, compared to 59 percent of Republican women who said the same.",
        "Because YouGov’s surveys are conducted using an online panel, the pollsters were able to compare respondents’ latest opinions against what they’d actually said prior to the hearings. More than 1,000 of those surveyed in the most recent poll were also interviewed for an earlier Economist poll taken after the allegations broke. Of those, 80 percent hadn’t changed their minds on whether or not Kavanaugh should be confirmed. The rest hadn’t shifted one particular way, either ― 15 percent of those who’d supported him said they were now opposed or undecided, but 16 percent of those who’d opposed him said they were now unsure or supportive. The formerly undecided who came off the fence also split about evenly, according to YouGov, leading to “almost no net movement in one direction or the other.”",
        "The survey’s results offer an initial sense of public reaction in the immediate aftermath of the hearings. Sentiments could easily change in the week to come, as the FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh unfolds, and news coverage of the story continues.",
        "It also remains to be seen what other surveys will show. Prior to the hearings, for instance, initial HuffPost/YouGov polling showed Kavanaugh’s ratings to be relatively stable in comparison to the drop measured by several other polls. And although polling by several outlets last week consistently found opposition to Kavanaugh’s nomination outstripping support, the exact size of that gap varied.",
        "But the results suggest that so far, Kavanaugh’s opponents may be especially mobilized by the issue. Sixty-five percent of voters who don’t want him confirmed, the survey finds, say the Supreme Court will be very important to deciding their vote in this year’s midterms, compared to 50 percent of those who support his confirmation ― a gap that’s especially notable because, in the past, Republicans have often been substantially likelier than Democrats to prioritize Supreme Court appointments.",
        "The YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Sept. 27-28 among U.S. adults using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.",
        "Most surveys report a margin of error that represents some, but not all, potential survey errors. YouGov’s reports include a model-based margin of error, which rests on a specific set of statistical assumptions about the selected sample rather than the standard methodology for random probability sampling. If these assumptions are wrong, the model-based margin of error may also be inaccurate. Click here for a more detailed explanation of the model-based margin of error."

        "Now the editors are denouncing Republicans for not investigating the research psychologist’s claim that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers and are calling for his nomination to be withdrawn.",
        "“If Dr. Blasey’s allegation is true, the assault and Judge Kavanaugh’s denial of it mean that he should not be seated on the U.S. Supreme Court,” the magazine’s editors wrote on Thursday.",
        "“But even if the credibility of the allegation has not been established beyond a reasonable doubt and even if further investigation is warranted to determine its validity or clear Judge Kavanaugh’s name, we recognize that this nomination is no longer in the best interests of the country,” they added.",

        "They described him as a constitutional “textualist who is suspicious of the kind of judicial innovation” that led to the ruling. The editors mused that his nomination would allow Catholics to transform the public’s views on abortion, making it “an even less appealing choice.” Kavanaugh, a Catholic, was attending a Jesuit-run private school at the time of the alleged assault.",
        "But Blasey’s testimony on Thursday apparently outweighed the magazine’s fight against abortion.",
        "Blasey’s testimony “clearly demonstrated both the seriousness of her allegation of assault by Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh and the stakes of this question for the whole country,” the editors wrote.",
        "The magazine said that Kavanaugh’s hearing was now more than a battle of policy issues: “The hearings and the committee’s deliberations are now also a bellwether of the way the country treats women when their reports of harassment, assault and abuse threaten to derail the careers of powerful men.”",
        "The magazine also warned Republicans on the committee against voting for Kavanaugh without investigating all of the women’s claims.",
        "“If Senate Republicans proceed with his nomination, they will be prioritizing policy aims over a woman’s report of an assault,” they wrote.",
        "“Even if one thinks that Dr. Blasey’s allegations are not credible, demonstrating them not to be would require further investigations and testimony,” the editors added.",

        "WASHINGTON ― Even if you had spent the day on Capitol Hill, you could have missed it: Congress sent an $854 billion bill to the president Wednesday that would fund the government ― some agencies for the entire fiscal year and some until Dec. 7 ― while not providing any money for President Donald Trump’s border wall.",
        "The House passed the bill 361-61, with 176 Republicans and 185 Democrats voting yes, and 56 Republicans and 5 Democrats voting no. (The Senate passed the bill last week, 93-7.)",
        "While the bill would provide $674.4 billion for defense, $12.1 billion for government labor programs and $90.5 billion for health programs until October of next year, the bill would fund other government programs until just Dec. 7, meaning lawmakers will need to return after the midterm elections to work out a number of contentious issues.",
        "Trump and most congressional Republicans still hold out hope that they can persuade Democrats to fund a border wall ― or else enter into a partial government shutdown ― come December. But Trump’s earlier vows to shut down the government over Democratic objections to the wall are once again ringing hollow",
        "The president is expected to sign the bill and allow lawmakers to get out of town and back on the campaign trail without a messy shutdown fight. But Trump could always pull a Trump, going back on his promise to GOP leaders that he would sign the bill and instead siding with his other previous promises. The president and his conservative allies, however, seem resigned to the temporary, tactical withdrawal.",
        "Trump and Republicans might be more willing to fight for the wall in December after the midterms, particularly if they lose their majority in the House. A fight in December could be their last chance.",
        "But such a gambit is still unlikely to work. For one, Trump and Republicans have continually caved on funding the government without money for the border wall. Also, by funding parts of the government for a full fiscal year, the worst effects of a shutdown will already have been tempered. In addition to the full year of funding for defense, labor and health programs in this bill, the president already signed a full-year package of three appropriations bills into law: military construction and veterans affairs, energy, and the legislative branch.",
        "Finally, if Democrats do take the majority in the House, they could simply wait out Trump and a shutdown until Congress changes hands in January, at which point the House could easily put forward a spending bill without the wall money and force Senate Republicans or Trump to continue the partial shutdown.",
        "What’s more likely is that Trump and Republicans will once again relent in December ― or Democrats will trade a renewal of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals immigration program for portions of a border wall. That’s a trade almost all congressional Democrats have been willing to make throughout the entirety of Trump’s presidency.",
        "The bill Wednesday does mark the first time in 22 years that the Pentagon will be funded on time.",
        "Usually, it takes Congress a number of extensions past October’s fiscal year deadline to fund the massive Defense Department. That sort of “regular order” governing would normally be a point of pride for Republicans, proof that they can govern.",
        "But the unimpressive achievement of funding the government on time comes with some asterisks. Lawmakers passed none of these bills under what are known as “open rules,” which allow any member to offer any relevant amendment during floor debate, and they packaged bills together, requiring less time to pass them all.",
        "There’s also the matter of Trump’s less-than-consistent leadership on funding the government and his promises to have a fight in December over the border wall. Any bragging about the largest troop pay raise in nine years or funding the government on time have been almost entirely drowned out by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh’s ongoing saga and the cloud of uncertainty hanging over the future of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein."

        "NORRISTOWN, Pa. ― Judge Steven O’Neill ruled Bill Cosby a “sexually violent predator” during Tuesday’s sentencing hearing for the comedian.",
        "Cosby, 81, was convicted in April of three counts of aggravated indecent assault for drugging and sexually assaulting former Temple University women’s basketball coach Andrea Constand at his home in 2004. O’Neill’s ruling came amid a two-day sentencing hearing for the disgraced comedian.",
        "Prosecution “met the clear and convincing standard, therefore this defendant is designated a sexually violent predator,” O’Neill said in court on Tuesday morning.",
        "Prior to O’Neill’s decision, Cosby’s defense had fought against the designation, calling it a “modern-day scarlet letter.” They said Cosby shouldn’t be classified a sexually violent predator because of his old age and sight issues, claiming that because of those two factors the comedian will likely not repeat his sex offenses.",
        "Defense attorney Joseph Green argued that the use of the classification was “unconstitutional.” O’Neill denied the defense’s motion to dismiss early Monday morning.",
        "A sexually violent predator is defined as a person with “a mental abnormality or personality disorder that makes the person likely to engage in predatory sexually violent offenses,” according to Pennsylvania state law. The classification means Cosby will have to register as a sex offender for the rest of his life. Additionally, the sexually violent predator designation demands a more active notification on the sex offender registry list, including registering upon release, informing state police of changes of residence or employer, monthly therapy sessions and quarterly in-person interviews with state police.",
        "A large portion of the sentencing hearing on Monday and Tuesday was dedicated to debating the “sexually violent predator” classification, which the prosecution argued was fitting because Cosby exhibited predatory behavior and, as expert witness Dr. Kristen Dudley explained, it’s possible he could repeat his offenses in the future.",
        "Dudley, a psychologist and member of the Pennsylvania Sex Offenders Assessment Board who assessed Cosby on the sexually violent predator classification, gave prosecution’s first expert testimony on Monday. She told the courtroom that she “came to the conclusion that Mr. Cosby does in fact fit the criteria” of a sexually violent predator.",
        "“Using his power and prestige within the community, [Cosby] is able to meet people, befriend them, and it is during that friendship that the sexual assault occurs,” she said, adding she believes his offenses are “likely to reoccur.”\n\nWhen O’Neill made the ruling on Tuesday, Cosby had not yet been sentenced. O’Neill announced on Monday that the prosecution and defense agreed to merge the three felony counts into one, adding that the average total confinement for perpetrators of the same crime is anywhere between 22 to 36 months.",
        "Cosby had been under house arrest, on $1 million bail, following his conviction. He was tried on the same charges in 2017, but the trial ended in a hung jury and a mistrial. Cosby reportedly paid Constand $3.4 million in a civil lawsuit settlement in 2006.",

        "Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who was overseeing special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into whether President Donald Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 presidential election, is expecting to be fired Monday, according to several reports.",
        "As of Monday morning, when Rosenstein was en route to the White House, he was expecting to be fired, a source familiar with the situation told HuffPost. But the situation had shifted by midday, when Rosenstein was at the White House meeting. It wasn’t clear whether he would be fired, resign or stay on as deputy attorney general.",
        "White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Monday in a statement that Rosenstein and Trump would meet again Thursday, once Trump had returned from the United Nations.",
        "“At the request of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, he and President Trump had an extended conversation to discuss the recent news stories,” she said.",
        "Axios reported that he had already verbally resigned Monday, in anticipation of Trump firing him. Such a move would be surprising, because it would give the White House more power to replace Rosenstein with someone willing to do Trump’s bidding.",
        "Rosenstein’s potential departure follows a report by The New York Times on Friday that May 2017 ― just before he named Mueller as special counsel ― he’d suggested covertly recording the president in the White House and had discussed invoking the 25th Amendment to remove him from office. Rosenstein firmly denied the allegations, and a Justice Department official who was in the room at the time insisted Rosenstein’s comments about wiring Trump were said in jest.",
        "The Times report echoed an anonymous op-ed published by a senior Trump administration official in the Times earlier in September that described “early whispers within the cabinet of invoking the 25th Amendment” to “start a complex process for removing the president.”",
        "It’s unclear who would succeed Rosenstein. The No. 3 position, associate attorney general, has been vacant since February. Solicitor General Noel Francisco is next in line.",
        "The president had long mistrusted Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller to take over the Russia investigation after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey last year. Rosenstein began overseeing the probe after Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself in March 2017 following revelations about his contact with the Russian ambassador during the Trump campaign.",
        "Trump erupted in “uncontrollable anger” when Rosenstein appointed Mueller as special counsel, according to an account from journalist Bob Woodward.",
        "“This is all politically motivated. Rod Rosenstein doesn’t know what the hell he is doing. He’s a Democrat. He’s from Maryland,” Trump said, according to Woodward’s book Fear: Trump in the White House, published in September. (Rosenstein is actually a lifelong Republican.) The Wall Street Journal reported in August that the relationship between Rosenstein and Trump had improved in recent months.",
        "Along with FBI Director Christopher Wray and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, Rosenstein met with Trump at the White House in May to discuss the handling of the Russia investigation. The meeting followed a weekend of volatile tweets from the president suggesting that the FBI and the Justice Department may have surveilled his campaign at the request of the Obama administration.",
        "“I hereby demand, and will do so officially tomorrow, that the Department of Justice look into whether or not the FBI/DOJ infiltrated or surveilled the Trump Campaign for Political Purposes - and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the Obama Administration!” Trump tweeted on May 20.",
        "The Justice Department said later in a statement that it would review whether political motivation impacted the Russia investigation. Rosenstein also responded to Trump in a statement: “If anyone did infiltrate or surveil participants in a presidential campaign for inappropriate purposes, we need to know about it and take appropriate action.”",
        "Despite the reassurances, Republican lawmakers continued to question the legitimacy of the Russia investigation and accuse Rosenstein and the DOJ of working to undermine the Trump administration.",
        "A House Judiciary Committee hearing in June became heated when Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) accused Rosenstein of hiding information from Congress pertaining to the Hillary Clinton email investigation.",
        "“Whenever you have brought issues to my attention, I have taken appropriate steps to remedy them,” Rosenstein responded. “Your use of this to attack me personally is deeply wrong.”",
        "Sources close to Rosenstein told NBC News in April that the deputy attorney general was at peace with the possibility that he might lose his job.",
        "In private conversations, the sources said, Rosenstein had frequently repeated the phrase “Here I stand,” referencing a quote attributed to 16th-century Protestant reformer and theologian Martin Luther.",
        "Trump, who has repeatedly attacked Sessions, Rosenstein and the Justice Department, reportedly considered firing Rosenstein last summer and also attempted to fire Mueller around the same time, The New York Times reported.",
        "An FBI raid on the office and hotel room Michael Cohen, who at the time was Trump’s personal lawyer, on April 9 renewed the president’s frustration. Rosenstein’s role in the raid came to light the following day, when the Times reported that he had personally signed off on the action. Investigators retrieved documents related to topics including the payment Trump’s longtime lawyer and “fixer” made to former adult film star Stormy Daniels, reported the Times.",
        "The search warrant for the raid stemmed from a referral from Mueller’s team, but it was reportedly not related to the Russia investigation. Nonetheless, Trump used the opportunity to double down on his opposition to the probe.",
        "Trump called Mueller’s investigation a “witch hunt” and slammed Sessions for his decision to recuse himself from it.\n\n“The attorney general made a terrible mistake when he did this,” the president said. “He certainly should have let us know if he was going to recuse himself, and we would have put a different attorney general in.”\n\nSessions’ recusal from the Russia investigation had left Rosenstein ― who was harder for Trump to control ― in charge of the probe. In March, Rosenstein affirmed his confidence in Mueller and his investigation.",
        "“The special counsel is not an unguided missile,” he told USA Today. “I don’t believe there is any justification at this point for terminating the special counsel.”",
        "Of his own position, he mused that he “anticipated that this would be a lower-profile job.”",
        "The White House denies that it has done anything but cooperate with the investigation. But with Rosenstein out of the way, Trump could be one step closer to either removing Mueller or ensuring that the investigation plays out according to his wishes.",
        "“He could install someone who would limit Mueller in subtle ways that are defensible,” Renato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor, told The Washington Post. “Under the special counsel regulations, the attorney general ― or acting attorney general, in this case ― can ask Mueller for explanations of his actions and overrule them.”",
        "Rosenstein’s job seemed potentially compromised earlier this year after the House Intelligence Committee voted to release to members of Congress a classified memo that listed him as one of three Justice Department officials who had signed off on surveillance applications. The memo, which was released publicly on Feb. 2 and was widely considered to be underwhelming, accused the Justice Department and the FBI of abusing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to spy on a foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign before the 2016 election.",
        "Rosenstein reportedly approved a FISA application to extend surveillance of Carter Page, a former Moscow-based investment banker who worked on Trump’s campaign.",
        "Among the main contentions of the Intelligence Committee’s memo was that the FBI based that request on research financed by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. GOP members of Congress called it “absolutely shocking,” “sickening,” “jaw-dropping” and “worse than Watergate.”",
        "But FISA experts viewed the memo with extreme skepticism. And the FBI said in a public statement ahead of its release that there were “material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo’s accuracy.”\n\nDemocrats on the Intelligence Committee later released their own memo, which the Republican-led committee initially voted not to make public. In it, the Democrats offered a point-by-point rebuttal to the GOP document. Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) also sent a letter to Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), the committee chairman and author of the memo, accusing him of making “material changes” to his memo after the full committee voted along party lines to release it and before it was sent to Trump to either make it public or block it.\n\nIn responding to the Cohen raid, Trump also lashed out at Rosenstein for signing off on the FISA application. House Republicans filed articles of impeachment against Rosenstein in July, accusing him of “knowingly hiding material investigative information from Congress” and failing “to comply with congressional subpoenas.”\n\nSessions defended the deputy attorney general after the impeachment filing, saying, “My deputy Rod Rosenstein is highly capable. I have the highest confidence in him.”"

        "The fate of special counsel Robert Mueller’s Trump-Russia investigation could hinge on whether Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein can convince President Donald Trump that he didn’t float a plot to overthrow him — or that he was just joking when he did.",
        "Rosenstein is the key figure standing between Trump and an independent investigation that could reveal whether the president colluded with Russia to swing the 2016 election in his favor. Trump had long floated the idea of firing Mueller but has apparently been convinced by his aides that such a move would backfire. Instead, he has considered an only slightly subtler approach: firing Rosenstein, who oversees the Mueller probe, and replacing him with a political ally who would get rid of the special counsel. The only thing missing from this plan was a pretext for firing Rosenstein. Now Trump may have it.",
        "The New York Times reported Friday that Rosenstein last year suggested secretly recording conversations with Trump and invoking the 25th Amendment to remove the president from office on the grounds that he is unfit to serve. The Washington Post later also reported the story. Both articles rely heavily on people who weren’t in the room, many of whom disagree on the tone of Rosenstein’s remarks about recording Trump and whether he even mentioned the 25th Amendment.",
        "Rosenstein said in a statement Friday that the Times story is “factually incorrect” and that he saw no reason to invoke the 25th Amendment. He later told Politico: “I never pursued or authorized recording the President and any suggestion that I have ever advocated for the removal of the President is absolutely false.”",
        "One source who was in the room for a May 16, 2017, meeting said in a statement to HuffPost that Rosenstein was being sarcastic when he suggested law enforcement officials wear a wire while talking to Trump, echoing similar defenses of Rosenstein quoted in the Times and the Post.",
        "It is possible that Rosenstein’s words were taken out of context, a former Justice Department official who has worked with Rosenstein but wasn’t present during the meeting told HuffPost. Rosenstein has an affinity for “dad jokes,” the former official said, and sometimes cracks jokes to ease tension during stressful conversations. The meetings in question happened during a particularly stressful time: a week after Comey was fired and the day before Rosenstein named Mueller as special counsel.",
        "The former official doubted Rosenstein would bring up the 25th Amendment, if only because of how difficult it would be to carry out. “Anyone who has spent two minutes Googling the 25th Amendment knows that it’s a near impossible task, and Rod Rosenstein is not the kind of person to throw out harebrained schemes to people that he’s only recently been working with,” Rosenstein’s former colleague added.",
        "But other sources in the room briefed on the remarks were under the impression that Rosenstein was being serious and that spinning the comments as a joke is part of an effort to save Rosenstein’s job.",
        "Both articles cite memos written at the time by Andrew McCabe, then the acting FBI director, in which he noted Rosenstein discussing the 25th Amendment and wearing a wire. Michael Bromwich, McCabe’s lawyer, did not deny the description of the memos, but he said McCabe didn’t leak the documents. McCabe gave the memos to Mueller’s office more than a year ago, according to Bromwich, and a set of the memos remained at the FBI office until McCabe was fired in January.",
        "Despite efforts to downplay the seriousness of Rosenstein’s private comments, it is almost inevitable that Trump will view this as an opportunity to fire the deputy attorney general and replace him with a political loyalist.",
        "Trump appointed Rosenstein as deputy attorney general in April 2017. Rosenstein, a lifelong Republican, was an establishment choice to take over the critical No. 2 position running the day-to-day operations of the Justice Department. He and Attorney General Jeff Sessions barely knew one another, and Trump didn’t know Rosenstein at all.",
        "In one of Rosenstein’s first moves as deputy attorney general, he volunteered to write a memo criticizing then-FBI Director James Comey’s handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server after Trump told Rosenstein he wanted to fire Comey. Trump pointed to Rosenstein’s memo as the justification for firing Comey — even though he later admitted he fired the FBI director in an attempt to shut down the bureau’s investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.",
        "It never made much sense that Rosenstein wrote the Comey memo. Even if he was horrified by Comey’s handling of the Clinton investigation, even the most politically unsavvy of people could predict how Trump would use such a document. According to the Times, Rosenstein didn’t see it coming. He felt used and sounded “frantic, nervous, upset and emotionally dis-regulated,” the Times reported earlier this year. Trump blaming Rosenstein for Comey’s ouster was what prompted Rosenstein to discuss recording the president and the 25th Amendment, according to Friday’s article in the Times.",
        "Trump turned on Rosenstein after the deputy attorney general appointed a special counsel to oversee the Trump-Russia probe a little more than a week after Comey’s firing. Rosenstein appointed Mueller on May 17, 2017, the day after a meeting in which he reportedly discussed recording Trump.",
        "Since then, Trump has been desperate to get rid of Mueller, whose special counsel team has secured several guilty pleas from former Trump advisers and turned some of them into cooperating witnesses.",
        "Rosenstein has become an easy target for Trump and his allies, who have twisted his words before. In July, House Republicans threatened Rosenstein with impeachment and even accused him of threatening a staffer (though the actual story, unsurprisingly, wasn’t as nefarious as they’d claimed). Eventually Rosenstein appeared to tire of the attacks. In a May speech, he announced that the Justice Department “is not going to get extorted” — a remark that appeared to be aimed at House Republicans.",
        "Because the Times did not disclose whether its key sources are close to the White House, it’s unclear whether the story might stem from an effort to discredit Rosenstein — and, by extension, the entire Justice Department and the special counsel investigation. But, regardless of the context, Rosenstein’s private comments could finally provide Trump the excuse he’s been looking for to get rid of an investigation that has been gradually snaring some of his closest allies."

        "ISTANBUL (AP) — Every morning, Meripet wakes up to her nightmare: The Chinese government has turned four of her children into orphans, even though she and their father are alive.",
        "Meripet and her husband left the kids with their grandmother at home in China when they went to nurse Meripet’s sick father in Turkey. But after Chinese authorities started locking up thousands of their fellow ethnic Uighurs for alleged subversive crimes such as travel abroad, a visit became exile.",
        "Then, her mother-in-law was also taken prisoner, and Meripet learned from a friend that her 3- to 8-year-olds had been placed in a de facto orphanage in the Xinjiang region, under the care of the state that broke up her family.",
        "“It’s like my kids are in jail,” Meripet said, her voice cracking. “My four children are separated from me and living like orphans.”",
        "Meripet’s family is among tens of thousands swept up in President Xi Jinping’s campaign to subdue a sometimes restive region, including the internment of more than 1 million Uighurs and other Muslim minorities that has alarmed a United Nations panel and the U.S. government . Now there is evidence that the government is placing the children of detainees and exiles into dozens of orphanages across Xinjiang.",
        "The orphanages are the latest example of how China is systematically distancing young Muslims in Xinjiang from their families and culture, The Associated Press has found through interviews with 15 Muslims and a review of procurement documents. The government has been building thousands of so-called “bilingual” schools, where minority children are taught in Mandarin and penalized for speaking in their native tongues. Some of these are boarding schools, which Uighurs say can be mandatory for children and, in a Kazakh family’s case, start from the age of 5.",
        "China says the orphanages help disadvantaged children, and it denies the existence of internment camps for their parents. It prides itself on investing millions of yuan in education in Xinjiang to steer people out of poverty and away from terrorism. At a regular news briefing Thursday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the measures taken in Xinjiang were necessary for “stability, development, harmony” and to fight ethnic separatists.",
        "But Uighurs fear that these measures are essentially wiping out their ethnic identity, one child at a time. Experts say what China is doing echoes how white colonialists in the U.S., Canada and Australia treated indigenous children — policies that have left generations traumatized.",
        "“This is an ethnic group whose knowledge base is being erased,” said Darren Byler, a researcher of Uighur culture at University of Washington. “What we’re looking at is something like a settler colonial situation where an entire generation is lost.”",
        "For Meripet, the loss is agony; it is the absence of her children and the knowledge they are in state custody. A year and a half after leaving home, the 29-year-old mother looked at a photo of a brightly painted building surrounded by barbed wire where her children are believed to be held. She fell silent. And then she wept.",
        "“When I finally see them again, will they even recognize me?” she asked. “Will I recognize them?”",
        "“PROTECTION OF DISADVANTAGED CHILDREN”",
        "When Xi came to power in 2012, an early challenge to his rule was a surge in violent attacks that killed several hundred people and which Beijing pinned on Uighur separatists. Since then, Xi has overseen the most extensive effort in recent years to quell Xinjiang, appointing in 2016 the former Tibet party boss Chen Quanguo to lead the troubled region bordering Afghanistan.",
        "Chen rolled out unprecedented security measures such as internment camps that hold Muslims without trial and force them to renounce their faith and swear loyalty to the Communist Party. China has described religious extremism as an illness that needs to be cured through what it calls “transformation through education.” Former detainees say one can be thrown into a camp for praying regularly, reading the Quran, going abroad or even speaking to someone overseas.",
        "",
        "The camps are among the most troubling aspects of Xi’s campaign to assert the party’s dominance over all aspects of Chinese life, which has drawn comparisons with Mao Zedong. Authorities heeding Xi’s call to “Sinicize” religion across the country have shut underground churches , burned Bibles , replaced pictures of Jesus with ones of Xi, and toppled crescents from mosques. The party also has beefed up its ability to track the movements of its 1.4 billion people, with Xinjiang serving as an important testing ground.",
        "In Xinjiang, detention has left countless children without their parents. Most of these families in China cannot be reached by journalists. However, the AP interviewed 14 Uighur families living in Turkey and one Kazakh man in Almaty with a total of 56 children who remain in China.",
        "The families say that among these children, 14 are known to be in state-run orphanages and boarding schools. The whereabouts of the rest are unknown because most of their adult relatives in Xinjiang have been detained.",
        "Some interviewees, like Meripet, requested that they be identified only by their first names because they feared official retaliation against their relatives. Others insisted their full names be used despite the risks, saying they were desperate for their stories to be heard. They pleaded with reporters to track down their families in Xinjiang, and one interviewee pressed a piece of paper into a reporter’s hand with a Chinese address scribbled on it.",
        "The regional government appears to be moving quickly to build centers to house the children of these exiles and of detainees. An AP review of procurement notices in Xinjiang has found that since the start of last year, the government has budgeted more than $30 million (200 million Chinese yuan) to build or expand at least 45 orphanages, known variously as children’s “welfare centers” and “protection centers,” with enough beds to house about 5,000 children.",
        "In July and August alone, the government invited bids for the construction of at least nine centers for the “protection of disadvantaged children” in the Xinjiang city of Hotan and several counties in Kashgar, Aksu and Kizilsu prefectures, inhabited primarily by ethnic minorities. Most orphanages have a minimum of 100 beds mandated by the government, and some are much larger. One notice called for an orphanage in Moyu county with four four-story dormitories, coming to 22,776 square meters in size — nearly as big as four football fields.",
        "These numbers do not include kindergartens and other schools where some children of Uighur detainees are being housed. It’s impossible to tell how many children of detainees end up at these schools because they also serve other children.",
        "Shi Yuqing, a Kashgar civil affairs official, told the AP over the phone that “authorities provide aid and support to everyone in need, whether they’re the children of convicted criminals or people killed in traffic accidents.” But such services may not be welcome. A government report from Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture in June last year acknowledged that relatives were resistant to “handing over” their extended families’ kids to the orphanages because they “lack trust or confidence” in the centers.",
        "A friend told Meripet last November her four children were living in the Hotan City Kindness Kindergarten in southern Xinjiang. The friend said Meripet’s sister-in-law had visited her children and was permitted to take them home for one night only.",
        "The school looks like a house-sized castle, with a bright marigold facade, orange turrets and blue rooftops. Its entrance is blocked by an iron gate and a walled enclosure lined with barbed wire. “We Are Happy and Grateful to the Motherland,” say the red characters emblazoned on one fence.",
        "The principal, who gave only her last name, Ai, told AP reporters that the institution is “just a normal kindergarten.” But the authorities’ anxiety was clear: armed police officers surrounded the reporters’ car minutes after their arrival at the school and ordered them to delete any photos.",
        "Gu Li, a propaganda official for Hotan who also immediately appeared on site, said: “There are really young kids here — some of them may even be orphans whose parents have died.”",
        "A report published this February in the Xinjiang Daily, a party newspaper, called Hotan City Kindness Kindergarten a “free, full-time” kindergarten for children 6 and younger that provides accommodations and clothing to those whose “parents cannot care for them for a variety of reasons.”",
        "“Soon after many of the kids arrived at the school, they grew taller and got fatter, and quickly started using Mandarin to communicate,” the article said. Another state media report in January said $1.24 million (8,482,200 yuan) had been invested in the kindergarten.",
        "Satellite imagery shows that the kindergarten was constructed less than three years ago, just as an initiative was launched to strengthen “bilingual” education in Xinjiang. More than 4,300 bilingual kindergartens were built or renovated last year, according to the government. A report on the project in a state-run regional newspaper said such kindergartens teach children “civilized living habits.”",
        "“The children started educating their parents: your hands are too dirty, your clothes are too dirty, you haven’t brushed your teeth,” the report quoted Achilem Abduwayit, a deputy chief of the Hotan city education bureau, as saying.",
        "Life in an orphanage could have a lasting psychological and cultural impact on children, said James Leibold, an expert on Chinese ethnic policy at La Trobe University in Melbourne, Australia.",
        "“You grow up as a ward of the state,” he said. “They’re told to be patriotic citizens, told that the identity and religion of their parents was abnormal, if not radical, and thus needs to be eradicated.”",
        "Meripet has at least an inkling of where her children are. Her brother, a 37-year-old doctor named Aziz, has not heard any news of his three youngest children since his wife was taken to a re-education center in June 2017.",
        "Aziz fled to Turkey more than a year ago after he received a call from his local police station ordering him to report to authorities immediately. More than half his neighbors had already been taken away to re-education centers or prison, he said.",
        "Now the young doctor is often shaken awake by a nightmare in which his kids are huddling at the bottom of a cliff, their faces smudged with dirt, calling to him to hoist them up. Aziz walks for what feels like hours but cannot reach them. He awakens with their cries ringing in his ears.",
        "“If I could, I would choose not to have been born as a Uighur, to not have been born in Xinjiang,” Aziz said. “We are the most unfortunate ethnic group in the world.”",
        "“THEY WON’T BE LIKE US ANYMORE”",
        "The government says all 2.9 million students attending compulsory elementary and junior high school in Xinjiang will receive Mandarin instruction by this month, up from just 39 percent in 2016.",
        "Even preschoolers are steeped in the language. A former teacher at a “bilingual” kindergarten outside Kashgar said all lessons were given in Mandarin and the entirely Uighur student body was banned from speaking Uighur at school. A colleague who used Uighur to explain concepts to students was fired, according to the teacher, who lives in Turkey but asked for anonymity because she fears retribution against family in China.",
        "Like all schools in China, this one immersed children in patriotic education. Kindergarten textbooks were filled with songs like “Without the Communist Party, There Would Be No New China,” the teacher said.",
        "Dilnur, a 35-year-old business student in exile in Istanbul, said officials regularly visited her children’s kindergarten in Kashgar and asked the students if their parents read religious verses at home or participated in other faith-based activities. The questions effectively forced children to spy on their own families. A man was taken away by police after his grandson said in class that he had made a pilgrimage to Mecca, she said.",
        "Her seven-year-old daughter once complained that her throat was sore from chanting party slogans. “Mama, what does it mean to love the motherland?” she asked.",
        "Some bilingual schools are boarding schools, which are not uncommon in China. Xinjiang has long provided voluntary boarding school programs that are seen as coveted opportunities for the best minority students. But several Uighurs asserted that in many cases boarding school was now mandatory for minority children, even though Han Chinese children could choose to continue living at home.",
        "The Xinjiang government did not respond to repeated requests for comment. The government has said the tuition-free boarding schools relieve parents of education and living expenses and help raise Mandarin standards, which will make their children more employable.",
        "But Uighurs say they don’t want their culture erased.",
        "“If the kids are forced to speak Mandarin and live like Han Chinese every day, I’m afraid they won’t be like us anymore,” said Meriyem Yusup, whose extended family has four children sent to state-run orphanages in Xinjiang.",
        "Adil Dalelkhan, an ethnic Kazakh sock merchant in exile in Almaty, said that even though his then 5-year-old son could live with relatives, he was forced to stay at his preschool Mondays through Fridays instead. The father called the policy a “terrifying” step toward extinguishing Kazakh culture.",
        "A Uighur businessman in Istanbul, also named Adil, told a similar story. Adil’s son was 9 years old when the school system automatically transferred him to a boarding school. All children of a certain age in their Uighur district were obliged to attend boarding school, Adil said. His son was only permitted to come home on weekends and holidays.",
        "“There were iron bars like we saw in a zoo in Kashgar,” Adil recalled.",
        "Dilnur said her neighbors too were only allowed to visit their kids at boarding school on Wednesday nights, and even then they had to hand them candies through a fence.",
        "“The educational goals are secondary to the political goals,” said Timothy Grose, a professor at Indiana’s Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology who has done research on Xinjiang boarding schools. “They aim to dissolve loyalties to ethnic identity... toward a national identity.”",
        "A government notice posted in February in Kashgar states that children in the fourth grade and above with parents in detention must be sent to boarding school immediately — even if one parent is still at home. Students must be instilled with socialist values, the notice said, and be taught to “be grateful for education and love and repay the motherland,” and avoid the “75 types of behavior that show religious extremism.” Such behavior ranges from calling for ‘holy war’ to growing beards and quitting smoking and drinking for religious reasons, the government says.",
        "China insists it guarantees the freedom of religion, but Uighurs view the Chinese education system as a threat to it. In schools, children are taught to respect teachers more than their parents and may criticize their parents’ Islamic faith, according to Byler.",
        "“The students, children, might question them and say, you know, this is backward, this is extremist,” he said.",
        "The Kashgar notice also said schools being modified to house students should place no more than 24 beds in one room―an indication of the program’s size. In 2015, a sprawling new boarding school complex was completed on the outskirts of Kashgar, with the capacity to house 23,400 students and teachers, according to the state-run China Daily.",
        "Abdurehim Imin, a writer from Kashgar, said a friend told him his 14-year-old daughter was sent to a bilingual school in 2015 after his wife was arrested, ostensibly for receiving a gift of olive oil he sent her. When AP reporters visited what was likely his daughter’s school, Peyzawat County No. 4 High School, a local plainclothes officer who identified herself as Gu Li said it was a bilingual boarding school. She said that while Uighur students had to study Mandarin, there were also Han Chinese students studying Uighur.",
        "Yet the exterior of the school bore bright red lettering that said: “Please speak Mandarin upon entering the schoolyard.” Barbed wire around the campus extended for miles, with rows of tall apartment buildings marked as dormitories.",
        "A historian at the University of Sydney, David Brophy, said the move toward boarding schools brings to mind Aboriginal children in Australia who were forcibly separated from their families in the 1900s and placed into state-run institutions that discouraged indigenous identity.",
        "“Should China’s policies continue in this direction, we may be talking about a Chinese version of the Stolen Generation,” he said.",
        "‘AN ETERNAL TORTURE’",
        "Since coming to Istanbul by himself in 2014, 42-year-old Imin, the writer, has led a solitary existence in a dimly-lit apartment with bare walls and stacks of writings. For the first year, he avoided looking at photos of his children.",
        "“We are dying every day,” Imin said. “We cannot see our kids, we cannot see our parents. This is an eternal torture.”",
        "In December, he was sent a photo of his daughter wearing a traditional Chinese “qipao”. He deleted the picture because he could not bear to look at it, he said, and could not sleep for nearly a month.",
        "Imin also has four other children in Xinjiang. Last summer, a friend who had visited his home in Kashgar told Imin that two of his kids were killed in a traffic accident while his wife was in jail. He doesn’t know where the other two are.",
        "Feeling helpless, he wrote verse after verse in mourning:",
        "“I will go...to tear down your dark, endless night...",
        "I will go, to embrace again my hometown...",
        "I will go, bearing my sorrow to your tomb.”",
        "Elsewhere in Istanbul, Meripet’s house was quiet during Eid al-Adha, a Muslim holy festival heralded by large family reunions. In a room at the end of the hall, there rose the distant laughter of relatives’ children, children who were not hers.",
        "She flipped through the photographs which she keeps in her purse: Abdurahman, the oldest; Adile, her only daughter; and her two younger sons, Muhemmed and Abdulla. Meripet has a fifth child, a son named Abduweli who was born in Turkey. She calls him “my only light.”",
        "“Sometimes I wonder if I will go crazy from this pain,” she says. “I have only been able to keep living because I know there is hope — I know one day I will see my children again.”",

        "authors": "Jessica Schulberg",
        "date": "2018-09-23"
    },
    "articleContent": [
        "Andrew Janz decided it was time for Devin Nunes to go when he read about the congressman’s secret trip to the White House last year, when Nunes collected classified information he later claimed was evidence for the unfounded conspiracy theory that the Obama administration had spied on the Trump campaign during the election.",
        "Once a relatively unknown member of Congress, Nunes has become infamous in Washington for using his position as the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee to block the panel’s efforts to investigate collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian operatives during the election. In doing so, he has emerged as one of the president’s most loyal allies — and one of the Democrats’ key targets in the 2018 elections. Nunes’ notoriety in Washington has helped Janz raise nearly $3 million without taking corporate PAC money. When Nunes published a much-hyped memo he claimed would prove the Justice Department spied on the Trump campaign (it didn’t), Janz raised over $65,000 in one week.",
        "But Janz, who grew up in the area, knows that a lot of voters either haven’t followed the Russia scandal or don’t believe it. And bashing Nunes for his unwillingness to investigate the president is a weak general election strategy in a district President Donald Trump carried by over nine percentage points. So instead, Janz is focusing on an issue that unites voters from both parties in California’s 22nd Congressional District: getting water to the area’s farmers.",
        "Janz liked his job as a deputy district attorney and hadn’t ever considered running for office, he said in an interview. But he believed that someone needed to hold Nunes accountable, so he filed to run. Some of Janz’s friends tried to talk him out of entering the race. Nunes had been elected eight times in a row, one year running unopposed. They thought he was untouchable in the conservative central California farming district. But Janz sees the continued water shortages and contamination in his district as a vulnerability for the incumbent lawmaker.",
        "Janz is calling for a massive infrastructure investment from the federal government for water infrastructure — a “Marshall Plan for central California,” he said. He wants to use that money to recharge underground aquifers and to improve aboveground and underground water storage so farmers can reduce their reliance on over-pumped groundwater. He’s also calling for federal investment in cleaning up the contaminated water supply in outlying parts of the district where residents are forced to buy bottled water for drinking, cooking and bathing.",
        "It’s an issue that, in theory, should attract support from Trump and congressional Republicans, who have long promised to hold some kind of “infrastructure week.” Janz has already reached out to lawmakers from both parties and talked to Democratic California Sens. Kamala Harris and Dianne Feinstein’s team about working in the future on an infrastructure package.",
        "Nunes, who comes from a family of dairy farmers, has also portrayed himself as someone who understands the needs of farmers in his water-strapped district. But Janz is trying to convince voters that Nunes, despite describing himself as a farmer, is actually a longtime politician who abandoned his constituents in favor of appearing on Fox News talking about the so-called deep-state conspiracy against Trump.",
        "“We want to bring attention to the fact that he ain’t working for us. He’s doing his own thing,” Janz said. Nunes is “in a pretty good position to get a lot of things done for us, he has political capital,” Janz continued, pointing to his relationships with Trump, House Speaker Paul Ryan and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy. “He’s not spending it on the district, he’s spending it to protect the president.”",
        "Nunes, who did not respond to a request for comment, hasn’t ignored California’s water issues. But his solutions, according to water experts, aren’t exactly viable. According to the incumbent congressman, who is also a climate change denier, the key problem facing California farmers is “extreme environmentalists” who have tried to depopulate the land by depriving residents of water with “relentless determination.”",
        "Nunes claims that California has plenty of water, but that too much of it “is simply flushed into the ocean” — an inaccurate argument often echoed by Trump. He has said California’s water problems could easily be fixed by diverting water from the north and storing it in dams. He has also called for loosening environmental regulations that restrict water diversion from the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta to protect endangered fish.",
        "These arguments are “bogus,” said Matt Weiser, the managing editor at Water Deeply, a news site covering water issues in the West. If water were blocked from flowing into the ocean, farmers in the delta area would be faced with excessive salinity in the water, which would create “billions of dollars in water quality issues,” Weiser said. And rolling back wildlife protections would only worsen the problem, he said, as killing off fish in the delta would lead to toxic algae blooms in the water.",
        "In addition to water quality issues, there aren’t a lot of economically viable places to put dams anymore, Weiser continued. One of the water storage projects Nunes has championed, the Temperance Flat Dam, was denied funding earlier this year, after a commission determined the reservoir would not provide enough public benefit to justify the investment.",
        "A recent poll by Strategies 360 in California’s 22nd, showed Janz just six points behind Nunes — compared to 12 points in July. Most political pollsters are predicting a Nunes victory, but to some extent, Janz’s strategy has already proven effective. This year’s race marks the first time Nunes has faced a real fight to keep his seat.",
        "After 16 years of Nunes with little progress on water issues in the district, Janz says, he’s imploring voters: Why not try something new?"

        "SAN FRANCISCO ― About 500 people gathered for the inaugural She the People summit in San Francisco on Thursday, which organizers dubbed the “first-ever national women of color in politics summit.”",
        "The event comes in a year of unprecedented wins for women of color running for office — a fact not lost among the attendees, women of all ages from 36 states across the country.",
        "The group gathered to discuss the power of women of color to change American politics, particularly in the 2018 midterm elections.",
        "Prominent organizers Linda Sarsour and Dolores Huerta took to the stage, along with barrier-breaking candidates like Rashida Tlaib ― set to be one of the nation’s first Muslim congresswomen ― and Deb Haaland ― likely to be one of the first Native women in Congress.",
        "“Alexandria, Ilhan, Ayanna. I love these names!” Tlaib said as a roomful of women cheered, referring to congressional candidates ― and likely history makers ― Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York, Ilhan Omar in Minnesota and Ayanna Pressley in Massachusetts.",
        "“Yes, you’re going to have to learn how to say our names,” Tlaib said, to laughs and applause.",
        "With the primaries for the midterm elections now over, 2018 promises to be a historic year for representation in political office. More women won House and Senate primaries this year than ever before. Christine Hallquist in Vermont could be the nation’s first openly transgender governor. And a number of women of color candidates, if they prevail in November, are set to shake up the makeup of the country’s overwhelmingly white and male governors and members of Congress. Stacey Abrams in Georgia, for instance, could become the first black female governor in the U.S.",
        "Speakers at the summit emphasized the need for people to turn out to vote and back female candidates of color ― and for more women of color to run for office.",
        "“Look at this room. Isn’t it amazing? Amazing women leaders are what we need to push us forward,” Haaland said. She mentioned her background as a single mother who worked minimum wage jobs and used food stamps while raising her “beautiful queer daughter.” “We need more people [in office] who understand struggle and know what it means to be fierce in the face of difficulty.”",
        "Summit founder Aimee Allison started off the day by listing statistics on how women of color have consistently led as voters and organizers, adding that the time had come for them to be represented in elected office. Black women are among the demographic groups with the highest rates of turnout at the polls, she said. And while women of color make up 20 percent of the U.S. population, they account for only about 7 percent of members of Congress.",
        "“We can’t even get clean water for our children, because our lens is not at the table,” Tlaib said, recalling her encounters with Michigan families struggling amid the state’s notorious water crisis. “So you all better run for office.”",
        "Many speakers noted that their work as progressive women of color in politics led to not only beating Republicans but also unseating centrist establishment Democrats.",
        "“Not all Democrats are created equal,” as California Assemblywoman Wendy Carrillo put it. Several shouted out Ocasio-Cortez’s victory against a 10-term Democratic incumbent.",
        "“If 2018 is not the year the Democratic establishment learns its lesson, it’s the year voters teach it to them,” declared Andrea Mercado, the director of the Florida New Majority, which is working to increase turnout among marginalized groups. In the state’s primaries last month, progressive Andrew Gillum pulled off an upset win, becoming Florida’s first black gubernatorial nominee.",
        "Toward the end of the summit’s morning session, legendary workers’ rights organizer Dolores Huerta took the stage and led a chant that had all the women in the room yelling.",

        "An Alaska man accused of choking a woman until she was unconscious and then ejaculating on her will serve no jail time after accepting a plea deal.",
        "Justin Schneider, 34, pleaded guilty on Wednesday to one count of felony assault, local news station KTVA reported. Previously, a grand jury had indicted him on four felony charges, including kidnapping and assault, as well as a misdemeanor count of harassment. The charges stemmed from a 2017 incident in which a woman said he offered her a ride, then drove her to a secluded area and choked her until she passed out. When she woke up, she said, she was covered in semen.",
        "In exchange for his guilty plea, Schneider was sentenced to two years of prison time with one year suspended. However, as a Friday press release from the Alaska Department of Law explains, “Alaska law allows an offender to receive credit for any time spent on an ankle monitor or under house arrest against any jail sentence imposed” ― meaning that in practice he will not actually have to spend any time in jail.",
        "Schneider will also have to undergo sex offender treatment, though he will not have to register as a sex offender. “Physical contact with bodily fluid such as semen” is not considered a sex crime in Alaska, according to the statement.",
        "Anchorage Assistant District Attorney Andrew Grannik is taking heat for comments he made on Wednesday ― specifically, referring to the sentencing as a “pass.”",
        "According to KTVA, Grannik said the plea deal was based on expert analysis that Schneider is unlikely to re-offend.",
        "He then added, “But I would like the gentleman to be on notice that that is his one pass ― it’s not really a pass ― but given the conduct, one might consider that it is.”",
        "Grannik also said that Schneider had lost his job as an air traffic controller as a result of the case, which the assistant DA referred to as a “life sentence.”",
        "The Alaska Department of Law addressed Grannik’s controversial remarks in its press release, characterizing what he said as “unfortunate and misunderstood.”",
        "“The prosecutor was attempting to explain that while the agreed upon sentence seemed lenient, it was consistent with current Alaska law and based on a thorough review of the facts of case,” the statement said.",
        "Schneider was arrested in August 2017, after a 25-year-old Alaska Native woman said he offered her a ride at a gas station, but then drove her to an isolated area and assaulted her, according to charging documents obtained by the Alaska Star.",
        "“[Schneider] immediately and violently grabbed her neck in a front choke hold with both hands and told her if she screamed, he’d kill her,” Anchorage police detective Brett Sarber wrote in the documents.",
        "The woman reported that she lost consciousness and was covered in semen when she woke up. She said Schneider allowed her to grab her belongings and then drove away. She called 911 to report what happened and was taken to a hospital.",
        "A 2017 press release from Alaska’s Department of Law said that if Schneider were convicted of kidnapping, he would have faced a sentence between five and 99 years in prison. But the the state dismissed the kidnapping charge because investigators found the victim got into Schneider’s car “willingly” and “willingly drove with him to the location of the assault,” according to its newer statement.",
        "After his sentencing, Schneider said he was “grateful” for the process, KTVA reported. He said it had given him an opportunity to work on himself and “become a better person, and a better husband, and a better father.”"

    "articleContent": [
        "Tony Danza could have been quite the contender in the boxing ring. But his life took a different route when a producer discovered him inside a Manhattan gym and swiftly cast the budding boxer ― with no acting experience ― on the sitcom “Taxi.” To this day, Danza still wonders what life would have been like had that not happened.",
        "Luckily, though, that chance meeting turned into a five-year stint on “Taxi,” the Emmy-winning series, which ran from 1978 to 1983 and featured a top-notch cast, including Danny DeVito, Judd Hirsch, Marilu Henner, Christopher Lloyd, Jeff Conaway and Andy Kaufman.",
        "For Danza, it’s hard to believe so much time has passed since the premiere of the show, which centered around the lives of people working at a New York taxicab company.",
        "“Forty years. It doesn’t seem possible,” Danza told HuffPost at Build Series, which is owned by Oath, HuffPost’s parent company. “In just a blink of an eye. And what’s great is that we all still hang around together — I saw Chris [Lloyd] yesterday. It’s a touchstone in my life because obviously it changed my life.”",
        "“But I think about that a lot — how they treated me,” he continued. “Think about this for a second, right? So, these actors … they’ve been knocking around for a long time. They’re all looking for a show. Now they get this show. They get a great show with the greatest writers. They’re coming off ‘The Mary Tyler Moore Show’ with all these Emmys. They get the best time slot on TV. It’s right after the No. 1 show. They got the best director [James L. Brooks] … Oh, but just one thing — there’s this fighter that we found in New York. He’s never acted, but we’re going to put him in the show. And they welcome me with open arms … and I was just allowed to thrive … It was like being in the best school of all time.”",
        "“Taxi” served as a launching pad for Danza’s career, which later found him starring in “Who’s the Boss?,” hosting his own talk show, hitting Broadway and gracing both the big and small screen in a variety of projects. Still, “Taxi” holds a special place in his heart.",
        "“There was a ‘Taxi’ marathon a few years ago. It was a holiday or something,” he said. “I watched 19 episodes. I couldn’t stop, and they were great. Invariably what it’s about is somebody gets into trouble, and everybody goes to their aid. And I loved it. I’m so proud of being in that.”",
        "When asked whether he’d like to see a revival of “Taxi,” Danza admitted he feels torn, especially with the recent flurry of reboots and revivals.",
        "“This rebooting thing is kind of nutty. Why not think about something new? … I’m just not that crazy about doing something we’ve already done. I like to think ahead.”",
        "He certainly wouldn’t rule it out though.",
        "“But if you can get the guys back on ‘Taxi’ I might do it,” he added while smiling. “I’d jump in, I think.”",
        "Meanwhile, Danza has been working on a project that imagines what his life would have been like had he continued to pursue boxing.",
        "“I would love to play a trainer ... I’ve been writing a script. It’s called ‘The Hard Way’ … I boxed for six years. I took those six years before I got the part [on ‘Taxi’], and then I’m trying to imagine what would happen to me had I not gotten the part. And unfortunately, at the end it’s not like everyone has their hand up in the air. I think it’s a sad story because for three years, I boxed every day, five days a week. Every day I was in the ring … You take a lot of punishment. So what would I be like if it had been 10 years or 15 years? And I think what we know about the damage [boxing can cause] … I think that’s the story.”",
        "Before that script fully takes shape, though, Danza can be seen in a new TV project. Called “The Good Cop,” the Netflix series follows Tony Sr. (Danza), a disgraced, former NYPD officer who rarely ― if ever ― follows the rules. He lives with his son, TJ (played by Josh Groban), an honest NYPD detective who ― unlike his dad ― makes a point of always following the rules. The show, filmed on the streets of New York, blends comedy and drama and also manages to incorporate mystery into the plot. Danza and Groban also get a chance to show off their music skills.",
        "“The part is so much fun,” Danza said, adding that as soon as he read the script he felt as though the role has been written for him.",
        "Now 40 years into his career Danza attributes his longevity to good fortune ― plus, a few other things.",
        "“I’m lucky. I’m blessed. But I also work hard,” he said. “I put in the time. I also keep myself in shape … You have to put in your shift. And you have to be able to deal with unemployment. When you’re an actor, you have to deal with unemployment a lot …. That’s just the nature of the beast ... You have to reinvent yourself a lot. You can’t just do the same thing you did when you first started.”\n",
        "“The Good Cop” is currently available on Netflix.",

        "Kavanaugh has been a lecturer at the law school since 2009, and is scheduled to return in the new year for a course called “The Supreme Court since 2005.” Kavanaugh, who is up for consideration for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court, is facing sexual misconduct allegations from Christine Blasey Ford.",

        "Coleman, Kohnert-Young, Meiseles and Singh are part of a group known as the Pipeline Parity Project, which is working to end harassment and discrimination in the legal profession.",
        "Kohnert-Yount told HuffPost that as a woman, she wouldn’t be comfortable taking Kavanaugh’s class and that by continuing to have him teach at the school, it puts students in a “very uncomfortable position and necessitates that vulnerable people self-select out of a learning opportunity.”",
        "Meiseles said Kavanaugh is known as a “feeder judge,” meaning getting a position with him or getting him to help can lead to prestigious jobs in the judiciary, often on the Supreme Court. But there would be an “unfair burden on women” who wouldn’t feel comfortable being in his class, and they would therefore be losing out on a career opportunity.",

        "WASHINGTON ― The Justice Department has succeeded, for the moment, in convincing President Donald Trump to hold off on declassifying secret documents related to the ongoing criminal investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.",
        "The White House said earlier this week that Trump had ordered the Justice Department to immediately declassify certain previously redacted portions of a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act application regarding Carter Page, a former Trump campaign adviser who was monitored by the government during the 2016 campaign. Releasing the classified documents would have marked an extraordinary intervention into the Russia investigation, which has been led by special counsel Robert Mueller since May 2017.",
        "But Trump walked things back in a series of tweets on Friday morning, saying that the Justice Department indicated during a meeting that releasing the documents “may have a perceived negative impact on the Russia probe.” Instead, he said, the Justice Department’s inspector general had “been asked to review these documents on an expedited basis.” Trump said he could “always declassify if it proves necessary.”",
        "“Speed is very important to me ― and everyone!” Trump wrote.",
        "A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment, while a representative of the Justice Department’s inspector general did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
        "Trump, in a chummy interview this week with John Solomon and Buck Sexton of The Hill, said he wanted to release the documents because he was asked by “so many people that I respect” before listing a number of Fox News and Fox Business Network hosts: “the great Lou Dobbs, the great Sean Hannity, the wonderful, great Jeanine Pirro.”",
        "Trump had also instructed the government to release all the text messages exchanged by former FBI attorney Lisa Page and former FBI agent Peter Strzok about the Russia probe, as well as the texts of other Justice Department and FBI officials. It appeared that Trump’s statement ― referring to “various UNREDACTED documents” ― applied to the release of those texts as well.",
        "Trump’s Republican defenders on Capitol Hill have zeroed in on various text messages exchanged by Strzok and Page as a way of delegitimizing the Mueller investigation, which has already taken down a number of key Trump associates. DOJ’s inspector general, in a report that criticized the FBI’s treatment of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during the 2016 campaign, said the text messages Strzok and Page exchanged caused damage to “the FBI’s reputation for neutral factfinding and political independence.”",

        "Hirono was referring to a letter from Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) to Senate Democrats about Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford, who goes by Christine Blasey professionally. In a Washington Post report published Sunday, Blasey publicly accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her in 1982 when the two were at a high school party. Kavanaugh has denied the allegation against him.",
        "Garrett Ventry, a communications adviser to Grassley, responded on Twitter to Hirono’s claim, calling her comments “nonsense.”",
        "“This is such nonsense. The Committee has sent 9 emails and left 2 voicemails,” Ventry tweeted.",
        "The committee’s hearings on Kavanaugh concluded last week, but its vote on the confirmation was postponed in order to add one more hearing on Blasey’s accusation. The Supreme Court candidate has agreed to testify on the issue in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday.",
        "Blasey, however, has not committed to testifying, asking that the FBI investigate her claims first.",
        "“The rush to a hearing is unnecessary, and contrary to the Committee discovering the truth,” Blasey’s attorney Lisa Banks said in a Wednesday statement. “She continues to believe that a full non-partisan investigation of this matter is needed and she is willing to cooperate with the Committee.”",
        "Since Blasey came forward, she and her family have received death threats, forcing them to move from their home.\n\nOn Tuesday, Hirono asked men on the Senate Judiciary Committee and around the country to “step up” in the face of the accusation against Kavanaugh.\n\n“I expect the men in this country and the men in this committee ... to demand an FBI investigation. But really, guess who’s perpetuating all of these kinds of actions? It’s the men in this country,” she said, adding later: “I just want to say to the men in this country, just shut up and step up. Do the right thing for a change.”"

        "It’s been a year since Hurricane Maria upended Jennyfer Ortiz’s life. The single mother fled Puerto Rico with her two children after their house in the mountain town of Orocovis lost power. They have been using a government-funded program to pay for a hotel in the Bronx, but that ended last week, forcing Ortiz, her 20-year-old son and 14-year-old daughter into a homeless shelter.",
        "“Maria changed our lives ― ruined our lives ― and left us with nothing. After 18 hours of horror, we woke up the next day and had lost everything,” Ortiz said. The 46-year-old hasn’t been able to work since they’ve been in New York City ― she has diabetes and hypertension, takes 14 medications a day and uses a walker. Her son works full time at a grocery store, but doesn’t make enough to pay for their own place.",
        "“We’re working. We’re not just waiting for the government to pay everything,” she said. “We’re trying to get ahead ― but it’s hard.”",
        "Ortiz is one of 2,436 displaced Puerto Ricans on the U.S. mainland who, as of last month, were still in hotels paid for by the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Transitional Sheltering Assistance program.",
        "After repeated extensions of the program in response to a lawsuit from the advocacy group Latino Justice, a federal judge ruled late last month to end it, forcing people still using the program to check out by Sept. 14.",
        "There were few good options for the people still in hotels: Accept the government’s offer to pay for a plane ticket back to Puerto Rico or stay on the mainland and either secure their own place, stay with friends or go to a shelter.",
        "Many relying on FEMA’s housing funds are in precarious financial situations, said Peter Gudaitis, executive director of the nonprofit New York Disaster Interfaith Services, which has been helping Maria evacuees. Some have medical conditions, others have young kids and haven’t been able to afford day care, which has prevented them from finding a job. Even evacuees who have found work struggle to save enough for a security deposit and first month’s rent.",
        "“I don’t have anybody here. I don’t know what to do,” Myrna Reyes, another Maria evacuee, who suffers from diabetes, asthma and high blood pressure, told HuffPost on Monday. “I’ve lost hope.”",
        "After Reyes left the hotel that FEMA was paying for in Brooklyn on Friday, she ended up at a New York shelter. But she didn’t feel safe there. She saw people outside injecting drugs, she said, and her room was up four flights of stairs with no elevator, and she has limited mobility. She went to a friend’s home nearby, but that friend is moving to Florida next week, and Reyes will have to find somewhere else to go.",
        "“They’ve left us practically in the street,” Reyes said. “They’re not treating us like the U.S. citizens that we are.”",
        "When U.S. District Judge Timothy Hillman in Massachusetts ruled to end the FEMA hotel program earlier this month, he urged the government to find longer-term housing solutions for Maria evacuees. Latino Justice alleges that FEMA hasn’t.",
        "FEMA told HuffPost on Tuesday that since Maria hit, it had assisted more than 7,000 families who had survived the storm with temporary hotel rooms in 40 states, costing more than $100 million.",
        "“While FEMA and other forms of government assistance can never make a disaster survivor whole, the assistance is meant to help survivors begin their recovery process,” FEMA spokesperson Lenisha Smith wrote by email. “FEMA will continue to work with survivors in their long-term housing plans.”",
        "Gudaitis, whose group has been helping Maria survivors in New York, said that of the 34 families it assisted who were still in hotels paid by FEMA as of last week, over two thirds are now in the New York City shelter system. The rest are staying with family, and a “small number” have found their own place, he said.",
        "In central Florida, Vamos4PR, a group assisting Maria evacuees there, said of about 100 families it knew of that were using the FEMA program, about half are now doubled up with friends, a “handful” returned to Puerto Rico and a few had secured their own place. For the remaining, the group is now trying to assist with cash or by negotiating low hotel rates. They were told in recent months that there was no more capacity in the central Florida shelter system.",
        "Amneris Ortíz (no relation to Jennyfer) is a single mom who had been using the FEMA program to pay for a hotel on the outskirts of Orlando until Friday, along with her elderly mother and three children, ages 17, 10 and 8. A local church helped her pay a deposit and the first month’s rent to secure an apartment, but she doesn’t know how she’ll make rent next month.",
        "She had been working at a Wawa gas station, but after her car broke down in July, she lost that job because it was too far to walk there. She then got a job closer to the hotel, working as a part-time teacher in a day care, but the apartment they were able to line up is too far from that job. When HuffPost spoke to her Monday, she hadn’t been able to make it to work that day.",
        "“I don’t know how I’m going to do it,” said Amneris Ortíz. Her kids have asthma, and her mother also has health issues. She has a college degree, but her current job pays only $9 an hour. “I’m trying to make enough to help my kids get by, but it’s really hard.”",
        "FEMA noted that one of the options it offered evacuees was free plane tickets to return to Puerto Rico. About 500 people have taken them up on that.",
        "But for many of the most vulnerable families, returning to the island is not a viable option. Experts say Puerto Rico’s recovery process will take years. Repeated power outages still plague the island, and the health care system has not fully recovered.",
        "In the wake of the storm, the schools Amneris Ortíz’s kids had attended had closed. In Florida, they’re getting a good education at least. The principal at her son’s school even paid for his soccer cleats so he could join the team.",
        "Jennyfer Ortiz says she’s undergoing treatment in New York for her medical conditions. She has knee surgery scheduled. Without power in the wake of Maria, she couldn’t keep her insulin refrigerated. The family would line up for hours for ice only to have half of it melt by the time they got home. She doesn’t see how she can return to an island where she has no place to stay ― their home that flooded was a rental ― and where there’s still a shortage of doctors.",
        "“Without health, we have nothing,” Jennyfer Ortiz said. “They wanted to pay me a ticket to go back to an island where I lost everything. And to return where? To the street?”",
        "FEMA also pointed to a Rental Assistance program it offers to provide two-months’ rent to survivors. The agency said it had provided it to 3,833 families who had previously stayed in FEMA-paid hotels stateside.",
        "But Gudaitis said that, to his knowledge, none of the families his group serves in New York had been able to get rental assistance through that program. Vamos4PR echoed that in central Florida: None of the families it had assisted received additional longer-term housing assistance from FEMA.",
        "“I honestly feel lost,” said Amneris Ortíz. She applied for rental assistance from FEMA a couple of weeks ago and sent further documentation last week. She has not heard anything so far.",
        "“I’m getting panic attacks. I’m scared of ending up in the street with my kids,” she said, in tears. “Not being able to provide them with what they need ― they ask me for things and I can’t. I’m feeling very depressed. I don’t see the light at the end of the tunnel.”"

        "Chelsea Handler wasn’t pleased with Louis C.K. or Aziz Ansari’s recent returns to the stage over the past few weeks.",
        "The longtime stand-up comic and entertainer told HuffPost that the two missed out on the chance to do the “only thing they have to do.”",
        "“They have to address what happened. People want to talk about it,” she said in a phone interview last week. “You can’t just ignore and throw it under the rug. You have to talk about what you’ve learned, where you’ve come from and where you are now.”",
        "Louis C.K. was accused of unwanted sexual advances by multiple women in November, some of whom said he masturbated in front of them. The comedian later accepted responsibility for his sexual misconduct.",
        "In January, Ansari was accused of sexual assault by an unnamed woman, an encounter the comedian said was “completely consensual.”",
        "Handler added, “I think that’s the issue everyone has with it and why it’s such a big deal. You can’t just come back and act like nothing happened ― you did a bad thing ― depending on which person you’re talking about. It’s about taking responsibility, ultimately.”",
        "Handler has mainly stayed away from performing since she quit her Netflix show, “Chelsea,” back in October 2017. She said she’s spent the last year trying to get both women and people of color elected into office.",
        "She occasionally spars with the Trumps on Twitter, but told HuffPost that if she came face to face with any of them, she wouldn’t say a word.",
        "“What would be the point of speaking to somebody like that?” Handler said. “There are children in cages ― there are 12,000 children at our border that have been separated from their families and [Trump’s] denying that people died in Puerto Rico. We have a monster running our country and his whole family is a bunch of monsters.”",
        "Handler added that she couldn’t care less about Donald Trump Jr., who recently shared a sexist, suggestive tweet in response to one of Handler’s tweets about him.",
        "“I’ll care about [him] when he’s in jail,” she said. Same goes for the president, who, the entertainer says, needs to be impeached and removed from office because he’s not fit for the job.",
        "“They should’ve removed him a long time ago for the way he uses his Twitter, the language that he uses and the violence that he invokes,” Handler said. “His cabinet has responsibilities to this country ― not to the Republican party.”",
        "Handler says she uses cannabis to cope with the current administration.",
        "“Drinking when you’re angry is no fun so I needed another outlet,” she said. “There are so many times when I just don’t want to drink every night ― if I have a dinner or if I’m going out. Sometimes I’ll just take an edible and, you know, not drink. That was never part of my vocabulary before.”",
        "Handler is so passionate about her newfound, well, passion that she’s going on a seven-stop speaking tour in Canada with Civilized, a cannabis lifestyle publication. She’ll discuss topics like weed, culture and political activism in a town hall setting, just before recreational marijuana officially becomes legal in October.",
        "“I’m always looking for an excuse to spend more time in Canada, so this is a great one,” Handler said, later closing her interview with a plea. “I’m waiting for an invitation for dual Canadian citizenship ― so get that out there too.”"

        "“We are many, but we speak with one voice: Believe us, trust us, stand with us,” the letter, written by reproductive rights activist Alison Turkos, reads.",
        "The letter, published online Monday night, asks Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and others on the committee to believe Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who goes by Christine Blasey professionally. On Sunday, Blasey publicly accused Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her in 1982 at a high school party. In light of Blasey’s allegation, the vote to confirm Kavanaugh has been delayed.",
        "“Dr. Blasey Ford’s story, all too familiar to many of us, is not to be taken lightly. It is not to be dismissed as ‘boys being boys.’ It is not to be swept under the rug or denied,” the letter continues. “You have the power to make sure that doesn’t happen.”",
        "The statement is signed by 141 survivors from 33 different states, including Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, Turkos said. She is inviting survivors of sexual assault to sign the online letter if they want to.",
        "“A sexual abuser has no business serving on the highest court in the land. The nomination of Brett Kavanaugh is an insult to all of us ― to every survivor who has come forward. Our liberty, our dignity, our humanity demand to be heard and validated,” the letter states. “That is impossible with Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court.”",
        "Turkos, a survivor of multiple rapes herself, told HuffPost that she was inspired to write the letter because she wanted to ensure that victims of sexual violence were centered in the conversations about Kavanaugh.",
        "“Survivors are too often left out of the conversation, our voices and stories are reconfigured by men, the media and those in power. I wanted to lift up and center our voices and experiences, ensure they’re not being drowned out and ignored,” Turkos said.",
        "She added that in the wake of the Me Too movement, the Senate Judiciary Committee’s decision on whether or not to elect Kavanaugh is more important than ever.",
        "“This is a crucial moment for senators to do something. We want senators to continue to listen, to continue to act upon these allegations. We will hold these senators accountable, we will never forget this moment,” Turkos said. ”I want it to show these senators that Dr. Blasey Ford has the full support of a community, and sadly she’s not alone.”",
        "Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings concluded last week, but the vote was postponed in order to add one more hearing on Blasey’s accusations. The Supreme Court candidate has agreed to testify on the issue in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday. Blasey, however, has not committed to testifying, asking that the FBI investigate her claims first.\n\n“We are survivors and we will not be silenced,” the letter powerfully concluded. “We stand with Dr. Christine Blasey Ford and with all survivors. The question is ― will you?”",

If they use their aides, they would be able to rely on female staffers. (The Democratic side is more diverse, with women and people of color on the committee.)",
        "Three Democratic sources familiar with the committee’s planning told HuffPost that this proposal was under consideration, although so far it’s not clear whether Blasey and Kavanaugh will testify. The office of Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), the chairman of the judiciary panel, did not return a request for comment.",
        "“We’ve discussed various options, including hiring outside lawyers and supplementing that with senators asking questions,” said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), a member of the committee. “So, any senator who wants to ask questions remains free to do so. But I don’t want want to get in front of the chairman.”",
        "Another option under consideration is allowing Blasey’s attorney to question Kavanaugh and Kavanaugh’s attorney to question Blasey, an idea that Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said she would support. Collins is not on the judiciary committee.",
        "Republicans are no doubt eager to avoid some of the mistakes of 1991, when law professor Anita Hill testified about her sexual harassment allegations against Clarence Thomas, who was eventually confirmed to the Supreme Court anyway.",
        "Hill, a black woman, had to testify in front of a Senate Judiciary Committee that was composed entirely of white men. The optics were not lost on anyone, and in the 1992 elections, women across the country were inspired to run to change the representation in Congress.",
        "Republicans have agreed to hear testimony from Blasey on Monday, but they’re resisting calls from Democrats to bring in additional witnesses.",

        "The survey of 1,035 people was conducted between Sept. 4 and 12, shortly after retired Vatican official Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano published a letter accusing Francis and other high-ranking clergy of covering up sexual abuse and misconduct allegedly committed by the disgraced former archbishop of Washington, ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick. McCarrick, who denies the allegations, was removed from public ministry in June after a church investigation found the claims against him to be credible. He resigned from the College of Cardinals in July.",

        "The allegations have caused a rift in the U.S Catholic hierarchy, with some bishops rallying to defend the pope and others pushing for him to respond. Catholics in the pews have also been demanding answers. Over 46,000 Catholic women have signed a public letter pressing Francis to explain exactly when and how he found out about McCarrick’s alleged sexual abuse and misconduct.",
        "The Gallup survey was also conducted weeks after a Pennsylvania grand jury published a bombshell report documenting how six of the state’s eight dioceses covered up sexual abuse by 301 “predator priests” over seven decades. The two-year probe in Pennsylvania has inspired attorneys general in New York, New Jersey, and in several other states to announce their own investigations into the Catholic sex abuse scandal.",
        "According to Gallup, Americans’ opinions about former Pope John Paul II also took a hit after news about clerical abuse emerged during his papacy in 2002. Eighty-six percent of Americans viewed John Paul favorably in 1998, compared to 61 percent in 2002.",
        "And although Francis’ popularity has dipped, he hasn’t grown quite as unpopular as Pope Benedict XVI. In 2010, Gallup found that only 40 percent of Americans viewed Francis’ immediate predecessor favorably.",
        "Despite the turmoil in the Roman Catholic Church, it appears that American Catholics’ opinion of Francis has remained essentially unchanged. Seventy-nine percent of U.S. Catholics had a favorable opinion of Francis in September, compared to about 78 percent in August.",
        "Jason Berry, a journalist who has covered the Catholic clerical scandal since the 1990s, told HuffPost that he thinks Vigano’s letter did some damage to Francis’ standing among non-Catholics.",
        "But unlike his predecessors, Francis has shown that he has the capacity to change and publicly admit when he’s made mistakes, Berry said.",
        "“I think most Catholics, liberal or conservative, recognize that Francis, as a champion of the poor and migrants, is dealing with a complex crisis that built up for many years before he became pope,” said Berry, author of the 1992 book on the issue, Lead Us Not Into Temptation. “He has taken strong steps against certain bishops, though he has yet to forge an effective policy.”",
        "For all adults surveyed, this Gallup poll had a margin of error of +/- 4 percentage points at the 95 percent confidence level. For the 221 Catholic Americans surveyed, the poll had a margin of error of +/- 7 percentage points at the 95 percent confidence level."

The site lost enough material to fill around two-thirds of an Olympic-sized pool, the company said in a statement, adding that it did not believe the incident posed a risk to health or the environment.\n\nOfficials had warned before the storm rains could taint waterways with murky coal ash and toxic hog waste.\n\nFlorence has already set a North Carolina record for rainfall totals, exceeding that of Hurricane Floyd, which struck in 1999 and caused 56 deaths.\n\nIn New Bern, about 90 miles northeast of Wilmington at the confluence of two rivers, Florence overwhelmed the town of 30,000 and left the downtown area under water.\n\n“It was pitch black and I was just scared out of my mind,” said Tracy Singleton, who with her family later fled her home near New Bern.\n\nSouth Carolina authorities said law enforcement officers were guarding against looting in evacuated areas, while Wilmington set a curfew on Saturday evening in response to looting in one area.\n\nAs the United States dealt with Florence, a super typhoon made landfall in China’s Guangdong on Sunday after barrelling past Hong Kong and Macau and killing at least 29 people in the Philippines.\n\n(Additional reporting by Rich McKay; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg)"

    "articleContent": [
        "Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort has, as part of a plea deal, agreed to cooperate with the special counsel investigation led by Robert Mueller. This is likely bad news for President Donald Trump and his 2016 campaign team — but it could also cause problems for a slew of lobbyists and other advocates, including several Democratic operatives.",
        "As part of Manafort’s deal with Mueller, he agreed to testify in any case the government asks him to. Court documents show that high-profile lobbying, public relations and law firms worked quietly with Manafort over the years as he brought in more than $60 million boosting the U.S. image of a pro-Russia political party in Ukraine. And like Manafort, they don’t appear to have registered as foreign agents at the time.",
        "Mueller has already referred several of these firms to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York for further investigation, CNN reported last month. Here are some of the people who worked on Manafort’s Ukraine lobbying and could face fallout from his plea deal.",
        "Gregory Craig, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom",
        "Manafort hired Skadden, a prominent law firm, to produce a December 2012 report that defended the imprisonment of former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko by the government of then-President Viktor Yanukovych, her political rival. The report found that Tymoshenko’s defense against abuse-of-power charges was “compromised” but that her conviction was justified by the evidence presented.",
        "The report was part of Manafort’s effort to endear Yanukovych and his pro-Russia political party to the U.S. and Europe. Skadden received more than $4.6 million for the report, most of which came from one of Manafort’s offshore accounts, according to court documents. Manafort later arranged for it to be promoted in the media and passed around in White House and congressional offices, court documents show.",
        "The report’s lead author was then-Skadden partner Gregory Craig, a former White House counsel to President Barack Obama. In September 2012, about three months before the report became public, Manafort told Yanukovych it could play a significant role in influencing the Obama administration’s Ukraine policy. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had characterized Tymoshenko’s prosecution as a form of political revenge. But the White House indicated that if the report showed that Tymoshenko’s trial “was conducted fairly and that the conviction was based on the facts of the case and not politically motivated,” the Obama administration would be able to de-emphasize its position on releasing Tymoshenko, Manafort wrote to Yanukovych in a memo that was included in the court documents.",
        "In November 2012, just before the report became public, Skadden told Manafort “that the evidence of Tymoshenko’s criminal intent is ‘virtually non-existent,’” according to court filings. But Skadden’s final report said Tymoshenko’s conviction was justified.",
        "Freedom House, a watchdog organization, criticized some of Skadden’s findings as “utterly baffling.” There are signs that Craig was uncomfortable with his own report. In a 2012 interview with The New York Times, he said it was up to “others” to determine whether the prosecution of Tymoshenko was politically motivated — even though his own report suggested it was not.",
        "Skadden did not disclose in the report that it had also been retained to represent Ukraine in connection with the Tymoshenko case and to provide training to the lawyers prosecuting Tymoshenko, according to court filings.",
        "Skadden employees have not been charged with any wrongdoing, but CNN reported last month that Craig, who left the firm in April, is part of an inquiry that Mueller referred to federal prosecutors in New York related to whether several U.S. individuals failed to appropriately register as foreign agents. Prosecutors are now weighing whether to charge Craig with a crime, CNN reported on Friday.",
        "Skadden did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. Craig’s lawyer told CNN that Craig was not required to register as a foreign agent for his work on the Tymoshenko report.",
        "Tony Podesta, Podesta Group, and Vin Weber, Mercury Public Affairs",
        "Company A and Company B ― Mercury Public Affairs and the Podesta Group ― were hired in 2012 “to lobby in the United States on behalf of President Yanukovych, Party of Regions [his pro-Russia political party] and the Government of Ukraine,” according to court filings. Former Republican congressman Vin Weber headed Mercury’s efforts; Tony Podesta, the longtime Democratic lobbyist with ties to the Clinton administration, ran the Podesta Group’s involvement.",
        "Manafort said that he agreed to pay the two firms more than $2 million from his offshore accounts for their lobbying on behalf of Ukraine and that he directed those lobbying efforts. Mercury and the Podesta Group lobbied “dozens of Members of Congress, their staff, and White House and State Department officials about Ukraine sanctions, the validity of the Ukraine elections, and the propriety of President Yanukovych imprisoning Tymoshenko, his presidential rival,” according to the criminal filings.",
        "In November 2012, Rick Gates, Manafort’s top aide who has testified against his former boss, told the two firms to prepare an assessment of their lobbying efforts so that “Paul” could brief the “President” ― presumably Yanukovych ― on their progress, court documents show.",
        "As part of a scheme to avoid having to register as foreign agents operating on behalf of the Ukrainian government, Manafort connected Mercury Public Affairs and the Podesta Group with a “newly-formed Brussels entity called the European Centre for the Modern Ukraine,” according to court filings. But employees from both firms “understood that they were receiving direction from MANAFORT and President Yanukovych, not the Centre, which was not even operational when Companies A and B began lobbying for Ukraine.”",
        "One employee of the Podesta Group even referred to the center as the “European hot dog stand for a Modern Ukraine,” and “the head of Company B” — likely Tony Podesta — told his team to think of Yanukovych as “the client.”",
        "A Mercury Public Affairs employee instructed a colleague to “see through the nonsense” and understand that they were lobbying for the center “in name only,” according to court filings.",
        "“It’s like Alice in Wonderland,” the employee explained.",
        "Mueller’s team has referred the Weber and Podesta investigations to federal prosecutors in New York, CNN reported. Neither Weber nor Podesta, whose firm shuttered at the end of last year, responded to requests for comment.",
        "Alan Friedman, FBC Media",
        "FBC Media, a now-defunct public relations firm run by former journalist Alan Friedman, is referenced in the Manafort indictment as Company D. The Italy-based firm was hired to “write and disseminate” news stories in the U.S. “that alleged that Tymoshenko had paid for the murder of a Ukrainian official,” according to court filings. Manafort told Friedman that this allegation should find its way to the American press “[w]ith no fingerprints.”",
        "“My goal is to plant some stink on Tymo,” Manafort added.",
        "Friedman objected to this plan, according to court filings, but later carried it out.",
        "FBC Media also served as an intermediary for the Hapsburg Group, the nickname for a group of four former European heads of state hired by Manafort to quietly lobby on behalf of Ukraine in the U.S. and the European Union. The former European officials advocated pro-Ukraine policies in meetings with U.S. lawmakers and journalists and in ghost-written op-eds in American media outlets, court filings allege. Manafort paid FBC Media more than 700,000 euros from three of his offshore accounts in 2012 through 2013, according to court documents.",
        "Friedman did not respond to a request for comment."

        "Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) on Friday introduced legislation that would require public companies to disclose risks to their business posed by climate change.",
        "The Climate Risk Disclosure Act would impose sweeping rules mandating that publicly traded companies disclose direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions, the value of all fossil-fuel related assets, and risk-management strategies to deal with a warming world. Companies also would have to tell investors how their valuation would change under worst-case and best-case scenarios to curb greenhouse gas emissions.",
        "“Climate change is a real and present danger ― and it will have an enormous effect on the value of company assets,” Warren said in a statement on Friday, noting that the phenomenon can be “an economic opportunity if we act boldly and decisively.”",
        "“But if we don’t,” she continued, “we will see a global catastrophe that will put the 2008 crisis to shame.”",
        "The bill has the support of several environmental organizations, including the Sierra Club, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Union of Concerned Scientists and Greenpeace USA.",
        "Former Vice President Al Gore, who has long warned of a coming “carbon asset bubble” comparable to the subprime mortgage crisis, said the legislation would help the country shift toward renewable energy and demonstrate the financial toll of runaway climate change.",
        "“Our addiction to fossil fuels has led to a ballooning sub-prime carbon bubble that threatens to strand assets in every sector of the American economy,” Gore said in a statement. “This is a critical step toward breaking our addiction to fossil fuels and accelerating the transition to a clean energy economy. This bill highlights the opportunity for the U.S to lead the global sustainability revolution.”",
        "The legislation is sure to face an uphill battle in Congress, where Republicans have supported President Donald Trump’s efforts to roll back Obama-era climate regulations. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) was instrumental in the president’s decision to withdraw the U.S. from the landmark Paris climate deal. Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency and Interior Department are reportedly moving ahead on plans to roll back restrictions on methane emissions, a potent greenhouse gas.",
        "Researchers have warned for years that in order to halt the worst effects of climate change, the world will need to dramatically scale back greenhouse gas emissions. The planet is far off track from achieving those goals, even under pledges that are part of the Paris pact. Emissions actually rose in 2017 after plateauing for several years.",
        "Economists have struggled for years to put a dollar figure on the cost of rampant climate change, and a recent study found that even the best estimates may be dangerously low. But climate-related disasters have grown more expensive in recent years, and in 2017 such events cost the U.S. a record-breaking $300 billion, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration."

    },
    "articleContent": [
        "For 22 years, Nicole Holofcener has been known for making movies about women, treating their relationship hurdles (“Enough Said”), financial woes (“Friends With Money”), personal insecurities (“Lovely & Amazing”) and privileged restlessness (“Please Give”) with grace and wit. Even the television episodes she’s directed (“Sex and the City,” “Enlightened,” “Orange Is the New Black”) have centered largely on female stories that feel at home in the Holofcener wheelhouse.",
        "But not this time. This time, the 58-year-old writer-director shifted her lens to, of all things, a man. “The Land of Steady Habits,” which premiered earlier this week at the Toronto International Film Festival ahead of its Netflix launch on Friday, is about a retiree (Ben Mendelsohn) who divorces his wife (Edie Falco) and finds the next chapter of his life wanting. Adapting Ted Thompson’s novel of the same name, Holofcener departs from her preoccupations but maintains her signature poise.",
        "Holofcener also co-wrote one of the festival’s highlights, “Can You Ever Forgive Me?,” a lovely biopic starring Melissa McCarthy as writer Lee Israel, who took to forging high-profile literary correspondences when strapped for cash in the 1990s. There, too, Holofcener’s stamp looms large, blending whimsy and melancholy to portray quotidian heartache.",
        "In Toronto, I sat down with her to talk about what led to “The Land of Steady Habits,” Holofcener’s first film that doesn’t feature her muse, Catherine Keener. We discussed both movies and the evolution of her career.",
        "“Steady Habits” is a movie about a man, and that’s different for you. Being someone who’s so known for female-centric stories, what made this story about a male midlife crisis attractive and sympathetic to you?",
        "First of all, I would never have written this story. So when I read a book that draws me in and has great characters and good conflict in a world that I don’t really know that much about, that appeals to me. I felt like, oh, I’m never going to make this up, and I love it, so I should do it. And I didn’t really think about it being a male lead. I liked that, just for the experience of working with a man as the lead. But it felt the same. It’s just a person.",
        "The beats of the story exist in the Holofcener wheelhouse, if you will.",
        "Right, which is why I was drawn to it.",
        "It’s interesting, though, because we’re at a moment where people are saying, “Well, we’ve seen the male midlife crisis story a lot.”",
        "Oh, yeah. I’m not stupid. [Laughs] Yeah, I know.",
        "Was there a particular element that you felt elevated it beyond that convention?",
        "Yeah, absolutely. I so hope this is not seen as a male midlife crisis movie. Clearly it’s a white man with these white-privilege problems, but it was the relationships between the people: Ben Mendelsohn’s character and his son [played by Thomas Mann], his relationship with his friend’s young son [played by Charlie Tahan], the drugs, the bad decisions, the tragedy. The drama of it appealed to me, and I think it’s really important people know it’s not a comedy. Don’t expect Julia Louis-Dreyfus comedy, although most of my movies do have drama, and this one does have laughs. But it leans more toward drama.",
        "I hope that it does explore more original and unique themes that belong to these people, that it’s not just a guy trying to decorate his condo. Bad shit happens, and I think that makes the movie richer.",
        "“Enough Said,” in 2013, was a big moment for you. It was your highest-performing movie commercially, the reviews were tremendous, there was awards buzz.",
        "I got the buzz, but it didn’t get the awards.",
        "Right. I spoke to you on the phone not long after the Golden Globe nominations had come out, when it was thought maybe you’d get one. You were very candid with me about being disappointed not to be included.",
        "Well, I guess I had been told that I had a better chance at a Golden Globe [than an Oscar] — or not necessarily me, but Jim [Gandolfini] or Julia [Louis-Dreyfus]. And then nothing, so of course I was disappointed, especially for my actors. And especially for Jim, who was already gone by that time. I didn’t want him to be a sentimental pity win, but it was a beautiful performance.",
        "[Editor’s note: Louis-Dreyfus did receive a Globe nomination for “Enough Said.”]",
        "That was a James Gandolfini we had never seen before. And it was a Julia Louis-Dreyfus we’d never seen before, too, really. In the scope of indie films, it performed well at the box office and won you a lot of a critical attention.",
        "But it didn’t cross over. That’s the thing.",
        "Unfortunately, what does cross over these days?",
        "Oh, I could list things with great bitterness. [Laughs]",
        "OK, fair. But aside from the awards conversation of it all, did you feel like your career shifted? It’s not that you hadn’t been praised for a decade and a half prior to that, but it felt like a bigger moment for you, perhaps.",
        "I didn’t feel like it was that big a difference, no. In fact, because it didn’t cross over and my other films were more quote-unquote indie for some reason, I got more attention as an indie director, like at the Spirit Awards. I think this movie kind of hung somewhere in between, and no, I don’t really feel it changed my career. But I’m glad you think it was a bigger moment than it was for me. I’m not complaining, but nobody’s heard of that movie more than my other movies, I’ve found. Maybe if I say who’s in it, they’ll say, “Oh, yeah! I wanted to see that!” But as long as I can keep making movies that I’m proud of, that’s what makes me happy more than anything.",
        "Having come off “Enough Said” feeling unchanged, do you think there are more possibilities in the streaming realm?",
        "I think this particular movie will have a better and longer life on Netflix than it will had it been in the theater for any length of time. And this way I don’t have to worry about that, checking the newspaper like, “Is it still there?” I think other movies might fare better with that gamble.",
        "It’s interesting — I guess nothing is black and white. I do make peace with the fact that I make the kind of movies I make. I am stubborn about who I want to cast in the end. It’s all my choice; it really is. I have no reason to complain about anything, but sometimes it is hard. I think, “Oh, I should try to have a bigger audience or make more money.” And then I just don’t go that way. Or it’s not offered to me or I pass on it. Sometimes I think, “OK, I’m going to cast an A-list actor,” and then I just end up not wanting who’s on that list for this particular part. Ultimately, the process of making the movie I like is the most important.",
        "Are you literally handed lists?",
        "Yeah. They don’t say it quite as openly as that. They’ll say, “What about these people?” And then I’ll circle the ones that I think are actually right for the part that I would enjoy working with. Then they say, “But what about those people?” It’s definitely a dance. But with Netflix, it was not a dance. I wanted these people, and they said, “Terrific. Those are great people. Go make your movie.” That doesn’t happen very often, and casting is so important to me.",
        "It’s a director’s most important job.",
        "Absolutely. More than directing. More than anything. Otherwise, it’s just a job of fixing it, not making it.",
        "You wrote an essay in New York magazine a couple of years ago about having once felt like you needed to be so prepared on set or else make things up as evidence of your knowledge so nobody would doubt your skills. Going into this movie, how much different was that mentality for you than it had been even a couple of years ago?",
        "I guess even more so. I don’t pretend to know something I don’t, even more so. I’m more open, probably too much. I’m probably too self-deprecating at times. But I see young directors pretending to know everything, and it’s very off-putting. I don’t see the point. I think people can see through that, too. But in film school, they do make you think you have to know every element of the filmmaking process. I remember studying foot-candles. You’re like, “What’s a foot-candle?”",
        "Yeah, no idea.",
        "It’s all about lighting and the elements. See? There’s this book you’re supposed to study, and so you come out of film school thinking, “Oh, I know my foot-candles.” And I don’t even remember what they are, nor should I have to. My interest is elsewhere. I think full disclosure is so much better — even with actors, too. If I’ve written it from scratch and an actor says to me, “I don’t really know why I’m saying this,” I’ll sort of examine it myself and realize, “I’m not quite sure why you’re saying it either, but somehow it feels right. Let’s try it.” I think they would prefer that than me making up some bullshit answer.",
        "Instead of inventing some psychology on the spot.",
        "Exactly, “Well, your father and your mother ... ” It’s like, actually, I don’t know. I just wrote it and it felt right. That comes with age, as they say.",
        "I was going to ask if it was an age thing. How much has the elevated attention that we’re finally giving to women in Hollywood helped or encouraged you, if at all?",
        "I don’t know. I don’t know. I know that when I was trying to prove myself, being a woman made me even more anxious to do that. A crew full of guys? And when I got onto the set of a television show where they don’t know me, I do feel I may have more guard up as a female to prove myself. But I’ve been fortunate enough to be able to make my movies without the Me Too movement. I’ve been around. And I’m really glad that it’s happening and that women are getting more options.",
        "One of my very favorite movies at this festival is “Can You Ever Forgive Me?” How did the Lee Israel story enter your life? Was there ever a scenario in which you were to direct the movie yourself?",
        "Anne Carey, a wonderful producer, gave me the script that Jeff Whitty had written the first draft of. So I did several drafts on it, and I don’t even know — how do I explain this? [Addressing publicist across the room:] Should I just lie?",
        "No. No.",
        "[Publicist nods.] She says yes.",
        "No!",
        "I just did the script, and Marielle [Heller] directed it beautifully. And that’s how it was meant to be. [Smiles] She’s nodding back there. Yeah. It’s a beautiful movie.",
        "The movie references Nora Ephron, which feel like a Nicole Holofcener addition to the script.",
        "No, that’s in the memoir. I adapted it.",
        "I just mean that you seem like a Nora Ephron fan and would want to make sure that’s in there.",
        "Oh, sure. That’s so funny. Lee Israel used to pretend to be her. She’s a real character. I got to meet Lee and she’s really cool.",
        "Since you didn’t with this movie, you should direct Melissa McCarthy in another movie.",
        "We both agree. Both Melissa and I would love to work together.",
        "You’re also doing a Kathryn Hahn project as well, and I’m shocked the two of you have never worked together.",
        "Right?",
        "Kathryn Hahn is such a Nicole Holofcener-type actress. She’s like another Catherine Keener for you. I’m surprised it’s taken this long.",
        "We both feel that way, too. It’s like, are we finally doing this?",
        "Is that weird, to hear that certain actresses feel like Nicole Holofcener actresses?",
        "No, it’s wonderful. Totally.",

        "WASHINGTON ― Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort pleaded guilty on Friday to two charges involving a wide range of criminal conduct as part of a plea deal and has agreed to cooperate with the special counsel probe being led by Robert Mueller.",
        "President Donald Trump has previously discussed pardoning Manafort with his attorneys, but an agreement to cooperate with Mueller’s team could put a potential pardon in jeopardy. Trump had previously stated his distaste for “flipping” and said it “almost ought to be” illegal.",
        "Trump’s lawyer in the investigation, Rudy Giuliani, said Manafort’s agreement to cooperate with prosecutors is of no consequence to Trump.",
        "“I can guarantee you he has no information harmful to the president,” he told HuffPost late Friday, adding that he knows precisely what Manafort can offer Mueller. “I know because we have a joint defense agreement. He’s not going to lie to make them happy.”",
        "“This has nothing to do with the president, nothing to do with obstruction, nothing to do with anything that they were charged to go after,” Giuliani added. “They’re obviously winding down.”",
        "Manafort, 69, appeared Friday in federal court in Washington, where he pleaded guilty to conspiracy against the United States and conspiracy to obstruct justice. The first charge covers a lot of criminal activity, including money laundering, tax fraud, failing to file reports about his foreign bank accounts, failing to register as a foreign agent and lying to the government.",
        "Manafort was found guilty on eight counts last month following a separate federal trial in Northern Virginia and still faced 10 additional counts there in addition to the charges he faced in Washington. The 10 counts in Virginia will be dropped as part of Manafort’s plea deal.",
        "The plea deal states that Manafort “shall cooperate fully, truthfully, completely, and forthrightly with the Government and other law enforcement authorities identified by the Government in any and all matters as to which the Government deems the cooperation relevant.”",
        "“This had absolutely nothing to do with the President or his victorious 2016 Presidential campaign,” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement about Manafort’s guilty plea. “It is totally unrelated.”",
        "Manafort will remain in custody, and a sentencing date still hasn’t been set. It’s unclear precisely what information Manafort could provide about Russian interference in the 2016 election, but he had close ties to the country and served as Trump’s campaign chairman during a key part of the campaign.",
        "Four former Trump aides have previously pleaded guilty to charges that stemmed from the Mueller investigation: Michael Flynn, Rick Gates, Michael Cohen and George Papadopoulos.",

        "When Michael Kors debuted his ready-to-wear collection for spring and summer 2019 at New York Fashion Week on Wednesday, some people recognized two very familiar articles of clothing that didn’t seem to belong.",
        "The designer included a black-and-gray hooded jacket and a sleeveless black, green, red and white version ― a design known in Mexican and U.S. Latinx culture as a jerga.",
        "Their inclusion in Kors’ collection is sparking cries of cultural appropriation. Many people online feel the jergas’ appearance in the show gives the impression that the designer just “discovered” them, and some are questioning the likely markup on the typically inexpensive item.",
        "Luis Urrieta, a professor of cultural studies in education at the University of Texas, Austin, elaborated on the jerga and its background in an email interview.",
        "Explaining that “jerga” can mean “cloth” or “rag” in Mexican Spanish, Urrieta said “the sweaters in the Michael Kors runway fashion show have been worn by mostly working class youth in Mexico and in US Latinx communities for a long time.”",
        "“They reflect more traditional ponchos and the patterns are similar to zarapes that have been worn in Indigenous communities for a very long time,” he continued.",
        "Urrieta explained why their inclusion in the Kors collection smacks of cultural appropriation. Indigenous and Native peoples, he said, “are often taken advantage of” when selling their “arts and designs out of necessity to make a living.”",
        "“They are not paid fairly for their jewelry, designs, embroidery, or articles of clothing while their products end up in fancy boutiques or marketed by fashion designers (such as Kors) in other places in the world at expensive prices,” Urrieta said.",
        "“So, this is a serious issue, which involves not just the outright theft of the items themselves, including by ‘buying’ these items at cheap prices, but also the theft of the knowledge bases of their origin,” Urrieta continued. “It is also a violation of the relational ways in which material culture is produced, and the purpose of the use of these items in communities.”",
        "The Michael Kors company did not immediately comment when reached."

        "Forecasters said wind speeds have dropped from a high of 140 mph to 110 mph, reducing it from a Category 4 storm to a Category 2, and additional fluctuations and weakening were likely as it swirled toward land. But authorities warned Florence has an enormous wind field that has been growing larger, raising the risk of the ocean surging on to land and making Florence extremely dangerous.",
        "“Do you want to get hit with a train or do you want to get hit with a cement truck?” said Jeff Byard, an administrator with the Federal Emergency Management Agency.",
        "The National Hurricane Center’s best guess was that Florence would blow ashore as early as Friday afternoon around the North Carolina-South Carolina line, then slog its rainy way westward with a potential for catastrophic inland flooding that could swamp homes, businesses and farm fields.",
        "About 5.25 million people live in areas under hurricane warnings or watches, and 4.9 million live in places covered by tropical storm warnings or watches, the National Weather Service said.",
        "Weather Underground meteorology director Jeff Masters said Florence eventually could strike as merely a Category 1 hurricane with winds less than 100 mph, but that’s still enough to cause at least $1 billion in damage. Water kills more people in hurricanes than wind, and he said it will still be an extremely dangerous storm for rain and storm surge.",
        "The hurricane center is forecasting the storm to hover near the coast Saturday with winds of around 80 mph before landfall, but with rainfall in the 20 to 30 inches range and up to 13 feet of storm surge.",

The hurricane center said Florence will approach the coast Friday and linger for a while before rolling ashore.",
        "It’s unclear exactly how many people fled, but more than 1.7 million people in the Carolinas and Virginia were warned to clear out. Airlines had canceled nearly 1,000 flights and counting. Home Depot and Lowe’s activated emergency response centers to get generators, trash bags and bottled water to stores before and after the storm. The two hardware chains said they sent in a total of around 1,100 trucks.",
        "Duke Energy, the nation’s No. 2 power company, said Florence could knock out electricity to three-quarters of its 4 million customers in the Carolinas, and outages could last for weeks. Workers are being brought in from the Midwest and Florida to help in the storm’s aftermath, it said.",

        "Forecasters worried the storm’s damage will be all the worse if it lingers on the coast. The trend is “exceptionally bad news,” said University of Miami hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy, since it “smears a landfall out over hundreds of miles of coastline, most notably the storm surge.”",
        "With South Carolina’s beach towns more in the bull’s-eye because of the shifting forecast, Ohio vacationers Chris and Nicole Roland put off their departure from North Myrtle Beach to get the maximum amount of time on the sand. Most other beachgoers were long gone.",

        "The return of military governance to Brazil could be justified in certain “hypothetical” scenarios, an Army general and far-right vice presidential candidate told HuffPost Brazil.",
        "Army Gen. Antônio Hamilton Mourão, who is running with right-wing presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil’s Oct. 7 elections, has suggested in earlier interviews that a military coup could be justified in a period of “anarchy.” He reiterated that view in the HuffPost Brazil interview, during which he contrasted the military to the band aboard the Titanic.",
        "“We discussed a hypothetical situation of chaos in the country,” Mourão said, referring to a previous interview with Brazil’s Globo news outlet. “When the Titanic sank, the orchestra continued playing and did nothing. So the armed forces cannot be playing while the Titanic sinks.”",
        "Asked to expand on whether that meant Bolsonaro could hand power to a military-led government, Mourão said: “I have nothing more to explain on this subject.”",
        "Brazil was ruled by an oppressive military regime from 1964-85, then began a transition back to democratic governance. A National Truth Commission report later found that the dictatorship had killed or was responsible for the disappearance of hundreds of political opponents and tortured thousands of others using techniques learned from British and American allies.",
        "Bolsonaro, a former Army parachutist and seven-term federal congressman from Rio de Janeiro, has praised the military dictatorship throughout his political career and suggested that Brazil could benefit from a return to Army rule. He has denied that the regime tortured political opponents and praised dictators like Augusto Pinochet, the Chilean general whose military junta was accused of murdering 3,000 people and torturing 40,000 others between 1973-90.",
        "In 2016, he dedicated his vote to impeach then-President Dilma Rousseff, a former anti-dictatorship guerilla, to the Army colonel who oversaw the program that tortured her.",
        "Mourão, meanwhile, suggested last year that the military could return to power if Brazil’s democratically elected officials failed to deal with the economic and political corruption crises that have plagued the country.",
        "Those crises have plunged Brazil’s economy into one of its deepest recessions and led to corruption allegations against hundreds of politicians, including former leftist President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and top leaders of Brazil’s traditionally centrist parties. They have also evaporated faith in the country’s democracy. Polls have shown that as many as two-thirds of Brazilians have no confidence in their political parties, legislature or president. Other surveys have shown declining faith in democracy itself and nostalgia for the era of military rule.",
        "Bolsonaro, who was stabbed during a campaign rally last week, has capitalized on the discontent and waged a nationalistic campaign that that has earned him the nickname “Brazil’s Trump” and propelled him to the top of election polls. These surveys have not included da Silva, who led in the polls before he banned from the race due to his July 2017 conviction on corruption charges.",
        "Brazil’s current president, Michel Temer of the center-right Democratic Movement Party, has failed to revive the economy and also faces bribery charges. With his approval ratings in the single digits, he is not seeking another term.",
        "Bolsonaro’s past support for the dictatorship, along with his racist, sexist and homophobic remarks and calls for violence against political opponents, has turned his bid for the presidency into one of the strongest tests of Brazil’s democratic institutions since its return to democratic rule.",
        "Mourão, in the interview with HuffPost Brazil, insisted that the prospect of a return to military rule was not imminent in the nation’s current state of “turbulence.” Bolsonaro, too, has said in recent interviews that he does not favor the outright return of military governance, and expressed a newfound commitment to democracy.",
        "Brazilian political observers say that a traditional military takeover is unlikely. Though coups were once common across Latin America, they are rare now. Rather, erosions of democracies tend to occur at the ballot box, thanks to candidates like Bolsonaro who undermine that form of government after they win office.",
        "“There have been very, very few military coups in Latin America over the last 35 years,” said Steven Levitsky, a Harvard University political scientist and author of How Democracies Die. “So I think that while increased public support for a military coup is troubling, it’s much more likely Brazilian democracy will die at the hands of an elected leader.”",
        "If elected, Bolsonaro will likely militarize Brazil’s government and society even without an outright return to military rule. He has promised to stack his cabinet with military officers. He has called for a larger role for the military in policing and public security in an attempt to appeal to voters who are demanding solutions to outbreaks of violent crime that have resulted in more than 60,000 homicides in each of the last two years.",
        "Bolsonaro has also called for giving police and military officers greater leeway to shoot and kill criminals, even though Brazilian law enforcement was already responsible for more than 4,000 killings last year.",
        "“He represents the possibility that the conservative forces of the armed forces don’t need to take power because he will act on their behalf,” James Green, the director of Brown University’s Brazil Initiative program, said in an interview last month.",
        "Polls released this week ― the first since Bolsonaro was stabbed and hospitalized last Thursday ― showed a modest bump for him and his right-wing Social Liberal Party and he is now considered a favorite to reach the second round, run-off phase of the election. But polls also have shown he would lose a head-to-head match-up against nearly every possible opponent in that Oct. 28 vote.",
        "If Bolsonaro does win, though, the emergence of a quasi-authoritarian in Latin America’s largest democratic nation could have ramifications across the region and the world, Levitsky said.",
        "“If Brazil falls, if Brazil goes authoritarian, I would worry a lot about the rest of the region,” he said. “People in Latin America ― militaries in Latin America, demagogues and democrats in Latin America ― will be paying close attention to Brazil. It would have devastating regional consequences.”"

        "VATICAN CITY (AP) — With the Catholic Church in crisis once again over clerical sex abuse and cover-up, Pope Francis will meet Thursday with U.S. cardinals and bishops who are demanding to know how one of their own was able to climb the clerical ranks despite allegations that he slept with seminarians.",
        "The Vatican said Tuesday that the U.S. delegation would be headed by Cardinal Daniel DiNardo, head of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, and also include Francis’ top sex abuse adviser, Cardinal Sean O’Malley.",
        "Di Nardo has said he wants Francis to authorize a full-fledged Vatican investigation into ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, who was removed as cardinal in July after a credible accusation that he groped a teenager.",
        "The Vatican has known since at least 2000 that McCarrick would invite seminarians to his New Jersey beach house and into his bed.",
        "And yet St. John Paul II made him archbishop of Washington and a cardinal in 2001, presumably because Vatican officials impressed by his fundraising prowess considered his past homosexual activity a mere “moral lapse” and not a gross abuse of power.",
        "DiNardo has also said recent accusations that top Vatican officials - including the current pope - covered up for McCarrick since 2000 deserve answers.",
        "Vatican spokesman Greg Burke said DiNardo and O’Malley would meet with Francis on Thursday in the Apostolic Palace. Also involved are two officials from the U.S. conference, Los Angeles Archbishop Jose Gomez and Monsignor Brian Bransfield, according to a Vatican statement.",
        "The summit recalls the April 2002 meeting John Paul called with the senior U.S. church leadership after the sex abuse scandal first exploded publicly in Boston. At the time, McCarrick served as the front-man for the U.S. delegation, acting as their spokesman, and then went on to serve prominently when U.S. bishops drafted their tough abuse norms the summer of 2002 in Dallas.",
        "In July, Francis ordered McCarrick, 88, to observe a lifetime of penance and prayer pending the outcome of a canonical trial into the groping allegation involving a teenage altar boy in the 1970s. After the allegation was publicized in June, it emerged that it was apparently an open secret - including at the Vatican - that McCarrick routinely molested seminarians and young priests and harassed them.",
        "The McCarrick scandal took on crisis proportions two weeks ago after the Vatican’s former U.S. ambassador, Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano, accused two dozen Vatican and U.S. cardinals and bishops by name of covering up for McCarrick.",
        "Specifically, Vigano accused Francis of rehabilitating McCarrick from canonical sanctions imposed on him by Pope Benedict XVI in 2009 or 2010. The Vatican hasn’t responded to the accusations, but presumably the “clarifications” it has promised will come sometime after Francis meets with the top U.S. church leadership this week.",
        "Francis has refused to comment directly about Vigano’s claims, but nearly every day over the past two weeks his homily at morning Mass has seemed somewhat related to the scandal.",
        "On Tuesday, he drew Satan into the fray, suggesting that the devil was behind Vigano’s revelations.",
        "“In these times, it seems like the ‘Great Accuser’ has been unchained and has it in for bishops,” he said. “True, we are all sinners, we bishops. He tries to uncover the sins, so they are visible in order to scandalize the people.”",
        "Bishops, he said, should be men of prayer, and should know they were chosen by God and keep close to their flock.",
        "In other eyebrow-raising comments Tuesday, a top aide to both Francis and Benedict said the sex abuse scandal was such a game-changing catastrophe for the church that it amounted to its “own 9/11.”",
        "Archbishop Georg Gaenswein told a book presentation that he by no means was comparing the scandal to the nearly 3,000 people killed in the U.S. 17 years ago Tuesday, on Sept. 11, 2001.",
        "But he said the years-long scandal, and recent revelations in the Pennsylvania grand jury report, showed just “how many souls have been wounded irrevocably and mortally by priests from the Catholic Church.”",
        "“Today, even the Catholic Church looks full of confusion at its own 9/11, at its own Sept. 11, even though this catastrophe isn’t associated with a single date but rather at so many days and years, and innumerable victims,” he said.",
        "While no one has attacked churches with airplanes full of passengers, Gaenswein said, recent news from the U.S. “sends a message that is even more terrible than the sudden collapse of all the churches of Pennsylvania together with the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington.”",
        "Gaenswein, who serves as secretary to Benedict and prefect of Francis’ papal household, was speaking at a presentation of a book by conservative American author Rod Dreher, who has been at the forefront in reporting on the McCarrick and Vigano scandals.",
        "Gaenswein recalled that during a 2008 trip to the U.S., Benedict spoke from the National Shrine to denounce the “profound shame” and pain that abuse had caused the Catholic community. Benedict is credited with having turned around the Vatican on the issue of sex abuse while he was cardinal, forcing bishops around the world to send all their cases to him for review because they weren’t sanctioning abusers.",
        "Gaenswein’s said Benedict’s admonition was “apparently in vain, as we see today.”",
        "“Neither the lament of the Holy Father nor the formal assurances and commitments pledged by a large part of the hierarchy has been able to contain the evil,” he said."

        "Authorities in recent months have ratcheted up pressure on religious groups, destroying crosses, burning bibles, shutting churches and ordering followers to renounce their faith.",
        "The campaign is part of a drive to “Sinicize” religion by demanding loyalty to the officially atheist Communist Party and leader Xi Jinping. Observers call it the most severe crackdown since religious freedom was written into the Chinese constitution in 1982.",
        "Chinese law requires religious believers to worship only in congregations registered with the authorities and bans most religious observance in private homes.",
        "All of China’s officially recognized religions appear to have been affected by the crackdown. In the northwestern region of Xinjiang, an estimated 1 million Uighurs and other members of Muslim minority groups have been arbitrarily detained in indoctrination camps where they are forced to denounce Islam and profess loyalty to the party.",

        "The far-right Alternative for Germany party released a new campaign poster last week with a slogan promising “Islam-free schools” beneath a photo of smiling white schoolchildren.",
        "Alternative for Germany, also known as AfD, released the posters in the midst of its election campaign in the southern German state of Bavaria. Recent polls show the party is on track to win the third-largest share of the vote as it saps votes from the traditional conservative party aligned with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.",
        "But as AfD rallies voters ahead of Bavaria’s elections next month, the party is under intense public and political scrutiny for its links to neo-Nazi organizations and role in encouraging far-right riots in recent weeks.",
        "AfD’s Bavarian anti-Islam posters have added to the backlash against the party. A German teachers’ associations called the posters dangerous, and an Austrian member of the European Parliament accused the party of promoting fascist rhetoric and racially segregated schools. A British hate crime monitoring group also denounced the poster, tweeting, “Welcome to the new face of fascism.”",
        "AfD claims that the posters are not calling for barring Muslim children from schools, Germany’s Der Spiegel reports, but are opposed to Islamic education in schools and face veils. But some Germans on social media criticized the posters for echoing Nazi-era discrimination against Jewish students, HuffPost Germany reported.",
        "The party has a history of anti-Islamic propaganda, and during last year’s national elections it worked with a conservative American ad agency to create a controversial series of posters, including one reading “Burkas? We prefer bikinis” and another with a photo of a pregnant white woman with the tagline “New Germans? We’ll make them ourselves.”",
        "Although AfD is often careful to distance itself from more politically toxic extremist groups and violent rhetoric, it has repeatedly provoked scandals after its officials made statements downplaying the Holocaust or siding with far-right activists. After anti-migrant riots erupted after the killing of a German man in the city of Chenmitz two weeks ago, a prominent AfD official marched with the founder of anti-Islamic extremist group PEGIDA in a demonstration against migration.",
        "While AfD is still shut out of governing in Germany, its success has caused traditional right politicians to swing farther right in hopes of winning back voters, especially prevalent in Bavaria, where the Merkel-allied Christian Social Union is losing support and increasingly embracing anti-immigration, anti-Islamic views.",
        "CSU leader Horst Seehofer nearly brought down the German government this year after demanding tighter border controls, and more recently he called immigration the “mother of all political problems” and said he would have joined far-right anti-migrant protests were he not an elected official. Bavaria’s CSU premier ordered that crucifixes be hung in all government buildings, and the party last year drafted a law banning full-face veils in public places.",
        "Much like in several other countries where establishment parties mimic the far right, most recently Sweden, the CSU’s shift hasn’t worked, and the party is expected to lose its absolute majority government in a state where it once dominated."

        "Sweden’s Social Democrats are one of the most successful political parties in modern history, winning the highest share of the vote in every national election for the past 100 years. But on Sunday, the once-dominant party scored its worst election result in generations. Its decline is a symptom of when liberal parties let radical-right populists dictate the political agenda.",
        "The Social Democrats won a little over 28 percent of the vote, the most of any party but far short of giving their center-left bloc a majority. Meanwhile, the far-right Sweden Democrats won 17.6 percent of the vote in its best ever result. An exit poll showed that almost a fifth of the far-right voters cast their ballots for the Social Democrats the last election.",
        "The result gives no party a clear route to forming a government, leaves the country politically fragmented and means that the ruling Social Democrats could potentially lose power.",
        "The liberal party’s losses are at least partly self-inflicted. Faced with growing support for the Sweden Democrats, the Social Democrats focused much of their campaign on issues such as immigration and crime, where the far-right controls the narrative. And rather than countering the Sweden Democrats’ anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant rhetoric with a vision of their own, the liberals shifted to the right with proposals that included sending the army into neighborhoods with high crime rates.",
        "“They adopted the [Sweden Democrats’] agenda because they were afraid of losing voters,” said Ulf Bjereld, a professor at Gothenburg University and an active member of the Social Democrats.",
        "“It was a political mistake.”",
        "The Sweden Democrats, which have origins in the neo-Nazi movement, have spent years telling Swedes that their country is in crisis. The party blames hordes of migrants for breaking the country’s beloved welfare state, bringing in crime and threatening Swedish identity.",
        "That message has resonated with a growing number of people in recent years, as concerns rose over high-profile incidents of gang violence, an influx of refugees and regional economic inequality. Even some of their radical proposals and views found their way into the public debate. In June, a lawmaker’s comments that Jews and indigenous people don’t count as true Swedes received widespread attention. Similarly, the party’s proposal to only take in asylum-seekers from Nordic nations is a de facto ban on refugees that goes against Sweden’s history as one of the world’s most humanitarian nations.",
        "The far-right party further benefited from establishment parties’ lack of attention to its rhetoric. That silence, experts say, created an information vacuum that the Sweden Democrats filled with anti-migrant, ethnonationalist views",
        "“If nobody is talking about stuff that people see as problems, the only answers and understanding that they’re going to have are the ones offered by the populist parties. That’s what you basically had in Sweden,” said Sheri Berman, a professor of politics at Barnard College.",
        "The far-right’s claims, experts say, often did not match reality. Although Sweden has real struggles with regional inequality, social change and increasing violence, overall crime rates have dropped, the country is witnessing the highest economic growth in decades and income has increased across the board. The number of killings has risen in recent years, but there were still only 113 murders last year out of a population of nearly 10 million people, and there have been similar peaks since the government began reporting those statistics in 2002. As for Sweden Democrats’ warning of the “Islamization” of Sweden, the average Swede vastly overestimates the percentage of the population that is Muslim.",
        "When the Social Democrats finally did address public concerns over immigration and crime during the campaign earlier this year, the party mimicked many of the talking points and policies of the far-right. The government’s finance minister suggested refugees seek another country in which to claim asylum, while Prime Minister Stefan Löfven announced that the country would crack down on criminals, and the party declared that emergency border security laws from the height of the refugee crisis would be kept in place indefinitely.",
        "But embracing more conservative policies backfired ― support for the Social Democrats dropped even further, and one member of the Swedish parliament resigned from the party in protest.",
        "“A strategy that was tried to win back voters from the Sweden Democrats meant that the Social Democrats fell even more,” said Bjereld.",
        "“The parties who have been true to their ideological grounds ― they are the only parties who have raised in support.”",
        "That same scenario has played out similarly in countries across Europe, where traditional left and right parties have employed similar strategies to regain voters from populist parties, largely without success.",
        "“What happens is that xenophobia, racism, anti-immigration ideas become more recognized and legitimate ... because the big parties, the power-holding parties are jumping on them,” said Emilia Palonen, an expert on populism at the University of Helsinki.",
        "“These mainstream parties should be bringing in new issues, new excitement into politics, and instead they’re following.”",
        "Rather than copying the far-right’s emotional appeals toward identity and its criticism of the state, mainstream parties should offer voters fresh alternatives, Berman said.",
        "“[If] center-left parties can’t come up with a better narrative, a better set of policies, a way of making this work, then they are screwed.”"

        "A hard-line anti-immigrant party is poised for a big win in Sweden’s elections Sunday, seemingly signaling another dramatic shift toward the far right in Europe in a historic liberal bastion.",
        "The Sweden Democrats say their rise is because nations like theirs have been overwhelmed by foreigners, particularly after more than 2 million flowed into Europe since 2015 in the biggest wave of refugees since World War II. But new research suggests that line might be as misleading as the stories the party’s supporters have pumped out on social media about immigrant behavior.",
        "Instead, the party’s success is strongly associated with a factor foreigners had little control over: the policy choices of Sweden’s native politicians, according to a recently released paper by five economists that draws on data about Sweden Democrat candidates and voters.",
        "The experts point to a double whammy. In 2006, a new center-right government took aim at Sweden’s famed welfare state, reducing unemployment, sickness and disability benefits to finance tax cuts, and sparking a sharp and sustained increase in income inequality. Come 2008, the global financial crisis hit, causing big job losses, particularly among people who had already become less secure in the labor market.",
        "“People mostly look at the radical right from the angle of external shocks, like trade [with foreign workers proving cheaper than domestic ones] and globalization… the point that you might take away from our paper is the effect of austerity policy,” said Johanna Rickne, one of the co-authors of the report and a professor at Stockholm University.",
        "The first election after the events the researchers focus on, held in 2010, marked the first time the Sweden Democrats scored enough votes to enter Sweden’s parliament. In the next election, they more than doubled their vote share.",
        "What the party relied on, the researchers show, was the increasing pain of “outsiders” ― people, primarily working-class men with lower levels of education, who had little stable employment and relied heavily on government benefits. The Sweden Democrats also attracted particular “vulnerable insiders” whose jobs were especially likely to be outsourced or otherwise obliterated by the market, perhaps because of technological change.",
        "Those groups of “relative economic losers” also provided a disproportionately high number of the party’s electoral candidates compared with Sweden’s other parties. The result was that the two groups became tightly tied to a foreigner-bashing party that had been around, but was not a major force, since 1988, after emerging from neo-Nazi circles.",
        "“If you are yourself doing worse and worse, relative to others, and your income is stagnating or even declining year after year compared to people with stable employment… people are prone to thinking immigrants are taking resources rather than understanding tax and spending policy,” Rickne said.",
        "In the years since, Sweden’s economy has become one of the fastest-growing in Europe. Swedes who are “insiders” have done better and better. But inequality has continued to flourish ― and so have the Sweden Democrats. The country’s top parties on the center-left and center-right have shown little interest in reconsidering the tax cuts package of 2006 or other steps toward expanded redistribution. Even the social spending promises of the main liberal party, the Social Democrats, focus on universal benefits rather than those targeted at, say, the “outsiders.”",
        "That seeming callousness ― and the economic changes in the first place ― are the reason many voters became distrustful and were inspired to thumb their nose at the Swedish establishment. With that as a priority, those voters respected the Sweden Democrats’ determination to criticize politicians’ general consensus on welcoming immigrants, the paper argues, perceiving that as a way to tackle Sweden’s own elites as much as (or perhaps more than) foreigners. The often harsh and targeted rhetoric matters, then, but not just because of voters’ racial animus.",
        "Voters have stuck with the party as it has focused on immigration restrictions, saying little about reversing the policies of the mid-2000s and instead adopting standard fiscally conservative talk about the value of tax cuts and arguing having fewer immigrants will preserve the welfare state. And the researchers found that those groups’ continued support for the Sweden Democrats does not seem linked to direct exposure to immigrants or demographic changes in their own communities.",
        "Sound familiar? Other developed economies that are growing richer but also more unequal have seen similar developments. A different study released this year found links between politically imposed austerity in the United Kingdom and support for the immigrant-baiting party that promoted Brexit, the paper notes. In Finland, a radical right party has made gains after painful spending cuts even though the country has experienced minuscule amounts of immigration.",
        "Factors other than economic anxiety remain central to the popularity and conduct of anti-immigrant parties like the Sweden Democrats.",
        "“Our paper doesn’t provide 100 percent of the explanation,” Rickne said.",
        "But it’s attracting attention in Sweden and abroad ― and has undeniable value in showing what rival politicians and others upset about the hard-right’s growth need to understand and address.",
        "“I find their results interesting and intuitively reasonable,” Niklas Bolin of Mid Sweden University told HuffPost in an email, noting that the study departs from much other research directly tying increased anti-immigration views to increased support for the far right.",
        "A central question that remains is whether voters like these support parties because they purport to be anti-establishment, by departing from elite views on immigration or other issues, or if economic insecurity directly makes people more likely to decide they are upset about foreigners.",
        "“One plausible hypothesis is that those voters who are economically less well-off also [are] more receptive to anti-immigration messages,” Bolin wrote.",
        "At least some clues likely lie in Sunday’s results and the aftermath: what the Sweden Democrats do with their newfound power and how their supporters react."

The official, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the case, agreed to give details of the operation only on condition of anonymity.",

Dozens of students of the institute in Italy say they were similarly abused for decades, some allegedly by Corradi.",
        "The Vatican knew about Corradi since at least 2009, when the Italian Provolo students went public with tales of abuse and named names. The Vatican ordered an investigation and sanctioned four accused priests, but Corradi apparently never was sanctioned for his alleged crimes in Italy.",
        "The Verona diocese apologized to the Italian students in 2012. After the students again named Corradi as an abuser living in Pope Francis’ native Argentina in a 2014 letter to the pontiff and the Verona bishop, the Vatican still took no action. In 2016, a Vatican official said Francis wanted to assure the victims that the church was taking measures to protect children and prevent sexual abuse.",
        "Unlike the Verona case, the statute of limitations has not expired for the alleged crimes in Mendoza, which could lead to prison sentences of up to 50 years for a conviction."

        "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un reaffirmed his commitment to a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula and to the suspension of all future long-range missile tests, while also expressing faith in an increasingly embattled President Donald Trump’s efforts to settle a nuclear impasse, South Korean officials and the North’s official media said Thursday.",
        "Kim also reportedly expressed frustration with outside skepticism about his nuclear disarmament intentions and demanded that his “goodwill measures” be met in kind.",
        "The trove of comments from Kim was filtered through his propaganda specialists in Pyongyang and the South Korean government, which is keen on keeping engagement alive. They come amid a growing standoff with the United States on how to proceed with diplomacy meant to settle a nuclear dispute that had many fearing war last year.",
        "Only hours earlier, a South Korean delegation returned from talks with Kim where they set up a summit for Sept. 18-20 in Pyongyang between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in, their third meeting since April.",
        "Each statement reportedly made by Kim will be parsed for clues about the future of the nuclear diplomacy. His reported commitment to a nuclear-free Korea, for instance, wasn’t new information — Kim has repeatedly declared similar intentions before — but it allows hopes to rise that negotiators can get back on track after the recriminations that followed Kim’s meeting in June with Trump in Singapore.",
        "The impasse between North Korea and the United States, with neither side seemingly willing to make any substantive move, has generated widespread skepticism over Trump’s claims that Kim will really dismantle his nuclear weapons program.",
        "“Chairman Kim Jong Un has made it clear several times that he is firmly committed to denuclearization, and he expressed frustration over skepticism in the international community over his commitment,” Chung Eui-yong, Moon’s national security adviser and the head of the South Korean delegation to Pyongyang, told reporters on Seoul on Thursday. “He said he’s pre-emptively taken steps necessary for denuclearization and wants to see these goodwill measures being met with goodwill measures. ”",
        "Chung reported Kim as saying that work to dismantle the only engine-test site in the country “means a complete suspension of future long-range ballistic missile tests.” Kim said he’d take “more active” measures toward denuclearization if his moves are met with corresponding goodwill measures, Chung said.",
        "Kim told Chung he still had faith in Trump despite diplomatic setbacks, and emphasized that he has not once talked negatively about Trump to anyone, including his closest advisers.",
        "Kim also said an end-of-war declaration that Seoul and Pyongyang have been pushing Washington to sign off on wouldn’t weaken the U.S.-South Korean alliance or lead to the withdrawal of the 28,500 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea to prevent North Korean attack, according to Chung.",
        "The summit later this month between Kim and Moon, the driving force behind the current diplomacy, will be a crucial indicator of whether larger nuclear negotiations with the United States will proceed.",
        "Moon is seen as eager to keep the diplomacy alive in part so that he can advance his ambitious engagement plans with the North, which would need U.S. backing to succeed. The inter-Korean summit comes on the eve of a gathering of world leaders at the United Nations in New York at the end of September, but Seoul said Thursday that it was unlikely Kim would attend. Seoul has indicated an interest in Kim and Trump meeting in New York, and Trump, who is facing growing domestic turmoil, has hinted that another summit could happen.",
        "While pushing ahead with summits and inter-Korean engagement, Seoul is trying to persuade Washington and Pyongyang to proceed with peace and denuclearization processes at the same time so they can overcome a growing dispute over the sequencing of the diplomacy.",
        "Seoul and Pyongyang both want a declaration to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War. U.S. officials have insisted that a peace declaration, which many see as a precursor to the North eventually calling for the removal of all U.S. troops from the Korean Peninsula, cannot come before North Korea takes more concrete action toward abandoning its nuclear weapons. Such steps may include providing an account of the components of its nuclear program, allowing outside inspections and giving up a certain number of its nuclear weapons during the early stages of the negotiations.",
        "The Korean War ended with an armistice, leaving the peninsula technically still at war. Moon has made an end-of-war declaration an important premise of his peace agenda with North Korea.",
        "While an end-of-war declaration wouldn’t imply a legally binding peace treaty, experts say it could create political momentum that would make it easier for North Korea to steer the discussions toward a peace regime, diplomatic recognition, economic benefits and security concessions.",
        "After their June summit in Singapore, Trump and Kim issued a vague statement about a nuclear-free peninsula without describing when and how it would occur. Post-summit nuclear negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang were rocky and quickly settled into a stalemate.",
        "North Korea has accused the United States of making “unilateral and gangster-like” demands for denuclearization and holding back on the end-of-war declaration.",
        "Trump called off a planned visit to North Korea by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last month, citing insufficient progress in denuclearization.",
        "The two past inter-Korean summits in April and May removed war fears and initiated a global diplomatic push that culminated with the meeting between Kim and Trump in June. But Moon faces tougher challenges heading into his third meeting with Kim, with the stalemate in nuclear negotiations between Pyongyang and Washington raising fundamental questions about Kim’s supposed willingness to abandon his nuclear weapons."

        "More than 1,600 people have perished or vanished en route to Europe this year, mostly while attempting to cross by sea from north Africa, according to a UNHCR report.",
        "The publication of the report, “Desperate Journeys,” coincides with the third anniversary of the death of Alan Kurdi, a Syrian refugee boy whose body washed up on a Turkish beach at the height of the migrant crisis, sparking global outrage.",
        "Although arrivals have plummeted in recent years, European countries remain bitterly divided over how to share the burden of refugees and migrants fleeing war, persecution and poverty in the Middle East, Africa and Asia.",
        "“This report once again confirms the Mediterranean as one of the world’s deadliest sea crossings,” said Pascale Moreau, Director of the UNHCR’s Europe Bureau.",
        "“With the number of people arriving on European shores falling, this is no longer a test of whether Europe can manage the numbers, but whether Europe can muster the humanity to save lives.”",
        "The UNHCR said about 72,000 people had arrived in Italy, Greece and Spain between January and July, compared to about 121,000 for the same period in 2017. More than 1 million arrived in 2015.",
        "However, one in 18 who attempted the risky central Mediterranean route died or went missing, up from one in 42 in the first part of last year.",
        "The top countries of origin this year are Syria, Iraq and Guinea. Last year they were Nigeria, Guinea and Ivory Coast.",
        "The report said a key reason for the increased death rate was the reduced search and rescue capacity off the Libyan coast.",
        "Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that operated there last year have largely been replaced by the Libyan Coast Guard. The report said rescues often happened further out to sea, meaning refugees were traveling for longer on unsafe boats.",
        "Italy’s new populist government has meanwhile refused to let a number of NGO rescue vessels dock and is demanding the European Union find other ports to disembark migrants.",
        "The UNHCR urged European countries to ensure a predictable, regional approach for rescues and disembarkation.",
        "It also called for states to increase resettlement places for refugees and remove obstacles to family reunification so that people do not risk their lives at sea.",
        "Overall, arrivals in Italy fell in the first seven months of 2018, compared to the same period last year, while arrivals rose in Greece and Spain, now the primary entry point to Europe."

    "articleContent": [
        "Conservationists have discovered the carcasses of 90 elephants in Botswana over the past two months, sparking fears of a poaching boom in a country that has traditionally been a safe haven for tens of thousands of the gentle giants.",
        "Poachers appeared to be targeting male elephants older than 35, killing them near watering spots and hacking off their tusks, said Mike Chase, a conservation biologist who founded the environmental group Elephants Without Borders. Six white rhinos have also been killed, he said.",
        "The scale of poaching is “by far the largest I have seen or read about in Africa to date,” Chase told HuffPost in a statement. “Each day we are counting dead elephants.”",
        "Elephants Without Borders said it discovered the slain animals as part of an ongoing census of the pachyderms within Botswana that began in mid-July. The country has long been a refuge for more than a third of Africa’s remaining elephants, or about 130,000, thanks to its strict environmental protection that, until recently, gave its conservation forces the authority to shoot suspected poachers on sight.",
        "The slain elephants were “presumably carrying the heaviest tusks in the region of 60-70 pounds or even larger,” said Chase, who spearheaded a two-year Great Elephant Census to count every elephant on the African continent. “A clear order has been put out for tusks of a specific weight, and I suspect such large ivory is in heavy demand, considering that there are few large tuskers left in Africa.”",
        "He said the poachers “appear to be targeting elephant bulls when they come down to drink at seasonal pans.”",
        "The photo below may be disturbing to some readers.",
        "Kelly Landen, program manager for Elephants Without Borders, said the group had been flying since July 10 for the elephant survey in partnership with Botswana’s Department of Wildlife and National Parks, which contracts the group to conduct surveys every four years, according to National Geographic.",
        "But the Botswanan government is pushing back against the survey findings as “false and misleading.” A majority of the carcasses documented by Elephants Without Borders “were not poached but rather died from natural causes and retaliatory killings as a result of human and wildlife conflict,” the government said in a statement.",
        "The government also sought to distance the slaughter from its decision to disarm its anti-poaching force earlier this year without explanation. The team previously operated with the authority to shoot poachers on sight, and at least 52 had been killed over the past two decades, according to The Southern Times.",
        "“The Government of Botswana wishes to state that it is unfortunate that some media reports attribute the rise in elephant poaching primarily to the withdrawal of weapons from the Department of Wildlife and National Parks (DWNP) anti-poaching unit,” the government said on its Facebook page. “The fact of the matter is that the withdrawal of such weapons from DWNP, did not in any way affect the effectiveness and operations of the anti-poaching units.”",
        "Chase suggested to the BBC this week that the change encourages poachers to set their sights on Botswana’s wildlife, as neighboring countries have already seen their elephant populations reduced “to the verge of local extinction.”",
        "“People did warn us of an impending poaching problem and we thought we were prepared for it,” Chase told the outlet. “The poachers are now turning their guns to Botswana. We have the world’s largest elephant population and it’s open season for poachers.”"

        "Weeks after issuing a public apology for baselessly calling a British cave diver a “pedo guy,” Tesla founder Elon Musk has ramped up his attacks on Vernon Unsworth, labeling the diver a “child rapist” without providing any evidence.",
        "Musk’s renewed attacks on Unsworth, 63, who was involved in the July rescue of a youth soccer team in a Thailand cave, were sent to BuzzFeed reporter Ryan Mac last week in two separate emails.",
        "In the first, sent on Aug. 30, Musk lambasted the reporter as a “fucking asshole” before describing Unsworth as an “old, single white guy from England who’s been traveling to or living in Thailand for 30 to 40 years” and who has a “child bride who was about 12 years old at the time.”",
        "“I suggest that you call people you know in Thailand, find out what’s actually going on and stop defending child rapists,” Musk wrote.",
        "BuzzFeed said it “could find no evidence to support [these claims], and Musk did not provide any documentation to support his accusations.” No criminal records for Unsworth were uncovered in the U.K., the outlet added. BuzzFeed said it contacted the diver’s 40-year-old girlfriend, who said she’d been dating Unsworth for seven years.",
        "Musk confirmed to The Guardian on Tuesday that he had sent the two emails to BuzzFeed, though neither he nor Tesla provided additional comment.",
        "The acrimony between Musk and Unsworth began in July, when the diver criticized the tech entrepreneur’s attempts to build a mini-submarine to aid in the cave rescue.",
        "“He can stick his submarine where it hurts,” Unsworth told CNN at the time. “It just had absolutely no chance of working. He had no conception of what the cave passage was like.”",
        "Musk responded to the rebuke with defiance. “We will make one of the mini-sub/pod going all the way to Cave 5 no problemo,” he wrote in a tweet. “Sorry pedo guy, you really did ask for it.” (The mini-submarine was ultimately built, but was deemed “not practical” for the rescue operation by Thai officials. In his second email to BuzzFeed last week, Musk again defended the mini-sub, saying it was “total BS” for Unsworth to suggest it would not fit in the cave.)",
        "Musk’s “pedo” claim, made without a shred of evidence, sparked intense backlash, and rattled Tesla investors and board members. The tech magnate eventually offered a half-hearted apology and deleted the inflammatory tweet.",
        "Musk has been dogged by other recent controversies, including a now-abandoned effort to take Tesla private.",
        "Last week, however, two days before his emails to BuzzFeed, Musk doubled down on his attacks on Unsworth, suggesting in a tweet that the diver was, in fact, a pedophile.",
        "“You don’t think it’s strange he hasn’t sued me? He was offered free legal services,” Musk wrote, referring to Unworth’s earlier threat to take legal action.",
        "Unsworth’s lawyer said the diver sent a letter warning Musk about defamation on Aug. 6 ― several weeks before his Twitter retort, according to BuzzFeed.",
        "He wrote in his first email to BuzzFeed: “I fucking hope that [Unsworth] sues me.”",
        "He may get his wish. Unsworth’s attorney told The Guardian on Tuesday that his client was moving ahead with a lawsuit against Musk.",
        "“Elon Musk’s campaign of publishing vile and false accusations against Mr. Unsworth is inexcusable,” the lawyer said. “Musk hopes to be sued and he deserves to be sued. He will be.”"

        "YANGON (Reuters) ― A Myanmar judge on Monday found two Reuters journalists guilty of breaching a law on state secrets and jailed them for seven years, in a landmark case seen as a test of progress toward democracy in the Southeast Asian country.\n\nYangon northern district judge Ye Lwin said that Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, had breached the colonial-era Official Secrets Act when they collected and obtained confidential documents.\n\n“The defendants ... have breached Official Secrets Act section 3.1.c, and are sentenced to seven years,” the judge said, adding that the time served since they were detained on Dec. 12 would be taken into account. The defense can appeal the decision to the regional court and then the supreme court.",
        "The two reporters had pleaded not guilty and told the court that police had planted documents on them in the course of their work in reporting on Myanmar’s violence-plagued Rakhine State.\n\nPress freedom advocates, the United Nations, the European Union and countries, including the United States, Canada and Australia, had called for the journalists’ acquittal.\n\n“Today is a sad day for Myanmar, Reuters journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, and the press everywhere,” Reuters editor in chief Stephen J. Adler said in a statement.\n\n“We will not wait while Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo suffer this injustice and will evaluate how to proceed in the coming days, including whether to seek relief in an international forum,” Adler said.\n\nThe reporters had told the court that two police officials handed them papers at a restaurant in the city of Yangon moments before other officers arrested them.\n\nOne police witness testified that the restaurant meeting was a set-up to entrap the journalists to block or punish them for their reporting of a mass killing of Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine.\n\nAt least 50 people were packed into the small court Monday, with many standing outside. Judge Ye Lwin read out a summary of witness testimony for about an hour before delivering his verdict.\n\nHe said it had been found that “confidential documents” found on the two would have been useful “to enemies of the state and terrorist organizations.” Documents in their possession and on their phones were “not public information”.",
        "As the judge spoke, several reporters cried as they took notes.\n\nKyaw Soe Oo’s wife, Chit Su Win, burst into tears after the verdict, and family members had to support her as she left the court.\n\nWa Lone shook hands with supporters, telling them not to worry. Wearing handcuffs and flanked by police, he addressed a cluster of friends and reporters.\n\n“We know what we did,” he said. “We know we did nothing wrong. I have no fear. I believe in justice, democracy and freedom.”\n\nKyaw Soe Oo also said the reporters had committed no crime and that they would maintain their fight for press freedom.\n\n“What I want to say to the government is, you can put us in jail, but do not close the eyes and ears of the people,” he said.\n\nWa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo – who both have young daughters and have not seen their families outside of prison visits and court hearings for nearly nine months – were then taken back to prison.\n\nKyaw Soe Oo has a 3-year-old daughter and Wa Lone’s wife, Pan Ei Mon, gave birth to their first child last month.\n\nMyanmar government spokesman Zaw Htay didn’t respond to requests for comment about the verdict. He has mostly declined to comment throughout the proceedings, saying the courts were independent and the case would be conducted according to the law.\n\nThe verdict comes amid mounting pressure on the government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi over a security crackdown sparked by attacks by Rohingya Muslim insurgents on security forces in August 2017.\n\nMore than 700,000 stateless Rohingya Muslims have fled across western Myanmar’s border with Bangladesh since then, according to U.N. agencies.",
        "U.S. ambassador Scot Marciel, who attended the hearing, said he was sad for the two reporters and for Myanmar.\n\n“It’s deeply troubling ... one has to ask will this process increase or decrease the confidence the people of Myanmar have in their justice system,” Marciel told reporters.\n\nU.N. Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Myanmar Knut Ostby said he was disappointed.\n\n“The United Nations has consistently called for the release of the Reuters journalists and urged the authorities to respect their right to pursue freedom of expression and information.”\n\nBritish ambassador Dan Chugg, speaking on behalf of EU members, said the verdict had “dealt a hammer blow for the rule of law”.\n\nThe reporters were arrested on Dec. 12 while investigating the killing of 10 Rohingya men and boys and other abuses involving soldiers and police in Inn Din, a village in Rakhine State.\n\nMyanmar has denied allegations of atrocities made by refugees against its security forces, saying it conducted a legitimate counterinsurgency operation against Muslim militants.\n\nBut the military acknowledged the killing of the 10 Rohingya at Inn Din after arresting the Reuters reporters.\n\nA U.N mandated fact-finding mission said last week that Myanmar’s military carried out mass killings and gang rapes of Muslim Rohingya with “genocidal intent” and called for top generals to be prosecuted. Myanmar rejected the findings.\n\nThe International Criminal Court is considering whether it has jurisdiction over events in Rakhine, while the United States, the European Union and Canada have sanctioned Myanmar military and police officers over the crackdown.\n\n(Additional reporting by Antoni Slodkowski, Shoon Naing, Aye Min Thant; Writing by Robert Birsel; Editing by Clarence Fernandez and Philip McClellan)"

        "WASHINGTON (Reuters) ― The U.S. military said it has made a final decision to cancel $300 million in aid to Pakistan that had been suspended over Islamabad’s perceived failure to take decisive action against militants, in a new blow to deteriorating ties.",
        "The so-called Coalition Support Funds were part of a broader suspension in aid to Pakistan announced by President Donald Trump at the start of the year, when he accused Pakistan of rewarding past assistance with “nothing but lies & deceit.”",
        "The Trump administration says Islamabad is granting safe haven to insurgents who are waging a 17-year-old war in neighboring Afghanistan, a charge Pakistan denies.",
        "But U.S. officials had held out the possibility that Pakistan could win back that support if it changed its behavior.",
        "U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, in particular, had an opportunity to authorize $300 million in CSF funds through this summer ― if he saw concrete Pakistani actions to go after insurgents. Mattis chose not to, a U.S. official told Reuters.",
        "“Due to a lack of Pakistani decisive actions in support of the South Asia Strategy the remaining $300 (million) was reprogrammed,” Pentagon spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Kone Faulkner said.",
        "Faulkner said the Pentagon aimed to spend the $300 million on “other urgent priorities” if approved by Congress. He said another $500 million in CSF was stripped by Congress from Pakistan earlier this year, to bring the total withheld to $800 million.",
        "The disclosure came ahead of an expected visit by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the top U.S. military officer, General Joseph Dunford, to Islamabad. Mattis told reporters on Tuesday that combating militants would be a “primary part of the discussion.”",
        "Experts on the Afghan conflict, America’s longest war, argue that militant safe havens in Pakistan have allowed Taliban-linked insurgents in Afghanistan a place to plot deadly strikes and regroup after ground offensives.",
        "The Pentagon’s decision showed that the United States, which has sought to change Pakistani behavior, is still increasing pressure on Pakistan’s security apparatus.",
        "It also underscored that Islamabad has yet to deliver the kind of change sought by Washington.",
        "“It is a calibrated, incremental ratcheting up of pressure on Pakistan,” said Sameer Lalwani, co-director of the South Asia program at the Stimson Center think tank in Washington.",
        "Reuters reported in August that the Trump administration has quietly started cutting scores of Pakistani officers from coveted training and educational programs that have been a hallmark of bilateral military relations for more than a decade.",
        "The Pentagon made similar determinations on CSF in the past but this year’s move could get more attention from Islamabad, and its new prime minister, Imran Khan, at a time when its economy is struggling.",
        "Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves have plummeted over the past year and it will soon decide on whether to seek a bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or friendly nations such as China.",
        "“They are squeezing them when they know that they’re vulnerable and it is probably a signal about what to expect should Pakistan come to the IMF for a loan,” Lalwani said. The United States has the largest share of votes at the IMF.",
        "Khan, who once suggested he might order the shooting down of U.S. drones if they entered Pakistani airspace, has opposed the United States’ open-ended presence in Afghanistan. In his victory speech, he said he wanted “mutually beneficial” relations with Washington.",
        "A Pakistani official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said he was unaware of a formal notification of the U.S. decision on assistance but said one was expected by the end of September.",
        "Pakistan has received more than $33 billion in U.S. assistance since 2002, including more than $14 billion in CSF, a U.S. Defense Department program to reimburse allies that have incurred costs in supporting counter-insurgency operations.",
        "Pakistan could again be eligible next year for CSF.",

        "Tuilaepa Sailele delivered his no-holds-barred address at the Lowy Institute, a think-tank in Sydney, Australia, on Thursday. He called on Australia’s leaders to do more to reduce their carbon footprint and singled out the United States, India and China — the world’s three largest carbon dioxide emitters — as the countries most responsible for “all this disaster,” The Guardian reported.",
        "“Any leader of those countries who believes that there is no climate change, I think he ought to be taken to mental confinement. He is utterly stupid,” said Sailele, who has served as Samoa’s prime minister since 1998. “I say the same thing for any leader here who says there is no climate change.”",
        "U.S. President Donald Trump in the past termed climate change a “hoax,” and also as a Chinese invention. Trump provoked global condemnation last year when he chose to withdraw the United States from the landmark Paris climate agreement.",
        "In Australia, Scott Morrison, the newly elected prime minister, has been facing pressure by some lawmakers to abandon the country’s Paris agreement pledges, local outlet ABC News noted.",
        "Sailele said in his speech that climate change is the “single greatest threat to the livelihood, security and well-being” of peoples of the Pacific.",
        "Samoa and other Pacific islands are already feeling the effects of global warming, he noted. Several smaller islands in the region have been swallowed up in recent years because of rising sea levels.",
        "“While climate change may be considered a slow onset threat by some in our region, its adverse impacts are already felt by our Pacific islands peoples and communities,” Sailele said. “Pacific island countries continue to urge faster action [to reduce global warming] by all countries.”",
        "The Samoan leader said “political guts” will be needed to address the critical global issue.",
        "“We all know the problem, we all know the solutions, and all that is left would be some political courage, some political guts, to tell people of your country there is a certainty of disaster,” Sailele said."

A variety of possible causes — from sonic attacks to crickets to mass hysteria — have been considered, but no definite culprit has been identified.",
        "The New York Times reported Saturday, however, that several experts have pinpointed a “prime suspect”: Microwave weapons, which can invisibly beam painfully loud noises, paralyze victims, wage psychological warfare and “even kill.”",
        "Dr. Douglas Smith, director of the Center for Brain Injury and Repair at the University of Pennsylvania who examined almost two dozen of the sickened people from Cuba, told the paper that “everybody was relatively skeptical at first” of the microwave theory but “everyone now agrees there’s something there.”",
        "The State Department told the Times that no cause or source of the embassy attacks has been identified. The FBI declined to comment.",
        "Russia, China and many European nations are believed capable of making basic microwave weapons, which emit focused energy in the form of microwaves and can be small enough to be hand-held or carried in a van or other vehicle.",
        "The U.S. has been working on such weapons for decades. The nation’s military revealed that it had developed “a high-power microwave weapon that could disperse crowds without killing people by rapidly raising body temperature,” according to a 2015 Reuters report.",
        "This isn’t the first time that microwave weapons have been floated as the possible culprit behind the unexplained illnesses to embassy personnel and their relatives.",
        "ProPublica said in a February report that federal investigators were considering the possibility of a microwave attack, and at least two scientific papers have identified microwave weapons as a likely cause.",
        "James Lin, an electrical engineering expert at the University of Illinois at Chicago, suggested in a December study that microwave pulses could have produced the strange sounds and caused the symptoms that diplomatic staff and their family members suffered.",
        "Beatrice Golomb, a professor of medicine at the University of California-San Diego, has corroborated this assessment in a paper to be published next month in the journal Neural Computation.",
        "“I looked at what’s known about [pulsed radiofrequency/microwave electromagnetic] radiation in relation to diplomats’ experiences,” Golomb said, according to a news release. “Everything fits. The specifics of the varied sounds that the diplomats reported hearing during the apparent inciting episodes, such as chirping, ringing and buzzing, cohere in detail with known properties of so-called ‘microwave hearing.’”",
        "“And the symptoms that emerged fit, including the dominance of sleep problems, headaches and cognitive issues, as well as the distinctive prominence of auditory symptoms,” she said.",
        "Not everyone is convinced by this hypothesis, however.",
        "“That theory is a real stretch,” Kenneth Foster, a bioengineering professor at the University of Pennsylvania, told the New Scientist in December following Lin’s paper on the topic. “It would require something like a major airport radar transmitter with the subject’s head close to the antenna in its direct beam. ... I guess it is possible, but not likely.”",
        "Journalist Sharon Weinberger, the Washington bureau chief for Yahoo News who for years has researched efforts to develop microwave weapons, also expressed doubt that such technology was behind the embassy illnesses.",
        "Still, Allan Frey, a microwave radiation pioneer, told the Times he viewed it as highly plausible that microwave weapons had been used in the embassy attacks. In the case of Cuba, he speculated that “Cubans aligned with Russia... might have launched microwave strikes in attempts to undermine developing ties between Cuba and the United States.”",
        "“I think that’s a perfectly viable explanation,” he said."

        "Streamline recommends “The ABC Murders” on Amazon Prime this week. Amazon debuted this new show on Feb. 1.\n\nPremise: Based on an Agatha Christie novel, this takes place in the 1930s and tells the story of a once-famous detective who longs for his glory years while spending much of his time alone. A serial killer starts to send messages to the detective, which sets off a cat-and-mouse mystery that, of course, involves murder.\n\nStars: Rupert Grint and John Malkovich.",
        "How excited should you be? Amazon doesn’t have as many British crime shows as Netflix, so adding this highly stylized detective thriller should be a welcome move for fans of that genre. Malkovich elevates everything he stars in (even with a ridiculous accent this time around) and Grint looks nothing like Grint in this role, so that’s kind of fun. Although this show wallows in grimness, clever moments of humor peek through occasionally.\n\nAny reasons to be skeptical? This show plods along at a glacial pace. During multiple scenes, I wondered if my internet had slowed down and I was watching this at half-speed. The poor direction and dialogue make this hard to get through, so you really have to love detective thrillers to find enjoyment here. Sometimes I watch shows with hourlong episodes that feel too long, but it’s hard to say what should have been cut. That’s not the case here, as the show decides to spend a laughable amount of time focusing on shots of sinks and typewriters and other uninteresting inanimate objects.",

        "Former President George W. Bush memorialized Arizona Sen. John McCain on Saturday as an honorable friend and leader who was honest, courageous and not afraid to speak out against “bigots and swaggering despots.”",
        "“John was above all a man with a code. He lived by a set of public virtues that brought strength and purpose to his life and to his country,” the 43rd president said during a memorial service at the National Cathedral in Washington.",
        "“He was courageous, with a courage that frightened his captors and inspired his countrymen. He was honest, no matter who it offended ― presidents were not spared,” he said, drawing laughs.",
        "“Back in the day, he could frustrate me, and I know he’d say the same thing about me,” he said, appearing to draw a laugh from McCain’s wife, Cindy McCain. “But he also made me better.”",
        "Former President Barack Obama echoed a similar sentiment during his own eulogy at the service, stating that McCain “made us better presidents — just as he made the Senate better. Just as he made the country better.”",
        "President Donald Trump ― who appeared to be a target of many of the service’s eulogies ― clashed with McCain during his presidency and did not attend the service.",
        "Bush, who successfully ran against McCain for the White House in 2000, emphasized that it was the Vietnam veteran’s loyalty to his country and respect to his fellow human being, whether it’s friend or foe, that made him so great.",
        "“He was honorable. Always recognizing that his opponents were still patriots and human beings. He loved freedom with a passion of a man who knew its absence. He respected the dignity inherent in every life, a dignity that does not stop at borders and cannot be erased by dictators,” he said. “Perhaps above all, John detested the abuse of power. He could not abide bigots and swaggering despots; there was something deep inside of him that made him stand up for the little guy, to speak for forgotten people, in forgotten places.”",
        "Bush concluded his speech by stating that though the senator “has moved on,” his legacy will continue.",
        "“He would probably not want us to dwell on it, but we are better for his presence among us. The world is smaller for his departure, and we will remember him as he was: unwavering, undimmed, unequal.”"

        "In an equally empowering and emotional tribute, Arizona Sen. John McCain’s daughter, Meghan McCain, honored her late father on Saturday as a great warrior, American and father who was “defined by love,” not politics.",
        "“We gather here to mourn the passing of American greatness, the real thing, not cheap rhetoric from men who will never come near the sacrifice he gave so willingly,” she said at the memorial service held at Washington National Cathedral. The audience included former President Barack Obama and former Vice President Joe Biden.",
        "“He was a hero. He was a congressman. He was a senator. He was a nominee for president of the United States,” she said. “These are all the titles on a wall of a life well lived. He was a great man.”",
        "In an extraordinarily rare moment, the entire cathedral burst into applause as she declared “the America of John McCain has no need to be made great again because America was always great.”",
        "The declaration appeared to be a direct dig at President Donald Trump ― who did not attend the service ― and his campaign slogan. Trump’s daughter, Ivanka Trump, and her husband, Jared Kushner, were in attendance.",
        "“The America of John McCain is generous and welcoming and bold. She is resourceful, confident and secure. She meets her responsibilities. She speaks quietly because she is strong. America does not boast because she has no need to,” she declared.",
        "The 33-year-old went on to share her own loving relationship with her father, who she said never used his many accomplishments, pains and sacrifices as a means to make her feel small but used his greatness to raise her up, just as he did for others.",
        "“John McCain was defined by love,” she said. “When my father got sick, when I asked him what he wanted me to do with this eulogy he said, show them how tough you are. That is what love meant to John McCain.”",
        "“All that I am, all that I hope, all that I dream is grounded in what you have taught me,” she said. “Dad, your greatness is woven into my life, it is woven into my sister’s life, and it is woven into my brothers’ lives, and it is woven into the country.”"

        "CHAPEL HILL, N.C. ― What started as a peaceful demonstration over a toppled Confederate monument at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill campus Thursday evening ended with three people arrested and the crowd doused in pepper spray.",
        "About 40 people showed up for a “Twilight Service” that Alamance County Taking Back Alamance County, or ACTBAC, had planned on the campus to “show respect and honor to our fallen boy soldier” at the site where protesters pulled down the Confederate monument known as “Silent Sam” on Aug. 21. The Southern Poverty Law Center has described ACTBAC as “a neo-Confederate hate group.”",
        "At least 200 counterprotesters showed up, despite warnings from university administrators to stay away from the demonstration site. Some who had opposed the statue hosted a dance party near the steps of the monument’s pedestal, while others shouted at the statue’s supporters.",
        "Two of the people arrested were charged with disturbing the peace by fighting in a public place, and the third person arrested was accused of resisting an officer. The university has not released the names of those arrested Thursday. It was not clear if those arrested were affiliated with UNC. Seven people were also arrested at protests at the site last Saturday.",
        "The monument was erected in 1913 to commemorate UNC students who fought for the Confederacy during the Civil War. Since the statue fell, the university has faced criticism from both sides for its handling of the incident. State law had previously prevented the university from moving the statue, but questions remain over whether the school is required to reinstall it.",
        "André Tyson, a senior from Ansonville, North Carolina, said he’ll do whatever it takes to make sure that the statue is not put back up.",
        "“You have no idea the sense of empowerment that I feel when I see that that statue has come down,” Tyson said.",
        "UNC Chancellor Carol Folt and the university’s Board of Trustees passed a resolution Tuesday setting a Nov. 15 deadline to determine the statue’s fate.",
        "After a demonstration Saturday, Folt defended the idea of relocating it. “I would find a better location, a safe, secure location for the monument that would allow us to talk about it, learn from it and deal with it in a respectful, appropriate way. And if I could do that, that is what I still believe is necessary.”",
        "Officers from multiple UNC system schools assisted campus police in containing the groups.",
        "Shortly after counterprotesters began dancing, police officers with bicycles barricaded a pathway for ACTBAC members to enter the fenced area surrounding the pedestal. For about 30 minutes the “mourners” stood by the statue’s base, paying respects and staring at the crowd as they waved their Confederate flags.",
        "Hundreds of counterprotesters stood by the fences chanting for the group to leave. As ACTBAC members were escorted off campus, police pepper-sprayed the crowd to “maintain order,” the university said in a statement.",
        "A few police officers stood around the statue’s pedestal when tension between the groups rose moments later. A group of counterprotesters had gathered and started chanting “Nazis go home” when officers intervened and arrested one man.",
        "“I think that this whole hubbub over the monument is less about slavery and more about the suppression of free speech,” Noel Fritsch, a 38-year-old Chapel Hill resident who has worked as a political consultant for Republican campaigns, said above the shouts of counterprotesters. “These people don’t believe that people who don’t agree with them ought to be able to exist.”",
        "As officers pulled two other women out of the crowd who had been arguing with Fritsch, an officer doused the crowd in pepper spray again.",
        "The three people arrested were held in a nearby building filled with officers in riot gear. Moments later, as police escorted the three out of the area, demonstrators attempted to stop them. Officers again used pepper spray to disperse the crowd.",
        "Counterprotesters say they won’t be deterred from speaking out against any effort to restore the monument to its previous location on campus.",
        "“This campus belongs to everyone,” said Altha Cravey, a professor at the university, as she danced. “We don’t want Nazis. I’m here to celebrate ‘Silent Sam’ is gone, and he’s not coming back.”"

        "The ACBC published its report two weeks after a former Australian archbishop became the most senior Catholic cleric in the world to be convicted of concealing abuse, and was ordered to serve a one-year prison sentence at home.",
        "The convicted former archbishop of Adelaide, Philip Wilson, himself a former ACBC president, was found to have failed to report child abuse outside the confessional. He has said he will appeal the conviction.",

        "The exercise, called Vostok-2018 (East-2018), will take place in central and eastern Russian military districts and involve almost 300,000 troops, more than 1,000 military aircraft, two of Russia’s naval fleets, and all of its airborne units, Shoigu said in a statement.",
        "The manoeuvres will take place at a time of heightened tension between the West and Russia, which is concerned about what it says is an unjustified build-up of the NATO military alliance on its western flank.",
        "NATO says it has beefed up its forces in eastern Europe to deter potential Russian military action after Moscow annexed Ukraine’s Crimea in 2014 and backed a pro-Russian uprising in eastern Ukraine.",
        "The war games, which will take place from Sept. 11-15, are likely to worry Japan, which has already complained about a Russian military build-up in the Far East, something Moscow has linked to Tokyo’s roll-out of the Aegis U.S. missile system.",
        "Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is due to attend a forum in the Russian city of Vladivostok over the same period, and a Japanese Foreign Ministry official said on Tuesday that Tokyo always paid attention to shifts in Russian-Chinese military cooperation.",
        "Shoigu said the war games would be the biggest since a Soviet military exercise, Zapad-81 (West-81) in 1981.",
        "“In some ways they will repeat aspects of Zapad-81, but in other ways the scale will be bigger,” Shoigu told reporters, while visiting the Russian region of Khakassia.",
        "Shoigu said that both Russia’s Pacific and Northern Fleets would take part, while the Russian Ministry of Defence has said that Chinese and Mongolian military units will also participate.",
        "“A MORE ASSERTIVE RUSSIA”",
        "Asked if the cost of holding such a massive military exercise was justified at a time when Russiais faced with higher social spending demands, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said such wargames were essential.",
        "“The country’s ability to defend itself in the current international situation, which is often aggressive and unfriendly towards our country, means (the exercise) is justified,” Peskov told reporters on a conference call.",
        "When asked if China’s involvement meant Moscow and Beijing were moving towards an alliance, Peskov said it showed that the two were cooperating in all areas.",
        "China and Russia have taken part in joint military drills before but not on such a large scale.",
        "NATO spokesman Dylan White said that Russia had briefed the alliance on the planned exercise in May and that NATO would monitor it. Russia had invited military attaches from NATO countries based in Moscow to observe the war games, an offer he said was under consideration.",
        "“All nations have the right to exercise their armed forces, but it is essential that this is done in a transparent and predictable manner,” White said in an emailed statement.",
        "“Vostok demonstrates Russia’s focus on exercising large-scale conflict. It fits into a pattern we have seen over some time: a more assertive Russia, significantly increasing its defence budget and its military presence.”",
        "Shoigu this month announced the start of snap combat readiness checks in central and eastern military districts ahead of the planned exercise.",
        "“Imagine 36,000 armoured vehicles - tanks, armoured personnel carriers and armoured infantry vehicles - moving and working simultaneously, and that all this, naturally, is being tested in conditions as close as possible to military ones,” Shoigu said on Tuesday.",

        "GENEVA, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Airstrikes by the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen’s war have caused heavy civilian casualties at marketplaces, weddings and on fishing boats, some of which may amount to war crimes, United Nations human rights experts said on Tuesday.",
        "Saudi Arabia is leading a Western-backed alliance of Sunni Muslim Arab states trying to restore the internationally recognized government of Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, ousted from the capital Sanaa by the Iran-aligned Houthis in 2015.",
        "Fighters of the Houthi movement have fired missiles into Saudi Arabia, blocked delivery of supplies to Taiz and shelled the strategic city from the highlands, the panel said. They have also committed torture, a war crime, it said.",
        "Coalition forces have imposed severe restrictions on Red Sea ports and Sanaa airport, depriving Yemenis of vital supplies which may also constitute international crimes, the independent experts said in their first report to the Human Rights Council.",
        "The coalition’s additional inspection procedures at Hodeidah port have had a “chilling effect on commercial shipping”, although no U.N. or coalition searches had discovered weapons being smuggled into Yemen where 8.4 million people are on the brink of famine, it said.",
        "“Coalition air strikes have caused most of the documented civilian casualties. In the past three years, such air strikes have hit residential areas, markets, funerals, weddings, detention facilities, civilian boats and even medical facilities,” the panel said.",
        "Its investigation of 11 incidents raised “serious concerns about the targeting process applied by the coalition.” Strikes that fail to spare people or structures protected by international humanitarian law would be unlawful violations.",
        "“Individuals in the (Yemeni) government and the coalition, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, may have conducted attacks in violation of the principles of distinction, proportionality and precaution that may amount to war crimes,” the experts said, adding that they had compiled a confidential list of suspects.",
        "There was no immediate reaction from those governments, which received an advance copy of the report from the United Nations.",
        "All sides have conscripted children between 11 and 17 years and used them to participate in the hostilities, also war crimes, the 41-page report said.",
        "It was released ahead of U.N. peace talks between the government and Houthis on Sept. 6 in Geneva.",
        "The panel, headed by Tunisian expert Kamel Jendoubi, neither specifically referred to the United States and Britain, which provide arms and intelligence to the Saudi-led alliance, nor did it point a finger at Iranian support to the Houthis."

        "By Stephanie Nebehay",
        "GENEVA (Reuters) - Myanmar’s military carried out mass killings and gang rapes of Muslim Rohingya with “genocidal intent”, and the commander-in-chief and five generals should be prosecuted for the gravest crimes under international law, U.N. investigators said.",
        "A report by investigators was the first time the United Nations has explicitly called for Myanmar officials to face genocide charges over their campaign against the Rohingya, and is likely to deepen the country’s isolation.",
        "The investigators called for the U.N. Security Council to impose an arms embargo on Myanmar, subject its officials to targeted sanctions and set up an ad hoc tribunal to try suspects or refer them to the International Criminal Court in the Hague.",
        "The report also could serve as a major catalyst for change in how the world’s big social media companies handle hate speech in parts of the world where they have limited direct presence but their platforms command huge influence.",
        "The investigators sharply criticized Facebook, which has become Myanmar’s dominant social media network despite having no employees there, for letting its platform be used to incite violence and hatred.",
        "Facebook responded on Monday by announcing it was blocking 20 Myanmar officials and organizations found by the U.N. panel to have “committed or enabled serious human rights abuses”.",
        "The company already acknowledged this month that it had been “too slow” to respond to incitement in Myanmar, following a Reuters investigative report into its failure to tackle rampant hate speech including calls for all Rohingya to be killed.",
        "The U.N. investigators blamed Myanmar’s de facto civilian leader, Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi, for failing to use her “moral authority” to protect civilians. Her government “contributed to the commission of atrocity crimes” by letting hate speech thrive, destroying documents and failing to shield minorities from crimes against humanity and war crimes.",
        "“Our findings are grim,” panel chairman Marzuki Darusman told a news conference on Monday. “We believe that establishing the facts is the first stepping stone towards change.“Contacted by phone, Myanmar military spokesman Major General Tun Tun Nyi said he could not immediately comment. Zaw Htay, spokesman for Suu Kyi’s government, could not immediately be reached for comment. Reuters was also unable to contact the six generals named in the report. The Myanmar government was sent an advance copy of the U.N. report in line with standard practice.",
        "“GROSSLY DISPROPORTIONATE”",
        "A year ago, government troops led a brutal crackdown in Myanmar’s Rakhine state in response to attacks by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) on 30 Myanmar police posts and a military base. Some 700,000 Rohingya fled the crackdown and most are now living in refugee camps in neighbouring Bangladesh.",
        "The U.N. report said the military action was “grossly disproportionate to actual security threats”.",
        "“The crimes in Rakhine State, and the manner in which they were perpetrated, are similar in nature, gravity and scope to those that have allowed genocidal intent to be established in other contexts,” said the U.N. panel, known as the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission onMyanmar.",
        "Suu Kyi’s government has rejected most allegations of atrocities made against the security forces by refugees. It has built transit centres for refugees to return, but U.N. aid agencies say it is not yet safe for them to do so.",
        "The report said Suu Kyi “has not used her de facto position as Head of Government, nor her moral authority, to stem or prevent the unfolding events, or seek alternative avenues to meet a responsibility to protect the civilian population”.",
        "In Brussels, the European Union’s executive said it would meet this week with the U.N. panel and discuss further steps.",
        "The U.S. State Department is preparing its own report that U.S. officials say will document in grim detail a premeditated campaign of violence. The U.N. findings could increase pressure on the United States to take a stronger stand, said a U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity. Washington this month imposed sanctions on four military and police commanders and two army units, but Myanmar’s military chief was spared.",
        "The United Nations defines genocide as acts meant to destroy a national, ethnic, racial or religious group in whole or in part. Such a designation is rare, but has been used in countries including Bosnia, Rwanda and Sudan.",
        "The investigators documented rapes, sexual slavery and abductions, including of children, said panel member Radhika Coomeraswamy.",
        "“The scale, brutality and systematic nature of rape and (sexual) violence indicate that they are part of deliberate strategy to intimidate, terrorise or punish the civilian population. They are used as a tactic of war,” she said.",
        "Darusman said commander-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing should step down pending investigation.",
        "The list of generals also included Brigadier-General Aung Aung, commander of the 33rd Light Infantry Division, which oversaw operations in the coastal village of Inn Din where 10 Rohingya captive boys and men were killed.",
        "The incident, for which seven soldiers have since been jailed, was uncovered by two Reuters journalists - Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28 - who were arrested last December and are being tried on charges of violating Myanmar’s Official Secrets Act. The court had been due to deliver a verdict in their case on Monday, but postponed the proceedings until Sept. 3.",
        "Other generals named in the report included army deputy commander-in-chief Vice Senior-General Soe Win; the commander of the Bureau of Special Operations-3, Lieutenant-General Aung Kyaw Zaw; the commander of Western Regional Military Command, Major-General Maung Maung Soe; and the commander of 99th Light Infantry Division, Brigadier-General Than Oo.",
        "Panel member Christopher Sidoti said “the clarity of the chain of command in Myanmar” meant the six generals must be prosecuted, even in the absence of a “smoking gun” piece of evidence to prove who had ordered the crimes.",
        "“We do not have a copy of a direct order that says ‘undertake genocide tomorrow please’. But that is the case almost universally when cases of genocide have gone before the courts,” Sidoti said.",
        "“OPPRESSION FROM BIRTH TO DEATH”",
        "The U.N. panel, set up last year, interviewed 875 victims and witnesses in Bangladesh and other countries, and analysed documents, videos, photographs and satellite images.",
        "Decades of state-sponsored stigmatisation against Rohingya had resulted in “institutionalised oppression from birth to death”, the report said.",
        "The Rohingya, who regard themselves as native to Myanmar’s Rakhine state, are widely considered as interlopers by the country’s Buddhist majority and are denied citizenship.",
        "Members of the panel had accused Facebook in March of allowing its platform to be used to incite violence. The report said the social media company should have acted quicker.",
        "“Although improved in recent months, Facebook’s response has been slow and ineffective. The extent to which Facebook posts and messages have led to real-world discrimination and violence must be independently and thoroughly examined,” it said.",
        "In a statement announcing its action on Monday, Facebook said it was removing 18 Facebook accounts, one Instagram account and 52 Facebook pages.",
        "“The ethnic violence in Myanmar has been truly horrific. Earlier this month, we shared an update on the steps we’re taking to prevent the spread of hate and misinformation on Facebook. While we were too slow to act, we’re now making progress – with better technology to identify hate speech, improved reporting tools, and more people to review content.”",

        "Over a thousand leftist protesters massed near a giant statue of Karl Marx in Chemnitz on Monday evening to protest attacks on foreigners that occurred during an impromptu demonstration on Sunday after reports spread on social media about the stabbing of a 35-year-old German man.",
        "“The scenes of people going after those who look like foreigners scare us. We want to show that Chemnitz has another side that is cosmopolitan and opposes xenophobia,” Tim Detzner, the head of the radical Left party in Chemnitz, told the rally.",
        "Nearly the same number of demonstrators waving German and Bavarian flags gathered nearby, some breaking through police barriers aimed at keeping the two sides apart. Many chanted “We are the people,” a slogan used by far-right supporters.",
        "The police in Saxony, the eastern state where Chemnitz lies, said on Twitter at around 7:30 p.m. GMT that the demonstration had ended and they were accompanying participants to the train station.",

        "“That has no place in our cities and we, as the German government, condemn it in the strongest terms,” he said. “Our basic message for Chemnitz and beyond is that there is no place in Germany for vigilante justice, for groups that want to spread hatred on the streets, for intolerance and for extremism.”",

My brother, coming to my room, messing with me for no reason. It just ― I don’t even got words to explain the pain I’m feeling right now.”",
        "All victims were on the second floor of the two-story brick building with an attic, Langford said. The first floor was empty and boarded up while the attic was a storage area.",
        "Investigators are probing the fire’s origin and cause, Langford said. Officials’ preliminary observation showed the fire started on second floor, he said.",

Wes Anderson directed this and co-wrote the screenplay with Roman Coppola.\n\nThe two children run away and try to make a life for themselves together ― a very twee life. Then the adults start looking for them ― in a very twee way.\n\nAlthough the Anderson aesthetic is kind of out right now during this more hardened, ultra-cynical Donald Trump era, I still love this movie. I think you’ll find much to enjoy whether you’re revisiting it or watching for the first time.",

For U.S. tech companies like Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook, the project, called Aadhaar (which means “proof” or “basis” in Hindi), could be a gold mine.",

Launched nine years ago as a simple and revolutionary way to streamline access to welfare programs for India’s poor, the database has become Indians’ gateway to nearly any type of service ― from food stamps to a passport or a cell phone connection. Practical errors in the system have caused millions of poor Indians to lose out on aid. And the exponential growth of the project has sparked concerns among security researchers and academics that India is the first step toward setting up a surveillance society to rival China.",
        "A Scheme Born In The U.S.",
        "Tapping into Aadhaar would help big tech companies access the data and transactions of millions of users in the second most populous country on earth, explained Usha Ramanathan, a Delhi-based lawyer, legal researcher and one of Aadhaar’s most vocal critics.",
        "The idea for India’s national biometric identification team wasn’t unprecedented, and in fact, it has strong parallels with a system proposed for the United States. Following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, the CEO of Oracle, Larry Ellison, offered to build the U.S. government software for a national identification system that would include a centralized computer database of all U.S. citizens. The program never got off the ground amid objections from privacy and civil liberties advocates, but India’s own Ellison figure, Nandan Nilekani, had a similar idea. The billionaire founder of IT consulting giant Infosys, Nilekani conceptualized Aadhaar as a way to eliminate waste and corruption in India’s social welfare programs. He lobbied the government to bring in Aadhaar, and went on to run the project under the administration of Manmohan Singh. Nilekani gained even more influence under current Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who moved to make Aadhaar necessary for almost any kind of business in India.",
        "The first 12-digit Aadhaar ID was issued in 2010. Today, over a billion people (around 89 percent of India’s population) have been included in the system ― from India’s unimaginably wealthy billionaires to the homeless, from residents of the country’s sprawling cities to remote inaccessible villages. While initially a voluntary program, the database is now linked to just about all government programs. You need an Aadhaar ID to get a passport issued or renewed. Aadhaar was made mandatory for operating a bank account, using a cell phone or investing in mutual funds, only for the proposals to be rolled back pending the Supreme Court verdict on the constitutionality of the project.",
        "As Aadhaar identification became integrated into other systems like banking, cell phones and government programs, tech companies can use the program to cross-reference their datasets against other databases and assemble a far more detailed and intrusive picture of Indians’ lives. That would allow them, for example, to better target products or advertising to the vast Indian population. “You can take a unique identifying number and use it to find data in different sectors,” explained Pam Dixon, executive director of the World Privacy Forum, an American public interest research group. “That number can be cross-walked across all the different parts of their life.”",
        "Microsoft, which uses Aadhaar in a new version of Skype to verify users, declined to talk about its work integrating products with the Aadhaar database. But Bill Gates, Microsoft’s founder, has publicly endorsed Aadhaar and his foundation is funding a World Bank program to bring Aadhaar-like ID programs to other countries. Gates has also argued that ID verification schemes like Aadhaar in itself don’t pose privacy issues. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has repeatedly praised Aadhaar in both his recent book and a tour across India.",
        "Amazon did not respond to a request for comment, but according to a BuzzFeed report, the company told Indian customers not uploading a copy of Aadhaar “might result in a delay in the resolution or no resolution” of cases where packages were missing.",
        "Facebook, too, failed to respond to repeated requests for comment, though the platform’s prompts for users to log in with the same name as their Aadhaar card prompted suspicions from users that it wanted everyone to use their Aadhaar-verified names and spellings so they could later build in Aadhaar functionality with minimal problems.",
        "A spokesman for Google, which has its own payments platform in India called Tez, told HuffPost that the company has not integrated any of its products with Aadhaar. But there was outrage earlier in August when the Aadhaar helpline was added to Android phones without informing users. Google claimed in a statement to the Economic Times this happened “inadvertently”",
        "Privacy Jeopardized For Millions",
        "But the same features that are set to make tech companies millions are are also the ones that threaten the privacy and security of millions of Indians.",
        "“As long as [the data] is being shared with so many people and services and companies, without knowing who has what data, it will always be an issue,” said Srinivas Kodali, an independent security researcher. “They can’t protect it until they encrypt it and stop sharing data.”",
        "One government website allowed users to search and geolocate homes on the basis of caste and religion ― sparking fears of ethnic and religious violence in a country where lynchings, beatings and mob violence are commonplace. Another website broadcast the names, phone numbers and medical purchases — like generic Viagra and HIV medication — of anyone who buys medicines from government stores. In another leak, a Google search for phone numbers of farmers in Andhra Pradesh would reveal their Aadhaar numbers, address, fathers’ names and bank account numbers.",
        "The leaks are aggravated by “a Star Trek-type obsession” with data dashboards, said Sunil Abraham, executive director of the Center for Internet and Society. Many government departments each created an online data dashboard with detailed personal records on individuals, he explained. The massive centralization of personal data, he said, created a huge security risk as these dashboards were accessible to any government official and in many cases, were even left open to the public.",
        "Authentication failures have led to deaths among the poorest sections of Indian society when people were denied government food rations.",
        "And much like the tech companies, some local governments are using the system to connect data sets and build expansive surveillance. In the state of Andhra Pradesh in India, there’s a war room next to the state chief minister’s office, where a wall of screens shows details from databases that collect information from every department. There are security cameras and dashboards that track every mention of the chief minister on the news. There’s a separate team watching what’s being said about him on social media and there are also dashboards that collect information from IoT [Internet of Things] sensors across the state.",
        "Court Ruling Could Halt Rollout",
        "Those issues around privacy are why the dreams of government bureaucrats and large tech companies to build a perfect surveillance apparatus around Aadhaar may ultimately fall apart. The Supreme Court of India is set to decide on a case that could decide the future of the program.",
        "The court is set to review 27 petitions, including whether requiring an Aadhaar for government subsidies and benefits makes access to these programs conditional, even though the state is constitutionally bound to deliver them. The petitioners include lawyers, academics and a 92-year-old retired judge whose petition also secured the right to privacy as a fundamental right in August 2017. Petitioners also argue that the ability for Aadhaar to be used to track and profile people is unconstitutional.",
        "In its judgment, due any day now, the court will rule on all 27 petitions together. It will decide not only the fate of the Aadhaar Act of 2016, but likely the future involvement of some of tech’s biggest companies in one of the world’s most ambitious and divisive IT projects."

        "After the university sent a warning to the campus Friday afternoon about a “possible rally,” a small group of demonstrators with Confederate flags showed up at around 10 a.m. Saturday to the place where the statue known as Silent Sam formerly stood.",
        "Only a handful of demonstrators holding Confederate flags remained on campus by noon, as the number of those in favor of the statue’s removal swelled. Police had to intervene several times as demonstrators from both sides clashed and got into physical altercations.",
        "The monument, erected in 1913 to commemorate UNC students who fought for the Confederacy during the Civil War, was tied up and brought down Monday night. Many saw the statue as a symbol of Jim Crow-era white supremacy.",

        "Since Monday, members of the university’s board of trustees and the UNC system’s board of governors have expressed a range of opinions on the statue — some called for its restoration while others raised public safety concerns.",
        "After Saturday’s demonstration, Folt defended the idea of relocating the statue, even though state law prevents her from doing so.",
        "“I would find a better location, a safe secure location for the monument that would allows us to talk about it, learn from it and deal with it in a respectful appropriate way,” she said. “And if I could do that, that is what I still believe is necessary.”",
        "More than 35 demonstrations over the monument have taken place over the last few years, Folt said.",

        "Another gathering organized by a different conservative group to remember the fallen statue is scheduled at UNC’s campus Thursday evening.",
        "“I’m concerned,” Griggs said. “We’re going to see more and more people use this statue as a rallying point, or use the toppling of this statue as a rallying point, but I am feeling very hopeful that this many people came out to say that ‘no, this is not acceptable to us, this is not welcome here.’”"

        "Streamline recommends “The ABC Murders” on Amazon Prime this week. Amazon debuted this new show on Feb. 1.\n\nPremise: Based on an Agatha Christie novel, this takes place in the 1930s and tells the story of a once-famous detective who longs for his glory years while spending much of his time alone. A serial killer starts to send messages to the detective, which sets off a cat-and-mouse mystery that, of course, involves murder.\n\nStars: Rupert Grint and John Malkovich.",
        "How excited should you be? Amazon doesn’t have as many British crime shows as Netflix, so adding this highly stylized detective thriller should be a welcome move for fans of that genre. Malkovich elevates everything he stars in (even with a ridiculous accent this time around) and Grint looks nothing like Grint in this role, so that’s kind of fun. Although this show wallows in grimness, clever moments of humor peek through occasionally.\n\nAny reasons to be skeptical? This show plods along at a glacial pace. During multiple scenes, I wondered if my internet had slowed down and I was watching this at half-speed. The poor direction and dialogue make this hard to get through, so you really have to love detective thrillers to find enjoyment here. Sometimes I watch shows with hourlong episodes that feel too long, but it’s hard to say what should have been cut. That’s not the case here, as the show decides to spend a laughable amount of time focusing on shots of sinks and typewriters and other uninteresting inanimate objects.",

        "Of the children still separated from their parents, 23 were under age 5. And 343 had parents who were no longer in the U.S. ― because they had been deported, a government official said previously.",
        "Responding to a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of separated migrant parents, the Trump administration said earlier this month that the ACLU should use its “considerable resources and their network of law firms, NGOs, volunteers, and others” to locate parents who had been deported or released. U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw later said in a conference call that the onus was squarely on the Trump administration.",
        "“All of this is the result of the government’s separation, and then inability and failure to track and reunite,” the judge said at the time. “And for every parent who is not located, there will be a permanently orphaned child, and that is 100 percent the responsibility of the administration.”",
        "In June, Sabraw ordered the Trump administration to reunite the more than 2,500 migrant children whom officials had taken from their parents as a result of Trump’s hard-line zero tolerance policy on immigration.",
        "By the time of the July 26 deadline, there were still more than 700 children in shelters whose parents had been deemed ineligible for reunification, either because they’d been deported, had failed a background check or had yet to be located.",
        "“The government shouldn’t be proud of the work they’re doing on reunification,” ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt told reporters at the time. “It should just be, ‘We created this cruel, unconstitutional, inhumane policy. Now we’re trying to fix it in every way we can and make these families whole.’ Not, ‘We’re proud we’re doing the reunifications,’ as if they’re showing up to fix some natural disaster. This is a disaster that they created.”"

        "While their liberal and conservative counterparts are in free fall, radical right parties are successfully exploiting public anxiety over migration, national identity and the failures of the establishment. After decades on the fringes, they’re forming governments, by themselves or in coalition.",
        "“You’re seeing this very political, symbolic stand saying enough is enough,” said Natalia Banulescu-Bogdan, head of the international program at the Migration Policy Institute in Washington, D.C. “Those who believe that the system is not working are finding allies throughout Europe.”",

        "Matteo Salvini and Italy’s Lega Party",
        "Italy’s Lega party, or the League, has been part of several coalition governments since it was founded in 1989, but it’s never had more power than it does now. The far-right party won the third-largest share of the vote in Italy’s 2018 election and has become the driving power in a coalition government with the anti-establishment Five Star party, despite holding fewer seats.",
        "The League’s election results would have been unthinkable just a few years ago. Support for the party tanked at around 4 percent in 2012 after its founder was forced out in a massive fraud scandal. But the League has climbed back up in the polls since Matteo Salvini, now 45, became the leader in late 2013.",
        "Salvini’s rise and his vitriol against minorities have come amidst a wave of anti-migrant violence in Italy. As rights groups warn of increasing racist and fascist sentiment, Salvini once tweeted out a quote from Italian dictator Benito Mussolini ― “Many enemies, much honor.”",
        "“At the end of 2013, Salvini took over a party that most people thought was dying. … It was broke. It was losing members hand over fist,” said Duncan McDonnell, a professor at Australia’s Griffith University. “Salvini turned it around in a very short period of time and on very little money.”",
        "Under Salvini, the League has gradually abandoned its original political platform calling for prosperous northern Italy to secede from the south and instead embraced Italian nationalism. Where Salvini once derided southern Italians as foul-smelling freeloaders, his current target is the influx of migrants and refugees whom he vilifies as “rapists” and “drug dealers.” He told rallies of supporters that he wanted to close down mosques and vowed to deport 150,000 migrants in his first year in office.",
        "In Italy’s new coalition government, Salvini took on the dual roles of interior minister and deputy prime minister, using his powers to quickly become one of Europe’s most prominent radical right politicians. He has blocked ships of migrants and refugees from disembarking, called for a census of the minority Roma people and pushed for lifting EU sanctions against Russia. His rhetoric emphasizes the need to protect Christian Italy, and he has proposed installing a mandatory crucifix in every public place.",

While Orban was once a liberal activist who studied law in Britain on a scholarship from billionaire George Soros, he now demonizes his former benefactor while championing severe restrictions on democratic freedoms and anti-migrant hysteria.",
        "Fidesz and Orban, now 55, shifted to the right in the mid-1990s. They started to rapidly undermine Hungary’s democratic institutions after winning a two-thirds majority in the 2010 elections. Fidesz rewrote the country’s laws and eventually its whole constitution, passing electoral legislation that foreign affairs experts say was designed to benefit itself and hinder Hungary’s fractured liberal opposition. Orban’s allies steadily took control of the country’s media, limiting press freedom, while Fidesz loyalists grabbed power in cultural, judicial and financial institutions.",
        "“Nobody considers Hungary to be a liberal democracy, and most people don’t even consider it democratic,” said Sheri Berman, a professor at New York’s Barnard College.",
        "However, Orban’s rise to international fame came during the refugee crisis, when he positioned himself as a crusader against migration and a defender of Christianity in Europe. Even though Hungary has taken in almost no refugees and its population is only 0.4 percent Muslim, he has continued to talk about migrants as “Muslim invaders” who will destroy Hungary’s culture and ethnic homogeneity.",
        "During elections earlier this year, Orban and Fidesz plastered the country with anti-migrant and anti-Soros posters; they have used anti-Semitic tropes and accused the billionaire of trying to overthrow the government. Fidesz won a landslide victory in an April vote that observers deemed free but not fair. Since then, Orban has launched a crackdown on civil society groups and passed laws that criminalize giving aid to migrants.",
        "Secure in his position at home, Orban also plans to export his politics across Europe. He has already backed nationalist allies in other countries and vowed last month that the European Parliament elections in 2019 would bring a wave of “Christian democracy” across the continent.",
        "The Chaotic Slide Toward Authoritarianism",
        "Jaroslaw Kaczynski and Poland’s Law and Justice Party",
        "Polish democracy has backslid ever since the right-wing nationalist Law and Justice party, or PiS, won the right to form a majority government in 2015.",
        "Law and Justice has used increasingly authoritarian means to target civil society and undermine the independence of state-funded media. Currently, it’s attempting to reshape the country’s courts in order to pack them with loyalists. It also passed a widely condemned law earlier this year making it illegal to blame Poland for crimes committed during the Holocaust.",
        "The leader of PiS is Jaroslaw Kaczynski, who is neither prime minister nor president of Poland but is unquestionably the most powerful man in the country. While the 69-year-old doesn’t hold any government post, he controls the ruling party as its chairman.",
        "“What it affords him is incredible authority without any of the responsibility,” said Anna Grzymala-Busse, a professor of international studies at California’s Stanford University.",
        "Kaczynski founded PiS in 2001 with his twin brother Lech, who was the country’s president from 2005 until his death in a plane crash in 2010. The tragedy looms over Polish politics, with Kaczynski accusing both Russia and Polish opposition figures of assassinating his brother ― a charge that two independent investigations have refuted.",
        "Kaczynski has long supported Polish nationalism and positions PiS as a party that will preserve the country’s homogeneous Christian identity. He has used his nativist message and a growing economy to hold onto public support while PiS’s legal reforms remove checks on the government’s power.",
        "“[Kaczynski] has always had this particular take on nationalism,” Grzymala-Busse said. “The big difference is now he has a parliamentary majority and he can basically implement what he’s been about all along.”",
        "Massive public protests and EU pressure have pushed back against some of PiS’s plans ― including a total ban on abortion and a law that would remake Poland’s supreme court. But with a fractured political opposition and Kaczynski securely in power, global affairs experts warn that Poland’s democratic institutions remain under perpetual threat.",
        "A Match For Merkel Goes Mainstream",
        "Alexander Gauland and Alternative For Germany",
        "The Alternative For Germany party is rooted in its disdain for longtime Chancellor Angela Merkel’s welcoming stance toward migrants and refugees. Its platform calls for the closure of Germany’s borders to migrants, opposition to the Schengen Area (a zone of free movement within the EU), a ban on burqas and a referendum to leave the EU.",
        "Founded in 2013, the AfD became Germany’s third-largest party last year, winning 12.6 percent of the vote and becoming the first nationalist party to hold a seat in the Bundestag in over half a century. Most of its electoral support came from parts of eastern Germany where immigrant populations have risen significantly since 2015, when the country took in more than 1 million migrants and refugees. Germany has since struggled to process asylum requests in a timely manner and to integrate the newcomers, creating an opening for anti-migrant sentiment to fester.",
        "“Merkel was very successful in rallying support at the height of the refugee crisis and calling upon Germany’s sense of generosity and hospitality and noting that it was part of their culture to welcome people,” Banulescu-Bogdan said. “But as the crisis draws on for a very long time, there’s a generosity fatigue. It’s very hard to sustain that level of support when Europe hasn’t found any solutions for this.”",
        "Frauke Petry, who ran the AfD until 2017, once suggested that German police should shoot at migrants attempting to cross into the country. Alexander Gauland, who now leads the party, also drowns out some of its more moderate factions. Gauland, 77, is known for making unapologetically racist statements, such as suggesting of the government’s integration commissioner, who is German-born but of Turkish descent, that Germans could “dispose of her in Anatolia.”",
        "Although the AfD doesn’t have a seat in Merkel’s governing coalition, its anti-immigration rhetoric has spread into the mainstream and infiltrated policymaking at the highest levels. Horst Seehofer, the interior minister and head of Merkel’s coalition partner, the conservative Christian Social Union, is by no means a far-right figure. Yet as many tire of Merkel’s open-door policy, he too is pushing to shut Germany’s borders.",
        "Under The Trump-Like Slogan ‘Finland First’",
        "Jussi Halla-aho and the Finns Party",
        "The populist Finns Party advocates for a Finland without immigration from countries outside the European Union, except for those individuals who can bring added economic benefit to the country.",
        "Formerly known as True Finns, the Euroskeptic party rose in popularity during the eurozone debt crisis of the late 2000s. It became Finland’s third-largest political bloc in 2011, winning 39 of 200 parliamentary seats, and almost formed a coalition with the majority Centre Party.",
        "The Finns Party selected parliamentary member Laura Huhtasaari to run in this year’s presidential election. Although she didn’t stand a chance of winning, she used the platform to broadcast her party’s message, even channeling U.S. President Donald Trump by coining the slogan “Finland First” and ranting about “Muslim backwardness.”",
        "“Finland is a little bit late if you compare it to other European countries,” Huhtasaari said. “Anti-immigration parties are winning and people are waking up everywhere. They’re waking up now here, too.”",
        "The party’s leader, 47-year-old Jussi Halla-aho, is even more of a hardliner. In 2012, Finland’s Supreme Court fined him for comments he left on a blog that connected Islam to pedophilia and Somalis to theft.",
        "‘A Bit Vague’ But With Racist DNA",
        "Jimmie Akesson and the Sweden Democrats",
        "Convinced that native-born Swedes are being crowded out of their own country, the Sweden Democrats party wants to shut the doors to asylum-seekers and refugees, except those coming from neighboring nations.",
        "The far-right party has recently soared in the polls, making it the top contender to become Sweden’s second-largest party in September’s general election.",
        "The party was originally linked to the neo-Nazi movement in the late 1980s, but its current leader, 39-year-old Jimmie Akesson, claims he’s gotten rid of any vestiges of the party’s former self. It gained seats in Parliament for the first time in 2010 and its popularity has climbed ever since.",
        "“They’re a bit vague but they are targeting migration from outside Europe, Muslim migration and migration from Africa,” said Anders Sannerstedt, a senior political science lecturer at Sweden’s Lund University. “They’d have no problems with people coming from the U.S. or New Zealand ― it’s the Middle East and it’s Africa.”",
        "And Sannerstedt explained they’ve changed the rhetoric they use to justify their opposition to immigration.",
        "“In 1988, the Sweden Democrats were against migration as a matter of blood and DNA and genes, using explicitly racist arguments,” he said. “All that has been swept away. Now it’s a matter of immigration costing a lot of money and immigrants having difficulty adapting to Swedish society.”",
        "The party’s rise in popularity in recent years is likely connected to its own and others’ fear-mongering over rising crime rates and gang violence in the country. Gangs from areas with large immigrant populations have been responsible for several deaths in the last few years, creating fodder for the Sweden Democrats’ rhetoric.",
        "The Sweden Democrats acknowledge “that most of the people who live in these problem areas are sick and tired of gang crimes,” Sannerstedt said. But the party contends that these immigrant communities tend to breed this kind of lawlessness.",
        "Founded By Former Nazis",
        "Heinz-Christian Strache and Austria’s Freedom Party",
        "The current success of the Freedom Party of Austria and the muted reaction to that across Europe reflects both the way that radical right parties generally have gained acceptance and how the FPO specifically has remade its image.",
        "When the FPO became part of Austria’s ruling coalition in 2000, there was international outrage. A far-right party that was founded by former Nazi officials in the 1950s being welcomed into European government was seen as a dangerous development. The EU imposed sanctions on Austria, Israel recalled its ambassador in protest, and thousands marched in Vienna.",
        "Last December, 17 years later, the FPO entered government for the second time after winning 26 percent of the vote. Party leader Heinz-Christian Strache struck a deal with Sebastian Kurz of the conservative Austrian People’s Party to form a coalition. But this time Austria faced no sanctions, no recalled diplomats and only scattered protests.",
        "In recent years, the FPO has sought to distance itself from anti-Semitism ― Strache, 49, apologized for his own past as a neo-Nazi youth activist ― and to focus on the public backlash to migration, especially Muslim migration. Austria let in tens of thousands of asylum-seekers during the height of the refugee crisis in 2015. FPO leaders have pointed to those people to stir up fears of a potential “Islamization” of Austria and to campaign for tighter borders. Since the election last year, one of the party’s officials has called for a registry of Jews and Muslims who want to buy kosher or halal meat, and the party has faced scandal over its connections to an anti-Semitic fraternity.",
        "While the FPO remains only a junior coalition partner to the Austrian People’s Party, it has managed to drag the established conservatives to the right and set the agenda on immigration and Islam. Kurz’s government has called for an “axis” with Italy and Germany against migration and has cut its child benefits program for Austrians living abroad.",
        "Austria’s government also announced plans in June to close seven mosques and potentially expel up to 60 imams whom it accuses of receiving foreign funding from Turkey. Strache proclaimed this was “just the beginning.”"

        "In other cases, parents who had been reunited were threatened with another separation if they didn’t agree to be deported with their children, the complaint said.",
        "The complaint will be filed with the Department of Homeland Security by the American Immigration Lawyers Association and the American Immigration Council, who say attorneys spoke with 76 parents who said they were asked to sign forms affecting their rights to reunify with their children.",
        "All of them said they weren’t allowed to ask what would happen if they signed the form.",
        "The U.S. government separated more than 2,500 children from their parents this year as the Trump administration adopted a “zero-tolerance” policy requiring anyone who crossed the border illegally to be prosecuted. That resulted in parents who had to go to federal court to face criminal misdemeanor charges of illegal entry to be separated from their children, often for months.",

        "In one example, a Guatemalan mother who was separated from her 5-year-old son said an officer at the Port Isabel, Texas, detention center told her to sign a document to be returned to her home country so that she could get her son back.",
        "The officer didn’t explain what she was signing and the woman did so out of desperation, according to the complaint. The woman, like many others, also reported being threatened with solitary confinement because she was crying so much over being separated from her son.",
        "The woman, referred to only as “A.E.” in the complaint, was eventually reunited with her son and is currently being detained with him in Dilley, Texas.",
        "“Coercive tactics employed against a vulnerable population raises significant legal concerns and threatens the fundamental due process, statutory, and regulatory rights of parents who were separated from their children,” the attorneys wrote.",

        "NEW YORK (AP) — The last Nazi war crimes suspect facing deportation from the U.S. was taken from his New York City home and spirited early Tuesday morning to Germany, the White House said Tuesday.",
        "The deportation of the 95-year-old former concentration camp guard, Jakiw Palij, came 25 years after investigators first confronted him about his World War II past and he admitted lying to get into the U.S., claiming he spent the war as a farmer and factory worker.",
        "Palij lived quietly in the U.S. for years, as a draftsman and then as a retiree, until nearly three decades ago when investigators found his name on an old Nazi roster and a fellow former guard spilled the secret that he was “living somewhere in America.”",
        "Palij told Justice Department investigators who showed up at his door in 1993: “I would never have received my visa if I told the truth. Everyone lied.”",
        "A judge stripped Palij’s citizenship in 2003 for “participation in acts against Jewish civilians” while an armed guard at the Trawniki camp in Nazi-occupied Poland and was ordered deported a year later.",
        "But because Germany, Poland, Ukraine, and other countries refused to take him, he continued living in limbo in the two-story, red brick home in Queens he shared with his wife, Maria, now 86. His continued presence there outraged the Jewish community, attracting frequent protests over the years that featured such chants as “your neighbor is a Nazi!”",
        "According to the Justice Department, Palij served at Trawniki in 1943, the same year 6,000 prisoners in the camps and tens of thousands of other prisoners held in occupied Poland were rounded up and slaughtered. Palij has admitted serving in Trawniki but denied any involvement in war crimes.",
        "Last September, all 29 members of New York’s congressional delegation signed a letter urging the State Department to follow through on his deportation.",
        "The deportation came after weeks of diplomatic negotiations, which the White House said President Donald Trump had made a priority.",
        "“Through extensive negotiations, President Trump and his team secured Palij’s deportation to Germany and advanced the United States’ collaborative efforts with a key European ally,” the White House said.",
        "Germany’s Interior Ministry and Justice Ministry and Chancellor Angela Merkel’s office did not immediately have a comment on where Palij would be taken in Germany and what exactly would happen to him. Prosecutors there have previously said it does not appear that there’s enough evidence to charge him with wartime crimes.",
        "Palij’s deportation is the first for a Nazi war crimes suspect since Germany agreed in 2009 to take John Demjanjuk, a retired Ohio autoworker who was accused of serving as a Nazi guard. He was convicted in 2011 of being an accessory to more than 28,000 killings and died 10 months later, at age 91, with his appeal pending."

        "His wife, Maria del Carmen Venegas, who was headed to a scheduled cesarean section, told Univision that her husband was taken away after failing to provide identification, which she said he had forgotten at home in their haste. She insisted that her husband had never been in trouble with the law before, including a traffic ticket.",
        "“We don’t know what happened,” she said.",
        "In a statement obtained by HuffPost on Sunday, a representative for ICE said that Arrona-Lara was the subject of an “outstanding warrant issued for his arrest in Mexico on homicide charges.”",
        "“Mr. Arrona-Lara is currently in ICE custody pending removal proceedings with the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR),” the statement said. “ICE continues to focus its enforcement resources on individuals who pose a threat to national security, public safety and border security.”",

        "The victim, Miguel Ángel Morales Rodríguez, also known as “El Garcia,” was fatally beaten in Leon, Guanajuato, according to a release from the Guanajuato attorney general’s office. The other two men listed as wanted for the man’s death are identified as Julio Cesar Arrona-Lara, or “El Chikis,” and Roberto Arrona-Lara, or “El Rigo.”",
        "The arresting agents had been conducting surveillance on Arrona-Lara before taking him into custody at the gas station, according to the Times’ report. The agents said they were not aware the couple was heading to the hospital but that they were confident that Arrona-Lara’s wife was able to continue on her way after the arrest.",
        "When reached by ABC News over the weekend, Arrona-Lara’s legal defense team said it will continue to seek his release and that he denies any wrongdoing.",
        "“Mr. Arrona denies any criminal history in Mexico and he is unaware of any criminal proceedings in Mexico in which he is named as a defendant,” his defense team said in a statement. “The family denies allegations as well. In the charging documents he is charged with being in the country without documents. He is not in extradition proceedings.”",
        "Venegas, speaking with The Associated Press from the hospital, said she came to the U.S. with her husband 12 years ago from the city of Leon in the central Mexican state of Guanajuato.",

        "Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) said on Sunday that former CIA Director John Brennan abused his security privilege when he accused President Donald Trump of having “treasonous behavior.”",
        "During an interview on “Fox News Sunday,” the chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs maintained that Brennan didn’t need access to classified information, and said he had no issue with Trump pulling Brennan’s clearance.",
        "“I do believe that former CIA Director John Brennan abused his privilege,” said Johnson. “When you are an ex-CIA director and you are going on all the cable news shows and acting as partisan as he has and accusing the president of the United States of treasonous behavior, high crimes and misdemeanors. Last time I checked, treason was punishable by death. You’ve just crossed the line.”",
        "In July, Brennan called Trump’s behavior during a meeting in Helsinki with Russian President Vladimir Putin “treasonous.”",
        "At the July summit, Trump stood next to the Russian leader and appeared to dismiss the assessment of his own intelligence officials that Russia interfered in the 2016 election. The moment sparked widespread outrage, but several GOP lawmakers, including Johnson, did not condemn the president directly. Earlier that month, Johnson had met with Russian officials in Moscow as part of a delegation of Senate Republicans.",
        "On Wednesday, Trump revoked Brennan’s clearance in what appeared to be a broader attack on former and current intelligence officials who have spoken out against him. The White House is currently reviewing the security clearances of at least nine others who have been critical the president, and it has reportedly started drafting cancellations.",
        "Host Chris Wallace noted that some officials have likened this to “an enemies list,” and asked why the president would go only after his critics versus snatching clearances from all former officials.\n",
        "Johnson seemed to soften his position by saying he doesn’t want what happened to Brennan to become routine. The best way to handle things, he said, is just to not give people access to information.",
        "It’s unclear what exactly Johnson meant by that distinction. Earlier in the interview, Johnson did say it was unlikely that anyone was consulting with Brennan.",
        "He nevertheless doubled down on his assertion that Brennan went too far before going on to express deep sympathy for Trump.",
        "“Brennan really did cross a line. He’s one of the leaders of the resistance movement. I understand why President Trump is pretty frustrated,” he said. “I’ve never seen in my lifetime a president not given any chance — no honeymoon, massive protests the weekend after the inauguration. I understand President Trump’s frustration, but again, security clearance is really split between eligibility and access, and the best way to handle all of this, if you don’t have confidence in them, just don’t give them access to the classified information.”",
        "Earlier this week, a group of former CIA directors and deputies released a statement saying revoking Brennan’s clearance “has nothing to do with who should and should not hold security clearances — and everything to do with an attempt to stifle free speech.”",
        "Johnson disagreed that Trump is challenging free speech, but said he doesn’t want to see an enemies list. Instead, he repeated his earlier hedge, which seemed to contradict his position on Brennan.",
        "“And I will just repeat: The best way to handle this in any administration, if you don’t want to consult with anybody, you don’t have to yank their security clearance — just don’t give them access to classified materials,” he said. “It’s pretty simple.”"

Wes Anderson directed this and co-wrote the screenplay with Roman Coppola.\n\nThe two children run away and try to make a life for themselves together ― a very twee life. Then the adults start looking for them ― in a very twee way.\n\nAlthough the Anderson aesthetic is kind of out right now during this more hardened, ultra-cynical Donald Trump era, I still love this movie. I think you’ll find much to enjoy whether you’re revisiting it or watching for the first time.",

        "WASHINGTON ― Now that United Nations experts have endorsed widespread reports that China is holding a million members of its Muslim minority Uighur community in internment camps, the Chinese government’s denials of a crackdown look flimsier than ever. Activists and reporters who have documented the repression appear vindicated and awareness about the crisis seems to be growing ― but there’s no certainty of resulting international pressure from governments like the United States that experts see as essential to forcing change.",
        "“There’s very few countries in the world that have been vocal about the Uighur situation, even historically,” said Sean Roberts, a George Washington University professor and former U.S. Agency for International Development official. “The United States might have more leverage over China than any other country that might seek to sanction China but China also has a lot of leverage over the [U.S.] economically … I really think that in the end this can only be addressed by the [U.N.], which requires a lot of states coming together.”",
        "The dilemma for world leaders is that so much of the global economy now relies on China ― Chinese manufacturing, Chinese consumers and Chinese investment. Since the Chinese government is so enmeshed in the country’s economy, to criticize even policies far removed from business like human rights violations is to risk becoming a target of political retribution through economic means. Beijing has exploited that fear to avoid even acknowledging its excesses. In some cases, it has even successfully forced other governments to aid its repression by handing over Uighurs living within their borders.",
        "For years, particularly since a new top Chinese official took over the predominantly Uighur region of Xinjiang in 2016 and began instituting harsh new surveillance and measures like forcing families to host Communist Party officials in their homes, Beijing has felt it can treat the estimated 10 million Uighurs and other members of Muslim-minority communities as it pleases despite international law.",
        "“There has not been comparable foreign government pressure” to the criticism from rights groups and analysts, said Maya Wang, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch. “The Chinese government continues to act with impunity ... The camps’ very existence and construction shows the government thinks it can continue to do so.”",
        "In some cases, small but influential countries with business ties with China have helped shield it from criticism. Greece last summer blocked a disparaging European Union statement on China’s human rights record, and it aligned with Hungary against a separate EU statement on Chinese regional expansionism in 2016.",
        "The argument from Chinese partners like Greece is that such issues are better discussed in private. But advocates argue general silence around the targeting of Uighurs is the very reason their communities now exist in what U.N. expert Gay McDougall called a “no-rights zone.”",
        "“If one million Tibetans were arbitrarily detained in camps, there would be much stronger condemnation from the international community, which is a testament to the work of Tibetan advocacy groups around the world and people speaking strongly about rights issues there,” Peter Irwin of the World Uyghur Congress told HuffPost in an email. “This is perhaps why the Chinese government hasn’t gone to this extreme in Tibet.”",
        "“The reason that we’ve seen things escalate to this extent … is at least in part because of the lack of response from the international community over the last three decades when [Uighurs] were targeted by discriminatory policies,” he added.",
        "The Chinese policy in Xinjiang is now perhaps “more acute” than even the brutal upheavals during the country’s Cultural Revolution because it is planned in such detail and so specifically targeted on an ethnic and religious minority group, Roberts said.",
        "The U.S. has been one of the few governments to at least pay lip service to *the need for change, through its support of a well-respected Uighur news service run by state-funded broadcaster Radio Free Asia and a consistent line for years from officials and lawmakers.",
        "For Zubayra Shamseden, a Xinjiang native now working with the Uighur Human Rights Project in Washington, D.C., even that counts: “If there was no U.S. government or no U.N. to stand up, imagine what’s going to happen to Uighurs,” she said.",
        "Uighur groups estimate that more than a million members of the community now live outside China. They are primarily in Central Asia, but 10,000 are scattered around Europe, while about 5,000 are in the U.S., around 3,000 in Australia and up to 50,000 in Turkey, a country with which they share historical and cultural ties.",
        "As a result, the crisis affects citizens in foreign countries as well. With arrests of Uighurs in China having surpassed the 1 million mark, essentially every family has a member or a friend who has been detained, subjected to lectures about loyalty to the Communist Party or even torture, Shamseden said.",
        "“What’s happening inside the country is obstructing normal living” for Uighurs trying to live as productive citizens in countries abroad, she continued. In nations ranging from Egypt and Malaysia, they now also live in fear of being forced back to China.",
        "The perceived lack of concern for Uighurs is especially striking coming from governments in Muslim-majority countries, given their rallying around the cause of the Palestinians and to some degree that of the persecuted Rohingya minority in Myanmar. Some of the most powerful of those governments, like Iran and Pakistan, are hoping to benefit from China’s massive Belt and Road Initiative, a transnational development plan seeking to tie Europe and Asia closer together.",
        "“I’m not very religious, but at least I know the principles of our religion: If your brothers and sisters are suffering, you are too,” Shamseden said. “I don’t know why the Muslim world won’t really follow what that religion told me.”",
        "The spike in attention to the Uighur cause thanks to the U.N. session that ended Monday could create momentum, particularly because it comes a few months ahead of another big international review of China’s approach to human rights scheduled for November. With the Trump administration eager to confront China on all fronts as it ramps up its trade war, Washington could see a benefit to highlighting the issue even more, for instance by using evidence of mass detention to place sanctions on powerful Chinese officials, Roberts said.",
        "But the Trump administration has made that task potentially more difficult through its withdrawal from the U.N. Human Rights Council, which forfeited its official role in the November review. That makes it more important for governments like those in Europe to speak out, said Sarah Brooks, a program manager at the International Service for Human Rights.",
        "Still, she and other experts believe the unprecedented U.N. finding could make China so wary of further criticism and damaging revelations that the government will become a little more receptive to external calls for change.",
        "“You can’t necessarily stop a government from oppressing its own people,” Roberts said. “It’s a question of whether the tide could be turned to at least put enough pressure on China to … at the very least shut down those camps.”"

        "LAS VEGAS (AP) — Dave Dave, a respected Las Vegas artist who was badly scarred as a boy when his father tried to burn him to death in Southern California, has died. He was 42.",
        "Dave, who was born David Rothenberg, died on July 15 at Sunrise Hospital in Las Vegas, Clark County Coroner John Fudenberg said Wednesday.",
        "The cause of his death awaited results of toxicology and other tests and a police investigation, the coroner said.",
        "Dave was a close friend of Michael Jackson, who met him after the boy survived a 1983 attack that left him with burns over 90 percent of his body.",
        "Dave was 6 years old when his father, Charles Rothenberg, gave him a sleeping pill, doused his bed with kerosene and lit it in a Buena Park motel room near Disneyland during a bitter custody fight. The father fled.",
        "The boy underwent numerous skin grafts and was left disfigured but refused to define himself as a victim.",
        "“There is a lot that happens in people’s lives, but that doesn’t define them as a human being, it makes them stronger,” Dave told the Las Vegas Review-Journal in 2016.",
        "Dave “grabbed hold of life with a sense of urgency and passion,” Mike Watkiss, a family friend, told the Orange County Register. “He put people at peace, he brought people together. A guy who had no reason to trust anyone other than his mother was amazingly trusting.”",
        "“To have gone through what he had gone through as a child at the hands of his father, and to lead a life as rich as he did and as creative and as caring and as giving as he did, I think is amazing,” Watkiss said, speaking on behalf of his mother, Marie.",
        "Dave was 19 when he met his father in prison — their first contact since the attack.",
        "“It was very cathartic to be able to look my dad in the face and tell him exactly what was on my mind,” Dave told the Review-Journal. “A lot of people don’t get a chance to do that, to face the person who hurt them.”",
        "Charles Rothenberg spent less than seven years of a 13-year sentence in prison for attempted murder. He went on to amass a criminal record for robbery and other crimes, eventually being sentenced in 2007 to 25 years to life in prison in California."

        "Default.",
        "That word carries a lot of weight in the world of student loans. Last year, 1 million federal student loan borrowers defaulted on their loans, which means they failed to make a payment within 270 days of the due date. It’s expected that almost 40 percent of borrowers will default by 2023, according to a report by the Brookings Institution.",
        "Defaulting on your loans can lead to some pretty serious consequences, from poor credit to wage garnishment. So if you feel like your student loan payments are becoming unmanageable, it’s a good idea to work out some sort of solution with your lender before it’s too late.",
        "The only problem? If you have private student loans, you’ll probably have a much harder time than with federal lenders. But mentioning the possibility of default might help get the ball rolling.",
        "Federal vs. Private Student Loan Default",
        "When you default on a student loan that was issued by the federal government, your credit score will take a major hit and the loan will be sent to a collections agency, which can charge a fee as high as 40 percent of the balance. You also could have your wages or tax return garnished.",
        "But the good news for federal student loan borrowers is that there are several programs in place to help prevent this situation. “You have a lot of flexibility,” said Adam Minsky, a Massachusetts-based lawyer whose practice is devoted solely to helping student loan borrowers. For instance, borrowers can pursue payment plans that are tied to their income. “This means if you’re experiencing a financial hardship or a reduction in income, you have built-in ways of lowering payments,” Minsky said.",
        "He also noted that federal loans come with pretty generous deferment and forbearance options, which let you pause payments for a variety of reasons. And if a borrower does default, there’s an option to rehabilitate the loans and get back in good standing.",
        "That’s not the case for private student loans, which are issued by private financial institutions and therefore don’t come with any federal benefits or protections. In fact, these loans might not offer much payment flexibility at all ― it’s up to individual lenders to set their own policies.",
        "“[Private loans] have basically one payment plan, with no real flexibility beyond that, and pretty limited forbearance options,” Minsky said.",
        "And unlike federal loans, private student loans can enter into default in as little as 90 days of nonpayment. Borrowers can actually be sued by their lenders for the balance.",
        "Negotiating A Payment Plan With A Private Lender",
        "So what are your options if you have private student loans but can’t afford the payments?",
        "It’s generally not possible to settle your private loan balance for less than you owe, especially if you’ve been making your payments in full and on time. But because it’s in the lender’s best interest to collect on all the loans it issues, there’s a chance it might work out a deal with you if it believes you will likely default.",
        "“In some cases, some lenders will offer a settlement when the private loan account is severely delinquent and nearing default,” said Minsky. However, this situation isn’t common and the deals aren’t too generous. Plus, if you can’t afford your payments, it’s highly unlikely you’ll be able to come up with the cash to settle.",
        "But that’s not the end of the road. “Some private loan companies will offer very temporary types of options,” Minsky explained, noting that they might offer some sort of interest-only plan or payment reduction.",
        "For example, SoFi offers student loan borrowers the Unemployment Protection Program. In the event you lose your job, SoFi will let you put your loans in forbearance in three-month increments, with a cap of 12 months over the life of the loan. Sallie Mae also offers forbearance to borrowers experiencing financial hardship as long as they can make a good-faith payment of $50 on each account.",
        "However, in general, “It’s usually a very tedious and time-consuming process for borrowers,” Minsky said. “They usually have to provide an enormous amount of detail in terms of all their finances ― their income, their expenses ― and for their co-signers as well.” Minsky also pointed out that all this detailed information could end up being used against you if the lender decides not work out a plan with you and the loan ends up going to collections.",
        "In the end, negotiating with a private student loan company is tough, time-consuming and might not work out in your favor. But as Minsky points out, “In my experience, lenders are looking for evidence of severe financial hardship.” So if that sounds like you, it’s worth telling your lender that you’re in danger of defaulting. They just might listen."

        "As cranes moved in to shift truck-sized chunks of broken concrete, hundreds of firefighters searched for survivors, while public shock and grief turned to anger over the state of the 1.2 km-long bridge, completed in 1967 and overhauled two years ago.",

        "United Nations human rights experts made global headlines in a session that concluded Monday when they said they believe China is holding 1 million members of a Muslim minority group in secret prison camps.",
        "It’s a scale of tyranny that’s hard to imagine — a sprawling system of detentions for political “re-education” and a growing surveillance network outside the camps, ostensibly the only possible response to the risk of terrorism. But despite the Chinese government’s vast, often brutal attempts to control what the world knows about its repression, the U.N. announcement is also proof that Chinese citizens, journalists and advocacy groups are succeeding in long-shot efforts to get the truth out.",
        "The Uighurs, the ethnic group targeted by China’s ruling Communist Party, “have realized that it doesn’t help to be quiet,” said Zubayra Shamseden, the Chinese outreach coordinator at the Uyghur Human Rights Project. Just days ago, she heard from one more Uighur willing to volunteer his family’s story for the first time because his brother, a Communist Party loyalist with whom he had long squabbled over politics, had disappeared.",
        "China has been wary of the 10 million Muslim, predominantly Uighur residents of its northwestern Xinjiang province for decades. Beijing ramped up security checks and forced integration with the country’s Han Chinese majority amid global fears following the 9/11 attacks; it argues that without those measures the Uighurs and related communities would join Islamist extremists or separatist groups that have killed hundreds.",
        "But the current wave of repression has a clear beginning: 2016, when Chinese President Xi Jinping put Chen Quanguo, an official who previously managed tight Chinese control in Tibet, in charge of the region.",
        "Since then, Uighurs and foreigners tracking the events in Xinjiang have developed more discreet strategies to smuggle out information, as China has arrested family members of people speaking out and become more audacious in denying that there is any crackdown at all.",
        "The Uighurs within China ― who now experience sudden arrests, restrictions on their use of Muslim names or traditional dress, facial scanning on trips to buy groceries and state-sponsored spying by neighbors ― have a few ways to share what they’re going through.",
        "For some time, scores were managing to leave Xinjiang and provide firsthand accounts once they reached relative safety in the countries of Central Asia or the West, according to Maya Wang of Human Rights Watch. But China has tightened border controls, so it’s now been a year since most Uighurs have been able to leave the southern parts of the region where they are concentrated. Meanwhile, the Kazakh Muslims who are more common in the north have faced new restrictions for the past six months, she said.",
        "Today, reporters and activists on the ground are still collecting and sharing information on government excesses. They get it to the outside world through contact with three groups that often overlap and communicate with each other: expatriate Uighurs, experts on human rights, and the international media.",
        "Communication with the hundreds of thousands of Uighurs living abroad mostly takes place via the ubiquitous (and government-approved) Chinese messaging app WeChat, Shamseden said; telephone conversations inspire less confidence because of assumed wiretaps. Both methods involve using previously agreed-upon code words and signals the authorities might not know about, a key tactic since, per Wang, the Chinese government can deem any interaction with people outside the province a basis for arrest. Reuniting in person is only an option for some — the government rarely issues visas to visit China to Uighurs who are now foreign citizens, according to Shamseden.",
        "Expatriate Uighurs have become more willing to share what they hear as they have come to feel anyone can be affected by the government’s collective punishment, and because they’ve learned they have little other recourse: China won’t even tell them if family members are still alive.",
        "“It’s deep, deep suffering. … The only thing they can do is provide as much information as they can,” Shamseden said.",
        "Verifying those stories can be tricky because they travel far from their origin, and more dramatic allegations might be readily believed by people who have not been in the region for some time, Wang said.",
        "“I don’t blame people saying things even if it’s fourth-hand, because they only know that, and it’s horrible that the Chinese government wouldn’t give people more information,” she added. “I do take it into account because it’s useful for reference, and then we try to go to the source.”",
        "Her organization was one of many to submit reports that, along with China’s own brief, formed the basis of the U.N. experts’ judgment.",
        "Firsthand information also quietly reaches the U.N. through the work of a group called the International Service for Human Rights, which finds ways for officials and analysts to learn about rights violations directly from activists and caseworkers in Xinjiang (and elsewhere). They improvise to avoid issues like risky public naming of sources or bureaucratic inflexibility, the group’s Sarah Brooks told HuffPost.",
        "And deeply reported media coverage is crucial to connecting the dots too. Radio Free Asia, a U.S.-funded broadcaster, has run a Uighur-focused service for 20 years; based in Washington, the 12-person team has used extensive contacts in Xinjiang to break major scoops on the crisis, including the first reporting on the existence of the detention centers last spring and confirmation of deaths in the camps. China has responded by targeting the families of six staff members. The nearly 40 people arrested in these sweeps include elderly parents, siblings, in-laws, and nieces and nephews.",
        "“We’ve been taking cues from [the journalists] because it’s a very delicate situation,” said Rohit Mahajan, Radio Free Asia’s public affairs director. He noted that Chinese state-owned media has publicly blamed RFA’s reporters for instigating riots in 2009 and in 2014.",
        "Reporters with The Associated Press, BuzzFeed and Foreign Policy have published deep investigations as well, often by carefully parsing China’s own comments and public documents like government contracting requests, and U.S.-based journalist Bethany Allen-Ebrahimian this week revealed the expansion of Chinese surveillance of Uighurs to American soil. Though China currently has more than 40 journalists behind bars, among them at least a dozen Muslims, some Chinese reporters take the risk to provide fresh information or travel into the carefully protected region, Shamseden said.",
        "Taken together, the public picture stands in stark contrast to Communist Party propaganda about progress in Xinjiang.",
        "“I think the Chinese government is feeling the heat,” Wang said."

        "SEOUL/TAIPEI ― People in South Korea and Taiwan unveiled monuments and staged protests on Tuesday to mark Japan’s wartime use of “comfort women”, a euphemism for girls and women forced to work in Japan’s wartime brothels.",
        "In South Korea, a new monument was unveiled as part of its first “Memorial Day for Japanese Forces’ Comfort Women Victims,” which threatens to exacerbate a sensitive diplomatic issue with Japan, South Korea’s neighbor and a key ally of the United States in efforts to contain North Korea.\n\n“My hope is that this issue will not lead to a diplomatic dispute between South Korea and Japan. I also do not think that this will be solved by a bilateral diplomatic solution,” South Korean President Moon Jae-in said in commemoration of the day.\n\nMoon said the issue involves “the entire world” and human rights of women as a whole, and pledged the South Korean government will respect the women as the main parties of the issue, and pursue commemorative projects to restore their honor and dignity including discovery, preservation and propagation of records.",
        "Japan has said the issue was resolved by a 2015 deal, struck by a previous, conservative South Korean administration, under which Japan apologized to the victims and provided 1 billion yen ($9.03 million) to a fund to support them.\n\nBut South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s administration has spotlighted the emotionally-charged issue and has called for Japan to do more, despite backing down in January from formally renegotiating the deal.\n\nIn March, Moon described Japan’s wartime use of comfort women as “crimes against humanity”, with Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga calling Moon’s remarks “extremely regrettable.”\n\nTokyo has protested over other existing monuments in South Korea dedicated to comfort women, including one in front of the Japanese embassy in Seoul, as well as the move late last year to establish a day to remember comfort women.\n\nAugust 14 was chosen because on August 14, 1991, South Korean comfort woman victim Kim Hak-sun became the first to give a public testimony about her experience, according to the country’s Ministry of Gender Equality and Family.\n\nA think-tank funded by the South Korean government devoted to researching the issue also opened earlier this month.\n\nThe comfort women issue has been a regular cause for contention between Japan and neighbors including China and North and South Korea since the war.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, over 50 activists joined a sit-in protest in front of Japan’s de facto embassy in Taiwan’s capital, Taipei, asking for a formal apology and demanding monetary compensation for Taiwanese who were forced to work in its wartime brothels.\n\n“Japanese government should apologize,” the crowd shouted, wearing black shirts with their faces covered by white masks.\n\nA bronze statue symbolizing comfort women was also unveiled in the southern Taiwanese city of Tainan on Tuesday morning, according to Taiwan’s leading newspaper United Daily News.\n\nThe unveiling, attended by former President Ma Ying-jeou, was organized by a local group and had nothing to do with the city government, an official from Tainan’s Department of Information and International Relations told Reuters.\n\nJapan colonized the Korean peninsula between 1910 and 1945 and occupied parts of China before and after the war.\n\nJapan says the matter of compensation for the South Korean women was settled under a 1965 treaty. It says that in 2015, it agreed to provide the funds to help them heal “psychological wounds”.\n\n($1 = 110.7900 yen)"

        "ANKARA (Reuters) - President Tayyip Erdogan on Monday accused “economic terrorists” of plotting to harm Turkey by spreading false reports and said they would face the full force of the law, as authorities launched investigations of those suspected of involvement.",
        "The lira currency, which has lost more than 40 percent against the U.S. dollar this year, pulled back from a record low of 7.24 earlier on Monday after the central bank pledged to provide liquidity, but it remained under selling pressure and its meltdown continued to rattle global markets.\n\n“There are economic terrorists on social media,” Erdogan told a gathering of Turkish ambassadors at the presidential palace in Ankara, adding that the judiciary and financial authorities were taking action in response.\n\n“They are truly a network of treason,” he added. “We will not give them the time of day... We will make those spreading speculations pay the necessary price”.\n\nErdogan, who gained sweeping new powers following his re-election in June, said rumors had been spread that authorities might impose capital controls in response to the slump in the currency, which tumbled as much as 18 percent on Friday alone.\n\nThe interior ministry said it had so far identified 346 social media accounts carrying posts about the exchange rate that it said created a negative perception of the economy. It said it would take legal measures against them but did not say what these would be.\n\nSeparately, the Istanbul and Ankara prosecutor’s offices launched investigations into individuals suspected of being involved in actions that threaten Turkey’s economic security, broadcaster CNN Turk and state news agency Anadolu reported.",
        "Turkey’s Capital Markets Board (SPK) and financial crime board have also said they would take legal steps against those who spread misinformation about financial institutions and firms, or reports that the government would seize foreign-currency deposits.\n\nEarlier on Monday, Finance Minister Berat Albayrak, who is also Erdogan’s son-in-law, said Turkey would start rolling out an economic action plan on Monday.\n\nAlbayrak stressed the importance of budget discipline, and ruled out any seizure or conversion of dollar-denominated bank deposits into lira.\n\nEconomists say the lira’s fall is due to worries about Erdogan’s influence over the economy, his repeated calls for lower interest rates, and worsening ties with the United States over the detention of a Christian pastor and other disputes.\n\nErdogan reiterated on Monday his view that the currency’s crash had no economic basis, saying that U.S. sanctions imposed on Turkey over the terrorism trial of the pastor, Andrew Brunson, represented a “stab in the back” by a NATO ally.\n\nThe lira stood at 6.89 against the U.S. dollar at 1511 GMT - after Erdogan’s comments - up from a record low of 7.24 to the dollar reached in early Monday trade."

        "In what’s been described as one of the world’s most comprehensive plastic bans, Dominica intends to prohibit all commonly used plastic and styrofoam food containers and utensils, including straws, forks and knives, by January, the country’s prime minister said recently.",
        "Dominica — nicknamed the Nature Island for its lush rainforests and diverse flora and fauna — needs to act decisively to protect itself from plastic pollution, Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit said in a budget address late last month.",
        "“We must in every way deserve and reflect that designation,” Skerrit said of the Nature Island appellation. “The issue of solid waste management affects that perception and we continue to grapple with it.”",
        "The list of banned items has yet to be finalized, but Skerrit identified plastic utensils, as well as styrofoam cups and containers, as items that will be restricted.",
        "The plastic ban is part of Dominica’s initiative to become the world’s first climate-resilient nation — an effort first announced last year after Hurricane Maria devastated the island.",
        "“Our devastation is so complete that our recovery has to be total,” Skerrit said in October. “And so we have a unique opportunity to be an example to the world, an example of how an entire nation rebounds from disaster and how an entire nation can be climate resilient for the future.”",
        "He added: “We did not choose this opportunity. We did not wish it. Having had it thrust upon us, we have chosen actively and decisively to be that example to the world.”",
        "Dominica’s plastic ban will likely have a positive impact on the country’s wildlife, including migrating sperm whales that spend their summers in the warm waters around the island, National Geographic noted.",
        "Shane Gero, founder of the Dominica Sperm Whale Project, told the magazine that he’s witnessed plastic floating in the island’s waters and the disturbing sight of whale calves playing “with these clamshell styrofoam lunch boxes.”",
        "Dominica is the latest in a string of countries — and corporations — that have recently vowed to take steps to counter the growing tide of plastic waste.",
        "The European Union this year unveiled an ambitious new proposal that would reduce or outrightly prohibit many everyday single-use plastic items. The U.K. has proposed banning cotton buds, plastic drinking straws and several other single-use plastics by 2019.",
        "France recently pledged to use only recycled plastic nationwide by 2025. On Sunday, a French government official said the country plans to introduce a penalty system that would increase the costs of consumer goods that come with packaging made of non-recycled material. In 2016, France became the first country in the world to ban disposable plastic cups and dishes. That law will take effect in 2020."

        "SEOUL, Aug 13 (Reuters) - North and South Korea agreed to hold a summit in Pyongyang in September, the latest step forward in cross-border ties this year after more high-level talks on Monday, the South’s Unification Ministry said.",
        "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in met in April and May at the border truce village of Panmunjom, within the demilitarized zone (DMZ) that separates the two Koreas, and agreed that the next summit in autumn would be held in the North Korean capital.",
        "The two Koreas held a fresh round of talks at the DMZ on Monday to discuss the third summit, led by the South’s Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon and Ri Son Gwon, chairman of the North’s reunification committee.",
        "Ri said both sides agreed on specific details, including the date for the summit, but declined to elaborate.",
        "However, again without giving details, he said it was important to clear “obstacles” that prevent inter-Korean relations from moving forward as planned.",
        "“If the issues that were raised at the talks aren’t resolved, unexpected problems could emerge and the issues that are already on the schedule may face difficulties,” Ri said at the end of the meeting.",
        "Cho also refused to specify the problems raised by Ri but said there was talk of humanitarian issues and ways to improve inter-Korean relations.",
        "He said the next summit in Pyongyang would help improve cross-border ties by allowing the two leaders to discuss the North’s denuclearisation and how to establish peace on the Korean peninsula.",

        "U.S. officials familiar with the talks, however, told Reuters that North Korea had yet to agree to a timeline for eliminating its nuclear arsenal or to disclose its size, which U.S. estimates have put at between 30 and 60 warheads."

        "When Hala Al-Dosari told her father in 2013 that she planned to join the biggest-ever protests against the ban on women driving in Saudi Arabia, he told her she would need to use someone else’s car ― he was too old to collect theirs from the police station if she got arrested. She agreed, but warned him he might have to go to the station anyway to sign a form for her release. She guessed he would relent. “Of course I’m going to come,” he grudgingly told her.",
        "Five years later, Saudi Arabia is still using its sprawling and well-funded government apparatus to enforce misogyny more harshly than any other internationally recognized regime. The driving ban is dead, but the legal code requiring more than 5 million adult Saudi women to seek a male guardian’s permission for almost any activity remains in place ― and in the last few months authorities have jailed some of the kingdom’s loudest advocates for gender equality. In a break from decades of quieter repression, Saudi leadership is making a big deal of the arrests at home, where the women activists are labeled traitors, and abroad: Since Sunday, it has ramped up a fight with Canada, one of the kingdom’s many Western partners, over Canadian criticism of the crackdown.",
        "The unprecedented escalation is a choice, analysts and former U.S. officials familiar with Riyadh’s decision-making say. It seems quixotic ― but Al-Dosari sees a logic there. The kingdom’s sexism and its particular brand of authoritarianism go hand in hand. One cannot work without the other. And so as the country’s quasi-ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, signals that he is centralizing power, including by expressing Saudi nationalism in a form marketed as tough and masculine, it makes sense that he is doubling down on the gender divide ― and targeting women who doubt his promises of reform.",
        "“To maintain the status quo, you need this system of hierarchy,” she said. That structure treats the head of a family ― always a man, even in situations of, say, a son with a widowed mother or a brother and his adult sisters ― as responsible for dealings with the autocratic state, entrusted with ensuring that those in his household follow rules both codified and unspoken.",
        "“If everyone has equal rights, if men and women can do exactly the same things, it will be difficult to justify one having extra privileges,” Al-Dosari, a scholar and activist now in the U.S., continued. She and others pushing for equality say those calls aren’t subversive; they’re simply trying to better serve the Saudi people.",
        "But worry about what change would mean for those in power is a key reason why the system of male guardianship and other restrictions on women remain in place, even as the prince lifts other strictures historically deemed sacrosanct in Saudi Arabia by ultraconservative clerics close to the ruling family. The prince is happy to end barriers on, say, going to the movies. His argument, devoured and repeated by his fans in the West, is that what’s holding Saudi Arabia back is its relationship with a certain brand of Islam, not limits on personal freedom ― so who needs their full rights, especially ones never enjoyed by women, anyway?",
        "His vision of the kingdom’s future involves women becoming more free to the exact extent that serves his goal of expanding the Saudi economy beyond oil. And it makes up for the absence of the notorious religious police by giving government officials new ways to attack citizens’ private information, seize their property and trap them beyond the reach of relatives, lawyers or even well-connected friends.",
        "Saudi women have struggled for equality for decades. Those who have led the country’s determined feminist movement, raising their voices and liaising with allies abroad to create the pressure that forced the prince to lift the driving ban, have often been those with supportive families, Al-Dosari said. Her father, she noted, was broad-minded because of his education. She also pointed to the progressive background of Aziza al-Yousef, an academic arrested in May. And there’s Samar Badawi, one of the two activists whose July arrests Canada commented on. She used to be married to a human rights lawyer and has a brother who publicly promotes gender equality. (Both men are now also in Saudi prisons.)",
        "For others, obtaining permission to speak out can involve a major battle or simply be impossible because of family opinions or fear of state retribution, the activist told HuffPost. “I really honor and respect those women because they put themselves in inconvenience,” she said. “But then people see how resilient and how passionate you are.”",
        "Outsiders trying to help Saudi women win a fair shake ― not as part of international conspiracies like those the kingdom is now railing about, but because of their own moral convictions and often a concern for the kingdom’s future stability ― see that bind as a central problem.",
        "Equal treatment under the law would be truly transformative, according to Gina Abercrombie-Winstanley, a State Department veteran who in 2002 became the first woman ever to head up a diplomatic mission in Saudi Arabia.",
        "Saudi commentators have a point in saying, as they do now during the fight with Canada, that misogyny is hardly unique to the kingdom.",
        "In other nations, however, when women seek recourse from abuse or discrimination, “the difference is they could choose to do it on their own without having a male somewhere say yes,” said Abercrombie-Winstanley, who later served as ambassador to Malta before quitting the agency last year. In the kingdom, justice is nearly impossible without “a benevolent male somewhere,” she added.",
        "Western governments that deal closely with the Saudis are by now well aware of how careful they must be in calibrating their support for human rights. “The bottom line was not make it worse,” Abercrombie-Winstanley said. But they saw success stories ― she recalled the time that U.S. diplomats convened a meeting of scores of teachers and administrators from across the country, many of them women, who were working on special education with American help. Such mixing of men and women would have been illegal in public at the time. “Everyone left at 2:30 in the morning,” the former ambassador said.",
        "The key thing was that suddenly women were meeting others they had only ever heard of, forging relationships and whisper networks they might use in the future to help women in need or achieve shared, small-scale goals ― being empowered individuals, not subsidiaries of family units cowed by the state.",
        "Foreign critics of the kingdom’s repression have sought change for years. Sometimes the mere fact of who they are makes their comments especially striking and highlights how unique Saudi state sexism is, as was the case with Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland and previously Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallström. They’re most powerful when, as Freeland did, they acknowledge Saudis’ own movements, showing that they’re not exporting a foreign model but a baseline of respect and dignity.",
        "For that to work means sometimes being outspoken; even as the new Saudi leadership signals its distaste for public criticism, it’s done little to show that private urging, on issues ranging from human rights to the devastating Western-backed war in Yemen, works.",
        "“When we speak, we publicly reach civil society and citizens, we show them where we stand. … We care about the people in Saudi and we feel their pain and we wish for them to be able to express themselves,” said Marietje Schaake, an influential Dutch lawmaker in the European Parliament who rallied support for an official European Union endorsement of the Canadian position. (On Saturday, the EU said it had contacted the Saudis to seek information about the detainees Canada commented on and to emphasize the importance of human rights defenders.)",
        "For female Saudis considering the way the situation is developing, the public attention might be worth the risk of stoking nationalist (and male) anger. If nothing else, it at least highlights a disconnect with the message of Saudi progress that’s been spread around the world and shows there are some limits for the leadership.",
        "“The state has already rounded up leaders in business and media with little to no cost,” Al-Dosari said, referring to a dramatic campaign of arrests last fall that was largely met with crickets in the West. As the authorities mull future clampdowns, “it makes a difference if there’s little or no cost for rounding up women who hold the same views the government is now promoting.”",
        "This story has been updated to note the EU’s latest contact with the Saudis."

        "TANJUNG, Indonesia (AP) — Scientists say the powerful Indonesian earthquake that killed nearly 400 people lifted the island it struck by as much as 25 centimeters (10 inches).",
        "The National Disaster Mitigation Agency said on Saturday that 387 people died, jumping from the 321 it reported the previous day, as search and rescue teams continued to sift through the rubble and people already buried by relatives are accounted for.",
        "Using satellite images of Lombok from the days following the Aug. 5 quake, scientists from NASA and the California Institute of Technology’s joint rapid imaging project made a ground deformation map and measured changes in the island’s surface.",
        "In the northwest of the island near the epicenter, the rupturing faultline lifted the earth by a quarter of a meter. In other places it dropped by 5-15 centimeters (2-6 inches).",
        "NASA said satellite observations can help authorities respond to earthquakes and other natural or manmade disasters.",
        "Almost 390,000 people, about 10 percent of Lombok's population, are homeless or displaced after the earthquake, which damaged and destroyed about 68,000 homes.",
        "Disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said three districts in the north of Lombok still haven't received any assistance. The governor of West Nusa Tenggara province, which includes Lombok, has extended the official emergency period by two weeks to Aug. 25.",
        "\"It's estimated the death toll will continue to grow because there are still victims who are suspected of being buried by landslides and collapsed buildings and there are deaths that have not been recorded,\" Nugroho said.",
        "The number of evacuees fluctuates, he said, because not all evacuee points have been counted and some people tend to their gardens and properties during the day and return to the tent camps at night. Some people don't need to evacuate because their homes aren't damaged but have come to refugee centers because they feel traumatized.",
        "Nearly a week since the 7.0 quake, Lombok is still reeling but glimmers of normality were returning for some and devout villagers are making plans for temporary replacements of mosques that were flattened.",
        "In Tanjung, one of the worst affected districts in the hard-hit north of the island, a food market opened Saturday and locals bought vegetables and fish. Some shops also opened for business despite being in damaged buildings.",
        "“I had to borrow money from someone to buy morning glory to be resold here,” said Natbudi, one of the market vendors. “If I just stay at the camp and don’t come here to sell then I don’t have money to buy rice.”",
        "Lombok, a popular and less developed tourist destination than neighboring Bali, was hit by three strong quakes in little over a week and has endured more than 500 aftershocks.",
        "A July 29 quake killed 16 people. An aftershock measuring magnitude 5.9 on Thursday caused panic, more damage and more than two dozen injuries.",
        "Villager Sunarto, buying fish at the makeshift market, said it was a relief to do something ordinary.",
        "“I feel happy and thank God that finally the market is open,” he said. “We can buy our needs while waiting for the situation to get back to normal even though we’re still worried.”",
        "Indonesia is prone to earthquakes because of its location on the “Ring of Fire,” an arc of volcanoes and fault lines in the Pacific Basin. In December 2004, a massive magnitude 9.1 earthquake off Sumatra triggered a tsunami that killed 230,000 people in a dozen countries.",

        "Streamline recommends “The ABC Murders” on Amazon Prime this week. Amazon debuted this new show on Feb. 1.\n\nPremise: Based on an Agatha Christie novel, this takes place in the 1930s and tells the story of a once-famous detective who longs for his glory years while spending much of his time alone. A serial killer starts to send messages to the detective, which sets off a cat-and-mouse mystery that, of course, involves murder.\n\nStars: Rupert Grint and John Malkovich.",
        "How excited should you be? Amazon doesn’t have as many British crime shows as Netflix, so adding this highly stylized detective thriller should be a welcome move for fans of that genre. Malkovich elevates everything he stars in (even with a ridiculous accent this time around) and Grint looks nothing like Grint in this role, so that’s kind of fun. Although this show wallows in grimness, clever moments of humor peek through occasionally.\n\nAny reasons to be skeptical? This show plods along at a glacial pace. During multiple scenes, I wondered if my internet had slowed down and I was watching this at half-speed. The poor direction and dialogue make this hard to get through, so you really have to love detective thrillers to find enjoyment here. Sometimes I watch shows with hourlong episodes that feel too long, but it’s hard to say what should have been cut. That’s not the case here, as the show decides to spend a laughable amount of time focusing on shots of sinks and typewriters and other uninteresting inanimate objects.",

        "There is one interesting solution that most people don’t know about: virtual account numbers that you can get from your bank.",
        "Banks like Citibank, Bank of America and others — Doctor of Credit has a great list— allow customers to generate virtual credit card numbers that are linked to a real credit card account, but expire in a short time, say, a month. So while they are legitimate and can be used for a short time, nothing can be charged through them after a certain time. This makes them very useful for free trials.",
        "They also can be used for other things like budgeting, since they can be set to a specific dollar value, even though they’re not prepaid. (They just turn off.)",
        "Another option that works if you’re not a customer of those banks is Privacy.com, which lets you create virtual cards in a similar fashion. With this service, you can link your credit card to new virtual credit card numbers. Each one can have different limits, either cutting off free trials or making sure extra fees aren’t added to something you have agreed to pay for. You can also pause spending as well.",

And our American friends need to understand this,” he said, speaking on a trip to the Russian Far East.\n\nThe fate of the bill he was referring to is not certain.\n\nThe full U.S. Congress will not be back in Washington until September, and even then, congressional aides said they did not expect the measure would pass in its entirety.\n\nWhile it was difficult to assess so far in advance, they said it was more likely that only some of its provisions would be included as amendments in another piece of legislation, such as a spending bill Congress must pass before Sept. 30 to prevent a government shutdown."

        "A video showing a Brazilian man beating his wife and later dragging her dead body back to their apartment has ignited a fierce debate about domestic violence in the South American country.",
        "The video, caught by security cameras, shows Luís Felipe Manvailer hitting and kicking his wife of five years, Tatiane Spitzner, in their apartment building. The three-minute video was recorded on July 22 and publicly broadcast on Brazilian TV program Fantástico on Sunday, The New York Times reports.",
        "The security footage shows Manvailer assaulting Spitzner in a car in the parking garage of the couple’s apartment complex before he drags her out and chases her into an elevator. While on the elevator, the two struggle as Manvailer shoves Spitzner into the wall before the two exit to their fifth-floor apartment. Spitzner attempts to escape from Manvailer multiple times throughout the ordeal.",
        "The video then cuts to the security camera outside the apartment building where Spitzner is seen falling to her death. Manvailer is caught on camera retrieving Spitzner’s dead body and dragging her back up to the couple’s apartment. While in the elevator, Manvailer looks at himself in the mirror and appears to wipe his wife’s blood off his face. He later returns to the elevator to wipe blood off the floor and walls.",
        "Watch a part of the original video, posted online by local newspaper Tribuna do Paraná on Aug. 3, below. (To watch the full footage of the assault head here and here.)",
        "Warning: The below footage shows graphic violence.",
        "According to The New York Times, Manvailer was quickly apprehended by police and is currently being investigated for the murder of his wife. Manvailer denies killing Spitzner. He told police his wife jumped off the balcony, the Times reports.",
        "The video has sparked a heated debate about domestic abuse and the treatment of women in Brazil. Many Brazilians have taken to social media using the hashtag #metaAcolher, which translates to “stick a spoon in.” The phrase references a popular Brazilian saying: “When it’s a fight between husband and wife, don’t stick a spoon in,” which suggests outsiders should not get involved in a couple’s issues.",
        "According to a 2017 nationwide survey, nearly a third of Brazilian women reported they had experienced some sort of intimate partner violence ranging from beatings to attempted murder in the prior year.",
        "“The video just reflects the levels of violence we have been documenting,” Brazil director for Human Rights Watch Maria Laura Canineu told The New York Times. “What Brazil has to learn is that most of these cases are preventable. It is very rare that a murder is the first case of violence.”",
        "“It’s sad, but maybe something this brutal will wake people up to the reality of domestic abuse,” Canineu added. “Maybe it will mobilize them.”",

        "It appears that China’s war against Winnie the Pooh rages on.",
        "The latest casualty? The new Disney film “Christopher Robin,” which has reportedly been denied release in China.",
        "The lovable, portly bear has been a target of Chinese censors since at least 2013 when social media users began drawing comparisons between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Winnie the Pooh. A meme ― and symbol of political resistance ― was soon born, one that Chinese censors have been known to suppress online.",
        "The Hollywood Reporter suggested that Chinese officials blocked the release of “Christopher Robin,” a live-action/CGI movie starring Ewan McGregor, as part of the government’s crackdown on images of Pooh. As the magazine noted, the film is the second Disney movie to be denied release in China this year; the other was “Wrinkle in Time.”",
        "It’s possible that the new Pooh film was blocked for a less nefarious reason. As The Guardian noted, China only allows a limited number of foreign films to play in its theaters every year, so it’s possible that the movie simply didn’t make the cut.",
        "Chinese censors have, however, been ruthless in their scrubbing of Pooh material from the web. In June, references to both HBO and John Oliver were blocked on the Chinese Internet after the “Last Week Tonight” host challenged President Xi on a host of issues during his show, including human rights and China’s recent decision to abolish presidential limits. Oliver also teased Xi about the whole resemblance-to-Winnie-the-Pooh thing.",
        "“It’s true. Apparently, Xi Jinping is very sensitive about his perceived resemblance to Winnie the Pooh,” Oliver said. “And I’m not even sure it’s that strong a resemblance, to be honest. But the fact that he’s annoyed about it means that people will never stop bringing it up.”",
        "Chinese censors have been known to block any words or phrases deemed critical of Xi and the ruling Communist Party online. Following the removal of presidential limits from the Chinese constitution, censors began cracking down on mentions of George Orwell books and the word “disagree” on social media sites. The letter “N” was also briefly banned.",
        "Victor Mair, a University of Pennsylvania professor and Sinologist, suggested at the time that critics may have been using the term “N > 2,” with N (a signifier for an unknown quantity) referring to Xi’s possible terms in office.",
        "Pooh was also a victim of that purge."

        "WASHINGTON ― Saudi Arabia’s steadily escalating spat with Canada over a routine statement about human rights abuses shows that the kingdom, a longtime partner of the U.S. and other Western countries, wants to be more aggressive and less flexible in the face of the international criticism it has faced for years. That’s not surprising under the hyper-nationalist and messaging-obsessed crown prince who now dominates the country ― but it’s a big new dilemma for the governments that have spent years trying to balance the strategic relationship with their commitments to uphold fundamental rights internationally.",
        "“The Saudis are clearly trying to shift the goal posts,” said Ned Price, a former White House spokesman under President Barack Obama who spent over a decade at the CIA. “In prior years we would have been saying very much the same thing [about rights violations], and the Saudis would have grumbled under their breath…. A fairly mild statement is being met with a pretty outlandish response.”",
        "Managing the public perception of the decades-old partnership between Saudi Arabia and liberal democracies, such as the U.S. and Canada, has never been easy. Western citizens don’t like what they hear about Saudi Arabia ― that women need a man’s permission to travel or enroll in school, or that crimes are punished with amputations and beheadings. And international audiences question America’s complaints about authoritarianism in other countries, including Saudi nemesis Iran, because its chumminess with Riyadh suggests a double standard, making it look like those complaints are not rooted in a genuine belief that rights must be universal.",
        "For officials and experts trying to sustain the bond because of its value in trade, counterterrorism cooperation and projecting U.S. influence globally, the ability to at least say something about excesses is vital ― a tool that the kingdom has long understood the importance of and even sometimes reacted positively to. To lose even that option because the Saudis have now decided it violates their sovereignty makes justifying a Saudi-friendly foreign policy a lot harder. “These are rhetorical demands. This is not sending a team of special operators to free political prisoners,” Price said.",
        "Instead of minimal nudging, the Trump administration has now placed the U.S. in the position of explicitly blessing repression by mimicking the president’s “very fine people on both sides” thinking. The administration is not choosing sides in the dispute and sees the countries as “both close allies,” a State Department official told HuffPost. (Though, in response to a later question, the official noted that the U.S. would “encourage the government of Saudi Arabia to respect due process.”)",
        "The substance of the dispute shows the extent of the change the Saudis feel empowered to seek.",
        "On Aug. 2, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said she was “very alarmed” that Saudi authorities jailed award-winning human rights activist Samar Badawi, and the next day, her department said it was “gravely concerned” about Badawi and scores of other activists recently placed behind bars. Both statements called for the dissidents to be released. Since Sunday, Saudi authorities have expelled Canada’s ambassador, frozen future trade with the country and said they will relocate thousands of government-funded Saudi students at Canadian universities.",
        "“This behavior is so unlike what we would have seen in Saudi Arabia before King Abdullah died ... there would have been no statement at all from the old Saudi Arabia,” said Perry Cammack, an Obama-era State Department official, referring to the era before King Salman took the throne in 2016 and brought with him his son, now-Crown Prince Muhammed bin Salman.",
        "There are precedents for harsh Saudi reactions to Western government condemnation. In 2015, Riyadh got Sweden’s business elite to successfully pressure its center-left government over a minister’s complaint that the Saudi flogging of a blogger was “medieval,” and the kingdom slashed business with Germany earlier this year over a German official saying it treated neighboring Lebanon as “a pawn.” And Saudi columnist Mohammed Alsulami argued to HuffPost that his country had particular reasons to react to the Canadian comments because they demanded an action (releasing the activists) and addressed a domestic issue (rather than a regional one, such as President Donald Trump’s December 2017 demand for Saudi humanitarian relief in Yemen).",
        "But former U.S. officials are united in skepticism of the claim that this level of squabble was merited over Canada’s use of the word “concerned,” a classic Western favorite to signal attention without major condemnation.",
        "“There’s nothing different or unique about the Canadian statements,” Price told HuffPost. “It’s an insane, epic overreaction,” former U.S. ambassador to Israel Daniel Shapiro wrote on Twitter.",
        "To Price, what’s different is the signaling from Washington under Trump, who’s praised crackdowns and personally bashed Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The former Obama aide is involved in a progressive advocacy group ― he’s got a perspective. Some Canadian analysts, however, publicly agree, particularly after the State Department remarks.",
        "That sense of impunity suggests ramifications far beyond a dispute between two countries that don’t have a huge amount to do with each other anyway. While the U.S. could easily adopt a tougher line under future administrations, per Price, the Saudi government will for the foreseeable future likely seek fresh ways to flex its muscles ― continuing a trend of failing to learn from foreign policy misses that is worrying experts and investors.",
        "“There is a much deeper question about what this means for Saudi Arabia’s trajectory,” Cammack said. “This kind of impetuosity and overreaction in my mind doesn’t necessarily bode well.”",
        "A pro-Saudi Twitter account shocked online observers of the fight on Monday by posting (and then soon deleting) a graphic that appeared to show a plane heading toward the Toronto skyline in a grim echo of the 9/11 attacks. Even more bizarre, and dramatic, consequences of the new attitude might lie ahead."

        "Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) on Sunday suggested that President Donald Trump appeared at a campaign rally in his state on Saturday without a direct invitation from the House candidate he came to tout.",
        "Kasich, speaking on ABC’s “This Week,” said he asked state Sen. Troy Balderson, the Republican candidate for a U.S. House seat in a Tuesday special election, point blank why he invited Trump to campaign for him at his event in Delaware County.",
        "“I asked him the other day, ‘Why are you bringing Trump in,’ said Kasich, who has been one of the GOP’s harshest critics of the president. Kasich said Balderson told him, “Well, I don’t have anything to do with it.”",
        "“I think Donald Trump decides where he wants to go,” Kasich said of the president’s appearance, where after introducing Balderson and praising him, he then focused of his own agenda and his litany of complaints about the media.",
        "“I think [Trump and his political advisers] think they are firing up the base,” at such rallies, added Kasich, who was among several establishment party leaders Trump defeated for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination.",
        "Attempts to reach Balderson’s team for comment on Sunday were not immediately successful.",
        "Balderson, who polls have shown faces a tough battle against Democrat Danny O’Connor in a district where the GOP traditionally has dominated, was introduced by Trump to the crowd as “really smart” and a “really hard worker.”",
        "The plaudits came two days after Trump mistakenly urged Republicans to vote in the special election for a someone not on its ballot ― GOP Rep. Steve Stivers. He represents a nearby district and is up for re-election on November’s ballot.",
        "Trump deleted the tweet naming Stivers and replaced it with one supporting Balderson.",
        "If O’Connor wins Tuesday vote, he would flip a House seat that has been held by the GOP since 1982. The seat was vacated by Republican Rep. Pat Tiberi in January."

        "FLIMS, Switzerland (Reuters) - All 20 people on board were killed when a small vintage plane crashed in the Swiss Alps, police said on Sunday.",
        "Three Austrians and 17 Swiss were on board the trimotor JU-52 aircraft, built in the late 1930′s as a military aircraft and later used to operate scenic and charter flights, when it crashed shortly before 5 p.m. (1500 GMT) on Saturday on the west side of the Piz Segnas mountain in the canton of Grissons.",
        "The plane had been returning from Locarno near Switzerland’s southern border.",
        "Police said those killed were couples from the Swiss cantons of Zurich, Thurgau, Lucerne, Schwyz, Zug and Vaud, along with a three-member family from Austria and three crew members from Thurgau and Zurich.",
        "“Yesterday was the worst day in the 36-year history of JU-Air,” the airline’s Chief Executive Kurt Waldmeier said at a news conference in nearby Flims on Sunday. “We have all suffered a very great loss.”",
        "Police said they were not aware of any distress call and had not yet determined the cause of the crash, which occurred hours after a family of four was killed when their small plane went down further west in the Alps.",
        "The investigation, complicated by the vintage plane’s lack of a “black box” flight recorder, will take several days.",
        "“One can ascertain that the aircraft hit the ground nearly vertically at high speed,” Daniel Knecht, who heads the aviation division of the Swiss Transportation Safety Investigation Board, said.",
        "Established in 1982, JU-Air offered sightseeing, charter and adventure flights with its three mid-century Junkers Ju-52 aircraft decommissioned by the Swiss Air Force and known affectionately in German as “Auntie Ju” planes.",
        "It was the first time the airline had experienced an accident that resulted in death or injury to passengers or crew members, Waldmeier said. The airline suspended flights until further notice.",
        "The plane that crashed had its last maintenance check in late July, Waldmeier said, at which time no defects had been found.",
        "The wreckage of the plane was in a basin at 2,450 meters (8,000 feet) above sea level surrounded on three sides by peaks, a Reuters witness said. Rescuers and helicopters were at the scene.",
        "The airspace above the crash site was closed by the Federal Office for Civil Aviation and access to popular hiking trails in the surrounding area was blocked.",

        "Jack Evans, chairman of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, had said that operating dedicated cars was among the options being considered for the rally next Sunday, The Washington Post reported. He said that officials had simply been exploring every idea with police to keep the peace between the white nationalists and expected counterprotesters.",
        "But a decision has been made that “Metro will not be having a separate train, or a separate car, or anything separate for anybody at this event,” Evans told NBC News 4 on Saturday.",

        "“We draw the line at giving special accommodation to hate groups and hate speech,” Jeter said. “We find it hypocritical... to make these unprecedented special accommodations for a hate group.”",
        "The union said that people of color make up “more than 80 percent of Local 689’s membership... the very people that the Ku Klux Klan and other white nationalist groups have killed, harassed and violated. The union has declared that it will not play a role in their special accommodation.”",
        "The “Unite the Right” event is being organized by the group behind the rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, last summer that led to violent clashes and the death of a counter-protester who was run down by a car. The Washington gathering has been promoted as a “white civil rights” rally “protesting civil rights abuse in Charlottesville.”",

Footage of the attack on social media showed him surrounded and beaten by nearly a dozen men in the city’s Dhanmondi neighborhood.",
        "The protests have become a serious embarrassment to the government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina ahead of a general election due in December. Her party is blaming the main opposition, led by Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, for using the student anger to create chaos for political gains. Political feuding between the two political leaders has dominated Bangladesh’s politics for more than a decade.",

        "The roads of Dhaka are a web of gridlock and chaos. Unlicensed drivers, unregistered vehicles and speeding buses are commonplace, police corruption is rife and traffic enforcement often nonexistent. At least 12,000 people die each year in road accidents in Bangladesh.",
        "The demonstrating students have stopped thousands of vehicles during the protests, including those of top officials, checking if the cars were registered and the drivers licensed."

That should be rewarded.”",

Amazon debuted this new show on Feb. 1.\n\nPremise: Based on an Agatha Christie novel, this takes place in the 1930s and tells the story of a once-famous detective who longs for his glory years while spending much of his time alone. A serial killer starts to send messages to the detective, which sets off a cat-and-mouse mystery that, of course, involves murder.\n\nStars: Rupert Grint and John Malkovich.",
        "How excited should you be? Amazon doesn’t have as many British crime shows as Netflix, so adding this highly stylized detective thriller should be a welcome move for fans of that genre. Malkovich elevates everything he stars in (even with a ridiculous accent this time around) and Grint looks nothing like Grint in this role, so that’s kind of fun. Although this show wallows in grimness, clever moments of humor peek through occasionally.\n\nAny reasons to be skeptical? This show plods along at a glacial pace. During multiple scenes, I wondered if my internet had slowed down and I was watching this at half-speed. The poor direction and dialogue make this hard to get through, so you really have to love detective thrillers to find enjoyment here. Sometimes I watch shows with hourlong episodes that feel too long, but it’s hard to say what should have been cut. That’s not the case here, as the show decides to spend a laughable amount of time focusing on shots of sinks and typewriters and other uninteresting inanimate objects.",

        "A top minister in Italy’s anti-establishment government has provoked condemnation from rights groups after calling for the repeal of an anti-fascist law that criminalizes inciting racial violence and hatred, as well as bans support for groups that carry out hate crimes.",
        "Law No. 205, commonly called the Mancino Law, was passed in 1993 as a means of prosecuting racist violence and hate speech. Italy’s family minister Lorenzo Fontana claimed in a Facebook post on Friday that the law was being used by “globalists” to promote “anti-Italian racism,” and should be abolished.",
        "Fontana is a member of the far-right Lega party, which formed a coalition government with the anti-establishment Five Star party following Italy’s elections earlier this year. While Five Star won more seats, Lega and its leader Matteo Salvini have become the more prominent force in Italian politics since the vote and set about shifting the government’s policies to the right.",
        "Salvini, who earlier this week tweeted a notorious quote from Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, has gleaned international attention after leading a government crackdown on migrant boat arrivals from Africa as well as clashing with the European Union over refugee policy.",
        "The Lega leader said on Friday that he supports scrapping the anti-fascism law, but that it’s not a priority and the government has no immediate plans to try and repeal it. Five Star leader Luigi di Maio stated that the law wasn’t up for debate.",
        "Italy, much like Germany, has extensive anti-discrimination and anti-fascism legislation that goes back to the period after World War II. Under the Mancino law, Italians who commit a crime can receive harsher sentences if the motive is deemed to be based on hatred of ethnicity, religion, nationality or race. The country also bans fascist propaganda if it is intended to revive the Fascist party.",
        "The Lega and Five Star have both opposed efforts in recent years to strengthen restrictions on fascist symbols and rhetoric, while at the same time rights groups have raised concern over growing extremism and racism in Italy.",
        "The Mancino Law has also been used in the past to prosecute members of the Lega party who have incited hatred against Muslims and minorities. Deputy mayor of Treviso and Lega member Giancarlo Gentilini was fined 4,000 euro in 2009 after calling for “a revolution against those who want to open up mosques and Islamic centers” and said he didn’t want black people “teaching our children.”",
        "While other far-right politicians backed Fontana’s proposal, Italy’s Jewish community leaders condemned the statement and emphasized that the law was a necessary bulwark against discrimination.",
        "“Abolishing the Mancino Law entails removing incitement to racial hatred as a punishable offense. This means disarming the Judiciary in a historical phase where anti-Semitism, racism and xenophobia are on the rise,” said Noemi Di Segni, the president of the Union of Italian Jewish Communities, in an interview with HuffPost Italia. “Far from annulling the Mancino Law, there is now an urgent need to strengthen the regulatory provisions against all forms of racism and anti-Semitism.”",
        "Di Segni criticized Fontana’s effort as an attempt to downplay Italy’s past and a threat to the country’s principles of anti-fascism and tolerance.",
        "“A democratic community has no future without a historical memory,” said Di Segni.",
        "The head of Rome’s Jewish community, Ruth Dureghello, also condemned the proposal.",
        "“Eighty years after the (Fascist) Racial Laws, it would be good to combat discrimination instead of continuously winking at neo-fascism,” said Dureghello, according to ANSA news agency.",
        "There has been a wave of violence against migrants and minorities in Italy since the Lega and Five Star took office in May, including two murders and at least a dozen shootings. Last month, an assailant shot a 13-year-old Roma girl with a pellet gun, and in Naples on Thursday, a Senegalese fruit vendor was shot in the leg by two men on a moped.",
        "Rights groups are concerned that the Lega is fomenting a climate of hate through its xenophobic and racist rhetoric. Salvini routinely describes migrants as criminals and rapists, and is calling for a census of the country’s Roma people in a move that has stirred memories of Italy’s fascist past.",
        "Salvini responded to the criticism of his leadership on Sunday by tweeting “Many enemies, much honor!” ― A quote from Mussolini on the anniversary of the fascist dictator’s birth.",

        "“I hope the government of Donald Trump is willing to combat terrorist groups that want to attack presidents of peaceful nations.”",
        "A group named Soldados de Franelas (Soldiers in t-shirts) has also claimed responsibility for the attack on Twitter.",
        "In a series of tweets, the group said it planned to fly two drones “loaded with C4” to the presidential box, but it was shot down by snipers before it reached the target. HuffPost has reached out to the group for comment.",
        "As seen in video of the speech, the president’s security personnel rushed to shield Maduro from the attack.",
        "Another partial video of the speech shows Maduro, his wife and other military officials bracing as they look out into the distance. One clip shows military members running away.",
        "“At exactly 5:41 p.m. in the afternoon several explosions were heard,” Rodriguez said in an address to the country following the incident, according to AP.",
        "“The investigation clearly reveals they came from drone-like devices that carried explosives.”",
        "While the government is calling the explosions a drone attack, firefighters at the scene disputed that drones were involved, according to AP.",
        "Three fire officials who spoke to AP on the condition of anonymity believe the explosion was caused by a gas tank explosion in an apartment. Video filmed from buildings near the speech’s venue shows smoke rising from buildings.",
        "Venezuela’s government routinely accuses opposition activists of plotting to attack and overthrow Maduro, a deeply unpopular leader who was recently elected to a new term in office in a vote decried by dozens of nations. Maduro has steadily moved to concentrate power as the nation reels from a crippling economic crisis.",

        "VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis has changed church teaching about the death penalty, saying in a new policy published Thursday that it is always “inadmissible” because it “attacks” the inherent dignity of all humans.",
        "The Vatican said Francis had approved a change to the Catechism of the Catholic Church — the compilation of official Catholic Church teaching. Previously, the catechism said the church didn’t exclude recourse to capital punishment “if this is the only possible way of effectively defending human lives against the unjust aggressor.”",
        "The new teaching, contained in Catechism No. 2267, says the previous policy is outdated and that there are other ways to protect the common good.",
        "“Consequently the church teaches, in the light of the Gospel, that the death penalty is inadmissible because it is an attack on the inviolability and dignity of the person,” and she works with determination for its abolition worldwide,” reads the new text, which was approved in May but only published Thursday.",
        "In an accompanying letter explaining the change, the head of the Vatican’s doctrine office said the development of Catholic doctrine on capital punishment didn’t contradict prior teaching, but rather was an evolution of it.",
        "“If, in fact the political and social situation of the past made the death penalty an acceptable means for the protection of the common good, today the increasing understanding that the dignity of a person is not lost even after committing the most serious crimes,” said Cardinal Luis Ladaria, prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.",
        "Francis has long railed against the death penalty, insisting it can never be justified, no matter how heinous the crime. He has also long made prison ministry a mainstay of his vocation. On nearly every foreign trip, Francis has visited with inmates to offer words of solidarity and hope, and he still stays in touch with a group of Argentine inmates he ministered to during his years as archbishop of Buenos Aires.",
        "He announced his intention to change church teaching on capital punishment last October, when he marked the 25th anniversary of the publication of the catechism by announcing his intention to update it. The catechism, first promulgated by St. John Paul II, gives Catholics an easy, go-to guide for church teaching on everything from the sacraments to sex.",
        "At that 2017 ceremony, Francis said the death penalty violates the Gospel and amounts to the voluntary killing of a human life, which “is always sacred in the eyes of the creator.”",
        "He acknowledged that in the past even the Papal States had allowed this “extreme and inhuman recourse.” But he said the Holy See had erred in allowing a mentality that was “more legalistic than Christian” and now knew better."

        "Northern California firefighter Jason Campbell came home from battling one of the blazes tearing through the region last week only to find his own home burned to the ground.",
        "The firefighter with emergency response company GFP Enterprises was leading a 20-person crew tackling the Ferguson Fire near Yosemite National Park last Thursday when his own neighborhood was hit by the deadly Carr Fire near Redding, California, six hours north.",
        "Campbell’s wife, Shyla, and their kids, ages 6 and 13, were safely evacuated from the area, according to a GoFundMe post by Paul Asher, GFP’s vice president of fire operations. But by the time Campbell got to his house on Friday afternoon, he found only ashes.",
        "“It’s just hard ― it’s so overwhelming, it’s hard to put into words,” Shyla told HuffPost on Monday.",
        "She said she got the text notifying her to evacuate their home at 2 a.m. on Thursday, and that she and her children have been staying at a friend’s in nearby Shasta Lake ever since. Thursday was her daughter’s 13th birthday, and the girl had been planning a slumber party with her friends.",
        "“I wish I would have prepared more, I should have packed more, had stuff ready, or a plan,” Shyla said, noting that when they fled, it was pitch-black out and the air was filled with smoke and ash.",
        "“I never have been that close [to a fire],” she added. “You see pictures, you see the flames. But at night, when the smoke is blowing toward you, you just see red.”",
        "The Carr Fire, which started on July 23, has killed at least six people, destroyed over 700 homes and forced tens of thousands of people to flee. Officials were feeling “optimistic” on Sunday as firefighters finally began gaining ground on the blaze.",
        "In the Ferguson Fire near Yosemite, which started July 13, two firefighters have died.",
        "California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) declared a state of emergency over the blazes last week.",
        "Last year, the state’s deadliest fires in history hit Northern California in October, killing more than 40 people. Officials told HuffPost later that 2017 was “one of the worst” years ever for fires in the state. But 2018 has also had a daunting start.",
        "“We are well ahead of the fire activity we saw last year,” Cal Fire spokeswoman Lynne Tolmachoff told The Associated Press on Sunday. “This is just July, so we’re not even into the worst part of fire season.”",
        "At 5:30 a.m. on Sunday, Campbell headed back out again with his crew, this time to fight the Carr fire. Shyla said that despite being “pretty devastated” from losing their home, “he probably needs to work.”",
        "Meanwhile, Shyla has been struggling to find a place for her family to live. The competition for rentals in the area has become fierce since the fire hit, she said.",
        "The insurance company has suggested her family relocate elsewhere, but in her husband’s line of work, Shyla said, that’s not possible: He needs to be within 20 minutes of the office so he can be ready to head out with his crew within the hour if a fire hits.",
        "“It is a testament to the character of [Campbell] to return to work so soon,” Asher posted on the company Facebook page on Sunday, noting the firefighter was aiming to shift his focus “back to the positivity brought about by helping” his community.",
        "“It’s also beneficial to be around your comrades and working towards a common goal in difficult times like these,” he wrote."

        "headline": "World's Largest King Penguin Colony Has Mysteriously Shrunk By 90 Percent",
        "category": "WORLD NEWS",
        "short_description": "Concerned scientists say they have no idea what's caused this massive decline.",
        "authors": "Dominique Mosbergen",
        "date": "2018-07-31"
    },
    "articleContent": [
        "The population of the world’s largest king penguin colony, which resides on Île aux Cochons, a remote French island in the subantarctic Crozet Archipelago, has plummeted by a staggering 90 percent since the 1980s, according to a new study published in the Antarctic Science journal.",
        "Using recent satellite images and photos captured from helicopters, researchers measured the changes in the size of the colony since the island was last visited by scientists in the early 1980s. The penguin population back then had included some 500,000 breeding pairs and over 2 million individuals, the scientists said. Today, the number of breeding pairs has shrunk to just 60,000. About 200,000 individuals remain.",
        "“It is completely unexpected, and particularly significant since this colony represented nearly one-third of the king penguins in the world,” Henri Weimerskirch, the lead author of the study and an ecologist at the Center for Biological Studies in Chize, France, told Agence France-Presse.",
        "Weimerskirch shared a photograph with the news outlet that shows the island swarming with penguins in 1982:",
        "Troublingly, Weimerskirch and his colleagues said they have no idea what’s caused the colony’s dramatic collapse — though they’ve floated a number of theories.",
        "Climate change is one possible factor. Researchers said the decline appears to have begun in the late 1990s when a strong El Niño weather event warmed the southern Indian Ocean and impacted the colony’s food supply. Since then, the Earth has endured several more El Niño events, as well as several of the warmest years on record.",
        "Earlier studies conducted by Weimerskirch and other researchers have shown how global warming ― if it continues at its current pace ― will pose a major threat to king penguins living in the Crozet Archipelago in the coming decades.",
        "Weimerskirch and his colleagues, however, said they don’t believe they can blame climate change alone for the recent collapse of the Île aux Cochons colony as king penguin populations on nearby islands have remained either stable or, in some cases, have even increased, over the past few decades.",
        "The researchers believe, therefore, that the cause of the population decline on the island must be location-specific, noted ScienceAlert.",
        "Overcrowding, they said, could be another factor, as could a disease or tick infestation. Invasive species like house mice and feral cats, which are known to exist on the island, could also be impacting the health of the colony, the researchers theorized.",
        "Ultimately, the team said they will need to go to the island themselves before they can figure out what’s really going on. Weimerskirch said he hopes researchers will be able to visit the colony in 2019.",
        "“The cause of the massive decline of the colony remains a mystery, and needs to be resolved,” the researchers wrote in the paper. “Although the decline started at least 20 years ago, it appears to be ongoing, and the causes of the decline may still be active.”",
        "After the Emperor penguin, king penguins are the largest penguin species on Earth.",
        "There are two subspecies of king penguin: the Aptenodytes patagonica patagonicus, which inhabits the Falklands, South Georgia Island and in southern Chile; and A. patagonicus halli, which lives in the Crozet Archipelago, as well as on Heard, Kerguelen, Macquarie and Prince Edwards islands.",
        "King penguin females lay one egg at a time and the parents take turns incubating it on their feet.",
        "The International Union for Conservation of Nature currently lists king penguins as a species of “least concern.” The newly published study, however, may “prompt a reevaluation” of this status, reported AFP."

        "Relatives of two drowning victims are seeking $100 million in damages after 17 people died on an amphibious “Ride the Ducks” vehicle in Missouri 10 days ago.",
        "The wrongful death lawsuit likens the boats to “death traps” and sinking coffins.",
        "“Once they take on water, they sink, and they sink fast,” attorney Robert J. Mongeluzzi, who is representing the victims’ family, told reporters Monday.",
        "The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri on Sunday, seeks damages on behalf of the estates of Ervin Coleman, 76, and Maxwell Ly, 2.",
        "The lawsuit cites the operators’ history of safety issues and previous deaths, and accuses them of ignoring past safety recommendations by the National Transportation Safety Board. Those recommendations include removing a canopy that prevents people from escaping the boat when it’s taking on water, Mongeluzzi said.",
        "The defendants named in the lawsuit are Ripley Entertainment Inc., Ride the Ducks International, Ride the Ducks of Branson, the Herschend Family Entertainment Corp., and Amphibious Vehicle Manufacturing. A spokesperson for Ripley Entertainment, which owns Ride the Ducks of Branson, declined comment to The Associated Press because of the ongoing investigation.",
        "“The quest for justice includes doing everything within our power to ban duck boats once and for all,” said Mongeluzzi.",
        "The boat that sank on July 19 was carrying 31 people as severe thunderstorms moved across Missouri’s Table Rock Lake. Of the 17 people killed, nine were members of a single family.",
        "Survivor Tia Coleman, whose husband, Glenn, and three children, Reece, 9, Evan, 7, and Arya, 1, died in the catastrophe, recalled that the boat sank quickly after being overcome by a massive swell.",
        "“If I was able to get a life jacket, I could have saved my babies,” Coleman told reporters. “Because they could have at least floated up to the top and somebody could have grabbed them. And I wasn’t able to do that.”",
        "Coleman said one of the workers told passengers where the boat’s life jackets were located but said: “You won’t need them.”",
        "“So we didn’t grab them,” she said.",
        "Mongeluzzi said relatives of Ervin Coleman and Maxwell Ly reached out to him after he won a major settlement following another duck boat tragedy in Pennsylvania in 2010 that left two people dead. (Tia Coleman is also related to Coleman and Ly, but is not named in the lawsuit.)",
        "Prior to this month’s tragedy, at least 26 other people have died in duck boat-related accidents since 1999. The now second-deadliest incident was in 1999 in Hot Springs, Arkansas, when 13 people were killed."

        "HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabweans voted on Monday in the first election since the removal of former president Robert Mugabe, a watershed moment they hope will rid the country of its pariah status and spark a recovery in its failed economy.",
        "The election pits 75-year-old President Emmerson Mnangagwa, a long-time Mugabe ally, against 40-year-old Nelson Chamisa, a lawyer and pastor vying to become Zimbabwe’s youngest head of state.",
        "On the eve of the election, Mugabe emerged from eight months of obscurity since the military ousted him in a bloodless coup, to announce he would vote for the opposition, surprising former ally Mnangagwa who accused him of striking a deal with Chamisa.",
        "Voting started at 7 a.m. (0500 GMT) and will end at 7 p.m.",
        "Opinion polls give former intelligence chief Mnangagwa, who took over as president after the army ousted Mugabe, only a slim lead over Chamisa.",
        "There will be a runoff on Sept. 8 if no candidate wins more than half the votes.",
        "Nicknamed “the Crocodile”, an animal famed in Zimbabwean lore for its stealth and ruthlessness, Mnangagwa, of the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU–PF), has pledged to revive the moribund economy, attract foreign investment and mend racial and tribal divisions.",
        "Queues of eager voters snaked around the streets of the capital Harare from before sunrise.",
        "“ZANU-PF is the only party that I have voted for,” said Elizabeth Kamhunga, 67, after casting her vote at a school in the Harare suburb of Malbereign.",
        "“We may have made some mistakes but I think President Mnangagwa is the only person who has the interests of Zimbabwe at heart.”",
        "Chamisa, who honed his rhetorical skills in the courtroom and the pulpit, has attracted young and unemployed voters frustrated with nearly four decades of ZANU–PF rule.",
        "“This is a historic day,” said Fabian Matsika, a security guard who woke at 4:30 a.m. to travel to his polling station on the outskirts of the capital.",
        "“I’ll vote for Chamisa because it is a vote for change, it is a vote for the youth. Tomorrow we will have a new president.”",
        "CREDIBILITY",
        "Mugabe, one of the last “Big Men” of African politics, still looms large over Zimbabwean society and his comments may yet influence the first vote without his name on the ballot paper since the country gained independence from Britain in 1980.",
        "For Zimbabwe to be welcomed back into the international fold, end painful sanctions and secure the donor funding it needs to stem chronic cash shortages, observers have to sign off on the vote as being credible.",
        "Several elections under Mugabe were marred by intimidation, rigging and widespread violence but the consensus is the build-up to this vote has been better than before.",
        "There have been reports of intimidation and coercion and state media are biased towards ZANU–PF. Chamisa’s Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) has questioned the independence of the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission.",
        "Mnangagwa has welcomed foreign media and international observers from the European Union, the United States and the Commonwealth, who are watching polling stations across the country.",
        "There remain concerns that people may be intimidated into voting a certain way by party members.",
        "“It is exciting to see so many Zimbabweans casting ballots,” said former Liberian president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, co-leader of the National Democratic Institute’s observer mission.",
        "“However the public’s faith in the secrecy of the ballot is essential for the credibility of the process. We urge the authorities to do everything possible to ensure the secrecy of today’s vote.”",
        "Mnangagwa has made a big effort to win over foreign opinion; hosting Western ambassadors, courting investors and patching up relations with white commercial farmers who were violently evicted from their farms under Mugabe.",
        "Whoever wins will face the mammoth task of putting Zimbabwe back on track after 37 years of Mugabe rule that was tainted by corruption, mismanagement and diplomatic isolation, sending one of Africa’s most promising economies into crisis."

        "REDDING, Calif. (AP) — The deadly Northern California wildfire that has forced tens of thousands of people to flee their homes slowed down Sunday after days of explosive growth, giving officials hope even as they announced the discovery of a sixth fatality.",
        "Meanwhile, officials said a second firefighter died fighting a huge blaze to the south near Yosemite National Park. Brian Hughes, 33, was struck by a tree and killed while working as part of a crew removing brush and other fuel near the so-called Ferguson fire’s front lines, national parks officials said.",
        "In Redding, officials struck a hopeful tone for the first time in days.",
        "“We’re feeling a lot more optimistic today as we’re starting to gain some ground rather than being in a defensive mode on this fire all the time,” said Bret Gouvea, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection’s incident commander on the blaze around Redding, a city about 230 miles (370 kilometers) north of San Francisco.",
        "Gouvea spoke at a news conference with fire and law enforcement officials. Shasta County Sheriff Tom Bosenko said authorities found a sixth victim of the blaze at a home that was consumed by flames, though he declined to say where. The victim’s identity was not released.",
        "The sheriff’s department is also investigating seven missing persons reports, Bosenko said. Redding police have an additional 11 reports of missing people, though many of them may simply not have checked in with friends or family, said Redding police Sgt. Todd Cogle.",
        "The so-called Carr Fire that affected Redding — a city of about 92,000 people — was ignited by a vehicle problem on Monday about 10 miles (16 kilometers) west of the city. On Thursday, it swept through the historic Gold Rush town of Shasta and nearby Keswick fueled by gusty winds and dry vegetation. It then jumped the Sacramento River and took out subdivisions on the western edge of Redding.",
        "The latest tally showed at least 657 homes destroyed and another 145 damaged, with the fire having consumed 149 square miles.",
        "After days of fortifying the areas around Redding, fire crews were increasingly confident that the city would escape further damage. The fire had not grown inside the city limits since Saturday, Gouvea said.",
        "Some of the 38,000 people forced to evacuate said they were frustrated because they didn’t know whether their homes were standing or were destroyed. Authorities had not reopened any evacuated neighborhoods where fires raged due to safety and ongoing investigations and urged people to be patient, saying they would soon let residents back.",
        "Fed up, on Sunday morning Tim Bollman hiked 4 miles (6 kilometers) on trails up steep terrain to check on the Redding home he built for his wife and two sons 13 years ago. He found rubble.",

        "“What we’re seeing here is an incomplete burn situation,” Capt. Doug Miles said as his crew used picks, shovels and rakes to open up piles that just days ago were family homes. The flames laid waste to about 25 blocks, and the “mop up” work was likely to take days. He said his crew would be looking for anything salvageable, but there was little left standing.",
        "The fatalities included two firefighters and a woman and her two great-grandchildren.",

        "It is the largest fire burning in California, threatening more than 5,000 structures. The flames were just 5 percent contained, though Gouvea said he expected that number to climb.",
        "“We’re here till the end, and we will get to an end, and we will bring some peace to this chaos,” he said.",
        "The firefighters killed in the blaze included Don Ray Smith, 81, of Pollock Pines, a bulldozer operator who was helping clear vegetation in the path of the wildfire. Redding Fire Inspector Jeremy Stoke was also killed, but details of his death were not released.",
        "The fire around Redding was among 17 significant blazes in the state on Sunday that had forced roughly 50,000 people from their homes, said Lynne Tolmachoff, a Cal Fire spokeswoman.",
        "About 12,000 firefighters were battling the fires, she said.",
        "“We are well ahead of the fire activity we saw last year,” she said. “This is just July, so we’re not even into the worst part of fire season.”",
        "About 100 miles southwest of Redding, one of two blazes that started in Mendocino County forced the evacuation of Lakeport, a city of about 5,000 people, after destroying four homes. More than 4,500 buildings were under threat, officials said. The two fires had blackened 39 square miles and were each 5 percent contained.",
        "Authorities also issued evacuation orders in Napa County, famous for its wine, when a fire destroyed eight structures. The blaze had blackened 150 acre, but was 50 percent contained on Sunday.",
        "Hughes, the firefighter killed near Yosemite, was originally from Hawaii. He had been with California’s Arrowhead Interagency Hotshots for four years and reached the rank of captain. Earlier this month, firefighter Braden Varney was killed when the bulldozer he was operating overturned while he was fighting the flames near the national park. At least seven other firefighters have been injured since that blaze broke out July 13.",

        "A big fire continued to burn in the San Jacinto Mountains east of Los Angeles near Palm Springs, but officials lifted evacuation orders for several communities after reporting significant progress by firefighters. The Yosemite and Southern California blazes had burned nearly 100 square miles (260 square kilometers)."

        "The quake, which rocked the island early in the morning when many people were still asleep, injured 162 people and damaged thousands of houses.",
        "Electricity was cut off in the worst-hit area, Sembalun, a sparsely populated area of rice paddies and the slopes of Mount Rinjani on the northern side of the island.",
        "A 30-year-old Malaysian woman visiting Mount Rinjani, a popular trekking destination, was among those killed, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the disaster mitigation agency spokesman.",
        "He said the area was temporarily closed to climbers because there were reports of landslides.\n\n“People are gathering on the streets and empty fields to avoid collapsing buildings,” he said. “The main focus now is evacuation and rescue. Some of the injured are still being treated at clinics.”",
        "An emergency tent was set up on a street in Sembalun to treat the injured because the local hospital was damaged, and those in a critical condition were taken to other hospitals.\n\n“It happened so suddenly at around 6 in the morning. Suddenly everything simply collapsed,” said Siti Sumarni, a Sembalun resident. “My child was inside the house, thankfully he survived.”\n\nStanding outside a green tent set up on a dusty field, she said nothing was left of her house.\n\nVideo footage showed ambulances lining the streets of Lombok and many houses damaged with only parts of brick walls standing.\n\n“We jumped out of our beds to avoid anything falling on our heads,” said Jean-Paul Volckaert who runs a hotel near Senggigi on the western side of Lombok.\n\n“I’ve been walking around but so far there is no damage. We were very surprised as the water in the pools was swaying like a wild sea. There were waves in the pools but only for 20 to 30 seconds,” he told Reuters by telephone.",
        "A magnitude 6.4 earthquake is considered strong and is capable of causing severe damage.\n\nThe Lombok quake struck at 6:47 a.m. local time and was only 4.35 miles deep, a shallow depth that would have amplified its effect.\n\nIt was centered 31 miles northeast of the city of Mataram, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, but it was also felt strongly to the west on the neighboring island of Bali, Indonesia’s top tourist destination.\n\nNearly 80 subsequent tremors were recorded, with the largest aftershock recorded at 5.7 magnitude, Indonesia’s Meteorological, Climatological and Geophysics Agency said.\n\nThe earthquake was on land and did not trigger any waves or tsunami.\n\nEarthquakes are common in Indonesia, which is located on the seismically active “Ring of Fire” that surrounds the shores of the Pacific Ocean.\n\n(Additional reporting Agustinus Da Costa and Fransiska Nangoy in Jakarta, Alison Bevege in Sydney; Editing by Michael Perry)"

        "CAIRO (AP) — An Egyptian court sentenced 75 people to death on Saturday, including top figures of the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood group, for their involvement in a 2013 sit-in, state media reported.",
        "The Cairo Criminal Court referred the sentences to the Grand Mufti — the country’s top theological authority — for his non-binding opinion as is the norm in capital cases. Though non-binding, the formality gives a window of opportunity for a judge to reverse an initial sentence.",
        "The sentences are subject to appeal.",
        "Sentencing for more than 660 others involved in the case was scheduled for Sept. 8, the Al-Ahram news website reported. Those sentences, too, are subject to appeal.",
        "Of the 75 defendants referred to the Mufti, 44 are jailed and 31 are at large. The court normally hands down the maximum sentence for fugitives but a re-retrial is typically held after they are caught.",
        "The case involves a total 739 defendants, including the Muslim Brotherhood’s Supreme Guide Mohammed Badie and photojournalist Mahmoud Abu Zeid. The charges range from murder to damaging public property. Neither Badie nor Abu Zeid were sentenced to death in this case.",
        "The 2013 sit-in, in Rabaa al-Adawiya Square in Cairo, supported former Islamist President Mohammed Morsi who was militarily ousted following mass protests against his divisive one-year rule. Morsi hailed from the Brotherhood.",
        "The sit-in was violently dispersed on Aug. 14, 2013. More than 600 people were killed. Months later, Egypt designated the Brotherhood a terrorist organization.",
        "Egyptian authorities have since launched a severe crackdown on Brotherhood members and supporters, arresting many and trying them on terror-related charges.",
        "Egyptian courts have held mass trials and handed down death sentences for hundreds of people, drawing international condemnation.",
        "In 2014, an Egyptian judge sentenced 529 of Morsi’s supporters to death. A retrial was later ordered after several proceedings.",
        "Rights groups have repeatedly criticized such mass sentencings in Egypt and called on authorities to ensure fair trials.",
        "International rights groups also denounced the mass trial of the 2013 sit-in. Amnesty International described it in a statement last month as a “grotesque parody of justice” and called on authorities to drop all charges against those arrested for protesting peacefully."

        "Mass funerals were held in the city of Sweida on Thursday, a day after the wave of attacks that began in the early hours of the mourning and lasted for hours. The city was the scene of several suicide bombings, including one at a busy vegetable market that left a scene of devastation and set in motion the coordinated assaults.",
        "IS militants also attacked a number of villages in the northeast of the province, also called Sweida, where local militias and residents took up arms to fight the advancing militants.",
        "The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights put the death toll at 246, including 111 members of local militias who fought IS militants who swarmed their villages. At least 135 civilians were among the killed, the Observatory said.",
        "Hassan Omar, a government health official in Sweida province, said on Thursday that at least 150 people were wounded in the attacks; some of them were in critical condition.",
        "An activist-operated Facebook page called Sweida News Network said many of the killed were shot in the head. The SNN said the militants sneaked into the villages under the cover of darkness, shooting residents as they slept.",
        "The Observatory also reported bodies found killed inside homes and that the militants had also abducted some residents, their fate unknown.",
        "The rare attacks in Sweida, populated mainly by Syria’s minority Druze, came amid a government offensive elsewhere in the country’s south. Government forces are battling an IS-linked group near the frontier with Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and near the border with Jordan. The group also has a small presence on the eastern edge of Sweida province, and in the desert in the adjacent Homs province.",

        "ISLAMABAD, July 26 (Reuters) - Pakistani cricket legend Imran Khan declared victory on Thursday in a divisive general election, and said he was ready to lead the nuclear-armed nation despite a long delay in ballot counting and allegations of vote-rigging from his main opponents.",
        "His success in Wednesday’s election is a stunning rise for an anti-corruption crusader who has spent much of his political career on the fringes of Pakistan politics, but now stands on the brink of becoming the country’s prime minister.",
        "“God has given me a chance to come to power to implement that ideology which I started 22 years ago,” Khan, 65, said in a televised speech from his house near the capital Islamabad.",
        "Supporters of jailed former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who accuse Khan of colluding with the still powerful army, said the vote count was rigged in what it termed an assault on democracy in a country with a history of military rule.",
        "Oxford-educated Khan, in the past a fierce critic of U.S. policy in the region, called for “mutually beneficial” ties with Pakistan’s on-off ally the United States, and offered an olive branch to arch-foe India, saying the two nations should resolve their long-simmering dispute over Kashmir.",
        "In a speech peppered with populist pledges, Khan promised to create jobs for the poor and said he would turn the palatial prime minister’s official residence in the capital into an education facility instead of living in it.",
        "With about half the votes counted, Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), or Pakistan Movement for Justice, had a wide lead in the Muslim-majority nation, the country’s election commission said.",
        "“SHEER RIGGING”",
        "Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and rival Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) both said their party monitors at many voting centers were either kicked out during counting or had not received the official notifications of the precinct’s results, instead being given handwritten tallies they could not verify.",
        "“It is a sheer rigging. The way the people’s mandate has blatantly been insulted, it is intolerable,” Shehbaz Sharif, PML-N president and Nawaz’s brother, told a news conference.",
        "Khan has staunchly denied allegations by PML-N that he is getting help from the military, which has ruled Pakistan for about half of its history and still sets key security and foreign policy.",
        "The army, which dismisses allegations of meddling, deployed 371,000 soldiers at polling stations across the country, nearly five times the number as in last election in 2013.",
        "Khan offered to investigate all the allegations of rigging and said he wants to “unite” the country under his leadership.",
        "Pakistan faces a mounting economic crisis that is likely to require a bailout from the International Monetary Fund, the likely conditions of which could complicate Khan’s spending pledges. PTI has also not ruled out seeking succor from China, Islamabad’s closest ally which has in recent years been investing heavily in infrastructure in the country.",
        "Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) secretary Babar Yaqoob told reporters early on Thursday that counting had been delayed by technical failures in an electronic reporting system and the tallying was now being conducted manually. The results had been due by around 2 a.m. (2100 GMT on Wednesday).",
        "By early Thursday evening, a full day after polls closed, he told reporters 82 percent of results had been received and rejected the allegations of tampering in the vote count.",
        "“The complaints we have been receiving, they could be of procedural level, but not any kind of rigging,” Yaqoob said.",
        "With 48 percent of the total vote counted, Khan’s PTI was listed by the ECP in its provisional results as leading in 113 of 272 contested National Assembly constituencies.",
        "Sharif’s PML-N was ahead in 64 constituencies, and the PPP, led by Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, the son of assassinated two-time prime minister Benazir Bhutto, led in 42 constituencies.",
        "Although Khan still appeared likely to fall short of the 137 seats needed for a majority in the National Assembly, he should have no problems finding coalition partners from smaller parties and independents.",
        "Pakistan’s election monitoring body and the European Union’s were scheduled to deliver their assessments of the conduct of the election on Friday.",
        "POPULIST PLEDGE",
        "An icon of Pakistani cricket and a one-time London playboy who has since transformed himself into a pious, firebrand nationalist, Khan’s campaign speeches were littered with anti-America rhetoric and baiting of India.",
        "But in his victory speech, Khan pledged to improve ties with Washington and Pakistan’s neighbors at a time the country is becoming increasingly isolated over its alleged links with Islamist militants in Afghanistan.",
        "He called for a “balanced relationship” with the United States, which has taken a firmer line on Pakistan under President Donald Trump, suspending aid and even convincing Western allies to putPakistan on a terror financing watchlist earlier this year.",
        "Quipping that Indian media had recently portrayed him like a “villain in a Bollywood movie,” Khan’s overtures to New Delhi included calls for better trade ties and to sit down and discuss Kashmir, a disputed region that was the cause of two of the three wars between the neighbors.",
        "Khan also said he wants deepen ties with old ally Beijing and emulate China’s success in reducing poverty.",
        "Investors welcomed Khan’s election success, with Pakistan’s benchmark 100-share index surging as much as 1.9 percent to 42,136 points in early trade, before closing 1.8 percent up. Analysts said there was relief Khan was unlikely to have to rely on major opposition parties in a messy coalition.",
        "Khan has promised an “Islamic welfare state” and cast his campaign as a battle to topple a predatory political elite hindering development in the impoverished nation of 208 million, where the illiteracy rate hovers above 40 percent.",
        "“Accountability will start with me, then my ministers, and then we will work our way down,” Khan said. “I want all of Pakistan to be united in this moment.”",

        "“We have serious indications and significant signs suggesting the criminal actions of arson,” Civil Protection Minister Nikos Toskas told a news conference. He said police had testimonies to that effect, but did not elaborate.",
        "Reuters reported on Wednesday that police were investigating how the fire started from three different locations at the same time, on a day when a second major fire was raging west of the Greek capital.",
        "With the toll from Greece’s deadliest wildfire in decades expected to rise further, about 300 firemen and volunteers were still combing the area on Thursday for dozens still missing.",
        "In a nation numbed by the scale of devastation, desperate relatives appeared on television to plead for information on those missing, while questions mounted on how people got trapped, and why no evacuation order was issued.",
        "“This shouldn’t have happened, people perished for no reason,” a tearful woman shouted at Defense Minister Panos Kammenos as he visited the town and nearby fire-ravaged areas. “You left us at God’s mercy!”",
        "One woman was still looking for her sister. “Nothing happened to her car, the house was not burned, so where is she?” Maria Sarieva said. “I believe she is alive. Where are they? They went somewhere. Where could they be?”",
        "BLOCKED EXITS",
        "Haphazard and unlicensed building ― a known feature of many areas across Greece ― was also blamed. Many routes to the beach were walled off.",
        "“How is it possible to have so many lives lost and not investigate who is responsible for such town planning chaos?” said Infrastructure Minister Christos Spirtzis.",
        "Adding to the misery, an area of Athens was hit by flash floods on Thursday, damaging scores of cars.",
        "Outside the coroner’s service in Athens, the mood was grim as relatives of victims arrived to submit information and blood samples which could assist identifications.",
        "“This is a difficult process, more difficult than other mass disasters we have dealt with,” said coroner Nikolaos Kalogrias, adding that the bodies of most of the victims were completely charred.",
        "About 500 homes were destroyed, and the fire brigade said there were closed-up homes that had not yet been checked.",
        "The left-led government announced a long list of relief measures including a one-off 10,000 euro payment and a job in the public sector for victims’ spouses and near relatives. But for many, that was not enough to ease the pain.",
        "“A drop in the ocean,” read the front page of newspaper Ta Nea.",
        "The fire broke out on Monday at 4:57 p.m. and spread rapidly through Mati, which lies less than 30 km (17 miles) east of Athens and was popular with local tourists.",
        "Firefighters described a rapid change in the direction of the wind, which also picked up speed, and some suggested the thick covering of pine trees and a mood of panic was a deadly combination that would have been hard to combat.",

        "BEIRUT (AP) — Israel shot down a Syrian fighter jet it said had breached its airspace on Tuesday, as Syrian forces reached the Golan Heights frontier for the first time in seven years.\n\nThe Israeli military said it monitored the advance of the Syrian Sukhoi fighter jet and shot it down with a pair of Patriot missiles after it penetrated Israeli airspace by about two kilometers (1.2 miles).\n\nSyrian forces have been battling rebels and Islamic State militants at the frontier with Israel in recent weeks.\n\nTuesday marked the first time government forces reached the border fence with the U.N.’s Disengagement Observer Force at the edge of the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.\n\nIt was the first time Israel shot down a Syrian jet in four years.\n\nIsrael’s military said there had been an increase in internal fighting in Syria since the morning hours, including intensified activity by the Syrian Air Force.\n\nMinutes before the reported shootdown, Syria’s state-run Al-Ikhbariya TV was broadcasting footage from the fence demarcating the U.N. buffer zone between Syrian and Israeli forces inside the Golan Heights. A U.N. observer post could be seen just on the other side of the fence.\n\nThe camera showed an Israeli post 400 meters (440 yards) away.\n\nIsrael captured the Golan Heights from Syria in 1967. The U.N. deployed a peacekeeping force between the two sides in 1974.\n\nIt is the first time government forces have taken up positions along the frontier since an uprising against President Bashar Assad swept through the country in 2011. Islamic State militants later seized territory from rebels along the frontier region."

        "A ride-sharing driver in St. Louis has been suspended following a report that he livestreamed his passengers without their knowledge as online entertainment.",
        "Jason Gargac, 32, was removed as a driver for both Uber and Lyft on Saturday after the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that he had been broadcasting his passengers on the video streaming platform Twitch for months.",
        "According to the Post-Dispatch, since March, Gargac uploaded hundreds of videos of his passengers under the username “JustSmurf.” In addition to watching and listening in on the car’s conversations, viewers commented on his passengers’ appearance, rated them, and discussed their destinations in the comment section.",
        "The paper estimated that he had given 700 rides through Uber. That tally doesn’t include the number of trips he made with Lyft, which he reportedly drove for less frequently.",
        "In an interview with the Post-Dispatch, Gargac said he initially told his passengers they were being broadcast but found that by telling them this, passengers refused to cooperate or they acted out or unnaturally. So he decided to film them without their knowledge.",
        "“I try to capture the natural interactions between myself and the passengers — what a Lyft and Uber ride actually is,” he told the Post-Dispatch.",
        "Missouri has a one-party consent law that makes it a crime to record someone unless one person involved in the recorded conversation consents to it. It was unclear as of press time whether the recordings were protected by that law, or if Gargac violated any other privacy laws.",
        "Regardless of whether his actions were illegal, they were enough to get him removed as a driver.",
        "Uber described Gargac’s behavior as “troubling,” as well as a violation of its community guidelines.",
        "“We have ended our partnership with this driver,” an Uber spokesperson told HuffPost.",
        "A representative for Lyft also confirmed to HuffPost that Gargac is no longer driving for the service.",
        "“The safety and comfort of the Lyft community is our top priority, and we have deactivated this driver,” Lyft said in a statement on Sunday.",
        "A representative for Twitch declined to comment on Gargac specifically, citing company policy, but said that it does not allow people to share content that invades others’ privacy.",
        "“If reported to us by the person whose privacy was invaded, we would take action under our Community Guidelines to remove the content,” the spokesman said in an email to HuffPost. Gargac’s Twitch account appeared to be deactivated on Sunday.",
        "According to the Post-Dispatch, Gargac used a camera on his dashboard to film his riders. It faced both his passengers and the road ahead, revealing their destination. If a passenger ever asked about the camera, Gargac reportedly said it was for security purposes.",
        "Gargac told the paper that he would censor viewers’ comments that were racist, homophobic or aggressively sexual with help from his wife and his friends.",
        "To help attract viewers, he tweeted about his driving plans, frequently announcing: “I am now LIVE driving awesome people around the St. Louis area! Come check out what kind of content we can come across tonight!”",
        "In one Twitter post last month, he bragged about hitting 4,000 followers.",
        "“I am forever grateful, words are not enough to express. Seriously thank you to everyone who has been supporting me,” the tweet said.",
        "Gargac did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Sunday.",
        "A post on his Twitter account on Saturday morning stated that “transparency is always key” and that he has removed his stored videos. The post went on to suggest that he may repost the content, describing the videos as gone “for now.”",
        "This story has been updated with a statement from Uber."

        "TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Tens of thousands of Israeli LGBT advocates and their supporters went on strike across the country Sunday, protesting the exclusion of gay men from a recently passed surrogacy law.\n\nThe community is outraged that after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged to pass legislation supporting surrogacy for gay fathers, he then voted against it, apparently under pressure from his ultra-Orthodox Jewish coalition partners.\n\nProtesters marched in Tel Aviv and other Israeli cities on Sunday, waving rainbow flags and briefly blocking a major highway.\n\nTel Aviv’s central Rabin Square was packed with tens of thousands of people for the main demonstration Sunday night. “Although Israel has a very liberal image concerning gays it’s not the case when you look at the Israeli law,” said former Israeli lawmaker Nitzan Horowitz at the protest, who called for law amendments to ensure equal treatment for the LGBT community.\n\nHundreds protested near Netanyahu’s residence in Jerusalem.\n\nEyal Lurie Pardes, a protester draped in a rainbow flag, chanted: “We will not remain silent!”\n\n“Look me in the eyes and tell me I don’t deserve to be a father!” he said.\n\nFootage aired on Israeli TV later showed police pushing him into a police car. Israeli police said two people were detained and then released.\n\nThe protest has grown into a general call for equality, following other recent controversial legislation that appeared to target Israeli liberalism.\n\nThe protest has generated widespread support and hundreds of employers said they would allow employees to observe the strike without penalty.\n\nIsrael has emerged as one of the world’s most gay-friendly travel destinations in recent years, in sharp contrast to the rest of the Middle East where gays are persecuted and even killed.\n\nIn Israel, homosexuals serve openly in Israel’s military and parliament, and many popular artists and entertainers are homosexual.\n\nHowever, leaders of the gay community say Israel still has far to go in promoting equality."

        "Streamline recommends “The ABC Murders” on Amazon Prime this week. Amazon debuted this new show on Feb. 1.\n\nPremise: Based on an Agatha Christie novel, this takes place in the 1930s and tells the story of a once-famous detective who longs for his glory years while spending much of his time alone. A serial killer starts to send messages to the detective, which sets off a cat-and-mouse mystery that, of course, involves murder.\n\nStars: Rupert Grint and John Malkovich.",
        "How excited should you be? Amazon doesn’t have as many British crime shows as Netflix, so adding this highly stylized detective thriller should be a welcome move for fans of that genre. Malkovich elevates everything he stars in (even with a ridiculous accent this time around) and Grint looks nothing like Grint in this role, so that’s kind of fun. Although this show wallows in grimness, clever moments of humor peek through occasionally.\n\nAny reasons to be skeptical? This show plods along at a glacial pace. During multiple scenes, I wondered if my internet had slowed down and I was watching this at half-speed. The poor direction and dialogue make this hard to get through, so you really have to love detective thrillers to find enjoyment here. Sometimes I watch shows with hourlong episodes that feel too long, but it’s hard to say what should have been cut. That’s not the case here, as the show decides to spend a laughable amount of time focusing on shots of sinks and typewriters and other uninteresting inanimate objects.",

        "Periods are among the leading factors for girls to drop out of school in a country where four out of five women and girls are estimated by campaigners to have no access to sanitary pads.",
        "“I am sure all mothers and sisters will be very happy to hear that sanitary pads are now 100 percent exempt from tax,” India’s interim finance minister, Piyush Goyal, told reporters at a news conference in New Delhi.",

        "The decision triggered protests, petitions and court cases that questioned why the government taxed pads as a luxury rather than an essential item, such as condoms, which are tax-free.",

        "Palestinians have held the protests to demand the right to return to homes and villages from which they fled or were driven during the conflict surrounding the creation of the modern state of Israel in 1948.

        "NORFOLK, Va. (AP) — Adrian Cronauer, the man whose military radio antics inspired a character played by Robin Williams in the film “Good Morning, Vietnam,” has died. He was 79.",
        "Mary Muse, the wife of his stepson Michael Muse, confirmed Thursday that Cronauer died Wednesday after a long illness. He had lived in Troutville, Virginia.",
        "During his service as a U.S. Air Force sergeant in Vietnam in 1965 and 1966, Cronauer opened his Armed Forces Radio show with the phrase, “Goooooood morning, Vietnam!”",
        "Williams made the refrain famous in the 1987 film, loosely based on Cronauer’s time in Saigon.",
        "The film was a departure from other Vietnam war movies that focused on bloody realism, such as the Academy Award-winning “Platoon.” Instead, it was about irreverent youth in the 1960s fighting the military establishment.\n\n“We were the only game in town and you had to play by our rules,” Cronauer told The Associated Press in 1987. “But I wanted to serve the listeners.”\n\nThe military wanted conservative programming. American youths, however, were “not into drab, sterile announcements” with middle-of-the-road music, Cronauer said, and the battle over the airwaves was joined.\n\nIn the film, Williams quickly drops Perry Como and Lawrence Welk from his 6 a.m. playlist in favor of the Dave Clark Five.",
        "Cronauer said he loved the movie, but he said much of the film was Hollywood make-believe. Robin Williams’ portrayal as a fast- talking, nonconformist, yuk-it-up disc jockey sometimes gave people the wrong impression of the man who inspired the film.",
        "“Yes, I did try to make it sound more like a stateside station,” he told The AP in 1988. “Yes, I did have problems with news censorship. Yes, I was in a restaurant shortly before the Viet Cong hit it. And yes, I did start each program by yelling, ‘Good Morning, Vietnam!’”",
        "The rest is what he delicately called “good script crafting.”",
        "When the film was released, the presidential campaign of Democrat Jesse Jackson called asking if Cronauer would help out. The conversation died quickly after Cronauer asked the caller if she realized he was a Republican.",
        "In 1992, George H. W. Bush’s re-election campaign taped a TV ad slamming Bill Clinton’s draft record. In the ad, Cronauer accused Clinton of lying.",
        "“In many ways, I’m a very conservative guy,” he said. “A lifelong, card-carrying Republican can’t be that much of an anti-establishment type.”",
        "Cronauer was from Pittsburgh, the son of a steelworker and a schoolteacher. He spent 21 years in television, advertising, teaching and freelancing before attending the law school at the University of Pennsylvania and going into the legal profession.",
        "He worked in communications law and went on to handle prisoner-of-war issues for the Pentagon.",
        "“I always was a bit of an iconoclast, as Robin (Williams) was in the film,” Cronauer told the AP in 1999. “But I was not anti-military, or anti-establishment. I was anti-stupidity. And you certainly do run into a lot of stupidity in the military.”"

        "Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has launched a Twitter flash mob to free Russian national Maria Butina following U.S. charges that she conspired to influence American politics while covertly working for the Kremlin.",
        "It’s an intriguing strategy by a foreign government, though perhaps not surprising, given the U.S. intelligence finding that the Kremlin manipulated social media during the 2016 U.S. presidential election.",
        "The ministry urged people to show support for Butina by changing their Twitter profile photos to a portrait of Butina posted on the ministry’s official Twitter account and Facebook page on Thursday. Those pages feature an image of Butina, 29, with the hashtag #FreeMariaButina beneath.",
        "“In connection with the arrest in the United States of Russian citizen Maria Butina, we’re starting a flashmob in her support: #FreeMariaButina,” reads the translated Tweet. “Put a photo of Maria as your avatar.”",
        "The English version of the ministry’s Twitter account simply announced #NewProfilePic and #FreeMariaButina.",
        "By late Thursday, it appeared that no one who had responded in Russian to the Russian Twitter account had changed their profile photo. Responses in English were harsh.",
        "U.S. prosecutors say Butina cultivated contacts she made at a “gun rights organization” that fits the description of the National Rifle Association to get close to politicians. She “gained access” through one unidentified American with whom she was cohabiting to an “extensive network” of people in “positions to influence political activities in the United States,” according to court documents.",
        "According to reporting by Rolling Stone and Mother Jones, Butina’s key American contact was likely South Dakota Republican Paul Erickson, 56, who reached out to Trump campaign leaders in a bid to establish a “back channel” between the campaign and the Kremlin, according to The New York Times.",
        "Butina’s attorney has said she was just networking and hasn’t done anything illegal. Prosecutors argued in court Wednesday that Butina posed a flight risk, and the judge ruled that she will remain in custody without bail at least until her hearing next week."

        "“FamilyOFive,” a spinoff of the defunct YouTube channel “DaddyOFive” created by Michael and Heather Martin, was taken down on Wednesday after it was found to violate YouTube’s conditions, the website said.",
        "“Content that endangers children is unacceptable to us. We have worked extensively alongside experts in child safety to make sure we have strict policies and are aggressively enforcing them,” said a spokesperson for Google, which owns YouTube. “Given this channel owner’s previous strikes for violating our Guidelines prohibiting child endangerment, we’re removing all of his channels under our Terms of Service.”",
        "The decision follows growing concerns on social media about the content of the new videos. A since-removed promo for the “FamilyOFive” series showed one of the Martins’ sons getting hit in the groin with a ball and another boy crying and screaming for the camera to be turned off.",
        "The Martins had two of their five children taken away from them in 2017 following concern about abuse depicted in their past videos. The latest videos showed the couple with their remaining three sons, who are from Heather Martin’s previous marriage. She also had a channel called “MommyOFive.”",
        "According to Washington-based TV station WUSA, which was the first to report on the videos’ removal, the Martins moved from Maryland to West Virginia after their convictions last year.",
        "In a statement to the news site, the Martins appeared to defend their behavior and said they will continue to make videos as a family.",
        "“Our family has worked very hard to heal and re-establish ourselves over the past 18 months. Through a lot of hard work and introspection, we are all doing well, and are happy,” the statement read. “YouTube is something we enjoy as a family, and we will continue to do it, within the strict boundaries we have set for ourselves.”",
        "The family declined further comment, citing “our privacy and continued healing.”",
        "The Martins entered Alford pleas last year to two counts of child neglect, which means they maintained their innocence but conceded that prosecutors had enough evidence to result in a guilty verdict.",
        "Both were placed on five years of supervised probation after a judge initially sentenced them to 10 years each in prison but then suspended the jail time. Under a plea agreement, they were not allowed to contact their youngest two children, who Michael Martin fathered with another woman, unless they obtain a judge’s approval. They were also restricted from posting any videos or images of their children on social media unless it was for family use, Fox 5 DC reported.",
        "The Martins on Thursday did not immediately respond to a HuffPost request for comment. An attorney previously listed as representing the family declined to comment."

        "Sam Price, now 44, can trace his credit problems back to college.",
        "On one hand, he said, he lacked basic personal finance knowledge. “I didn’t know how to balance a checkbook. I didn’t know the proper use of credit,” Price said. On the other hand, he didn’t want to confront his money management issues. “I was very careless with my money.”",
        "Price said that when he got his hands on his first credit card, the limit was only about $500 ― hardly enough to get in any real trouble. But once he established good credit with that card, the offers started rolling in. “That really started the problem for me. I began to juggle credit … there was something that I’d want and I’d go ahead and buy it and worry about it later.”",
        "Stuck In A Cycle Of Debt",
        "A few years after college, Price dug himself into about $15,000 in credit card debt. “Back in those days, there were always new offers in the mail where you could just roll over debt for an introductory 0 percent APR. I just played the game for so long and rolled debt over,” he said.",
        "But then Price lost his job and was unemployed for several months. With no emergency fund in the bank, he began losing at that game. “I didn’t have any savings to fall back on, so I started spending more just to live,” Price said. It got to the point where he couldn’t afford to make his monthly minimum payments.",
        "“When I could no longer apply for new credit, I missed the first month,” Price said. Soon after, he missed the second. And then the third.",
        "“The right thing to have done would have been to call the credit card companies and try to work out some kind of deal,” he said. But unfortunately he took the opposite approach. “I ran from the problem. When the credit card companies would call, I just wouldn’t pick up and let it go to voicemail. I would never call them back.”",
        "Eventually, those credit card bills became charge-offs, and soon it was debt collectors calling instead. But if you had asked him at the time, Price would have told you he had it under control. “There was not a point early on when I just faced up and dealt with my problems. That would take me looking in the mirror and saying, ‘Look, you’re messing up,’ so I just kept avoiding the problem.”",
        "The Turning Point",
        "Eventually, Price decided he had to turn things around. Why? Like many great stories, Price said, there was a girl.",
        "“I had no business dating her because I didn’t have any money,” he said of his now-wife. “My credit at that point was destroyed, I was $15,000 in debt.”",
        "But despite his financial troubles, things got serious. Soon Price knew he would propose ― except there was one problem. “It was a realization that I’ve met the person that I’d like to spend my life with, and I can’t do it because I’ve destroyed my finances.”",
        "His future wife had no idea about the financial situation he was in.",
        "“It’s a joke now,” he explained, “but I didn’t let her know the depths of my problem. She just thought I paid cash for everything.” The reality was that Price always paid in cash because if he put money in a bank, creditors would levy his account. At his lowest point, Price’s credit score fell to 550.",
        "Price knew that if he wanted to have a wedding and start a life with the woman he loved, he needed to get his finances under control.",
        "His first move: As soon as his lease was up, Price, at 28, moved back in with his parents. “Back then, that wasn’t something that was commonly done.” But since he was going to school and only had part-time work in landscaping to rely on, there wasn’t really any other option.",
        "To increase his income, Price began taking online courses that would help him gain full-time work with overtime. “I started working as much as I could possibly work,” he said.",
        "Finally, Price followed the debt snowball method of paying off debt, a strategy popularized by personal finance guru Dave Ramsey. “Over the course of one year, I didn’t spend anything,” Price said. “I was eating pork and beans for a year. And every nickel that I got, I put towards my debt.”",
        "One year later, not only was the debt was gone, but Price had also saved enough for a ring and the honeymoon.",
        "“It Was Transformational For Me”",
        "In addition to aggressively paying off his credit card debt, Price started making more informed decisions when it came to spending.",
        "“I started shopping for better auto insurance. I started cutting coupons. You realize there are a lot of ways you can save money if you’re just willing to take a little bit of time.”",
        "Price also had the good sense to come clean with his fiancée about how bad his credit was during premarital counseling. Fortunately, “she was gracious enough to love me with my bad credit.”",
        "In fact, according to Price, marrying his wife was one of the best financial decisions he’s ever made. “I went into the marriage penniless. She already had her IRA started, had a savings account. She actually brought in money to the marriage, but she also brought a good head for managing money.”",
        "Once Price was able to build up savings, begin investing and watch his money grow in the market, “it was transformational for me,” he said. “For so many years, I saw how compounding interest led me to a very bad place. When I started seeing my money actually grow, it was just the opposite.”",
        "And after several years of diligently paying his bills on time, his credit score finally hit 800.",
        "In fact, Price was so inspired by his newfound financial success that when he was ready to make a career change in the pursuit of higher income, he decided to enter a field where he could use everything he learned to help others: financial planning.",
        "The Secrets To Success",
        "Now, as a registered investment adviser, independent insurance broker and founder of Assurance Financial Solutions, Price shares a few tips with clients who are looking to work on their own credit and get in a better financial position.",
        "1. Pay credit cards before the due date. Usually Price would make his payments the day before the due date. But one strategy for increasing his credit score that he learned from his wife was to pay the bills as they came in. “That’s when my credit score really started to improve.”",
        "The reason? Creditors often report your balance to the credit bureaus on a different date than your payment due date. So if you run up a large balance during the billing cycle, your credit utilization ratio could be too high even if you pay down the balance to $0 on the due date. It’s best to keep your credit utilization under 30 percent to maintain a healthy credit score ― and one way to keep it as low as possible is by making payments throughout the billing cycle.",
        "2. Make credit cards work for you. Even though Price had a rocky past with credit, he still uses credit cards to make purchases. But now he uses them as a tool rather than a crutch.",
        "For example, Price and his wife opened a rewards credit card that offered a complimentary trip to Disney World if they spent $2,000 within the first four months. “We put a couple of mortgage payments on the credit card and then took the family of five down to Orlando for free,” he said. The key, of course, was charging only what they could afford to pay off right away.",
        "3. Check your credit score regularly. “I’ve tracked my credit score every few months for the past several years now,” Price said. Not only does he check his score to measure his progress, but also to keep an eye out for fraud.",
        "Price uses a free credit score service from WalletHub, which provides users their VantageScore from TransUnion. It’s a similar service to that offered by sites such as Credit Karma and Credit Sesame, which also offer free VantageScores. If you want to check your FICO score ― the most popular credit scoring model used by lenders ― check with your credit card company, as most major banks offer the option free to cardholders.",
        "4. Stick to a budget. The term “budget” might sound restrictive or off-putting, but really, it’s simply about having a plan for your money. And devising and sticking to a budget is how Price and his family stay on track.",
        "“Since we’ve been married, we’ve always lived off a budget. That doesn’t mean we’re rigid… but each month, we determine what we’re going to spend our money on.” This, Price said, allows them to save money, put more toward their retirement and generally be able to afford the things that are most important to their family."

        "The girl told police that an elevator operator named Ravi Kumar, 66, first sexually assaulted her when she arrived home from school before she entered her family’s apartment. She said Kumar raped her in a vacant apartment. A few days later, he invited two other men to rape her, she said.",
        "Police said the three men videotaped the second assault and threatened to release it if the girl talked about the attacks.",
        "Later, Kumar reportedly allowed more men to join the assaults. They would inject the girl with sedatives and force her to drink “drug-laced soft drinks” before raping her, the Times of India reported. The routine went on for seven months, according to police.",
        "“This continued [until] the girl on Saturday told her older sister, a college student on a visit home from Delhi, about the trauma she was going through,” police said. “The sister informed their parents, who filed a complaint with the Ayanavaram all women police.”",
        "Sherin Bosko, co-founder of nonprofit Nakshatra, told local Indian outlet DT Next that she hopes the trial is over quickly for the girl’s sake.",
        "“In this case (and all others), I hope that the system is kind to the children and ensures a speedy trial,” Bosko said. “We need the same kind of anger for all cases of child sexual abuse.”",
        "Other activists condemned the crime, and pointed to the increase in sexual abuse of children and women in recent years.",
        "“Sexual attacks against [disabled female] children continues in Tamil Nadu. In Sivagangai, a 17-year-old hearing impaired girl was raped and killed in a village, while another such instance has happened in Aynavaram,” S. Namburajan, the state general secretary of Tamil Nadu Association for the Rights of All Types of Differently Abled & Caregivers, told D Next.",
        "Namburajan added: “We condemn these attacks and urge the state government to conduct mass awareness programs to curb this.”",
        "India has seen an increase in sexual violence against women in the past decade, including the 2012 fatal gang rape of a 23-year-old woman in Delhi. More recently, the country was in an uproar after an 8-year-old girl was gang raped and murdered by eight men in India’s Jammu and Kashmir state in April."

        "Four members of the Russian protest performance group Pussy Riot will be serving time behind bars for their pitch invasion during the World Cup final in Moscow.",
        "The protesters — Veronika Nikulshina, Olga Pakhtusova, Olga Kurachyova and Pyotr Verzilov — were sentenced to 15 days in prison on Monday, reported the Associated Press. They were also banned from attending sports events for three years.",
        "Play was briefly interrupted early in the second half of Sunday’s final between France and Croatia when the protesters, wearing police uniforms, sprinted onto the pitch at Luzhniki Stadium.",
        "Dignitaries including Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has been a target of Pussy Riot’s protests in the past; French President Emmanuel Macron; Croatian President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović; and FIFA President Gianni Infantino were in the audience at the time.",
        "One of the protesters was caught on camera high-fiving French player Kylian Mbappé, a smile on her face. Verzilov, the only man in the group, was seen being shoved by a furious Dejan Lovren, a Croatian defender.",
        "Lovren later told reporters that the stunt had interrupted the game at a critical moment for his team, who would ultimately lose 4-2.",
        "“I really was mad because we’d been playing at that moment in good shape,” he said, according to AP. “We’d been playing good football and then some interruption came. I just lost my head and I grabbed the guy and I wished I could throw him away from the stadium.”",
        "One of the protesters, Kurachyova, said it was a “pity that we disrupted the sportsmen.” She added that the protest had not been aimed at the players, but at FIFA and the Russian government.",
        "“FIFA is involved in unfair games unfortunately,” said Kurachyova, according to Reuters. “FIFA is a friend of heads of states who carry out repression, who violate human rights.”",
        "(Story continues below)",
        "In a statement, Pussy Riot claimed responsibility for the stunt, which they said had been a metaphor for how the state intrudes into people’s lives. The group called for the freeing of all political prisoners and the end of illegal detentions at political rallies, among other demands.",
        "In an essay about the protest, Masha Gessen of The New Yorker said Western politicians and media had been largely silent about Putin’s repressive regime during the World Cup, held in Russia for the first time in the tournament’s history.",
        "“Pussy Riot became the only people to make a meaningful statement about Russian politics during the [event] — and it came on the eve of Vladimir Putin’s triumphant meeting with Donald Trump,” wrote Gessen, referring to the U.S. president’s Monday meeting with the Russian leader in Helsinki.",
        "“They also created, on one of the biggest stages in the world, an image of unjust and arbitrary authority, the sort with which a hundred and forty-five million Russians live day to day,” Gessen continued.",
        "Pussy Riot first gained global infamy when a group of the collective’s members entered Moscow’s largest cathedral in 2012 and performed a “punk prayer” to “drive Putin away.” Three participants were arrested and imprisoned for two years for their involvement in the stunt.",
        "One of them, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, a founding member of Pussy Riot, is reportedly married to Pyotr Verzilov, the man who participated in Sunday’s World Cup protest.",
        "In 2014, Verzilov, who is a citizen of both Russia and Canada, told Toronto Life magazine that he’d been arrested “maybe 50 times” in Russia for his activism.",
        "“If you live in Russia and do the things I do, you get to a point where you become completely fearless,” Verzilov said. “I realize I’m constantly watched by Russia’s special forces and my phone is tapped. I see the same plainclothes officers following me around, and they don’t even try to hide.”"

    "articleContent": [
        "Even if they had failed to hang a second star on their jerseys on Sunday, which signifies a World Cup win, the players of the French national team would have still been able to claim a unique boast. Since the beginning of the 2018 tournament through to their 4-2 victory in the final against Croatia, this French team has had a different World Cup than in years past, but not just because they won ― it was the first time in decades that no French political party had attacked the team for its diversity.",
        "Les Bleus have spent years as a kind of lightning rod for discussions of race and identity in France. The conversation over the ethnic background of players and what version of France the team represents was not just whispered in fringe circles, but openly debated in French media and by political leaders.",
        "When France first won the soccer World Cup in 1998, commentators celebrated that the country’s flag had changed from white, blue and red to “black, blanc, et beur,” or black, white and Arab. The team’s diversity became both a rallying point for multiculturalism and a target for far-right leaders such as Jean-Marie Le Pen, who said that a team full of players of African and Arab descent had nothing to do with the ideals of France.",
        "The World Cup of “1998 turned this team into a symbol, and it’s always been a symbol since then,” said Laurent Dubois, a historian at Duke University and author of a book on French soccer.",
        "But each tournament since 1998 brought new controversy. Marine Le Pen, Jean-Marie’s daughter, who received 10 million votes in last year’s presidential election, took up the mantle of attacking the team’s ethnic background and claimed in 2010 some players had “another nationality in their hearts.” The French team’s coach at the time, Laurent Blanc, was caught in a scandal a year later when tapes surfaced of him discussing putting in secret quotas to limit the number of non-white players in their national training program.",
        "France’s hosting of the European Championship in 2016 was overshadowed by scandals that included players accusing racism as a factor in the team’s selection process. It spilled over into a full public debate about national identity and drew in the country’s biggest soccer stars, politicians and intellectuals.",
        "But only two years later, France’s national team is practically universally embraced in the country and the cause for national euphoria throughout the tournament. Even Jean-Marie Le Pen ― who had 22 years ago judged the team as ”artificial” ― was pictured with a French flag and novelty sunglasses. And Les Bleus have been almost entirely devoid of scandal ― whether manufactured by the far-right or genuine.",
        "The national unity over the team is not because the players are any less diverse. An analysis by The Guardian found almost 80 percent of the French squad are from migrant backgrounds. In the past, the team’s diversity would have been a target for the far-right. But the far-right National Rally party, formerly known as the National Front, embraced the squad. The sentiment is shared across France’s fractured political landscape. The leftist France Unbowed party similarly supported them, with leader Jean-Luc Melenchon announcing the team’s image reflected that of the country.",
        "“This is not the same French team,” said Aleksandar Nikolic, head of sports policy for the National Rally.",
        "“This team is in the image of what we want to promote: Players who sing the Marseillaise and proclaim their attachment to their country.”",
        "But it would be wrong to think that the national harmony over the French team is indicative that the country has addressed its problems with systemic racism or that the far-right no longer holds xenophobic and anti-immigrant views. Soccer also remains an easy target for racism ― Switzerland’s team became a source of crisis over national identity, while the far-right in Germany blamed their country’s early exit on having too many players from immigrant backgrounds.",
        "Instead, France’s success and young, clean-cut image gave far-right politicians little to prey on, while the team’s popularity made it politically fatal for anyone to oppose Les Bleus.",
        "“It’s this team’s victories that … inhibits racist and xenophobic discourse,” said Thomas Guénolé, a political scientist and member of France Unbowed.",
        "The team also appeared to be more conscious of its public face, playing to nationalism and attempting to avoid being tarnished by the likes of blackmail and sex tape scandals that have hit past national team squads. In press conferences, stars such as Antoine Griezmann and Paul Pogba have mentioned how proud they were to play for France.",
        "“I do not know where I am!” Griezmann said at the end of the match Sunday night. “That is the France we love. There are different origins but we are all united. There are many players who come from different horizons but we all play for the same jersey and for our country.”",
        "His comments were echoed by other players. “France today is a France full of colors,” star midfielder Pogba said before the final, according to AFP. “There are people of many different origins, that’s what makes France so beautiful. We all feel French. We’re happy to wear this shirt.”",
        "Midfielder Blaise Matuidi, born in Toulouse to an Angolan father and a Congolese mother, said on Friday: “The diversity of the squad is in the image of this beautiful country that is France.”",
        "“For us, it’s superb,” he added. “We are proud to represent this beautiful jersey and I think the people are also proud to have a national team like that.”",
        "But it’s unclear how long France’s far-right will find it politically advantageous to stay away from turning the national team into a target again. France’s 1998 victory brought the country together, but political divisions over race and identity quickly re-emerged. Despite French joy at the World Cup result, politically, Europe has rarely been as divided as it is now.",

        "“I can’t tell you that, I assume he probably is,” Trump told Morgan during the wide-ranging interview, conducted aboard Air Force One in Essex, England, on Friday and published on Sunday in The Daily Mail.",
        "“But I could name others also,” Trump said.",
        "Trump, in Britain over the weekend for a state visit, went on to say he anticipates getting along with Putin, who he has met with before.",

I said, well, it’s too early to say but right now I say we’re competitors ― but for the United States, and frankly the U.K. and other places, to get along with Russia and China and all of these other places... that’s a good thing, that’s not a bad thing. That’s a really good thing.”",
        "Morgan asked Trump about “ruthless” North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who the president had lavishly praised after the pair held a summit in Singapore last month.",
        "“Sure he is, he’s ruthless, but so are others,” Trump said of Kim. “I mean, plenty of the people that I deal with are pretty ruthless people.”",

The Skripals subsequently recovered.",
        "Sturgess’ partner, 45-year-old Charlie Rowley from Amesbury, a town a few miles from Salisbury, is still recovering in hospital after falling critically ill.\n\nOn Friday the police said they had recovered and identified a small bottle in Rowley’s house, which they believe was the source of the contamination.\n\nThey said on Saturday “a significant number (of the 400-odd items recovered) are potentially contaminated” and they have been submitted to laboratories for analysis.\n\n“Work is ongoing to establish whether the nerve agent is from the same batch as used in the attack against Sergei and Yulia Skripal in March, and this remains a main line of enquiry for the investigation team,” the police said in a statement.\n\nBritain and its allies blamed Russia for the attack in March on the Skripals, prompting the biggest Western expulsion of Russian diplomats since the Cold War. Moscow has rejected the accusations and has hit back by expelling Western diplomats.\n\nThe Russian embassy in London called on Britain on Saturday to share information about the substance used in the poisoning.\n\n“We would like the British side to share with us the information regarding the type of substance used and the correlation between this incident and other mysterious poisonings happening in the vicinity of the secret military chemical laboratory in Porton Down,” it said in a statement posted on its website before Saturday’s police statement.\n\nBritain has invited independent technical experts from the international chemical weapons watchdog to travel to the UK early next week to independently confirm the identity of the nerve agent, the British Foreign Office said on Friday.\n\nAn inquest into Sturgess’ death is set to open and adjourn in Salisbury next Thursday.\n\n(Reporting by James Davey, additional reporting by Maria Kiselyova, editing by Andy Bruce and Gareth Jones)"

        "AT&T was sued by the Justice Department on antitrust grounds, saying that the deal would harm consumers, but won approval last month from U.S. District Judge Richard Leon to move forward with the deal following a lengthy trial. The merger, first announced in October 2016, was also opposed by President Donald Trump.",
        "Leon ruled that the tie-up between AT&T’s wireless and satellite businesses with Time Warner’s movies and television shows was legal under antitrust law.",
        "AT&T general counsel David McAtee said the company is “surprised” the Justice Department is appealing. “We are ready to defend the court’s decision at the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals,” McAtee said in a statement. “The court’s decision could hardly have been more thorough, fact-based, and well-reasoned.”",
        "A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment.",

The government’s notice of appeal filed in U.S. District Court in Washington did not disclose on what grounds it intends to challenge the approval.",

        "In 2016, the Justice Department had demanded that AT&T sell the Turner networks, which include CNN, as part of approving the merger.",
        "Deals approved by a federal judge have been undone on appeal in the past.",
        "In 2001, H.J. Heinz Co called off its acquisition of Beech-Nut after an appeals court overturned a lower court’s decision to allow the merger. The Federal Trade Commission had argued the deal would have merged the No. 2 and No. 3 baby food makers and that competition would be “lessened substantially” in the $800-million-a-year U.S. market for baby food if it were to go forward.",

        "BRUSSELS (Reuters) ― NATO leaders will try on Thursday to move beyond U.S. President Donald Trump’s demands for higher defense spending, and focus on ending the long war in Afghanistan, in the second day of a summit in Brussels underscored by transatlantic tensions.",
        "On a trip that will also take Trump to Britain and to Helsinki to meet Russia’s Vladimir Putin, the president spent the first day of the NATO summit lambasting allies for failing to spend the targeted 2 percent of GDP on defense and accused Germany of being a prisoner to Russian energy.\n\nIn a series of tweets on Wednesday night and Thursday morning, Trump criticized Germany and other NATO nations for not spending “nearly enough.”",
        "The tweets followed an uncomfortable first round at the summit where anxious Western allies were subjected to the U.S. president’s “America first” approach. His comment that Germany was controlled by Russia earned a rebuke from Berlin.\n\nOn day two, leaders will welcome non-NATO partners including Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and Ukraine’s Petro Poroshenko to the alliance’s new glass-and-steel headquarters as they seek to focus on policy rather than politics.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May tried to set the tone on Wednesday by announcing more troops for NATO’s Afghan training mission.\n\n“We will be deploying an additional 440 personnel to NATO’s Resolute Support mission in Afghanistan and I think that shows when NATO calls, the UK is one of the first to step up,” May told reporters.\n\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization chief Jens Stoltenberg wants leaders to agree to fund Afghan security forces until 2024, despite public fatigue in Western countries about their involvement in the conflict.\n\nFunding has averaged at about $1 billion annually and Stoltenberg has said he expected that level to be met.\n\nLeaders will be keen to hear more about Trump’s military approach to Afghanistan, which he revamped last August to include a surge in air strikes to force Taliban militants to the negotiating table.\n\nU.S. officials have told Reuters that Washington is preparing another review of strategy, a year after Trump begrudgingly agreed to extend involvement in the 17-year-old war.\n\nTrump was opposed to remaining in America’s longest war, but his advisers convinced him to give it more time. He authorized the deployment of an additional 3,000 troops, bringing the total to around 15,000.",
        "Trump’s tweets also repeated his insistence from earlier in the summit that Germany was wrong to support an $11 billion Baltic Sea pipeline to import even more Russian gas while being slow to meet targets for NATO spending.\n\n“Pipeline dollars to Russia are not acceptable!” he wrote.\n\nBut Trump appeared earlier to substantially overstate German reliance on Russian energy and to imply Berlin was funding a pipeline that Chancellor Angela Merkel says is a commercial venture.\n\nHaving chided NATO members for failing to reach a target of spending 2 percent of national income on defense, Trump told fellow leaders on Wednesday he would prefer a goal of 4 percent, similar to U.S. levels, officials said.\n\nThat would represent a massive upheaval of budgetary priorities in Europe where Germany and many others have pledged only to reach 2 percent by 2024 or later, and it was not clear what allies would spend the money on.\n\nAt the summit on Thursday, leaders will discuss ties with Georgia and Ukraine, two NATO membership hopefuls that contribute to troop levels in Afghanistan but have seen their chances of joining the alliance hampered by Russian incursions into their territory.\n\nUnder NATO rules, countries with territorial conflicts cannot join the Western alliance and neither country is expected to progress in membership talks.\n\nMacedonia, however, which was formally invited to start accession talks on Wednesday, will be part of a special ceremony on Thursday as the alliance sets the stage for expanding to its 30th member state."

        "Life in the Rocky Mountains is frequently extreme as blizzards, baking sun and fires alternate with the seasons. But fire tsunamis? Those aren’t normal.",
        "On Thursday, one observer described a “tsunami” of flames overnight at the Spring Creek fire near La Veta in the south-central part of the state. And you can’t stop tsunamis.",
        "“It was a perfect firestorm,” Ben Brack, incident commander for the Spring Creek fire, told the Denver Post. “You can imagine standing in front of a tsunami or tornado and trying to stop it from destroying homes. A human response is ineffective.”",
        "Pyrocumulus clouds, a sure indicator of intense heat release from wildfire, were clearly visible from 100 miles away. The fire is just five percent contained and covers more than 100,000 acres — larger than the city limits of Denver — making it the third-largest wildfire in state history.",
        "A 300-foot tower of flames wiped out an entire subdivision, according to the Post. Officials aren’t yet sure how many homes were torched overnight (they’re too busy fighting the fire to count), but the latest available number is in the hundreds. No one has been injured or killed so far.",
        "The official term for the hellish meteorological event that hit La Veta is a “firestorm,” a self-propelling explosion of flame generated by strong and gusty winds from a particularly intense fire over extremely dry terrain. When a fire gets hot enough, it can generate its own weather conditions and wind speeds can approach hurricane force, drying out the surrounding land. In just a few hours on Wednesday night, the Spring Creek fire swelled by nearly 20,000 acres, with airborne sparks igniting new fires nearly one mile downwind.",
        "Months of unusually dry and warm weather have combined to push Colorado’s fire risk to “historic levels,” leading the state to close millions of acres of public lands. Two-thirds of the state is in drought. It’s part of a pattern of intense fire dangercurrently plaguing most of the western United States, which is unlikely to fade anytime soon.",
        "Fire is a natural part of ecosystems throughout the West, but what’s happening now is far from natural. There’s growing evidence that climate change is starting to create the conditions for more frequent firestorms.",
        "In 2012, the most destructive wildfire in Colorado history swept through Colorado Springs, torching nearly 350 homes. In 2016, when a fast-moving wildfire destroyed more than 2,000 homes in Fort McMurray, Canada, it took 15 months to fully extinguish. Last year, in Santa Rosa, California, entire neighborhoods were erased.",
        "Over the past two decades, more than 800 million of Colorado’s trees have been consumed by bugs — a phenomenon more common worldwide as warmer temperatures are helping plant-eating pests flourish in previously cool places. To top it off, this past winter was one of the warmest and driest ever recorded, “the stuff of nightmares,” according to local experts. Rivers are running at about half their normal levels, and the summer monsoon rains still haven’t arrived.",
        "It’s clear that the state’s steady and transformative slide into a drier future has already begun. This week’s firestorm is terrifying proof."

        "“Just like me, you came to EPA to protect the environment,” Wheeler said, adding that he considers it a “privilege” to “lead the agency in its vital mission of protecting human health and the environment.”",
        "“I value your input and feedback, and you will find me and my team ready to listen,” he added. “My instinct will be to defend your work, and I will seek the facts from you before drawing conclusions.”",
        "His comments at the agency’s headquarters in Washington appeared aimed at restoring order to the scandal-plagued EPA. Pruitt resigned on July 5 amid mounting ethics scandals and at least 18 federal investigations.",
        "Wheeler, a climate change skeptic and a former coal lobbyist, applauded the “tremendous progress” made during Pruitt’s tenure, including investments in water infrastructure and cleaning up Superfund sites. Wheeler promised to build on those accomplishments and continue “reining in federal regulatory overreach.”",
        "Trump delivered a clear message in a call last week, Wheeler said, to ask him to take over the agency. “He said, ‘Clean up the air, clean up the water and provide regulatory relief,’” Wheeler said. “I think we can do all of those things at the same time.”",
        "He took the opportunity Wednesday to defend himself against what he jokingly described as “flattering” press reports about his time as a coal lobbyist. He said he was “proud of the work” he did for coal baron Bob Murray, which he claimed primarily focused on helping retired mine workers obtain pension and health care benefits.",
        "“I don’t think that story has been out there,” he said.",
        "As a lobbyist for Murray Energy, Wheeler helped the company challenge environmental regulations, including the Obama-era Clean Power Plan, and sow doubt about the science of climate change, as HuffPost previously reported.",
        "In a statement Wednesday, Denise Morrison, the acting president of the American Federation of Government Employees Council 238, said that while Wheeler “will be more disciplined than his predecessor,” his speech was “simply a superficial attempt to plug the leaks and quell the dissent.”",
        "“A successful coal lobbyist doesn’t change his stripes,” she added. “He will continue to champion deregulation and permit big polluters to evade compliance altogether.”",
        "AFGE Council 238 represents more than 8,000 EPA workers nationwide."

        "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump has decided on who he will pick for a lifetime position on the U.S. Supreme Court and will announce the nomination later on Monday, with four conservative federal appellate judges as the top contenders to succeed retiring long-time Justice Anthony Kennedy.",
        "The Republican president, with an opportunity to further put his stamp on the court with the second appointee of his 18 months in office, is expected to choose among four judges with strong conservative credentials: Thomas Hardiman, Brett Kavanaugh, Raymond Kethledge and Amy Coney Barrett. A source familiar with the process said Trump has made his choice.\n\nAll are young enough that they could serve on the nine-member high court for decades. Trump is poised to make his announcement at 9 p.m. ET.\n\nA person familiar with the selection process earlier indicated Trump was narrowing the field, with Barrett the least likely among the four to be chosen.\n\n“The president was very impressed with Barrett but said on a number of occasions it might be best to save her for a future vacancy,” the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nHardiman, 53, has served on the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals since 2007, having been appointed by Republican former President George W. Bush, after four years as a U.S. district judge in western Pennsylvania. Hardiman, a one-time cab driver from Waltham, Massachusetts who was the first member of his family to attend college, served alongside Trump’s older sister, Judge Maryanne Trump Barry, on the 3rd Circuit. She no longer hears cases.\n\nKavanaugh, 53, has served since 2006 on the influential U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. A former White House aide under Bush who previously worked for Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel who investigated Democratic former President Bill Clinton in the 1990s, he faced a long confirmation battle when Bush nominated him to his current post.\n\nKethledge, 51, has served on the Cincinnati-based 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals since 2008 after also being appointed by Bush. A former aide to a Republican senator, Kethledge also previously worked as an in-house lawyer for Ford Motor Co.\n\nBarrett, 46, has the least judicial experience of the four, with only eight months as a judge after spending most of her career as a conservative legal scholar. Barrett was appointed by Trump to the Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year. Barrett, a married mother of seven and a devout Roman Catholic, is a favorite among social conservatives and conservative Christian leaders.\n\nIDEOLOGICAL BREAKDOWN\n\nThe appointment will not change the ideological breakdown of a court that already has a 5-4 conservative majority but nevertheless could move the court to the right. Kennedy sometimes joined the liberal justices on key rulings on divisive social issues like abortion and gay rights, a practice his replacement may not duplicate.\n\nKennedy, 81, announced on June 27 plans to retire after three decades on the court, effective on July 31.\n\nTrump’s selection will set up a confirmation showdown in the U.S. Senate, where his fellow Republicans hold a slim 51-49 majority, though with ailing Senator John McCain battling cancer in his home state of Arizona they currently can muster only 50 votes. Without Republican defections, however, Senate rules leave Democrats with scant options to block confirmation of Trump’s nominee.\n\nTrump last year appointed Neil Gorsuch, who has already become one of the most conservative justices after Senate Republicans in 2016 refused to consider Democratic former President Barack Obama’s nominee Merrick Garland to fill a vacancy left by the death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia. As a result, Democrats have accused Republicans of stealing a Supreme Court seat. Gorsuch restored the court’s conservative majority.",
        "Democrats are certain to press Trump’s latest nominee on the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion nationwide, a decision some conservatives - particularly conservative Christians - have long wanted to overturn.\n\nTrump has previously said he wanted “pro-life” justices opposed to abortion rights. Top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer on Monday said Trump’s nominee should be obligated to make his or her views clear on matters like the Roe ruling. Not long after Schumer spoke, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell accused the “far left” of engaging in “scare tactics” over the nominee.\n\nThe White House said former Republican Senator Jon Kyl, now a Washington lobbyist, will help Trump’s nominee navigate the Senate confirmation process.\n\nThe new justice can be expected to cast crucial votes on other matters of national importance including gay rights, gun control, the death penalty and voting rights. The court could also be called upon to render judgment on issues of personal significance to Trump and his administration including matters arising from Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s ongoing Russia-related investigation and several civil lawsuits pending against Trump."

        "TOKYO (Reuters) ― The death toll from unprecedented rains in Japan rose to at least 64 on Sunday after rivers burst their banks and forced several million people from their homes, media reports said, with more rain set to hit some areas for at least another day.",
        "Torrential rains pounded some parts of western Japan with three times the usual precipitation for a normal July and set off landslides and sent rivers surging over their banks, trapping many people in their houses or on rooftops.\n\n“We’ve never experienced this kind of rain before,” an official at the Japanese Meteorological Agency (JMA) told a news conference. “This is a situation of extreme danger.”\n\nAt least 64 people were killed and 44 missing, national broadcaster NHK said after the death toll had been put at 49 overnight. Among the missing was a 9-year-old boy believed trapped in his house by a landslide that killed at least three others, one of them a man in his 80s.\n\n“All I have is what I’m wearing,” a rescued woman clutching a toy poodle told NHK television.\n\n“We had fled to the second floor but then the water rose more, so we went up to the third floor,” she said.",
        "Japan’s government set up an emergency management center at the prime minister’s office and some 54,000 rescuers from the military, police and fire departments were dispatched across a wide swath of southwestern and western Japan.\n\n“There are still many people missing and others in need of help, we are working against time,” Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said.\n\nEmergency warnings for severe rain remained in effect for three prefectures, with 300 mm (11 inches) predicted to fall by Monday morning in parts of the smallest main island of Shikoku.\n\nEvacuation orders remained in place for some 2 million people and another 2.3 million were advised to evacuate, although rain had stopped and floodwaters receded in some areas. Landslide warnings were issued in more than a quarter of the nation’s prefectures.\n\n“My husband couldn’t make it home from work since the road was flooded, and since it was pouring down rain I didn’t have enough courage to walk to an evacuation center with two infants after dark,” one woman wrote on Twitter, without giving further details.",
        "The rain began late last week as the remnants of a typhoon fed into a seasonal rainy front, with humid, warm air pouring in from the Pacific making it still more active ― a pattern similar to one that set off flooding in southwestern Japan exactly a year ago that killed dozens. The front then remained in one place for an unusually long time, the JMA said.\n\nRoads were closed and train services suspended in parts of western Japan. Shinkansen bullet train services, resumed on a limited schedule after they were suspended on Friday.\n\nAutomakers including Mazda Motor Corp and Daihatsu Motor Co suspended operations at several plants on Saturday due to a shortage of parts or dangerous conditions. They were set to decide later on Sunday on plans for the coming week.\n\nElectronics maker Panasonic Corp said one plant in Okayama, western Japan, could not be reached due to road closures, although it had been closed for the weekend anyway. A decision about next week would be made on Monday.\n\nWhile the Japanese government monitors weather conditions closely and issues warnings from an early stage, the fact that much of the country outside of major cities is mountainous and building takes place on virtually every bit of usable land leaves it vulnerable to disasters.\n\nReforestation policies after World War Two that saw many mountains logged and replanted with trees whose roots are less able to retain water have also contributed to the danger.\n\n(Additional reporting by Junko Fujita and Makiko Yamazaki; Editing by Paul Tait)"

        "Leonard Leo, a leader of the conservative Federalist Society who is advising President Donald Trump on his Supreme Court pick, said Sunday it’s a mystery whether one of the job’s finalists would vote to overturn Roe v. Wade.",
        "“Nobody really knows,” Leo said on ABC’s “This Week.” “I think it’s a bit of a scare tactic and rank speculation more than anything else.”",
        "But Trump himself has said he wants to put people on the court who support overturning the landmark 1973 decision that granted women the constitutional right to have an abortion. And if anyone knows of a potential Supreme Court pick who would support doing this, it’s Leo.",
        "He crafted Trump’s short list of potential Supreme Court nominees. All but one of the 25 people on the list are members of The Federalist Society, a national organization of conservative lawyers, and there’s a clear pattern to judicial nominees being fed by the group: They are young, conservative and have records of being very opposed to abortion rights.",
        "Leo has the powerful track record of helping to pick and confirm three of the court’s conservative justices, John Roberts, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch. He’s also had a hand in Trump’s picks for lower courts; the president has gotten a whopping 21 circuit court judges confirmed since taking office and nearly all were outsourced to The Federalist Society to fill.",
        "It’s no secret that Leo’s goal is to populate federal courts with judges who oppose abortion rights. And analysts say Trump’s latest pick for the court could provide the fifth vote needed to rescind Roe v. Wade.",
        "The president is set to announce his Supreme Court nominee on Monday night. He’s reportedly down to four possible picks, all of whom are Federalist Society members: Brett Kavanaugh, Amy Coney Barrett, Raymond Kethledge and Thomas Hardiman.",
        "Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), a member of the Judiciary Committee that will hold the confirmation hearing for Trump’s court pick, said Sunday that it’s clear to him that Trump wants a justice committed to overturning Roe v. Wade. He called it “extraordinary” that The Federalist Society is playing such a central role in the process.",
        "“I was a law clerk to Justice [Harry] Blackmun. I’ve argued cases before the Supreme Court,” Blumenthal said on “This Week.” “I’ve never seen a president of the United States in effect make himself a puppet of outside groups and choose from a group of right-wing fringe ideologues that are prepared on this list.”"

Americans, the North said, pushed a “unilateral and gangster-like demand for denuclearization” over the two days of talks in Pyongyang, The New York Times reported.",

        "“These are complicated issues, but we made progress on almost all of the central issues,” Pompeo said before boarding a plane to depart North Korea, according to a pool report. “Some places a great deal of progress, other places there’s still more work to be done.”",

Yet many observers are skeptical of the country’s commitment to dismantling its nuclear program. Multiple reports indicated that North Korea has actually increased its production of nuclear materials and made attempts to conceal such weaponry in recent weeks.",

        "Two women connected to Mother Teresa’s religious order were arrested this week for allegedly selling a baby born at a shelter for unwed mothers in India.",
        "The women ― one religious sister and one employee ― were affiliated with a shelter run by the Missionaries of Charity in the eastern state of Jharkhand, The Associated Press reported. One other charity worker at the shelter was also brought in for questioning.",
        "Police officer Aman Kumar told the AP on Wednesday that local authorities are investigating at least three other complaints that shelter employee Anima Indwar illegally sold children to childless couples.",
        "“We are investigating to see how the operation was run and how many more children have been given away in the last few years,” Kumar told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.",
        "The arrests on Tuesday and Wednesday were prompted by a complaint filed by a state-run child welfare committee, according to the BBC. The committee claims a couple from Uttar Pradesh, a northern Indian state, paid 120,000 rupees (about $1,760) for a newborn boy born to a young woman at a Missionaries of Charity shelter in the city of Ranchi. The couple was allegedly told that the money was for hospital expenses.",
        "Indwar reportedly sold the baby to the couple on May 14, according to the Press Trust of India news agency (PTI). After the state’s child welfare committee conducted a surprise check at the shelter, Indwar reportedly called the couple on July 1 and asked them to visit the shelter to complete some formalities. Indwar reportedly took the child away when the couple arrived.",
        "The charity’s spokeswoman, Sunita Kumar, told the AP that it is conducting an internal investigation. The spokeswoman said that the charity hadn’t taken money from parents while facilitating adoptions in the past.",
        "The Missionaries of Charity opted to shut down its adoption services in India in 2015 after objecting to the Indian government’s decision to allow single or divorced parents to adopt children.",
        "“There was no question of selling any child as the Missionaries of Charity had stopped giving children for adoption three years ago,” Sunita Kumar told the AP.",
        "The boy is now in the custody of the state, PTI reported. Twelve pregnant women who were living at the Missionaries of Charity’s Ranchi shelter have been transferred to a government-run shelter, according to the AP.",
        "Mother Teresa, a Nobel Peace Prize winner and a Catholic saint, founded the Missionaries of Charity in Kolkata, India, in 1950. Members of the order, known for their distinctive blue-and-white saris, dedicate their lives to serving the “poorest of the poor” by caring for the sick and homeless, and educating children.",
        "In 2015, the latest year for which statistics are available, the order had more than 5,000 religious sisters stationed in 139 countries."

        "Samarn Poonan, a former member of Thailand’s elite navy SEAL unit who was part of the rescue team in Chiang Rai, died on Thursday night after entering the cave to lay oxygen tanks along a potential exit route, the SEAL commander said.",
        "“The conditions in the cave are tough,” Admiral Apakorn Yuukongkaew, commander of the SEALS unit, told reporters on Friday.",
        "“Once he placed the oxygen tanks he became unconscious on his way back. His buddy tried to administer first aid, when there was no response he tried to move him,” Apakorn said.",

        "“A navy SEAL just passed away last night. How about a 12-year-old boy that will have to pass through?” Rafael Aroush, an Israeli living in Thailand and volunteer who arrived at the cave site on Thursday, told Reuters.",
        "“There will be rain and many things could go wrong. I don’t want to say it, but it could be a catastrophe,” he said.",
        "Chiang Rai Governor Narongsak Osottanakorn said on Thursday that rescuers were preparing a five km (three miles) “oxygen pipeline” as part of preparations for the group’s extraction but added that the boys would not be coming out soon.",
        "“You see we are increasing the number of people going inside the cave. So we have to fill it up with oxygen,” Narongsak told reporters.",
        "Rescuers, including international teams, are considering alternative ways to bring the group out before heavy rains hit the country’s north next week which could further hamper the rescue operation.",
        "“We have considered many alternatives to find the most feasible ones,” Narongsak said.",
        "Deep Water",
        "Rescue alternatives include teaching the boys to dive and then swim out, a highly risky venture, remaining in the cave for months until the wet season ends and flood waters recede, or drilling a shaft into the cave from the forest above.",
        "The boys, aged between 11 and 16, and their assistant coach were found inside the cave on Monday, after nine days underground, hungry but in good spirits. They went missing after they set out to explore the cave on June 23.",
        "Rescuers are deciding how to remove the group but have been slowed down by logistical issues including high water levels inside the cave and narrow, flooded passages which would require the boys to dive alone.",
        "The Thai navy is teaching the boys the basics of diving, with a view to guiding them out through flood waters.",
        "But getting them out won’t be easy. The boys will have to be taught how to use scuba diving gear and how to navigate a cave that has frustrated even the most expert divers.",
        "“Regarding the plan for the 13 to swim or dive, there is only one critical point which it is risky: It is where every boy has to dive alone. The point is very narrow ... It is very deep water. The distance is pretty long,” said Narongsak.",
        "Some of the boys cannot swim.",
        "But rescuers are considering other options including keeping the 13 inside the Tham Luang cave until the flood waters recede, at the end of the rainy season in about four months.",
        "Others say the boys could be out in days if the weather is on their side and enough water can be pumped out of the cave to enable the boys to get out the same way they got in, on foot, perhaps with some swimming.",
        "Another possibility would be to find an alternative way into their chamber, such as drilling a shaft into the cave from the forested mountain above.",
        "Heavy monsoon rains are forecast for next week in most of the north, according to Thailand’s meteorological department."

        "Prominent Jewish groups are condemning Pope Francis’ decision to push Poland’s top Roman Catholic priest during and after World War II further along the road to sainthood, claiming the would-be saint’s legacy is tainted by anti-Semitic views.",
        "Pope Francis confirmed the “heroic virtues” of Cardinal August Hlond in late May, which means that he put a stamp of approval on a Vatican body’s initial review of the priest’s candidacy for sainthood. The Vatican now needs to confirm Hlond’s involvement in two miracles before the priest, who died in 1948, can become a saint.",
        "But two leading U.S.-based Jewish organizations, the American Jewish Committee and the Simon Wiesenthal Center, have already stepped in to question Hlond’s attitude toward Polish Jews.",
        "Rabbi David Rosen, the AJC’s director of interreligious affairs, criticized Hlond in a letter to the pontifical commission tasked with maintaining good relations with Jews.",
        "Moving forward with the canonization process “will be perceived within the Jewish community and beyond as an expression of approval of Cardinal Hlond’s extremely negative approach towards the Jewish community,” Rosen wrote in the letter.",
        "Hlond, who led the Roman Catholic Church in Poland between 1926 and his death, is revered in the country for opposing Nazi Germany’s occupation of the country and attempting to maintain the Catholic Church’s independence when communism took root after the war, The Associated Press reports.",
        "But Jewish groups believe Hlond’s legacy is tainted by his anti-Semitic views. In a 1936 pastoral letter sent to Polish churches, Hlond warned his flock to stay away from the “harmful moral influence of Jews” and to avoid Jewish shops and publications.",
        "“It is a fact that the Jews are fighting against the Catholic Church, persisting in free thinking, and are the vanguard of godlessness, Bolshevism and subversion,” Hlond wrote in the letter, according to a translation provided by AP.",
        "Hlond wrote in the letter that “not all Jews” exhibited those qualities, and there were many “ethically outstanding, noble and respectable” Jews. He also urged Poles not to attack Jews or their property. Still, the priest ultimately criticized Jews for rejecting Jesus, Rosen wrote.",
        "Philip Cunningham, director of the Institute for Jewish-Catholic Relations at Saint Joseph’s University, told HuffPost that Hlond’s views reflected the nearly universal attitude of Christians of that era. It wasn’t until the Second Vatican Council in 1965 that the Catholic Church officially denounced anti-Semitism.",
        "Hlond was outspoken in his public condemnation of the Nazis’ attacks on Catholic priests, property and people in Poland, Cunningham said. However, he said the priest “spoke ambivalently” about the Nazis’ racist ideology.",
        "“He seems to have denounced the Nazi persecution of Jews while simultaneously speaking of Jews as alienated from God and enemies of the church,” Cunningham explained in an email.",
        "In addition, the AJC said Hlond failed to publicly speak out against anti-Jewish violence in Poland after World War II. During a press conference after a 1946 pogrom in Kielce that left at least 40 Jews dead, Hlond refused to condemn the attack or urge Poles to stop murdering Jews, Rosen wrote.",
        "“Rather, he pointed out that the Jews were all communists or supporters of communism and that the pogrom was their own fault,” Rosen wrote.",
        "The Simon Wiesenthal Center urged Pope Francis to put an end to Hlond’s candidacy for sainthood.",
        "“Jews do not usually speak out about a candidate for Sainthood, but such a move by Pope Francis to elevate a lifelong anti-Semite to Sainthood would be shameful,” the center’s leaders said in a statement.",
        "The center also warned that canonizing Hlond would further embolden far-right, nationalist movements in Poland. Polish lawmakers sparked international criticism in February for passing a law, backed by the right-wing Law and Justice party, that made it a crime to suggest Poland was complicit in the Holocaust. In June, the country’s parliament tweaked the law to ensure that violators would not be imprisoned.",
        "Before World War II, Poland was home to Europe’s largest Jewish population. About 90 percent of Polish Jews ― more than 3 million people ― were murdered during the Holocaust.",
        "Despite the criticism, Hlond is still a well-respected figure in Poland, which is still an overwhelmingly Catholic country. Archbishop Wojciech Polak of Gniezno, the leader of the Roman Catholic Church in Poland, tweeted that he hoped Hlond would be “beatified and canonized as soon as possible.”",
        "The Polish Bishops’ Conference insisted in a tweet Thursday that Hlond had saved many Polish, German and French Jews from deportation to death camps ― and had condemned the Kielce pogrom during a conversation with a Jewish professor in 1946.",
        "The Rev. Boguslaw Koziol, a priest who has been campaigning for Hlond’s sainthood, rejects claims that Hlond was anti-Semitic. He told AP that Hlond’s 1936 letter was progressive for its time. Although it contained questionable elements by today’s standards, the letter’s overarching aim was to protect Jews, he said.",
        "Critics “have focused on this negative part of the letter, but are not quoting any other part,” Koziol told AP.",
        "In addition, Koziol said that Hlond was restricted from speaking up about the Kielce pogrom after the war because of Poland’s communist-controlled media.",
        "Koziol told the Catholic News Service that Hlond’s canonization process could face delays if the Vatican seeks further clarifications about this issue.",
        "When a canonization has the potential to generate divisiveness and hostility, the Vatican usually chooses not to move the process further, Cunningham said.",
        "In 2005, Pope Benedict XVI suspended the beatification of French priest Leon Dehon after receiving complaints about his anti-Semitic writings.",
        "Cunningham said he believes the current discussions about Hlond actually illustrate the vitality of modern-day Jewish-Catholic relations.",
        "“It is strong and resilient enough to enable and to cope with controversial and painful topics that probably by their very nature cannot be fully resolved to everyone’s satisfaction,” he said."

This is the best show I’ve seen so far this year.\n\nPremise: A “Groundhog Day”-inspired story that focuses on a woman who keeps dying and returning to a party for her 36th birthday. This video game programmer (and fashionable New Yorker) has to act like a detective to try to piece together why this happens to her, as she wonders whether her mother’s mental illness might be manifesting in her.\n\nStars: Natasha Lyonne.",
        "How excited should you be? So excited. I loved this show and found myself having to binge this to the end, an easy task since each of the eight episodes is only about a half-hour long. The show does so many things well, most impressive of which is tackling dark philosophical questions while still being fun. Each character ― even the minor ones ― appears to have a fully realized backstory and speaks with witty, intelligent dialogue. Although the plot moves at a fast pace, this show has so many wonderful details, from subtle jokes to beautiful costuming, that deserve close attention.",
        "Any reasons to be skeptical? It does kind of feel tiresome that this is yet another show about rich New Yorkers. From the ridiculously expensive apartments to the casual use of hard drugs to the abundant orgy situations, I have to imagine this show feels like it takes place on a foreign planet to most people (although that comment might just be a self-own on my personal, more boring lifestyle).",

A serial killer starts to send messages to the detective, which sets off a cat-and-mouse mystery that, of course, involves murder.\n\nStars: Rupert Grint and John Malkovich.",
        "How excited should you be? Amazon doesn’t have as many British crime shows as Netflix, so adding this highly stylized detective thriller should be a welcome move for fans of that genre. Malkovich elevates everything he stars in (even with a ridiculous accent this time around) and Grint looks nothing like Grint in this role, so that’s kind of fun. Although this show wallows in grimness, clever moments of humor peek through occasionally.\n\nAny reasons to be skeptical? This show plods along at a glacial pace. During multiple scenes, I wondered if my internet had slowed down and I was watching this at half-speed. The poor direction and dialogue make this hard to get through, so you really have to love detective thrillers to find enjoyment here. Sometimes I watch shows with hourlong episodes that feel too long, but it’s hard to say what should have been cut. That’s not the case here, as the show decides to spend a laughable amount of time focusing on shots of sinks and typewriters and other uninteresting inanimate objects.",

        "A spokesperson for the USHMM told HuffPost that by July 1942, “it was clear that Otto’s efforts to get to the U.S. would not succeed in time to avoid Nazi genocidal policies.”",
        "Otto Frank, a German Jew, relocated his family to Amsterdam in 1933, as Nazi leaders passed increasingly restrictive laws regulating all aspects of life for Jews in Germany.",
        "Gertjan Broek, a researcher at the Anne Frank House, and Rebecca Erbelding from the USHMM wrote in their report that Otto Frank began seeking ways to escape to the U.S. as early as 1938.",
        "At the time, the U.S. had no specific refugee policy. The government enforced stringent national origin quotas, restricting the number of people from each country who could immigrate to the U.S. per year. People fleeing persecution had to clear the same bureaucratic hurdles that all other immigrants faced, such as obtaining birth and wedding certificates, affidavits of support from family members in the U.S., medical records, letters from employers and tax documents.",
        "Immigrants were also required to collect exit visas from their countries of residence. In 1941 the Nazis stripped German Jews living outside Germany of their nationality, which meant that those who had fled to other countries — like the Franks — were rendered stateless.",
        "The Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, a Jewish nonprofit that helps resettle refugees, said there are parallels between the policies that kept the Franks from finding refuge in the U.S. and the immigration policies adopted by Donald Trump’s administration.",
        "Melanie Nezer, an HIAS senior vice president for public affairs, pointed to the extreme vetting procedures the White House has called for and Trump’s travel ban, which suspended the refugee resettlement program.",
        "“These nationality-based bans echo the policies that kept people from German-occupied countries out of the United States beginning in 1941,” she told HuffPost via email. “Even though they were not explicitly the target of these policies, Jews were particularly impacted by them.”",
        "After the outbreak of World War II, the U.S. government became increasingly concerned with the possibility of spies and saboteurs immigrating to the U.S., the researchers wrote. In 1941, the State Department decided that applicants with close relatives in German-occupied countries would no longer be eligible for visas. State Department officials were instructed to scrutinize every application even more carefully and reject anyone about whom they had any doubts.",
        "At the same time, U.S. citizens had largely negative views of refugees overall. According to the report, a May 1938 public opinion poll found that 67 percent of Americans surveyed said they wanted to keep German, Austrian and “other political refugees” out of the United States. A Gallup poll conducted in June 1940 found that 71 percent of respondents said they believed that Nazi Germany had established a network of spies and saboteurs in the United States.",
        "Even President Franklin D. Roosevelt warned that some Jewish refugees had been coerced to spy for the Nazis.",
        "“National security took precedence over humanitarian concerns,” Broek and Erbelding wrote.",
        "Meanwhile in Europe, the situation was getting dire for Jewish families. In November of 1938, the year that Otto Frank started trying to immigrate to the U.S., Nazi supporters terrorized Jews throughout the Third Reich in what came to be known as Kristallnacht — the Night of Broken Glass, so named because of the windows of Jewish homes, businesses and synagogues shattered in a wave of violence.",
        "Frank turned to Nathan Straus, an affluent American businessman and friend from college, for help to immigrate to the U.S. In an April 1941 letter to Straus, Frank wrote that he had filed an application at the U.S. consulate in Rotterdam in 1938. But in 1940, while the Franks were waiting for their applications to move forward, that consulate ― and their application papers ― were destroyed in a German bombardment.",
        "In 1941, Frank again tried to relocate to the U.S. He told Straus that he felt America was the only place his family could be safe.",
        "“I am forced to look out for emigration and as far as I can see USA is the only country we could go to,” Frank wrote in the April letter.",
        "But his hopes of moving to the U.S. were dashed by the end of June that year. After the U.S. ordered the closure of all German consulates in the U.S., Germany ordered the closure of all U.S. consulates in Nazi-controlled territory, including the Netherlands. As a result, moving the U.S. was no longer a viable option.",
        "The researchers found no evidence to suggest that Frank was ever interviewed by a U.S. consular official, which means the family was not denied immigration visas.",
        "Frank later turned his attention to Cuba, hoping to use the country as a “jumping board” to the U.S., the report reads. But that visa application was canceled in December 1941 for unclear reasons.",
        "The Franks went into hiding in Amsterdam on July 6, 1942, and were later joined by another Jewish family, the van Pelses, and one more individual. They remained in the secret annex for more than two years, during which Anne kept her famous diary. The group was discovered on Aug. 9, 1944, and deported to various concentration camps.",
        "The researchers wrote that Otto Frank’s efforts to flee to safety were “thwarted by American bureaucracy, war, and time.”",
        "“The conclusion must be that both the Frank and van Pels families’ attempts were not successful because of the rapidly growing numbers of applicants for a small number of openings on the quota lists; the unwillingness of the president, State Department and Congress (or the American people) to open immigration beyond the limits set by the 1924 quota laws or to endeavor to fill these quotas; and, eventually, the impact of the war on the possibility of escape,” Broek and Erbelding wrote in the report.",
        "Otto Frank was the only member of the family who survived the war. He published Anne’s diary in 1947, and it has gone on to be translated into dozens of languages.",
        "Nezer said in her email that modern domestic and international refugee policies were a direct response to the Holocaust and the refugee crisis created by World War II, with U.S. laws and international treaties in place to help refugees and asylum seekers.",
        "But she said the Trump administration’s immigration policies and the language it uses to “dehumanize” refugees are setting back decades of progress in refugee resettlement.",
        "“Regardless of what our leaders say, Americans of faith, and particularly Jewish Americans, understand the importance of the United States as a safe haven for refugees,” Nezer said. “It would be a tragic mistake to reverse course and repeat the mistakes of the past. We are a strong country when we save people who are in harm’s way. We become weak when we reject them and let fear win.”"

        "Months before protesters disrupted Kirstjen Nielsen’s dinner and the owner of a farm-to-table restaurant asked Sarah Huckabee Sanders to leave and hecklers confronted Pam Bondi at a movie theater, 17-year-old Noah Christiansen walked out of class, called his congressman’s office, and said lawmakers should “get off their fucking asses.”",
        "By the phony standards of our national discourse, this was uncivil stuff — never mind that at the time of the call Christiansen was participating in a nationwide school walk-out to demand action on gun control, a civil cause in every sense. This was about a month after the mass shooting in Parkland, Florida, where a gunman killed 17 people at a high school. Christiansen had placed a call to Rep. Mark Amodei (R-Nev.), a National Rifle Association-endorsed politician, who has called for loosening restrictions on gun sales.",
        "You might remember what happened next. Arturo Garzon, the staffer in Amodei’s office who’d taken the call, was unmoved by the high-schooler’s plea for life-saving intervention. But he was bothered by Christiansen’s use of profanity. And so he phoned up the kid’s school in Reno and tattled. Administrators at Robert McQueen High School suspended Christiansen two days for what it determined was an act of “defiance/disrespect/insubordination.” He was also told he couldn’t serve as the school’s class secretary.",
        "The incident was an early entry in our dispiriting National Civility Debate, in which people with little power are scolded by elites for expressing themselves in a manner commensurate with the stakes of this fucking political moment. Emails obtained via a public records request show a fuller picture: of the pettiness of authority figures, sure, but also of what “civility” really means to the sort of people who don’t hang out in TV green rooms.",
        "According to one email, the school’s principal, Amy Marable, justified the punishment by describing Christiansen as a student with a history of behaving uncivilly. In a letter responding to the American Civil Liberties Union, which had taken up Christiansen’s cause, Marable said that he used the “the F word repeatedly” at a debate tournament, had argued that the school’s dress code restrictions on women baring their shoulders promoted rape culture, and handed out condoms in the hallway after being told the school clinic would not provide them to students.",
        "The school eventually removed the suspension from Christiansen’s record and allowed him to serve in student government — but only after hearing from the ACLU and a bunch of angry grown-ups from all over the country. Email after email to Marable chastised the principal for not seeing that the greater obscenity was the phenomenon the teen was addressing — the political cowardice that has created a generation of students like Christiansen who have to worry about getting gunned down in the middle of math class.",
        "One man, who identified himself as an “educator,” advised Marable to tell Amodei and his staff to “fuck off.” (The school redacted Christiansen’s name from all the emails provided to HuffPost.)",
        "Amodei is “a true snowflake,” another remarked.",
        "A professor at Columbia University weighed in and said that Amodei should “get off his fucking ass” and pass gun legislation.",
        "“If people are not passionate and willing to speak out about change more innocent children and people are going to die,” one woman wrote.",
        "Schools should encourage students to call their elected officials, a lawyer wrote.",
        "Even the more civilized adults who thought Christiansen shouldn’t have cussed thought the school went too far.",
        "Teenagers say “fuck” all the time, one eighth-grade teacher helpfully informed Marable.",
        "How can we expect a student to be more polite than the president, several grown-ups wrote.",
        "People who wrote school administrators on Christiansen’s behalf received a carefully worded non-answer about the importance of free speech from the Washoe County School District.",
        "The school’s response did not go over well."

        "WELLINGTON (Reuters) - The New Zealand Court of Appeal ruled on Thursday that internet entrepreneur and Megaupload founder Kim Dotcom could be extradited to the United States to face racketeering and criminal copyright charges.",
        "The court’s written decision rejected Dotcom’s appeal and upheld a lower court ruling in 2017 that the extradition could take place.\n\nThe six-year legal saga is widely seen as a test for how far the United States can reach globally to apply American firms’ intellectual property rights.\n\nU.S. authorities say Dotcom and three co-accused Megaupload executives cost film studios and record companies more than $500 million and generated more than $175 million by encouraging paying users to store and share copyrighted material.\n\nThe Court of Appeal said the United States had disclosed “a clear prima facie case that the appellants conspired to, and did, breach copyright wilfully and on a large scale, for their commercial gain.\n\n“An extradition hearing is not a trial. It is held to decide whether there is sufficient evidence to commit a person for trial on a qualifying offence,” the court said in its ruling.\n\nDotcom’s lawyer Ira Rothken told Reuters via email that his client would appeal the decision in the country’s highest judiciary body, the Supreme Court.\n\n“We look forward to seeking review with the New Zealand Supreme Court. We think that ultimatelyKim Dotcom will prevail,” Rothken said.",
        "Dotcom’s lawyers have argued in previous court cases that copyright infringement is not a criminal offence in New Zealand and that there was not enough evidence that Dotcom and other Megaupload executives conspired to commit a crime.\n\nGerman-born Dotcom, who has New Zealand residency, became well known for his lavish lifestyle as much as his computer skills.\n\nHe used to post photographs of himself with cars and vanity licence plates such as “GOD” and “GUILTY”, shooting an assault rifle and flying around the world in his private jet.\n\nDozens of black-clad police raided Dotcom’s mansion in 2012, breaking him out of a safe room and confiscating millions of dollars in cash and property, including a fleet of luxury cars, computers and art work.\n\n(Reporting by Charlotte Greenfield and Leika Kihara; Editing by Darren Schuettler)"

        "Najib, 64, nodded as he was charged with abuse of power and three counts of criminal breach of trust as part of an investigation into a transaction involving SRC International, a former unit of 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB).",
        "Each of the four charges carries a prison sentence of up to 20 years. The abuse of power charge carries a fine of not less than five times the “value of gratification”.",
        "Najib was granted bail set at 1 million ringgit ($247,000).",
        "“As a public official, which is prime minister and minister of finance, used your position for self gratification (for a) total of 42 million ringgit,” Attorney General Tommy Thomas said referring to the abuse of power charge.",
        "The charges relate to funds that allegedly went from SRC International into Najib’s personal bank account, but are only a fraction of the billions of dollars the U.S. Department of Justice has said was misappropriated from 1MDB.",
        "Najib has consistently denied wrongdoing in relation to 1MDB.",
        "In a stunning fall from grace, Najib was arrested at his home on Tuesday as part of the investigations into 1MDB revived by his successor and mentor-turned-foe Mahathir Mohamad since the surprise May 9 election.",

        "Tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets across Poland on Tuesday night and demonstrations continued into the next day as the government prepared to carry out a radical revamping of the country’s Supreme Court.",
        "Poland’s ruling Law and Justice Party instituted a mandatory retirement age of 65 for Supreme Court justices earlier this year. Only the nation’s president, Andrzej Duda, can make exceptions. The measure took effect at midnight, and will potentially force more than a third of the 72 justices off the bench.",
        "Most notably, the measure will remove Justice Małgorzata Gersdorf, the president of the Supreme Court, whose six-year term was otherwise set to expire in 2020.",
        "On Wednesday morning, Gersdorf defied the legislation and walked into the Supreme Court building for work. She was surrounded by hundreds of supporters chanting “constitution” and singing the Polish national anthem, Reuters reported.",
        "“My presence here is not about politics, I am here to protect the rule of law,” she said.",
        "The purge is the result of a long-running clash between Poland’s judiciary and its right-wing national government, which has accused the justices of obstructionism and has systematically worked to increase its own power over the country’s legal system.",
        "In the hours before the retirement age measure went into effect, protests erupted in dozens of cities around the country.",
        "“We are here because of the destruction of the judiciary in Poland,” one protester told The New York Times, as organizers distributed signs emblazoned with the word “Constitution.”",
        "Last week, an assembly of Supreme Court justices responded to the pending purge by issuing a series of resolutions highlighting Poland’s constitutional guarantee of judicial independence. The resolutions stated that Gersdorf and others facing forced retirement would not comply with the measure.",
        "On Monday, the European Commission announced it was formally notifying the Polish government of the launching of a so-called infringement procedure over the mass dismissals.",
        "“These measures undermine the principle of judicial independence, including the irremovability of judges,” the commission said in a press release, “and thereby Poland fails to fulfill its obligations under Article 19(1) of the Treaty on European Union read in connection with Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.”",
        "The notice stated that the Polish government had one month to respond.",
        "Gersdorf had said she planned to go to the office as usual on Wednesday.",
        "“I will go to my office on Wednesday, but whether I will be let in is another matter,” she told The Guardian on Monday. “It doesn’t happen in well-developed countries that the executive and the legislative branches destroy the judiciary. With no guarantees of basic freedoms, the fundamental rights of Polish citizens will be destroyed sooner or later.”",
        "By Tuesday evening, the government had shown no signs of changing course. According to the Associated Press, the thousands of people gathered in front of the Supreme Court building in Warsaw shouted “Free courts!” and “Down with dictatorship!”",
        "This story has been updated with details from Wednesday."

        "CHIANG RAI, Thailand (Reuters) - Rescuers raced to pump water from a cave in northern Thailand on Tuesday as forecasted heavy rain threatened to complicate efforts to free a young soccer team found trapped for 10 days, an ordeal officials warned they may have to bear longer.",
        "Divers struggled through narrow passages and murky waters to find the 12 boys and their coach late on Monday night on an elevated rock about 2.5 miles from the mouth of the cave.",
        "News of the boys’ survival sparked jubilation in a nation that has been gripped by the harrowing drama.",
        "A video shot by rescuers in flickering torchlight revealed boys clad in shorts and red and blue shirts sitting or standing on the rock above an expanse of water.",
        "“How many of you are there - 13? Brilliant,” a member of the multinational rescue team, speaking in English, tells the boys. “You have been here 10 days. You are very strong.”",
        "“Thank you,” one of the boys says.",
        "One boy asks when they will get out, to which the rescuer answers: “Not today. You have to dive.”",
        "The boys were found in weak condition, but with only minor injuries.",
        "Interior minister Anupong Paochinda said rescuers needed to double down to reduce water levels in the cave.",
        "Rain continued to fall in Chiang Rai on Tuesday and was forecast to intensify from Wednesday.",
        "“Quickly pump out water first to get the kids out as soon as possible,” Anupong told reporters. “If it rains too much, water levels will rise and make getting them out harder.”",
        "Two British divers, John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, were first to reach the boys, having had strong experience in cave rescues, according to Bill Whitehouse of the British Cave Rescue Council.",
        "They found the group along with a team of Thai navy SEAL divers.",
        "Aged between 11 and 16, the boys went missing with the 25-year-old after soccer practice on June 23 after they set out to explore the Tham Luang cave complex in a forest park near Thailand’s northern border with Myanmar.",
        "Rescuers had been focusing on an elevated mound, which cavers have named “Pattaya Beach”, in the cave complex’s third chamber, knowing that it could have provided the boys with a refuge when rains flooded the cave.",
        "But Chiang Rai governor Narongsak Osottanakorn said the divers reached Pattaya Beach but found it flooded, so they went 400 meters further and discovered the team.",
        "JUBILATION",
        "When news came through that the boys had been found, relatives waiting at a nearby shelter were seen cheering, smiling and receiving calls. Rescuers shook hands and congratulated each other as occasional cheers broke out.",
        "Rescuers have to decide how best to get the group out, and were warning it could take time.",
        "In the meantime, the lucky 13 have been given energy gels to sustain them while a plan is worked out to bring them out safely.",
        "Options considered included waiting until water levels subside, or teaching the group to use diving gear to navigate the flooded cave.",
        "“Helping the kids will take time,” Navy chief, Admiral Naris Pratoomsuwan, told reporters.",
        "“From the operations center in the third chamber to where they were found, it takes about three hours to get there and three hours to come back.”",
        "Provincial governor Narongsak said the group’s health was assessed overnight and the boys had sustained only light injuries. Rescue workers would now focus on getting them out, then a hand over to medical teams waiting outside the cave, he said.",
        "Sura Jeetwatee, a doctor who is part of the operations, said the boys were able to walk and had survived by staying where they were and drinking water that dripped from stalactite formations.",
        "“They were smart to drink water in the cave,” Sura told Reuters.",
        "Assistant government spokesman Colonel Athisit Chainuwat said the SEAL team was still with the boys and rescuers were trying to install lights, a power supply and get communications equipment to the boys.",
        "“The prime minister asked that this be a lesson in disaster relief in the future,” Athisit said."

        "WASHINGTON ― Rep. Diane Black (R-Tenn.) said this week that the 2009 stimulus bill ― the $787 billion spending package that pulled the U.S. back from the brink of a depression ― was a flop and that the government should have given that money to women to restock their wardrobes.",
        "“That stimulus plan was such a failure under the previous administration,” Black told CPAC 365, a conference of conservative leaders, on Monday. “If they would have just sent those dollars to we women, we would have bought a lot of shoes and clothes.”",
        "Here’s a video of her remarks:",
        "Black, who recently claimed that pornography leads to school shootings, was not in Congress when the emergency spending bill passed. Economic experts overwhelmingly agree that it pulled the economy out of a recession; the Congressional Budget Office concluded that the gross domestic product in late 2009 was as much as 3.8 percent higher because of the stimulus; and Mark Zandi of Moody’s Analytics estimated that it created 2.5 million more jobs by the end of 2010.",
        "Republicans like to knock the stimulus package as excessive government spending and dub it a failed effort by President Barack Obama. But many of the GOP lawmakers who trashed it at the time went home and celebrated its benefits.",
        "In Black’s home state of Tennessee, for example, Sen. Lamar Alexander (R) opposed the bill but then applied for stimulus money for a project to “create over 200 jobs in the first year and at least another 40 new jobs in the following years.” Then-Rep. Zach Wamp (R) opposed the bill but celebrated $71.2 million in stimulus money for a new lab and another $63 million for a new factory that “means good high-end manufacturing jobs for our region’s workers.”",
        "A spokesman for Black, who is currently running for governor of Tennessee, did not respond to a request for comment on why the congresswoman thinks women could have saved the economy with a Macy’s shopping spree."

        "A former aide to Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt recently told congressional investigators that she was asked to help her boss’s wife find a job with a six-figure salary, according to multiple media reports on Monday.",
        "The revelation constitutes the latest in a long string of reports accusing Pruitt of using his political office for personal gain and came shortly before a CNN report claimed he has employed cover-up strategies.",
        "Samantha Dravis, the EPA’s former associate administrator for its Office of Policy, spoke recently with a congressional committee about her work for Pruitt, according to accounts of the interview first reported by The Washington Post. Dravis reportedly said that Pruitt asked her to reach out to the Republican Attorneys General Association, a group Pruitt chaired for two terms while he served as Oklahoma Attorney General, to inquire about a fundraising job he hoped would pay his wife $200,000 or more a year.",
        "Dravis said she declined his request, saying she was worried the call would violate the Hatch Act and that she wanted to avoid potential conflicts of interest. The New York Times also reported the contents of Dravis’ congressional interview on Monday, citing people familiar with her account.",
        "Pruitt’s wife did eventually land a job ― with Dravis’ support ― at the conservative Judicial Crisis Network, which told the Post her salary was under six figures and that she worked only as an independent contractor until earlier this year.",
        "Citing internal EPA documents, CNN reported Tuesday that Pruitt has attempted to keep under wraps certain meetings and calls that may “look bad” for him by asking aides to keep “secret” calendars and schedules.",
        "Some of the events scrubbed from Pruitt’s public calendar involved meetings with executives and attorneys employed in industries his agency regulates. Similarly, a dinner with a climate-denying Vatican cardinal did not appear on the EPA chief’s official calendar.",
        "An ongoing saga of related scandals has plagued Pruitt’s tenure. Last month, the Times reported that another former aide, Sydney Hupp, was tasked with finding a “business opportunity” for Pruitt’s wife to open a Chick-fil-A franchise. Hupp was also told to look into purchasing “an old mattress” for Pruitt from the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., a request she said was unrelated to EPA business.",
        "Monday’s reports also include details about Pruitt’s frequent use of first-class travel. Dravis and another Pruitt aide, current chief of staff Ryan Jackson, told investigators that the agency chief often insisted he travel in premium cabins, even as they both expressed concerns about the bookings. Pruitt has repeatedly said his security detail made the determinations to book him in first- and business-class seats.",
        "The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee is currently investigating Pruitt’s management of the EPA and his spending habits, including his use of premium cabins while traveling and the details surrounding a sweetheart condo rental from the wife of an energy lobbyist. The inquiry is one of 13 federal investigations into the administrator.",
        "Kevin Minoli, the chief ethics officer for the EPA, recently wrote to the Office of Government Ethics to ask for a separate series of independent investigations into Pruitt.",
        "This article has been updated to include information about Pruitt contained in a new CNN report."

        "The Trump administration’s decision to join a conservative lawsuit challenging some of the most popular parts of the Affordable Care Act continues to be the gift that keeps on giving, at least politically, for Democrats ― first in the midterms and now in the upcoming Supreme Court fight.",
        "Last month, the Justice Department threw its support behind a lawsuit arguing that Obamacare’s protections for people with pre-existing conditions are unconstitutional.",
        "From a political perspective, the move was confounding. Polls show that the majority of the public approves of the law, in large part because of popular provisions like the pre-existing conditions mandate. And Democrats have the upper hand on the issue.",
        "A recent poll also found that 76 percent of voters, including 58 percent of Republicans, say coverage for pre-existing conditions is “very important” to them.",
        "Democrats immediately went to town on the suit, blasting out ads and fundraising emails warning that the Trump administration wants to take away coverage for people with pre-existing conditions.",
        "And now, Democrats say they plan to use the suit to their advantage when Trump picks his Supreme Court nominee, expected to be announced July 9.",
        "The lawsuit, brought by 20 states led by Republicans, argues that the law’s protections were supposed to work in tandem with the mandate that individuals have health insurance. Because Congress is no longer enforcing the mandate, they say, insurers no longer have to sell policies to everyone regardless of medical status.",
        "Democratic senators are assuredly going to question the nominee as to whether he or she supports Trump’s position on the lawsuit. Normally, nominees punt on these sorts of questions, arguing that the issue could come before them if they are confirmed to the court.",
        "Without a firm answer, Democrats will likely turn to the nominee’s past rulings and writings, and, of course, Trump’s own tweets. In 2015, when the Supreme Court upheld the Affordable Care Act ― thanks to votes from Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Anthony Kennedy, who is retiring ― Trump promised he would choose only people who would strike down the law.",
        "“The president’s made abundantly clear that his plan all along has been to destroy the Affordable Care Act,” said Jesse Ferguson, a Democratic consultant who works with health care groups. “First was by repeal, then it was going to be by lawsuit, and now he’s going to try to pick the judge to rule on the lawsuit.”",
        "The pro-Obamacare group Protect Our Care has already launched a TV ad urging senators to “stop any nominee who will support Trump’s lawsuit that overturns health care protections for people with pre-existing conditions.” It will be running in Washington, D.C., as well as in Bangor, Maine, and Anchorage, Alaska ― where Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski will be sure to see the spot, since they’re considered the two Republicans most likely to potentially vote against a Trump pick.",
        "The anti-Obamacare lawsuit is considered weak, even among some conservatives. A group of liberal, conservative, and libertarian legal scholars filed an amicus brief arguing that it would be “unlawful” for a court to go along with what the conservative states want.",
        "The Supreme Court fight will also force Republicans to start talking about health care more in the months before the midterm elections ― something they don’t seem all that excited to do. GOP spending on TV ads mentioning Obamacare has plummeted compared with previous election cycles, while Democratic spending is up slightly. Democrats also consistently say it’s their top issue for the midterms.",
        "With Kennedy retiring, Roberts ― a conservative justice appointed by George W. Bush ― will likely become the swing vote on Obamacare. In addition to health care, Democrats are going to be emphasizing the threat to abortion access from potential justices, since Kennedy has long been the main obstacle to overturning the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. Trump has promised to nominate justices who will overturn the ruling and ban abortion rights."

        "The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled in favor of the state’s top election official by reversing a 2017 ruling by a lower-court judge who concluded the registration cut-off violates the state’s constitution.",
        "The 7-0 ruling by the court came in a lawsuit filed in 2016 by the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts on behalf of two organizations, Chelsea Collaborative and MassVote, and several individual qualified voters.",
        "The ACLU contended the 20-day restriction disenfranchises thousands of otherwise qualified voters. According to a brief the state filed, 34 states have deadlines requiring voters to register seven to 30 days before elections.",
        "Justice Kimberly Budd wrote that while a registration blackout period could be so far from election day that it would interfere with voters’ rights, the state had a rational basis to say it needed the 20 days to prepare for orderly elections.",
        "“However, we acknowledge that, with the passage of time, voting regulations once considered constitutionally permissible may come to significantly interfere with the fundamental right to vote in light of conditions existing in contemporary society,” she wrote.",
        "Budd said that by imposing a voter registration deadline, the state’s legislature has a continuing duty to ensure that the cut-off period was no further from election day than needed to conduct an election.",
        "The ACLU did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
        "The decision reversed a July 2017 ruling by Suffolk County Superior Court Judge Douglas Wilkins that held that the 20-day cut-off violated the state’s constitution.",
        "Wilkins ruled that while Massachusetts could pass laws to ensure voter qualifications and election security, evidence presented at a trial showed no such necessity for the registration cut-off.",
        "Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin, a Democrat who oversees the state’s elections, appealed that ruling, arguing that the 20-day rule did not impose a severe burden on voting rights.",
        "Galvin has proposed that the legislature pass a new law allowing election day registration. But lawyers for the state argued the issue of how to regulate registration should be left to the legislature to decide.",

        "Though Payne didn’t advance in the show at the time, he later locked eyes with Cole when he reappeared on the show in 2010 and was paired with his future One Direction stars.",
        "“X Factor UK” gave Payne the career of a lifetime, but the 24-year-old told the radio station “The Hits” that his favorite moment on the show involved Cheryl, saying “I think when I winked at my Mrs. on the show, before she was my Mrs. I think it’s just the best thing ever.”",
        "The two began dating in 2015 shortly after Cole split from her second husband, Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini (she was previously married to soccer player Ashley Cole). They made things official — with an Instagram photo, of course — in early 2016.",
        "The two announced that Cole had given birth to their first child, a son named Bear, in March 2017. People first confirmed the pregnancy in November 2016.",
        "“On Wednesday 22nd March Liam and I became parents to an incredibly beautiful, healthy baby boy, weighing 7lb 9 and looking like a dream,” Cole wrote in an Instagram post. “Although he still doesn’t have a name he is already stealing hearts. We are all madly in love and overwhelmingly happy with our little arrival. Happy Mother’s Day to all the mothers around the world. A day that now has a different meaning to me forever.”",
        "Shortly afterward, Payne opened up about dating his “dream girl” in an interview with the U.K. magazine Rollacoaster.",
        "“She is a wonderful, wonderful person and it’s amazing to have someone who can relate to so much of things — someone who’s taken greater steps than me,” Payne said. “She’s been my dream girl since I was younger. She’s so ace.”",
        "In the following months, the couple denied both engagement rumors and split rumors, though the latter apparently turned out to be true."

        "NIIGATA, Japan ― Megumi Yokota was just 13 when she disappeared. On her way home from badminton practice at her junior high school, she vanished somewhere along the eight-minute walk to her house in this seaside town. It was just after sunset on Nov. 15, 1977, and the weather records from that day show a calm sea and clear sky.",
        "Megumi’s mother frantically searched the quiet residential streets with Megumi’s twin nine-year-old brothers. A massive police hunt involving a helicopter and search dogs turned up nothing. The canines lost Megumi’s trail just a few dozen yards from her house.",
        "Snatched by special forces, Megumi was already on a boat to North Korea.",
        "During the 1970s and 80s, North Korea kidnapped at least 17 Japanese citizens. They were taken from all over Japan, and sometimes even while abroad in Europe. Most were in their twenties, and some were couples, but otherwise, they fit no single profile.",
        "Only a little information about their fate has trickled out from the secretive North Korean regime. The full explanation of why they were taken remains a mystery.",
        "The unexplained state-sponsored crime has shaped Japanese politics, with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe using the abductions to capitalize on anti-North Korean sentiment and advance his political career. Today, Megumi’s image is plastered on posters as the face of the issue, and her story has become a potent source of nationalism, frequently told in government-produced anime films and comic books.",
        "Megumi’s mother, Sakie Yokota, now 82, hopes the recent meeting between President Donald Trump and North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un signals an opening that will allow her to see her daughter again before she dies.",
        "“It’s a race against time,” she says.",
        "At her apartment building in northern Tokyo, Yokota has a binder of photographs containing a picture of Megumi at 13, standing in her school uniform, unchanged by the passage of four decades.",
        "“That was the last photo we took of her,” she says. Over the years, she has met with three American presidents to ask for help. In November, she met with Melania and Donald Trump in Tokyo. She showed Trump a photo of Megumi and her family, which she said he looked on frowning.",
        "“This is unacceptable and this must not be forgiven,” Yokota says Trump told her.",
        "Yokota says she spent the years after Megumi’s disappearance near delusional with grief. She scoured newspapers for sightings of Megumi. Sometimes, she ran up to girls she saw on the street, thinking they were her. In the evenings, she and her husband Shigeru took walks along the rocky beach, looking for the remains of their daughter.",
        "“I wanted to die every day,” Yokota says. “In order to forget my sadness.”",
        "It took 20 years before they learned what had happened to Megumi.",
        "In 1997, a North Korean defector revealed to South Korean intelligence officials that, as part of a secret abduction program, North Korean operatives had taken a young girl who matched Megumi’s description from Niigata 20 years earlier. The information leaked to Japan’s media, and South Korean intelligence shared the story with Japanese officials.",
        "North Korea was ultimately pressed to officially admit in 2002 that it had kidnapped people from Japan and several other countries.",
        "When Yokota found out North Korea was behind her daughter’s kidnapping, she felt an instant wave of joy. The absurdity and tragedy were immediately outweighed by the revelation that Megumi was possibly still out there somewhere, even if she was stuck in a totalitarian country.",
        "North Korea has never given a complete account of the abductions or their purpose, which were conducted while Kim Jong Un’s grandfather Kim Il Sung ruled the country and his father Kim Jong Il oversaw its spy agency. Some abductees were used as language tutors for North Korean spies, while experts speculate others were possibly taken as bargaining chips for future negotiations with Japan before North Korea had a nuclear program it could use to barter.",
        "In 2002, Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi visited North Korea to strike a deal on the abductees in exchange for the promise of normalizing relations between the two countries. When Koizumi arrived, however, North Korean officials surprised him with a grim assessment ― eight of the abductees were dead, including Megumi.",
        "But their explanations for how each abductee died were vague or unlikely. One person allegedly died in swimming accident, another in a car crash. Pyongyang denied some people were in North Korea at all. Megumi, officials claimed, killed herself in 1994 while being treated for depression in a hospital ward.",
        "A month after Koizumi and Kim’s summit, North Korea allowed five of the abductees to visit Japan. They never returned to North Korea, and later described years of indoctrination and life under the close watch of government minders in small, closed-off communities known as “invitation-only zones.” Some of them said they had met Megumi, who had married a South Korean abductee and had a daughter.",
        "Yokota and the other families couldn’t accept North Korea’s account that their relatives were dead, and neither did the Japanese government. There was widespread public outrage, and the Japanese media kept the story perpetually in the news cycle. The issue stirred long-repressed feelings of nationalism, militarism and victimhood in Japan.",
        "“For the first time since World War II, Japan was the victim,” said Dr. Shunji Hiraiwa, a professor of Korean studies at Nanzan University.",
        "Before becoming prime minister, Shinzo Abe was the lead negotiator for the abduction issue. His hawkish stance on North Korea and emphasis on the abductions helped him win leadership of the country in 2006, and once in office, he immediately set up a highly visible Cabinet ministry to deal with the issue. The government keeps in close touch with the families, and Abe met with them repeatedly this year.",
        "Abe had found a rare political issue with both enormous popular appeal and bipartisan support that he could claim total ownership over. If any critics felt that Abe was exploiting the issue to boost his own popularity or stir up nationalist support, they could hardly say so without appearing to insult the families and abductees.",
        "The abduction issue was once an easy win for Abe, but now it comes with risks. While North Korea increases diplomatic ties with foreign powers, Japan has been noticeably absent from the negotiating table, as it views resolving the kidnappings as a precondition to lifting sanctions or fully normalizing relations.",
        "Abe now plans to meet with Kim, potentially later this year, but if the prime minister doesn’t produce any meaningful progress on the abductions after years of rhetoric, it could cause a wave of political backlash against his already scandal-stricken administration.",
        "The Japanese government has reason to be wary about trusting North Korea to act in good faith on the issue of abductions. In 2004, North Korea sent over what it said were Megumi’s cremated remains, but Japan’s government says DNA testing revealed that they didn’t match.",
        "Yokota insists she never believed the remains were her daughter’s and remains deeply skeptical of North Korea’s diplomatic efforts. Even when she met her granddaughter and son-in-law during a carefully negotiated trip to Mongolia in 2014, she refused to believe Megumi’s husband when he told her Megumi had died, assuming he had to stick to North Korea’s narrative.",
        "The Japanese government demands a full account of how many abductions took place, the arrest of the perpetrators and the immediate return of the surviving abductees. But even if North Korea offers verification that the abductees have indeed died, it could hurt a Japanese government that has consistently implied that some of the abductees are alive and that there could be hundreds more not officially recognized.",
        "The families would also be devastated or may not accept the proof. This dynamic has created a cycle in which North Korea repeatedly claims the abductees are dead and Japan continually refuses to accept that conclusion.",
        "As the families age, there’s added pressure on the government to break this repetitive back-and-forth. Some relatives have died waiting to know what happened to their abducted kin. Shigeru Yokota is currently hospitalized and in poor health, while the Yokotas’ twin sons, Takuya and Tetsuya, have begun taking on some of the advocacy work from their parents.",
        "The head of the Association of Families of Victims Kidnapped by North Korea, 79-year-old Shigeo Iizuka, worries that this latest round of negotiations is a final opportunity. In 1978, North Korean agents kidnapped his 22-year-old sister, Yaeko Taguchi, and left him to raise her 1-year-old son.",
        "“Time is running out,” Iizuka said, sitting in front of a spread of photos that show him meeting a succession of U.S. presidents and top diplomats.",
        "Iizuka pictures a day when his sister walks down the stairs of a plane, as the five other abductees did in 2002, and hugs her son. It doesn’t matter that Taguchi has spent almost her entire adult life in North Korea ― Iizuka talks about his sister as she was before the abduction, rather than who she might have become.",
        "When Sakie Yokota talks about Megumi, she is also rooted firmly in the past, and she sometimes turns to the blue binder of photos resting in front of her, flipping through them. A baby photo of Megumi reminds her of how happy she and her husband were when their daughter raised her head for the first time. A picture of Megumi in tiny new shoes makes her think of how soft the touch of the leather was when she bought them.",
        "“When I look at these pictures, I can remember even the scent in the atmosphere,” Yokota says.",
        "For years after Megumi disappeared, Yokota would try to envision what her daughter might look like as she got older, watching classmates as they grew up to help her imagine it. But Megumi would be 53 years old now, and Sakie finds it harder to picture.",
        "“She may be thin, but still, she would be healthy, I think. I can’t really picture what she would be like now,” Yokota says. “I don’t really want to picture anything unfortunate, so I always try to be hopeful.”",

        "The U.S. ambassador to Estonia has announced his resignation, saying he is taking the “honorable course” in the wake of President Donald Trump’s “inaccurate” slams against the European Union, Foreign Policy reported Friday.",
        "“For the president to say the EU was ‘set up to take advantage of the United States, to attack our piggy bank,’ or that ‘NATO is as bad as NAFTA’ is not only factually wrong, but proves to me that it’s time to go,” James D. Melville Jr. wrote in a private Facebook post obtained by Foreign Policy.",
        "Melville was quoting Trump’s comments Wednesday at a campaign rally in North Dakota.",
        "Melville has worked as a diplomat for 33 years and been in Estonia since 2015. He has served under six presidents. Melville said he was already planning to retire, but will cut short his service and step down at the end of July over Trump’s comments.",
        "He said in his post that a foreign service officer is “programmed to support policy,” and that if there “comes a point when one can no longer do so ... the honorable course is to resign.”",
        "Melville said he leaves with “deep gratitude for being able to serve my nation with integrity for many years, and with great confidence that America, which is and has always been, great, will someday return to being right.”",
        "A screenshot of Melville’s message was posted on the Estonian news outlet Eesti Ekspress.",
        "“We love the countries of the European Union,” Trump said. “But the European Union, of course, was set up to take advantage of the United States, to attack our piggy bank.”",
        "Melville’s announcement comes less than two weeks before a critical NATO summit in Brussels and Trump’s planned meeting in Helsinki with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Fears are mounting that the president will repeat his performance at the Group of Seven summit and exacerbate tensions with long-time American allies.",
        "The White House has not yet commented on Melville’s resignation or his Facebook message."

        "TAOS, New Mexico (Reuters) - A man was arrested on Saturday on charges of starting a forest fire in Colorado that has destroyed structures and forced hundreds to evacuate their homes in one of dozens of wildfires raging across the drought-hit U.S. southwest.",
        "Jesper Joergensen, 52, was taken into custody for suspected arson that started the Spring Fire, the most active of around 10 blazes in Colorado, the state hardest hit by fires, according to Costilla County Sheriff’s Office Facebook page.",
        "Joergensen is not a U.S. citizen and will be handed over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement once he has faced arson charges, said a Costilla County detention officer. The officer could not immediately say what nationality Joergensen held.",
        "The fire has scorched over 38,000 acres (15,378 hectares) between the towns of Fort Garland and La Veta in southern Colorado, forcing more mandatory evacuations of homes and ranches on Saturday in a mountainous area of public and private land. The fire continued to grow, fueled by temperatures in the mid 80s Fahrenheit (27 Celsius) and had zero percent containment as of Saturday afternoon.",
        "Air tankers and helicopters dropped fire retardant and water on the blaze. Authorities asked evacuated residents not to fly drones to check on their properties as the devices posed a danger to aircraft and would force them to be grounded.",
        "An unknown number of structures were consumed by the fire, said Bethany Urban, a public information officer. No injuries have been reported.\n\nGusty winds, single-digit humidity and hot temperatures have fueled the fires and could ignite new blazes in the U.S. West, the National Weather Service said in several warnings.\n\nThe largest wildfire in Colorado, the 416 Fire, has charred almost 47,000 acres about 13 miles (21 km) north of Durango in the southwest corner of the state, and is 37 percent contained, said public information officer Brandalyn Vonk.",
        "About 10 smaller wildfires were burning in New Mexico and three in Arizona, with much of the two states suffering extreme or exceptional drought conditions.",

    "articleContent": [
        "The likely replacement of Justice Anthony Kennedy by a hard-right conservative, as promised by President Donald Trump, will immediately imperil the rights of women, religious and racial minorities, and the LGBTQ community. His retirement will also change the direction of important issues including climate change, gun control and criminal justice toward the right.",
        "Kennedy, who announced his retirement Wednesday, has often been a swing vote on the Supreme Court since Sandra Day O’Connor retired in 2006. He possessed a clear conservative judicial philosophy, but he occasionally sided with the court’s more liberal justices and took more moderate positions than did hard-right conservatives such as Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch. Notably, in 2015, he penned the landmark decision legalizing gay marriage across the country. On many of the court’s most significant cases, the court split 5-4, with Kennedy more often than not being the fifth vote that decided which side prevailed. It is on those types of cases where his absence will be most felt.",
        "“For some things, there was a 5-4 [vote] for constitutional rights and protections of vulnerable groups, and now they are going to go in the opposite direction,” said Caroline Frederickson, president of the American Constitution Society, a liberal legal organization. “The right will have their people mobilized to bring their cases back to court.”",
        "Although not a true supporter of abortion rights, Kennedy still was the only justice left on the court who had voted in 1992 to affirm Roe v. Wade’s legalization of abortion. Trump pledged during the campaign to choose only justices who would overturn that decision.",
        "While Kennedy was perhaps best known to the public for his ideological deviations, he remained a strong vote to increase corporate power, hinder labor unions, deregulate campaign finance and remake the United States into a more conservative nation.",
        "“I think it’s important we don’t lionize Justice Kennedy too much,” said Janai Nelson, associate deputy counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.",
        "Lawrence Norden, deputy director of the democracy program at the Brennan Center for Justice, said, “He was horrible and did great damage on campaign finance,” noting Kennedy wrote the controversial Citizens United decision that struck down limits on corporations’ campaign spending.",
        "Still, even those who are critical of Kennedy worry about what will happen now that there is no clear moderate on the court.",
        "“Without him there, it’s hard to imagine what limits might be on this court to become a wholly political actor and not impose its ideology and viewpoints on an entire nation without any check or balance,” Nelson said.",
        "Here are just a few of the areas where his departure will be most clearly felt.",
        "Reproductive Rights",
        "Kennedy voted in the 1992 Planned Parenthood v. Casey decision to affirm the landmark 1973 abortion rights ruling in Roe v. Wade. Trump promised to only nominate justices to the Supreme Court who would vote to overturn Roe v. Wade while campaigning for president in 2016. This is the ballgame.",
        "It may not come in one fell swoop from one big decision, but there will soon be a five-vote majority ― entirely men ― to either reverse or dramatically scale back women’s reproductive rights. This could come from a court challenge to restrictive state abortion laws or simply if reproductive rights defenders choose not to file suit with the knowledge that they do not have the votes on the court to overturn a state law.",
        "HuffPost’s Laura Bassett has a more detailed explanation of what types of cases could lead a future court to overturn or cut into Roe.",
        "LGBTQ Rights",
        "During the Obama administration, the White House was lighted with rainbow colors to celebrate the nationwide legalization of gay marriage, not because of any legislation Barack Obama signed but because Kennedy, as the fifth vote, penned the court’s decision making it so. Kennedy had long been a champion of LGBTQ rights since his 1996 Romer v. Evans decision. His support for gay rights will be one of his lasting legacies.",
        "His replacement is not expected to be a proponent of LGBTQ rights or someone who would have voted to legalize gay marriage.",
        "Few observers believe that this means that gay marriage will be overturned any time in the near future, but the right could be chipped away. There are already three votes ― Gorsuch, Alito and Thomas ― to allow states to refuse to list the names of gay parents on their child’s birth certificate.",
        "And there are many other cases that could endanger LGBTQ rights, the obvious one being the ability of individuals and businesses to discriminate against LGBTQ people and gay couples based on religious or other beliefs.",
        "The court basically punted on this in the very narrowly worded 7-2 decision in Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission. Kennedy’s opinion favored the cake shop but only because he found that the state exhibited bias against the bakery owner’s religion. The opinion did not settle whether a person’s religious beliefs allow them to discriminate against gay couples getting married. The court will almost certainly see another case like this in the near future.",
        "Affirmative Action",
        "Kennedy is no staunch supporter of affirmative action. He has sided with the court’s conservatives to limit some state affirmative action laws. But he has also acted as a swing vote to uphold others.",
        "In 2016, Kennedy wrote the majority opinion in Fisher v. University of Texas, affirming the university’s use of race as a factor in admissions. He was the swing vote as the three remaining conservatives ― the late Antonin Scalia’s seat remained empty at this time ― dissented.",
        "Trump’s next nominee should be expected to side with the other conservative justices in opposing affirmative action rules. This will imperil such university rules or state laws around the country.",
        "Voting Rights",
        "The issue with Kennedy retiring for supporters of voting rights is not that he was particularly good on the issue ― he joined a 5-4 majority to gut the Voting Rights Act in the 2013 Shelby County v. Holder case ― but that he may not have been as bad as what will come next. Of course, he did just vote to uphold Texas’ redistricting map against a challenge that it represented racial bias.",
        "There was also hope that Kennedy would eventually side with the liberals to strike down or place more stringent limits on partisan gerrymandering. For years, Kennedy appeared to suggest that he was open to a ruling in this direction, but in his final term he joined six other justices in punting the issue back to the lower courts.",
        "One other area that could be a cause for concern is apportionment. Currently, the states can use their total population and not just their total eligible voting population to apportion legislative and congressional districts. Kennedy and Roberts joined the four liberals in the majority for Evenwel v. Abbott to affirm the 14th Amendment’s dictum of “one person, one vote,” while Alito and Thomas filed separate concurrences. What was not settled was whether states could use the eligible voting population instead of total population.",
        "“That could have huge impacts on political power in the United States,” Norden said.",
        "Gun Control",
        "Kennedy’s replacement could pave the way for the Supreme Court to overturn a number of gun control laws, but the pro-gun crowd will need more than just another ally on the bench to guarantee those victories.",
        "Before the court can rule on an issue, at least four justices must agree to hear a relevant case, known as granting a writ of certiorari. The court has largely avoided weighing in on Second Amendment cases in recent years, declining to hear challenges to a variety of gun laws, including state bans on so-called assault weapons and large-capacity ammunition magazines, as well as measures allowing for discretionary permitting of concealed handguns.",
        "Justices have agreed to hear only two gun rights cases over the past decade. The court’s 2008 decision in District of Columbia v. Heller established a constitutional right to own a gun for self-defense in the home while also determining that the Second Amendment was subject to limitations. Two years later, the court heard McDonald v. City of Chicago, ruling that local governments can’t infringe upon the gun ownership rights laid out under Heller. Kennedy joined the pro-gun majority in both of those decisions.",
        "Kennedy may not have been sympathetic to a narrower view of the Second Amendment, but he also didn’t seem particularly interested in taking up cases that would have put his position to the test.",
        "Assuming the court’s three pro-gun stalwarts ― Thomas, Alito and Scalia (and Scalia’s replacement, Neil Gorsuch) ― would vote to hear Second Amendment challenges to firearms restrictions, they’d need only one more vote for approval. They didn’t seem to be able to get it from either Kennedy or conservative-leaning Chief Justice John Roberts, noted UCLA law professor Adam Winkler in a recent Twitter thread.",
        "If Trump appoints a staunch pro-gun justice to replace Kennedy, as many expect he will, there would presumably be four votes to hear previously stalled challenges to gun control laws. From there, the swing vote on any subsequent decision would likely fall to Roberts. It’s unclear how he’d vote, but, like Kennedy, he sided with the majority in both Heller and McDonald.",
        "Fair Housing",
        "In 2015, Kennedy wrote the majority opinion in Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs v. the Inclusive Communities Project, affirming that the federal government can take into account “disparate impact” when it intervenes to prevent racial bias under the Fair Housing Act of 1968.",
        "Disparate impact in this context means that when racial bias occurs in housing, it does not need to be intentional or explicitly stated for the government to take action to remedy it. This is incredibly important to take into account as so many areas of life in the U.S. see gaps based on race where no explicitly stated animus can be found.",
        "Segregation in housing can occur through zoning, mortgage loan practices and, now, digital discrimination. In many cases, these kinds of exclusionary tactics do not explicitly state a racial bias. Kennedy recognized that policies can discriminate even without an explicit racial bias.",
        "Trump’s pick should be expected to fall in line with the other conservatives on the court who want racial segregation to only be deterred where there is explicit racial animus stated. That would be a huge reversal for the Fair Housing Act, which was passed soon after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.",
        "Climate Change",
        "Kennedy wasn’t a staunch liberal on environmental issues (probably because he isn’t a liberal), but he still joined the majority in the most important ruling the court has issued on climate change. In Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency, 12 states wanted the EPA under President George W. Bush to regulate carbon dioxide emissions (“greenhouse gases”) as a pollutant. Kennedy joined the liberals in a 5-4 decision stating that carbon emissions meet the standard of a pollutant and remanded the decision on how to regulate them back to the EPA.",
        "In 2014, however, Kennedy sided with the conservatives to rule that, although the EPA’s regulation of carbon emissions could apply to large polluters like power plants, it did not have the authority to regulate smaller polluters, such as businesses and schools.",
        "Criminal Justice",
        "Trump’s pick to replace Kennedy will almost certainly favor a more punitive criminal justice system along the lines of the other four conservative justices. Kennedy indicated he supported strictly limiting the use of solitary confinement and had voted to reduce prison overcrowding.",
        "While Kennedy joined with the conservative majority against a defendant who had been held in solitary confinement for most of his 25 years in prison in a 2015 case, he wrote a separate concurring opinion about his opposition to the practice: “Research still confirms what this Court suggested over a century ago: Years on end of near-total isolation exact a terrible price.”",
        "The implication of Kennedy’s 2015 concurrence was that he wanted to see the right case challenging the constitutionality of solitary confinement. It was believed that he would have voted with the liberal justices to limit its practice.",
        "In 2011, Kennedy sided with the four liberal justices to uphold a lower court ruling ordering California to reduce overcrowding in its prisons by releasing tens of thousands of prisoners. It was one of the few prisoners’ rights cases to side with the prisoners in decades.",
        "He was also a consistent vote to limit the death penalty’s use in various circumstances. He sided with the more liberal justices in multiple capital punishment cases, abolishing its use against juveniles and the intellectually disabled, finding it to be cruel and unusual punishment. His retirement will likely be a significant setback for death row prisoners.",
        "Just as in all the areas where Kennedy sided with the four liberals, his replacement by a fifth hard-line conservative justice will change the direction of criminal justice policy and jurisprudence for the foreseeable future.",
        "Habeas Corpus",
        "In the 2008 case Boumediene v. Bush, Kennedy wrote the majority 5-4 opinion granting a right to the writ of habeas corpus to detainees held in detention at camps at the Guantanamo Bay military base. The decision, joined by the court’s four liberals, overturned a piece of the congressional law creating military commissions for War on Terror detainees and cemented the right for those detained off U.S. soil by the government to be able to challenge their detention as unwarranted. This was one of many cases in a series of Supreme Court rulings limiting the Bush administration’s attempt to establish a regime of indefinite detention with no legal recourse.",
        "Most of those held at Guantanamo Bay have been released, but 41 remain. Some of them still attempt to exercise their habeas corpus rights but have been denied multiple times by the D.C. Circuit Court. Brett Kavanaugh, a D.C. Circuit judge and one of Kennedy’s possible replacements, ruled against habeas corpus for these detainees and affirmed his position that no law, domestic or international, prevents the government from holding these detainees indefinitely. Kennedy’s departure could not only affect these ongoing habeas corpus decisions but also potentially implicate future efforts by the Trump administration ― or any future administration ― to deny or limit habeas corpus rights to noncitizens.",
        "CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to clarify Kennedy’s positions in death penalty cases."

        "“These people were husbands, wives, mothers and fathers,” said Democratic Maryland House Speaker Michael Busch at the vigil, according to The Baltimore Sun. “They didn’t come from someplace else. They were dedicated to our community. They did not deserve to die under these circumstances.”",
        "Five workers at the newspaper were killed after a gunman blockaded a rear door, then began firing on his victims as some of the survivors crouched in fear under their desks, police said.",
        "Jarrod Warren Ramos, 38, was charged in the attack. He had a long-running feud with the newspaper and sued it for defamation in 2012.",
        "Four journalists were killed: editor and writer Rob Hiaasen, 59, brother of mystery writer and journalist Carl Hiaasen; editorial page writer and editor Gerald Fischman, 61; editor and sports writer John McNamara, 56; and editor and community writer Wendi Winters, 65. Rebecca Smith, 34, who was hired just last year as a sales assistant at the newspaper, was also killed.",
        "Area residents paid homage to the fallen throughout the day, leaving cards, flowers and gifts outside the newspaper office and gathering in a local park and church. Within hours of the shooting, a Bloomberg journalist set up a GoFundMe account. “Our hearts break for our colleagues in Annapolis and we want to do whatever we possibly can to help them pay for medical bills, funeral costs, and any other unforeseen expenses that might arise as a result of this terrible shooting,” the post noted. By late Friday over $168,000 had already been raised."

        "CHIANG RAI, June 28 (Reuters) - U.S. forces and British divers have arrived in Thailand to help in the search for 12 schoolboys and their soccer coach believed trapped by floodwaters in a cave, as rescuers prepared to drill a shaft into the cave on the fifth day of the search.",
        "Major Buncha Duriyapan, commander of the 37th Military District in Chiang Rai, said workers would drill down from the top of the Tham Luang cave complex in northern Chiang Rai province to create an alternative entrance for rescue workers.",
        "“We will drill down from one of the chimneys,” Buncha told reporters on Thursday.",
        "“The expert divers went straight from the plane into the cave to make an assessment,” he said, referring to the three British divers who landed in Thailand on Wednesday.",
        "Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwan said 30 members of the United States Pacific Command (USPACOM) have joined the search operation.",
        "“The United States Pacific Command (USPACOM) has sent 30 staff with equipment to help penetrate the cave walls,” Prawit told reporters.",
        "Search efforts, which have included Thailand’s elite navy SEAL unit, have been hampered by heavy rain and flooding inside the cave where the boys, aged between 11 and 16, and their 25-year-old assistant coach went missing on Saturday.",
        "Rescue workers on Thursday scoured the top of the mountain looking for alternative entrances to the cave, according to a Reuters reporter at the scene.",
        "Thai National Deputy Police Chief Wirachai Songmetta said police officers would explore a 1-kilometer path to the right of the cave on Thursday.",
        "So far, rescue teams have been focusing on a 4-mile long route to the left of the cave’s entrance which they believe the boys and their coach took.",
        "Authorities say they’re optimistic the boys are still alive, but the toll of five days of no news was visible on the faces of the boys’ relatives.",
        "Family members, red-eyed from crying, said prayers on Thursday near the cave, led by a saffron-robed Buddhist monk.",
        "“Observe your breath in this place of love. Love between mother, father and child,” the monk told anxious relatives.",
        "“Do not worry and wait for good news.”"

        "Stephanie Sebby-Strempel, 38, was arrested and jailed Monday after accosting a group of black teens at a Summerville, S.C.-area pool on Sunday and allegedly hitting a 15-year-old. “Get out! Get out now!” she yells in a video shot by one of the kids. “There are three numbers I can dial: 9-1-1. Get out. Little punks,” she said while swatting the camera.",
        "Upon sight, Sebby-Strempel had ordered the kids to leave the pool. The young victim said the teens were “respectful and said, ‘Yes, ma’am.’” The woman then hit one of the boys at least three times as he left, according to various reports.",
        "The video of the incident has been viewed more than 655K times on Facebook.",
        "Dorchester County Police say that when deputies visited the woman’s home on Monday, she pushed one against a wall, hurting his knee, and bit a second officer on the arm, breaking the skin. Sebby-Strempel was charged with third-degree assault, the New York Post reported, and two counts of assaulting an officer while resisting arrest.",
        "When internet sleuths discovered that Sebby-Strempel works for the popular direct-sales company Rodan + Fields, many called for her dismissal.",
        "On Tuesday, Rodan + Fields responded to one critical tweet by writing, “We do not condone violence of any kind and pride ourselves on embracing inclusion and acceptance of all. Please note, this person is not a Rodan + Fields employee, but an Independent Contractor. We are reaching out to this individual to reiterate our corporate values.”",
        "The message didn’t go over well, and many felt the statement was too lenient.",

This week, Alison Ettel, CEO of cannabis startup TreatWell Health in San Francisco, stepped down from her role after video surfaced of her threatening to call the police on 8-year-old Jordan Rodgers, who was selling water on the sidewalk near AT&T Park.",
        "Dubbed #PermitPatty, Ettel was scorned online and later told HuffPost there was “no racial component” to her threat and that she was only “pretending” to call the police.",
        "And in May, an Oakland, Calif., woman named Jennifer Schulte who encountered a group of black people barbecuing in Lake Merritt Park and called the police to report them for allegedly ignoring a “No charcoal grills” sign was also outed online. The police did not make any arrests, and later, hundreds of people threw a barbecue party in the park in protest.",

        "WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump on Wednesday morning called on House Republicans to pass an immigration bill to get a “win” that would show that the GOP wants strong borders and security.",
        "Instead of a win, Republicans ended up with an embarrassing loss.",
        "For the second time in a week, a fractured House Republican conference failed to pass immigration legislation ― this time a so-called “compromise” bill addressing border security, legal immigration changes and protections for undocumented young people who came to the United States as children.",
        "The bill went down 121-301, with no Democrats supporting the bill and 112 Republicans voting against the proposal as well.",
        "The bill that failed Wednesday was the result of months of negotiations between GOP moderates and conservatives in the House ― with Democrats left out of the process entirely. Republicans also failed to pass a more conservative immigration bill last week, but that bill ― which was simply a hardline immigration measure introduced by Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) back in January ― actually garnered 193 Republican votes.",
        "Even before the “compromise” bill fell Wednesday, conservatives were touting the stronger than expected showing for the Goodlatte bill. But with the far weaker showing for the more moderate legislation, it’s an indication for many conservatives that the path forward on a Republican immigration bill is to tack even further to the right.",
        "Either bill would have gone down in the Senate, where Republicans hold a majority but 60 votes are needed to advance legislation. The GOP “compromise” bill wasn’t particularly moderate, even if Republicans framed it that way. It included $25 billion in funding for Trump’s border wall and restrictions on types of legal immigration and asylum.",
        "It did not, however, include mandatory E-Verify, which would require companies to check the migration status of potential hires. Leaders considered adding an amendment with E-Verify provisions in a gambit to win conservative votes, but they ultimately weren’t sure how many votes E-Verify would win over and some moderates felt uncomfortable with the far-right policy.",
        "The “compromise” bill also included a path to citizenship for some undocumented young people who came to the U.S. as children, including many recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which was a key sticking point for some Republicans. The more conservative bill would have only granted temporary status to a smaller pool of DACA recipients.",
        "After last week’s failed vote, Trump tweeted that House Republicans should give up on immigration entirely until after the midterm elections.",
        "But he took a different tack Wednesday, tweeting that the House should pass a bill seemingly just to send a message.",
        "“House Republicans should pass the strong but fair immigration bill, known as Goodlatte II, in their afternoon vote today, even though the Dems won’t let it pass in the Senate,” he wrote in all-caps. “Passage will show that we want strong borders & security while the Dems want open borders = crime. Win!”",
        "After the vote, Trump downplayed the importance of the bill failing so dramatically after he had urged Republicans to vote for it. He said that since the Senate wouldn’t pass the bill anyway, he didn’t get “overly excited” about it. He also brought it back to politics, saying “strong borders” would be “a great election point” for Republicans.",
        "“I told them a few hours ago, I said, ‘Look: pass something, or come back to something that would be a variation, but get something you want,’” he told reporters, according to a pool report. “The problem with that is that we need Democratic votes in the Senate and that’s why I don’t get overly excited with the House bill right now because it’s not going to pass in the Senate, you’re not going to get the Democrats to vote for anything. We can give them 100 percent of what they wanted, and double it, they still wouldn’t pass it.”",
        "Trump, joined by House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and other Republicans, has repeatedly accused Democrats of supporting open borders, claiming ― falsely, in most cases ― that they favor total non-enforcement of the law rather than the more commonly-held position that migrant families should be put in immigration proceedings so they can remain together rather than be split up.",
        "The president and many Republicans have argued that Congress or the courts should grant the government the ability to lock up immigrant families indefinitely ― which could result in kids being detained for months or years ― as a way to address the administration’s self-made crisis of family separations at the border. Long-term detention of immigrant families, as well as removing certain protections for unaccompanied kids and making asylum more difficult to obtain, was part of both failed House bills.",
        "Trump signed an executive order last week that he said would halt his recent family separations, but thus far his administration is reuniting kids only if the parent agrees to be deported and drop their claim for asylum or other relief.",
        "Late on Tuesday, a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to reunite families it separated within 30 days, and put children under the age of 5 back into the care of their parents within 14 days. The order would likely prevent the Trump administration from restarting family separations in the near future.",
        "Some lawmakers have discussed a standalone measure to address family separations, but it’s unclear whether it has the votes to pass or support from Trump, who has also demanded wall funding and a host of other legal changes.",
        "The extent to which the “compromise” bill failed Wednesday indicates just how far Republicans are to finding agreement within their own party. Even with Trump’s all-CAPS urging, only 121 Republicans supported Wednesday’s immigration proposal. And even if 193 Republicans voted for the more conservative Goodlatte bill last week, it’s still difficult to see how Republicans could coalesce behind one plan.",
        "And, as Trump pointed out, Republicans would still need to get that bill through the Senate, where Democratic votes would be needed.",
        "If there’s one silver lining for Republicans, it’s that 224 House Republicans voted for one of the two immigration proposals ― and truthfully, both bills aren’t that far apart. Much of the disagreement with the “compromise” legislation seemed to be over its branding as such, and with a conservative desire to message on this vote.",
        "If Republicans continued pushing ahead with an immigration plan, it’s possible they could still reach a slim majority in the House.",
        "A senior GOP aide pointed out Wednesday after the vote that part of the reason this vote failed so spectacularly was that a number of members had concerns that Trump would say he supported the bill today, “watch Fox News tonight, and blast it tomorrow,” just like he did with the omnibus earlier this year. “And they didn’t want to be on the receiving end of that kind of incoming again,” the aide said.",
        "But if one of the silver linings for Republicans in these votes is that GOP leaders see a pathway to keep pushing on a GOP-only immigration bill, that’s also one of the failings. Again, even if Republicans miraculously passed a bill, it still couldn’t pass the Senate. And if conservatives really are emboldened by these two votes ― one in which their ideas seemed to have more traction with the conference than previously expected, and this vote where more moderate ideas had less ― then Republicans could be learning all the wrong lessons."

        "Dana Balter, a progressive activist and Syracuse University professor, won the Democratic nomination in New York’s 24th Congressional District on Tuesday, delivering a setback to the national Democratic Party, which had backed her opponent.",
        "Balter’s win reflects the importance of grassroots support and a strong field operation in low-turnout primary races. She benefited both from the backing of the local Democratic parties and from deep ties to central New York’s anti-Donald Trump resistance movement, of which she has been an active member since the aftermath of the 2016 presidential election.",
        "The outcome is a disappointment for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which avidly recruited and then staunchly backed Juanita Perez Williams, a former state prosecutor and Navy veteran. The party body, which helps elect Democrats to the House, along with several national groups, funneled hundreds of thousands of dollars into the district in a last-minute bid to boost Perez Williams.",
        "“This is another win for progressives, without a doubt, and among the biggest blows to the DCCC this cycle,” said Sean McElwee, a left-wing activist and co-founder of the think tank Data Progress. “It’s a sign that Democratic primary voters want the DCCC to stop picking favorites.”",
        "In fact, Perez Williams is only the second candidate on the DCCC’s “Red to Blue” list of candidates in high-priority races to lose in a primary. The first was former Rep. Brad Ashford, a moderate who lost to the progressive Kara Eastman in the May primary for Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District.",
        "However, Perez Williams, 54, who lost a November bid for mayor of Syracuse, was hobbled from the beginning by her late entry. While the DCCC had recruited her early on, she agreed to run in April, just days before the candidate filing deadline ― a time when the local Democratic Party committees had already coalesced behind Balter, 41.",
        "The resentment of local party officials backing Balter contributed to a sense among some primary voters that the national party had meddled unnecessarily in the race.",
        "“I just feel so ticked off about the fact that the local people chose Dana Balter, and then a couple weeks after, the DCCC came in,” said Leslie Shaw, a homemaker from Lyons who was initially open to backing Perez Williams but could not shake her irritation with the DCCC.",
        "Perez Williams also elicited suspicion among some voters for social media posts from 2016 in which she touted her participation in the anti-abortion rights March for Life and applauded an Irish court decision upholding that country’s abortion ban (which has since been overturned in a referendum). As a candidate, Perez Williams insisted that she was completely supportive of women’s abortion rights and merely participated in the March for Life to support her son, but some voters were not convinced.",
        "Jesse Ferguson, a former DCCC strategist and press aide for Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign, downplayed the significance for the DCCC.",
        "“People overestimate the impact that the DCCC or any national endorsement in a congressional primary really has,” Ferguson said.",
        "“In a year when there is such a deep rejection of Trump and the Republican Congress,” he said, “the seat’s competitive with” Balter as the nominee as well.",
        "Residents of New York’s 24th, which includes metropolitan Syracuse and parts of the Finger Lakes region, voted for Clinton over Trump by almost 4 percentage points in 2016. And the two parties have traded control of the district’s House seat multiple times since 2006.",
        "What’s more, two-term incumbent Rep. John Katko (R) has at least some potential vulnerabilities in a district affected by the national wave of liberal enthusiasm. Although he was one of a handful of Republicans to vote against repealing the Affordable Care Act, he voted for the GOP tax cut legislation, which all but eliminated a state and local tax deduction on which New Yorkers disproportionately relied.",
        "Even if Perez Williams had won, Democratic leaders in Washington viewed the district as a reach. Katko has largely steered clear of controversy, and there is likely to be low voter turnout in November due to what some Empire State analysts anticipate will be a non-competitive gubernatorial election.",
        "“Katko is in an extremely strong position,” said a prominent central New York Democrat who requested anonymity for professional reasons.",
        "Aside from New York’s 24th, primaries in GOP-held seats that Democrats hope to flip were mostly uncontentious.",
        "In New York’s 22nd, where Democrats are optimistic about unseating the controversial and bombastic Rep. Claudia Tenney (R), New York Assemblyman Anthony Brindisi cruised to the Democratic nomination uncontested. He has matched Tenney in fundraising, having brought in over $1.6 million.",
        "And in New York’s 19th, a Hudson Valley district Democrats are also keen to flip, a crowded primary had at least three candidates who raised more than $1 million. The strength of the field eased Democratic operatives’ fears about who would emerge to challenge Rep. John Faso (R), a freshman who voted for the unpopular GOP effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act.",
        "Antonio Delgado, a corporate attorney and former Rhodes scholar, defeated six competitors to win the nomination in New York’s 19th. Delgado, who was endorsed by Citizen Action of New York and the family of former Rep. Maurice Hinchey, raised the most money in the field ― over $2.2 million. If elected, Delgado, who is black and has Puerto Rican ancestry, would be one of upstate New York’s first black and Latino members of Congress.",
        "In addition, New York state’s Democratic establishment suffered a low-profile defeat in the primary for the 2nd District, a Long Island seat held by Rep. Peter King (R). First-time candidate Liuba Grechen Shirley defeated DuWayne Gregory, a Suffolk County lawmaker who had the endorsement of the Women’s Equality Party, a group aligned with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D).",
        "Although New York is, on the whole, a solidly Democratic state, the more moderate and conservative parts of the state ― in Long Island, Staten Island and the vast regions beyond metropolitan New York City ― are often major battlegrounds in elections for the House of Representatives.",
        "Victories in upstate New York were an important part of Democrats’ last takeover of the House in 2006, and if Democrats hope to do it again, they will need at least some pickups there again, according to Ferguson.",
        "“Democrats can have a good night nationwide without New York, but it is hard to see Democrats getting a majority without flipping a few New York seats,” he said.",
        "The story has been updated with primary results for the 2nd and 19th congressional districts."

        "Jealous’ main competition in the primary was Prince George’s County Executive Rushern Baker. While Jealous campaigned with a slew of possible 2020 Democratic presidential contenders ― Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) all did events for him in the final weeks of the race ― Baker was earning endorsements from a who’s who of powerful local Democrats, including former Gov. Martin O’Malley and House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer.",
        "State Sen. Rich Madaleno, Obama administration officials Alec Ross and Krish Vignarajah, and lawyer Jim Shea also competed in the Democratic primary.",
        "Maryland is considered a top Democratic pickup opportunity in 2018, when more than two dozen governor’s mansions are up for grabs. Defeating Hogan will not be easy, even in Maryland, where Democrats have a 2-to-1 voter registration advantage on the GOP. Polls have shown him beginning the race with a double-digit advantage over Jealous. While national Democrats are hopeful Hogan’s support will prove to be a mile wide and an inch deep, there are reasons to believe he’ll be resilient.",
        "Jealous ran on an ambitious platform of single-payer health care, legalizing marijuana and using the proceeds to pay for free community college and raising the minimum wage to $15. Strategists will now have to hope his ambitious agenda is enough to motivate Democratic voters to turn out to defeat Hogan.",
        "The model for a Democratic win in Maryland over a popular Republican incumbent is O’Malley’s 2006 victory over GOP Gov. Bob Ehrlich, who had an approval rating above 50 percent in the weeks leading up to Election Day. But Hogan’s approval numbers are stronger than Ehrlich’s ever were.",

        "As a growing number of European countries tip toward the far right politically, attempts to curb climate change are coming under pressure. The region’s race to cut planet-warming greenhouse gases is generating friction, and some Members of European Parliament and experts point the finger of blame at Russian big energy interests and populist governments in thrall to them.",
        "This month, a bid to raise the European Union’s supply of renewable energy to 35 percent of the electricity mix by 2030 was stymied by a bloc of EU states led by populist governments in the Visegrad countries ― Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia ― even though it had the support of the European Parliament and European Commission.",
        "The same bloc of countries helped whittle down proposals for a binding 40 percent energy conservation target, despite signs of accelerating climate change from the Antarctic to the African savannah.",
        "“We see a pattern of populist governments clearly opposing ambitious climate and energy regulations, which is in line with the primary Russian economic interest: exporting fossil fuels and nuclear technology,” Benedek Jávor, the vice-chair of the European parliament’s environment committee and a Hungarian Green MEP, told HuffPost.",
        "Russia supplies more than a third of Europe’s gas but this could be reduced to nothing by an ambitious energy saving target, according to analyses by several think tanks and consultancies.",
        "The European Commission itself calculates that every 1 percent of energy savings is accompanied by a 2.6 percent reduction in the gas imports.",
        "While Russia is a signatory to the Paris climate agreement and has not spoken against climate targets, the eastern European populist governments it supports have taken a hard line in EU negotiations.",
        "Hungary, for example, which is becoming an increasingly authoritarian government under far-right leader Viktor Orbán, is a valued advocate for Russian gas infrastructure and is also building a Russian-financed €10 billion ($11.5 billion) nuclear reactor outside Budapest.",
        "“Hungary has shifted to closer cooperation with Russia than the EU,” Jávor said. There was no evidence that Hungary’s stance was directly aimed at helping Russia export gas to Europe, Javor conceded, but “we can see that they go hand in hand,” he added.",
        "“Any energy efficiency program on an EU scale would decrease gas consumption and have dramatic costs for Russian imports,” the MEP added.",
        "Earlier this month, the Bulgarian parliament voted to resurrect the Soviet-era Belene nuclear plant, mothballed in 2012 because of concerns about its cost, necessity and safety, and under pressure from the United States and Europe to reduce its energy dependence on Russia (which had been slated to build the plant). Rosatom, Russia’s state-owned nuclear company, has expressed interest in the revived plant.",
        "“That nuclear power plant does not have any energy or economic justification whatsoever,” said Julian Popov, a former Bulgarian environment minister. “Not one single energy expert will say it is a good idea. I am not against nuclear power as a technology, but Belene is a disaster case.”",
        "Like Hungary, Bulgaria has resisted ambitious climate targets in Brussels (Neno Dimov, the country’s environment minister, also has alleged neo-Nazi connections and has described global warming as “a hoax”.) The country has used its EU presidency this year to try to replace the EU’s “energy efficiency first” principle with a rule that member states cannot promote energy efficiency projects over gas infrastructure projects.",
        "Far more important than climate concerns in Bulgaria, experts say, is the country’s dream of becoming an entry point for Russian gas supplies piped through Turkey, which is headed by another authoritarian leader.",
        "Speaking on condition of anonymity, a Bulgarian cabinet minister said that the country’s energy ministry was simply not engaged with environmental concerns.",
        "“Gas infrastructure is very important for us right now,” the official told HuffPost. “We want to become a Balkan gas hub. It is a priority for us. To be frank, the benefits of energy efficiency are not universally understood in the Bulgarian government. It is very difficult to convince the finance ministry.”",
        "Russia’s energy agenda plays to a wider audience than extreme nationalists. Gas and nuclear are both seen as relatively lower carbon options than coal, which could “bridge” the path to a mid-century world powered solely by renewables. However, some climate studies suggest that, where gas is concerned, the bridge could also burn the chances of limiting global warming to no more than a 2 C temperature rise above pre-Industrial levels ― the target the majority of scientists say cannot be exceeded if we are to avoid the worst effects of climate change.",
        "Several academic papers have found that investment in gas could crowd out desperately needed funds for renewable energy while providing few emissions-cutting benefits.",
        "Denmark, Portugal and Germany are already achieving 100 percent renewable electricity cover for short periods. And a push by the European Parliament earlier this month for a net zero emissions target by 2050 gained surprising traction, even if the same blocking countries prevented its uptake.",
        "But environmentalists’ hopes that Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel would stand up for clean energy ambition were dashed when her energy minister, Peter Altmaier, ruled out “unachievable” higher targets for 2030. The German government is struggling to meet its own climate targets for 2020 – and to pacify rising anti-migrant sentiment within its borders, and beyond.",
        "Germany also expects to begin importing Russian gas through a giant pipeline – Nord Stream 2 – in 2019, and this is sparking accusations that EU legislation has been spiked to please Moscow.",
        "Claude Turmes, Luxembourg’s new energy minister, told HuffPost he believes that Putin is using his contacts with Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov and Merkel in Germany to derail a proposed revision to an EU gas directive, which aims to increase transparency, competition and energy security.",
        "“We have to take that [Russian threat] extremely seriously,” he added. “We are in a really dangerous moment.”",
        "One European government, though, has apparently bucked the trend of populist indifference to global warming. Italy’s Five Star Movement (M5S) emerged as the largest party in recent elections and bagged the environmental portfolio in a new coalition government.",
        "As well as arguing for ambitious clean energy targets in the recent Brussels haggle, M5S has launched a review into the vast southern gas pipeline that would take gas from Azerbaijan to Western Europe and so reduce Europe’s reliance on Russian gas. Italy’s new environment minister has described the 1,850-kilometer project as “pointless.”",
        "But much as the review will be welcomed by environmental campaigners, it is also music to the ears of those in the Kremlin, which fears its stranglehold on Europe’s gas market being undermined.",
        "Both M5S and its coalition partner, the far-right League, are close to Russia – with whom the League has signed a cooperation pact – and the new administration is pushing for an end to EU sanctions against Russia.",
        "Russian nuclear interests may also be seeing a revival of fortune in the Czech Republic. The billionaire populist Andrej Babiš, who won recent elections on an anti-migrant platform, is in the process of forming a government with the country’s pro-Moscow Communist Party.",
        "The country already has two Soviet-era nuclear reactors and “there is a vision that we might build another block of reactors – or new reactors that will be added to Temelín [nuclear power station],” a Czech government minister told HuffPost, adding: “There are rumors that they may be Russian.”",
        "The minister said that energy efficiency was currently low on the priority list for Babiš. “It is not on the agenda but it can come,” the government minister said. “Somebody must find the bravery to try to explain [the benefits] to him because he is not easy to speak to.”",
        "Depleted gas fields may soon speak louder than words. Europe is already the world’s largest importer of fossil fuels, and likely to become ever more so without structural changes.",
        "North Sea gas production is in long-term decline, and gas production in the Netherlands – the EU’s largest domestic supplier – is to be capped and phased out by 2030.",
        "With Norwegian gas production also expected to fall and Algeria facing similar problems, Europe could be dependent on imports for more than 80 percent of its supply by 2025.",
        "In this context, Russia’s defense of its gas export market, which reached record levels in Europe last year, could have “a huge impact” on EU plans for decarbonization, according to Antoine Simon, a policy campaigner at Friends of the Earth Europe.",
        "“There is no room left in our carbon budget for building new gas pipelines,” he told HuffPost. “They will last for 40 or 50 years ― way past 2050 by when we are supposed to have decarbonized. That is why gas cannot be a bridging fuel. In 1970, we could maybe have talked about that kind of role for it but gas is way too carbon intensive, the fossil fuel era is over, and time is running out.”",

The bikers started at Berlin’s imposing Holocaust memorial and wove their way through the city to Bebelplatz, a city square with a dark history. In 1933, Nazis ordered the burning of around 20,000 books in an effort to purge universities of “the un-German spirit” and “Jewish intellectualism.”",
        "About 50 people attended, according to Deutsche Welle (DW), including rabbis, imams and lay members of each religious group. Christians, non-religious Germans, and Berlin politicians also took part in the event. Some participants wore white vests with the words “Jews and Muslims for respect and tolerance.”",
        "“I think it’s important that Muslims and Jews, as members of two minorities in Germany, do not allow themselves to be played off one against the other, but instead, together, oppose anti-Semitism and Islamophobia,” Sejfuddin Dizdarevic, a Muslim participant, told Agence-France Presse in a video.",
        "Rabbi Elias Dray, one of the organizers of the event, told The Associated Press that he hopes the joint bike ride helps Muslims and Jews in Berlin get to know one another better.",

Germany took in more than 1 million immigrants in 2015 and 2016, according to Reuters, including many who were fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and Africa.",

AfD leaders are known for openly anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant stances, the AP reports, and have less frequently expressed anti-Semitic views, as well.",

        "Adding to the tensions, some of the newer Muslim migrants have expressed anti-Semitic sentiment. In April, a 19-year-old Syrian refugee was caught on tape in broad daylight attacking a man wearing a Jewish skullcap in Berlin. The attack elicited condemnation from both Jewish and Muslim groups and sparked public marches in support of German Jews.",

        "ANKARA, June 25 (Reuters) - Tayyip Erdogan won Turkey’s presidential election on Sunday, the head of the country’s electoral body said, overcoming the biggest electoral challenge to his rule in a decade and a half.\n\nElectoral board Chairman Sadi Guven said that with more than 97 percent of votes counted, Erdogan had an absolute majority. Unofficial results broadcast on Turkish television also gave his ruling party and its alliance partner a majority in parliament.\n\nThe main opposition party did not immediately concede defeat. But after initially saying Erdogan would fall well short of a first-round victory, it said simply it would continue its democratic struggle “whatever the result.”\n\n“Starting tomorrow, we will start working to realize the promises we made our people,” Erdogan told flag-waving supporters in a victory speech delivered from the balcony of his ruling AK Party’s headquarters in Ankara shortly after 3 a.m.\n\nHe also pledged that authorities, who have waged a nationwide crackdown since a failed military coup two years ago, would act more decisively against terrorist organizations.\n\nErdogan, 64, the most popular but also the most divisive politician in modern Turkey, added that Turkish forces would continue to “liberate Syrian lands” so that the 3.5 million Syrian refugees in Turkey could return home safely.\n\nSunday’s vote ushered in a powerful new executive presidency long sought by Erdogan and backed by a small majority of Turks in a 2017 referendum. Critics say it will further erode democracy in the NATO member state and entrench one-man rule.\n\nErdogan’s victory paves the way for another five-year term. Under the new constitution, he could serve a further term from 2023, taking him to 2028.\n\nAn unexpectedly strong showing by the AK Party’s alliance partner, the nationalist MHP, could translate into the stable parliamentary majority that Erdogan seeks in order to govern freely.\n\n“This sets the stage for speeding up reforms,” Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek tweeted of the results.\n\nThe lira, which has lost about a fifth of its value against the dollar this year, firmed more than 1 percent in early trading in Asia on hopes of a stable working relationship between the president and parliament. It reached 4.587 lira to the dollar at 12:17 a.m. (2117 GMT) before easing slightly.",
        "OPPOSITION DOUBTS\n\nErdogan’s main presidential rival, Muharrem Ince of the main opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP), had urged election monitors to remain at polling stations to help ensure against possible election fraud, as final results came in from large cities where his party typically performs strongly.\n\nWith 99 percent of votes counted in the presidential race, Erdogan had 52.5 percent, well ahead of Ince’s 31 percent, broadcasters said.\n\nThe opposition raised doubts about the accuracy and reliability of the figures released by state-run Anadolu news agency, the sole distributor of the official vote tally.\n\nBut an opposition platform collating its own vote tally from monitors based at polling stations around the country broadly confirmed the Anadolu figures.\n\nOpposition parties and NGOs had deployed up to half a million monitors at ballot boxes to try to prevent possible electoral fraud. They said election law changes and fraud allegations in the 2017 referendum raised fears about the fairness of Sunday’s elections.\n\nErdogan said there had been no serious voting violations.\n\nIn Sunday’s parliamentary contest, the Islamist-rooted AK Party won 42 percent and its MHP ally 11 percent, based on 99 percent of votes counted, broadcasters said.\n\nIn the opposition camp, the CHP had 23 percent and the pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP) 11 percent - above the threshold it needs to reach to enter parliament. The opposition nationalist Iyi (Good) party received 10 percent.",
        "Election turnout nationwide was very high at around 87 percent for both contests, the state broadcaster said.\n\nErdogan argues that his new powers will better enable him to tackle the nation’s economic problems and crush Kurdish rebels in southeast Turkey and in neighboring Iraq and Syria.\n\nInvestors would welcome the prospect of a stable working relationship between the president and the new parliament, although they also have concerns about Erdogan’s recent comments suggesting he wants to take greater control of monetary policy.\n\nErdogan has declared himself an “enemy of interest rates,” raising fears he will pressure the central bank to cut borrowing costs after the election despite double-digit inflation.\n\nHe brought forward the elections from November 2019, but he faced an unexpectedly feisty challenge from Ince, a former physics teacher and veteran CHP lawmaker, who galvanized Turkey’s long-demoralized and divided opposition.\n\nTurkey held Sunday’s elections under a state of emergency declared after the failed military coup in July 2016 that Erdogan blamed on his former ally, U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen.\n\nIt limits some freedoms and allows the government to bypass parliament with decrees, although Erdogan says he will soon lift the measure.\n\nSince the coup attempt, Erdogan has waged a sweeping crackdown on Gulen’s followers in Turkey, detaining some 160,000 people, according to the United Nations.\n\nCritics, including the European Union, which Turkey still nominally aspires to join, say Erdogan has used the crackdown to stifle dissent. He says his tough measures are needed to safeguard national security.\n\n(Reporting by Ece Toksabay and Tuvan Gumrukcu; Additional reporting by Humeyra Pamuk, Orhan Coskun, Gulsen Solaker, Ali Kucukgocmen, Nevzat Devranoglu, Ezgi Erkoyun, Can Sezer, David Dolan, Daren Butler and Dominic Evans; Writing by Gareth Jones; Editing by Jon Boyle and Peter Cooney)"

        "President Donald Trump and Nevada GOP Sen. Dean Heller’s down-and-up relationship culminated Saturday with the president spending a full day boosting the re-election bid of the nation’s most vulnerable senator, the latest display of how Republican Senate candidates are relying on an unpopular president to boost their political fortunes.",
        "Trump hosted a $50,000-per-couple fundraiser for Heller’s re-election bid, then spoke at the Nevada GOP convention, before the pair jumped off to a roundtable to discuss the Republican tax overhaul.",
        "“Come on up here, Dean,” Trump said at the convention, before embracing Heller, whom he later praised as a “great senator.”",
        "“He’s been with me all the way ― once we got elected,” Trump said. “I must tell you. A little bit shaky at the beginning, but that was a lot of people running. But once we got in there, he’s been rock-solid.”",
        "Heller and Trump have been through a lot together.",
        "In 2015, offended by Trump’s comments calling Mexican immigrants “rapists,” Heller gave donations he had received from the billionaire businessman away to charity. Heller refused to say if he would vote for his party’s presidential nominee. Trump joked about defeating Heller in a primary after the senator helped sink an early version of his party’s plans to repeal Obamacare. Heller warmed up to Trump, admitted he voted for him, and then Trump convinced Heller’s primary challenger to run for the House instead.",
        "Saturday’s bonhomie represents not just a reversal in Heller’s treatment of Trump, but also in the traditional approach vulnerable senators take to presidents of their own party during a midterm election year.",
        "It’s reflective of a larger strategy by Senate Republicans to keep the president close to their candidates, despite his low approval ratings. They’re betting Trump’s ability to motivate Republican base voters, combined with the heavy red tint of the Senate map — Democrats are defending seats in 10 states Trump won, while Heller is the only Republican up for re-election in a state won by Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton — can help them keep control of the upper chamber in November.",
        "“We know that Democrats in every state are going to turn out at a very high level,” said Josh Holmes, a partner at Cavalry LLC and a top political lieutenant to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. “That’s not a mystery. What is a mystery is whether Republicans are going to show up. And no one fires up the Republican base like President Trump.”",
        "The Democratic Party’s chances of winning the Senate are low, but a Heller victory in Nevada would essentially reduce them to nil. Democrats have chosen Rep. Jacky Rosen, a freshman congresswoman with a background as a computer programmer and a synagogue president, to challenge him. Political forecasters typically list Heller as the most vulnerable senator up for re-election in 2018, and limited public polling indicates the race will be tight.",
        "“Dean’s looking out for his own political self-interest. It’s why he can’t be trusted,” she told HuffPost in a phone interview. “On every single issue that’s important for Nevada, he’s caved and flipped to the president and Mitch McConnell for money, for ads, for donations.”",
        "In the case of Heller, who declined an interview request, the strategy of embracing Trump is striking, not only because of his rocky relationship with the president, but because of the president’s consistent unpopularity in the state. But, Republican strategists say, the approach is informed by the experience of Democrats in 2014 and what happened to GOP Rep. Joe Heck in his Senate bid in Nevada in 2016.",
        "In 2014, Democratic Senators running for re-election in swing states — even those won by President Barack Obama — kept their distance from the president and avoided campaigning with him. While Heller is trying to capitalize on a Trump visit to fire up the Republican base, in the last midterm, then-North Carolina Sen. Kay Hagan (D) used a visit from Obama to confront him on his handling of veterans’ issues. For the most part, it didn’t save the Democrats — they lost nine Senate seats that election cycle.",
        "Holmes and other GOP strategists view that as a fatal mistake, arguing it did little to win over swing voters and depressed the Democratic base in key states.",
        "“Trying to distance yourself from your party’s leader in a midterm year is ultimately going to be unsuccessful,” he said. “If you spent all your time trying to pretend you’re not a member of the party that you’re a member of, what does that tell people?”",
        "The most immediate example of the dangers of distancing oneself from Trump comes in the form of former Rep. Joe Heck, an Army veteran and doctor who Republicans hoped could claim the seat belonging to retiring Democratic Sen. Harry Reid in 2016.",
        "After the release of the Access Hollywood tape in October 2016, which showed Trump bragging about sexual assault, Heck declared he couldn’t vote for Trump, saying he could “no longer look past the behavior and comments of Donald Trump.” Heck made the decision against the advice of his advisers, according to a Republican with knowledge of the discussion, and the results were immediate.",
        "Heck, who had been leading by a small margin in his internal polling up until that point, was suddenly trailing Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto. Voters began returning their Heck yard signs to GOP headquarters around the state, and one of the state’s Republican National Committee members withdrew her endorsement of Heck.",
        "He eventually lost to Cortez Masto by a little more than 2 percentage points, with many Republicans blaming the outcome on Heck’s decision to ditch the president.",
        "There are limits to how closely Heller will tie himself to Trump. His brief remarks at the convention focused almost exclusively on the GOP tax law, which he and other Republicans hope to credit for a booming economy. (Public polling indicates voters are divided on whether the tax bill is helping them.)",
        "“I wrote it, I fought for it, and the president signed it,” Heller said.",
        "Rosen, who spent Saturday at the state Democratic convention campaigning with Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts — Trump said “Wacky Jacky” was campaigning with “Pocahontas” — hopes to keep the campaign conversation focused on health care and immigration. She said Heller’s flip on health care, where he went from standing with Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval against an Obamacare repeal to co-sponsoring a version of the repeal legislation, was “the biggest cave of all.”",
        "“I think Dean can’t stand on his policies,” she said. “This is a tale of two Dean Hellers.”",
        "Heller has also been pressuring Rosen to take a stance on impeaching Trump, especially since Democratic megadonor Tom Steyer brought his “Need to Impeach” tour to Reno earlier this month. Rosen said she doesn’t support impeachment yet, but does “support allowing [special counsel Robert Mueller] to complete his investigation unimpeded, until its natural conclusion.”",
        "If Trump has his way, the strategy won’t change any time soon.",
        "“You have an outstanding man in Dean Heller,” Trump said. “I’ll be back a lot.”"

Wes Anderson directed this and co-wrote the screenplay with Roman Coppola.\n\nThe two children run away and try to make a life for themselves together ― a very twee life. Then the adults start looking for them ― in a very twee way.\n\nAlthough the Anderson aesthetic is kind of out right now during this more hardened, ultra-cynical Donald Trump era, I still love this movie. I think you’ll find much to enjoy whether you’re revisiting it or watching for the first time.",

        "LEISURE WORLD, Md. ― On a Wednesday night earlier this month, Ben Jealous got an opportunity any Democratic gubernatorial candidate would kill for, and few get.",
        "The former NAACP head had a 15-minute interview on MSNBC spotlighting his bid in Maryland. Alongside his family friend, comedian Dave Chappelle, Jealous had a priceless chance to deliver his message ― the legalization of marijuana, single-payer health care and a $15 dollar minimum wage ― to a national audience of progressives.",
        "The spotlight wouldn’t leave Jealous for the next week. Three different prospective 2020 Democratic presidential contenders would campaign for him ― Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator for whom Jealous was a TV surrogate during the 2016 White House race, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and California Sen. Kamala Harris.",
        "“Ben is somebody that inspires me,” Booker said while stumping with the candidate. “His whole life has been organized around service, his whole life has been organized around fighting for justice. He knows we need to take on sacred cows, and fight inequities.”",
        "An hour or so after Jealous’ MSNBC hit, his major rival in Tuesday’s Democratic primary, Prince George’s County Executive Rushern Baker, made an obligatory stop made by dozens of political candidates before him.",
        "He headed to Leisure World, a gated community in the Washington suburb of Montgomery County populated mostly by retirees. Despite the hour ― the event began at 7:45 p.m. – the silver-haired crowd of about 30 peppered him with questions on the MS-13 gang, rising prescription drug costs and how he would beat Maryland’s popular Republican governor, Larry Hogan, in November.",
        "Baker rattled off his accomplishments at the helm in Prince George’s County, which is majority-black: cleaning up county government after his predecessor was indicted in his final days in office, passing a $15 minimum wage, making it top spot for job growth in the D.C. region, bringing homicides to a 50-year-low.",
        "“This isn’t just rhetoric,” he said. “We’ve done it.”",
        "And while no one of Chappelle or Booker’s star power was in attendance, a devoted Maryland Democrat would find plenty of bold-faced names: Montgomery County Executive Ike Leggett, Attorney General Brian Frosh and former Gov. Martin O’Malley. Sen. Chris Van Hollen was scheduled to appear, but he couldn’t make it. The next day, Rep. John Delaney endorsed Baker.",
        "These men ― and plenty of women who hold elected office in the Old Line State ― are uniting to stop Jealous, who they dismiss as an inexperienced dilettante with fanciful proposals.",
        "“We need someone with executive experience,” O’Malley told HuffPost after the Leisure World event. “It’s different than being an advocate. Congress and the Senate are good places for advocates. Governors need to actually get things done.”",
        "Baker was even less diplomatic in a phone interview: “It’s easy to say stuff if you’ve never had to actually run a government.”",
        "Ricarra Jones, a political organizer with 1199SEIU, the union representing thousands of health care workers in the state and which has had volunteers knocking on doors for Jealous for months, predictably has a different view.",
        "“He’s one of our own. He’s an organizer,” she said of him in a phone interview. “Being a politician is being a politician. Organizers bring people together and get things done. It’s going to take a very progressive agenda to get Democrats back to the polls.”",
        "The clash’s fundamentals have repeated themselves again and again in Democratic gubernatorial primaries this election cycle.",
        "National Democrats and organizations have backed progressive insurgents, who suggest bold ideas and an expanded electorate are the way to victory. Meanwhile, state party establishments have lined up behind politicians they consider safer bets with agendas seen as more palatable to middle-of-the-road voters.",
        "Neither side has managed to dominate the clashes. Virginia’s Democratic establishment rallied behind Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam, who toppled former Rep. Tom Perriello despite Sanders’ backing and then went on to win the governorship last November.",
        "In this year’s batch of primaries, the singer Cher, Democracy for America and a host of other progressive organizations helped Paulette Jordan to a win over businessman A.J. Balukoff in Idaho. Stacey Abrams, with the support of Booker, Harris and the abortion rights group EMILY’s List, triumphed in Georgia over Stacey Evans. But EMILY’s List and Hillary Clinton weren’t able to lift Chris Giunchigliani over Steve Sisolak ― who had the backing of former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ― in Nevada.",
        "This makes the contest between Jealous, 45, and Baker, 59, something of a rubber match between activists and the establishment ― one that will go a long way toward defining how incremental or ambitious Democratic voters want a gubernatorial candidate to be during the Trump era, and one that will provide hints at the electoral strategy the party’s voters favor when faced with a strong GOP incumbent: Do they want an activist who aims high? Or a pragmatist with a record of accomplishment?”",
        "“It’s the people who give the politicians courage.”",
        "On the Saturday before the MSNBC appearance, Jealous and Chapelle showed up at historically black Morgan State University in Baltimore. They weren’t introduced by a local elected official, but by a cadre of activists, teachers and lesser-known comedians. Chapelle emerged to a roar from the 100 supporters sitting in a large lecture hall.",
        "The two men reminisced about when they first met ― Jealous was attending New York’s Columbia University and was sent by Chapelle’s parents to convince the young stand-up to drop out of comedy and go to college. He abandoned the plan after watching Chappelle earn $750 in 15 minutes telling jokes in Washington Square Park.",
        "Their Morgan State appearance was remarkably free of policy talk, save for marijuana legalization. (Jealous acknowledged Chapelle was the first person to ever pitch him on legalizing the drug, to which Chapelle responded: “I am the pot lobby.”)",
        "A few days later, as he drank a Sam Adams at an Ethiopian restaurant in Silver Spring ahead of an appearance with Booker, Jealous fleshed out his plans for legalizing marijuana. Maryland would “end mass incarceration [for pot-related charges] to end the student debt crisis” by taxing the drug and using the proceeds to pay for free community college in the state, an idea that sounds like a GOP parody of liberal overreach. He said he would fully fund public education in the state, pass a state-level version of Medicare for All, and stand up to President Donald Trump in a way Hogan, who he calls “Trump’s doormat,” has failed to do.",
        "“Defeating Hogan is about turning out Democrats,” Jealous said, noting that party members outnumber Republicans by a two-to-one margin in the state. “If this was about persuading moderate Republicans to vote for a Democrat, I’d be the wrong choice.”",
        "And in a race that had seen zero negative TV ads and a limited amount of Twitter sparring, Jealous took direct aim at Baker’s record, arguing a series of school scandals in Prince George’s County made him unelectable. “It makes him incapable of beating a Republican incumbent,” he said. (A super PAC backing Jealous has since turned these sentiments into digital ads and mailers declaring: “Rushern Baker is failing our children.”)",
        "He also rolled his eyes at Baker allies who questioned his executive experience, noting he was widely credited with revitalizing the NAACP during his five-year tenure. “Benjamin Jealous leaves the NAACP a far stronger place,” he said, reciting word-for-word a Chronicle of Philanthropy headline from the time of his departure. “I have more executive experience than anyone in this race.”",
        "But it’s his organizing experience he sees as setting him apart. He said he hopes to build a permanent political infrastructure, one that can persuade regular citizens to contact their representatives and push for progressive change. It’s a model the NAACP deployed to help Maryland legalize gay marriage and end the death penalty.",
        "“It’s the people who give the politicians courage,” he said. “The field infrastructure we’re building now, we’ll leave in the field.”",
        "But while the shorthand of progressive vs. establishment is easy to invoke, there are flies in the narrative ointment. Jealous isn’t a plucky underdog: He’s essentially tied with Baker in public polling, with eight others on the ballot ― including big law firm partner Jim Shea, who is self-funding his campaign, Clinton and Barack Obama tech guru Alec Ross, and state Sen. Rich Madaleno, a longtime progressive ― eating up smaller chunks of the vote.",
        "His running mate is a former state party chair, and he has the backing of the state teachers’ union ― hardly an insurgent group in Maryland.",
        "Jealous has been boosted by small-dollar online donations; his campaign and an affiliated super PAC have spent $1.1 million on TV ads, including spots on pricey Washington broadcast networks. Baker has spent just $300,000 on TV ads.",
        "“It’s not whether you believe in things or not.”",
        "Before Baker headed to Leisure World, he made a stop at his campaign’s freshly opened field office in Baltimore, where he was joined by the city’s contingent of Maryland’s Democratic political establishment. With Baker’s strong base in Prince George’s, both campaigns expect the race to be decided in the state’s largest city and its surrounding communities.",
        "The campaign office was covered in maps of Baltimore and its suburbs, divided into political subdivisions, but lacked air conditioning, leading more than one political heavyweight to sweat through their shirt.",
        "Various speakers at the office noted they had known Baker, a former state delegate, for years, often naming the specific legislative committee ― Appropriations, Judiciary ― they had been serving on when they met him.",
        "Adrienne Jones, a state delegate who serves as House speaker pro tem, summed up why so many of her colleagues were backing Baker: “He’s one of us. He understands the various branches, unlike Jealous, who doesn’t. [Jealous] has never had to be in the legislature.”",
        "Baker told HuffPost he and Jealous don’t have different philosophies. But he also said many of Jealous’ most progressive goals were impossible or poorly planned. Asked if he supported a single-payer health care plan, Baker responded with a simple “no.”",
        "“Ben just shows you he has no experience in actually running a government. How do you pay for that?” Baker said. “He’s just throwing out a lot of stuff because he doesn’t understand the budget.”",
        "He also dissected Jealous’ plan to legalize marijuana. Yes, legalization would bring in revenue, he said. But the revenue wouldn’t come right away, Baker added, citing Maryland’s experiences with legalized gambling and medical marijuana. How would Jealous pay for the free community college in the meantime?",
        "“It’s not whether you believe in things or not,” he said. “It’s about what you can get done. There’s nothing more progressive than providing jobs for people who didn’t have jobs before. And that’s what we did in Prince George’s County.”",
        "Weak fundraising ― he brought in just $180,000 in the last reporting period ―limits Baker’s ability to respond to Jealous’ attacks and high-profile endorsements. But one potential game-changer has rallied to his cause: Valerie Ervin.",
        "Ervin, the former chair of the Montgomery County Council and a longtime progressive activist, was the running mate of Baltimore County Executive Kevin Kamenetz, a leading contender in the gubernatorial race who died of a heart attack in early May. Ervin moved up to take his place, and sued to try to replace his name on the ballot with hers. The lawsuit failed, and even though her campaign had generated excitement and most surveys put her in third place, she recently opted to end her candidacy ― and endorse Baker.",
        "“We need to do something to make sure the person who wins this primary can beat Larry Hogan,” she said in an interview. “When I have to choose someone’s character, I chose the character of Rushern Baker over the character of Ben Jealous.”",
        "Ervin has accused Jealous of contacting the Working Families Party, where she worked as a senior adviser, to try to prevent her from joining Kamenetz’s ticket. (The Working Families Party had endorsed Jealous months before.) Then, when Kamenetz died, she said Jealous campaign representatives offered to help her get her job back ― but only if she endorsed Jealous.",
        "“They’re going to lie,” Ervin said. “But I got receipts” ― her term for proof.",
        "Jealous denied both accusations. “It’s just not true,” he said.",
        "Ervin’s role in the race also highlights a remarkable, but mostly overlooked fact: At one point, the three leading candidates for the Democratic nomination were all black. Maryland has never elected a black candidate statewide in their own right, although the last three lieutenant governors have all been African-American.",
        "“We feel like we won,” Ervin said of her campaign. “We feel like we won for all the brown and black girls.”",
        "As the Jealous-Baker faceoff enters its final days, the contest has generated little discussion in the state. But the candidates also said they thought excitement was muted because Democrats had nominated a black candidate for governor in 2014, who in an upset lost to Hogan.",
        "“Folks are eager to see us win the general,” Jealous said.",
        "CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story mentioned a super PAC backing Baker. The super PAC is backing Jealous. Additionally, it has been updated to indicate Valerie Ervin worked as a senior adviser and not executive director of the Working Families Party."

        "Hungary’s parliament passed a bundle of legislation that allows the prosecution of any individual or organization helping migrants enter the country illegally.",
        "The “Stop Soros” bill, named after 86-year-old American billionaire George Soros, whose Open Society Foundations is active in Eastern Europe, means people could face prison time for such things as handing out information about the asylum process or providing migrants with financial assistance. The government also changed Hungary’s constitution to make resettling foreigners in the country illegal.",
        "Parliament approved the measures on Wednesday ― World Refugee Day. The legislation takes effect after President Janos Ader signs it into law.",
        "“We want to use the bills to stop Hungary from becoming a country of immigrants,” Interior Minister Sandor Pinter wrote in a statement attached to the legislation.",
        "The bills fall in line with Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s push toward the right with his controversial views on immigration. Orban has referred to migration as “a poison,” and has called Syrian asylum seekers “Muslim invaders” looking to dismantle Hungary’s Christian identity (Muslims make up 0.4 percent of Hungary’s population). He also has erected border fences to keep people out, and opposes the European Union’s efforts to resettle refugees.",
        "Lotte Leicht, director of Human Rights Watch in the EU, called Hungary’s newly passed legislation “appalling and unacceptable.” She urged European nations to “take action and ensure human rights are respected.”",
        "“Criminalizing essential and legitimate human rights work is a brazen attack on people seeking safe haven from persecution and those who carry out admirable work to help them,” said Gauri van Gulik, Amnesty International’s Europe director. “It is a new low point in an intensifying crackdown on civil society and it is something we will resist every step of the way.”",
        "European countries continue to grapple with the arrival of migrants and refugees ― albeit in much smaller numbers than in 2015 and 2016. Hungary is among the handful of governments tilting to the right, led by politicians who stoke anti-immigration sentiment.",
        "Last week, Italy Interior Minister Matteo Salvini blocked a rescue vessel operating in the central Mediterranean from docking in any Italian port. The boat, carrying 629 migrants, was forced to instead head to Spain while governments sparred over how to tackle migration.",
        "Meanwhile, the leadership of German Chancellor Angela Merkel is uncertain, as her coalition government can’t reach consensus on whether to continue accepting migrants.",
        "“The voices that have lost confidence in the system and believe the system is not working are finding allies throughout Europe,” Natalia Banulescu-Bogdan, head of the international program at the Migration Policy Institute, told HuffPost, explaining that right-wing voices like Orban’s are becoming more mainstream."

        "The number of new applications for asylum in the U.S. increased by 27 percent from 2016 to 2017, reaching 331,700, according to the “Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2017” report. The U.S. surpassed Germany, which fielded 198,300 applications.",
        "The U.N. report was published Tuesday before World Refugee Day, which falls on Wednesday.",
        "The latest numbers are in line with the steady increase in asylum claims coming from Central America that the U.S. has seen since 2013.",
        "“Similar to last year, applicants from the [northern region of Central America] made up 43 percent of all claims, and the number of claims increased by 44 percent, reaching levels not seen since the 1980s,” the study said. The applicants consist mainly of people from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras who are fleeing gang violence.",
        "The release of these figures comes amid a public backlash against the Trump administration’s zero tolerance policy. The administration seeks to prosecute anybody who attempts to cross the border illegally ― an effort that is driving family separations on a massive scale. More than 2,300 children were separated from their parents between May 5 and June 9.",
        "Even once people have put in their asylum requests, the system is so backlogged ― there were 311,000 pending cases as of January ― that a decision can take years. Only 65,600 asylum decisions were made in the U.S. in 2017, the U.N. report said, making the U.S. home to the largest asylum-seeking population in the world.",
        "“This backlog has grown by more than 1,750 percent over the last five years, and the rate of new asylum applications has more than tripled,” U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said. The agency announced in January that it would be scheduling interviews for more recent applications, prioritizing new entrants over those who have already been waiting years for a decision.",
        "“Asylum is a slow process in the U.S. and it’s always been sort of a neglected activity within our judicial system. Never really have adequate resources been allocated to this particular legal component of the work,” said Erol Kekic, executive director of the immigration and refugee program at the Church World Service, a global humanitarian agency.",
        "The political will to deal with the asylum issue hasn’t been strong enough over the last 15 to 20 years, meaning that the government doesn’t have the personnel in place to make the process more efficient, Kekic said.",
        "The Trump administration, he noted, claims it’s trying to address the backlog by moving officers who had been working overseas on refugee resettlement back to the U.S. to deal with asylum claims.",
        "Kekic criticized that strategy as merely “watering down, moving shells around so nothing really ever gets done.”",
        "Worldwide, the number of asylum seekers waiting for decisions on their applications spiked about 300,000, to 3.1 million by the end of last year, the U.N. report said.",
        "A record 68.5 million people ― a jump of almost 3 million in just one year ― had also been displaced by the end of 2017. More than 25 million of them fled their countries as refugees. The remainder were internally displaced or seeking asylum.",
        "As crises like the civil war in Syria and the persecution of the Rohingya minority in Myanmar continue, governments worldwide are struggling to find sustainable solutions. Tensions erupted among European governments last week after Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini turned away a rescue ship carrying hundreds of migrants, forcing it to spend days at sea before finally docking safely in Spain. And German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government appears to be falling apart as internal squabbles over how to handle migration take center stage.",
        "“We are at a watershed, where success in managing forced displacement globally requires a new and far more comprehensive approach so that countries and communities aren’t left dealing with this alone,” said Filippo Grandi, chief of the U.N. Refugee Agency."

        "WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump may have bought Congress some time to act on family separations when he signed an executive order on Wednesday calling for an expansion of family immigrant detention to prevent parents and kids from being split up at the border.",
        "But it likely won’t last long, thanks to an expected legal battle.",
        "Rather than simply reversing his administration’s zero tolerance policy, as members of both parties have called for, Trump opted for an alternative that could create an equally troubling situation: the indefinite detention of entire families together while parents are undergoing prosecution and then immigration proceedings.",
        "But Trump’s order faces an uphill battle in court, based on a court settlement and ensuing orders that require the government to release child detainees promptly, typically limiting family immigrant detention to about 20 days. The Trump administration cited the restriction when it announced its zero tolerance policy, which called for prosecuting adult migrants for illegal entry even if it meant separating them from their kids. Trump’s executive order instructs the attorney general to seek a change to the court settlement so children can be detained for longer with their parents.",
        "The good news for lawmakers is that they now have some political breathing room to reach consensus on a highly controversial issue that has resulted in thousands of children and toddlers being detained and separated from their parents.",
        "The bad news is that even the administration acknowledges it’s not a permanent fix.",
        "“Congress needs to legislate,” Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen told reporters after leaving a meeting with Republicans on Capitol Hill.",
        "“I see this as giving us the opportunity to set the rules of the road in this area because I don’t know how long the executive order will be in effect,” added Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine). “I think legislation is still a good idea, but certainly it’s a positive step forward if the executive order says children will no longer be separate from their families.”",
        "The bad news, however, may be that Trump’s executive order deflates some of the urgency surrounding the issue. Congress doesn’t have a great track record for producing legislation without a specific deadline, especially on a controversial topic like immigration. For example, young undocumented immigrants who came to the country as children, known as Dreamers, still face legal limbo because lawmakers failed to codify protections for them when Trump ended President Barack Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.",
        "“This is a place where, when something is no longer an emergency ― you saw it with DACA ― it kind of goes away because there are so many other issues going on,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said Wednesday. “You’re a court ruling away from being back to the same thing.”",
        "The federal government has taken more than 2,000 children from their parents since Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the zero tolerance policy in May, prompting widespread outrage.",
        "Several proposals have been introduced in the Senate to address the crisis, but none so far has attracted bipartisan support. On Wednesday, Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) introduced a narrowly tailored bill that would essentially codify Trump’s executive order and allow children to be detained with their parents. It has 27 GOP co-sponsors, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who ultimately decides which bill gets a vote on the floor.",
        "Democrats, meanwhile, have continued to insist that no legislation is necessary to address the crisis because the Trump administration could reverse its zero tolerance policy immediately. They also say they oppose locking up families together, calling it a “monstrous” policy.",
        "“Locking up whole families is no solution at all—the Trump Administration must reverse its policy of prosecuting vulnerable people fleeing three of the most dangerous countries on earth, who are attempting to seek safe haven in America,” Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, said in a statement on Wednesday.",
        "It’s unclear, however, whether Democrats as a whole will ultimately object to a narrowly tailored bill that allows immigrant families to be detained together if Republicans are able to bring one up for a vote. If they decide to oppose it, they could be blamed for standing in the way of a solution.",
        "“The idea that we don’t want to fix this is just not plausible,” Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) said Wednesday, dismissing the notion that his party would receive blame. “It only is plausible for a few operatives on the Republican side whispering in the ears of journalists. ... Nobody in the world thinks that maybe [Senate Minority Leader] Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) doesn’t want to fix this.”",
        "In the House, Republicans are planning to vote Thursday on legislation that includes a provision allowing the Department of Homeland Security to detain whole families for longer periods than it can currently.",
        "Rep. Glenn Thompson (R-Pa.) said he hoped family detentions wouldn’t be indefinite, likening them to “a practice of Third World countries.”",
        "“I would hope what that means is we’re going to be, in an expedited fashion, processing folks to be able to help them return home,” he said."

        "Tipping has been around since the 1700s, when it applied to the monetary rewards that rich people gave their servants.",
        "And no, at least according to Snopes, it is not an acronym for “to insure prompt service” ― which makes sense if you think about it, since we tip after we receive good service, not in advance. And at the risk of stirring the grammar hornet’s nest, wouldn’t it be “ensure,” not “insure,” anyway?",
        "But the bottom line is that there’s a whole variety of ways to pay for services these days, leaving many of us confused about just when we are supposed to tip and when we really don’t have to. To help sort it out, HuffPost culled information online and reached out to an etiquette expert for advice.",
        "And thanks, but no tips are necessary for our service.",
        "Your morning cuppa joe",
        "If stopping at a coffee shop is part of your daily routine, you undoubtedly have encountered the baristas’ tip jar. Sometimes there’s a digital tip jar, giving coffee drinkers the option of tipping 50 cents, $1 or $2 through the coffee chain’s app.",
        "Now, you may have thought, “Isn’t it a bit crazy to tip $2 on a cup of coffee that already costs an arm and a leg?” While $2 may be steep, etiquette expert Diane Gottsman of the Protocol School of Texas told HuffPost to consider this: If you’re a regular customer, employees probably call you by name and have your order memorized. The tip jar is not an obligation, but it’s a nice perk for staffers when you receive special service.",
        "She added, “It is certainly polite to tip each time you make a purchase, especially when your order is large or complicated. Sometimes they are juggling a long line and still remember you prefer no foam or an extra pump of caramel. Their attention to detail and excellent service should be acknowledged.”",
        "The takeout food counter",
        "You may have noticed a tip line on the electronic check, making you wonder, “What service am I actually tipping for when no one even brings me my order?”",
        "Gottsman said that tipping for a takeout order is discretionary. If the server has carefully bagged your order, added extra utensils or carried it out to your car, a tip is a nice gesture.",
        "“Any time someone provides an exceptional level of service, you can’t go wrong by showing your appreciation with a few dollars,” she said.",
        "A dollar in the tip jar is appropriate. For large orders, if an employee has exerted time and effort, think $2 to $5. But no, not 18 percent if table service isn’t involved.",
        "The fast-food drive-through window",
        "Fast food workers are paid an hourly wage and do not rely on gratuities as part of their income. No tip is necessary, Gottsman said.",
        "Nor do you need to tip the Geek Squad technician, who is being a paid an hourly wage and therefore is not expecting a tip, she said. “But if you would like to acknowledge service that is above and beyond, do so in an online review or ask to speak to a manager,” she added",
        "The dog groomer",
        "The short answer is yes, you should tip the dog groomer 15 to 20 percent of the final bill, said Gottsman ― whether she goes to you or you take Fido to the shop.",
        "“A tip shows your gratitude for their effort in making your prized possession beautiful, shiny and clean while working hard to keep your baby calm,” she said.",
        "If you have an elderly dog, one with sensitive skin, a matted coat or behavioral issues that the groomer had to deal with, tip a bit more, she suggested. Neurotic dogs often need special attention.",
        "If your house is hard to find or takes extra time to get to because of road construction, figure that into your tip as well.",
        "Of course, if your pup winds up looking lopsided, tip at your discretion. But first, you might want to ask the groomer to fix the bad cut.",
        "The hair salon",
        "Confusion reigns when it comes to tipping in the salon. In part, it’s because we tend to develop a relationship with our stylist. We talk, share confidences and leave the salon feeling uplifted by our new look. We don’t tip our therapists, but when our “therapist” also cuts our hair, we should start with a 20 percent tip and go upward.",
        "But not much is set in stone, and there are plenty of variables, noted Today. Women in and around big cities tend to be a bit more generous, even though the services cost more. Women with supershort hair, which they get cut and colored every four to six weeks, don’t always give a huge tip because their annual beauty bill is so high to begin with. Stylists who work in mall shops or salons that don’t require appointments are less likely to have a loyal clientele and sometimes get smaller tips.",
        "But 20 percent is a good place to start. For a $15 haircut at a walk-in shop, that’s just $3. When the haircut is $150, $30 is reasonable as a tip ― more if your stylist squeezed you in, you were late or couldn’t get a sitter and had to take your toddler with you.",
        "You can ask what your stylist’s policy is on splitting tips with the shampooer. Some clients compare it to dining at a fancy restaurant with a wine steward and a waiter, giving one tip and assuming the restaurant divides it.",
        "A better idea is to tip everyone separately, according to salon owners. If the shampooer does more than just wash your hair ― gives you a to-die-for scalp massage or applies toner or extra conditioner ― you should tip more. In big cities, start at $3 to $5.",
        "Hair salons have changed a lot over the years. Often the individual hairstylists rent their space from a salon and aren’t employees of the shop anymore. Tips are definitely part of their income, and a 20 to 25 percent tip is pretty much standard.",
        "It also used to be that you didn’t tip the salon owner if he or she cut your hair. Nowadays, you do.",
        "Package and mail delivery drivers",
        "Generally speaking, you don’t need to tip UPS, FedEx or postal delivery people when they deliver something. UPS drivers are directed to politely decline any material expressions ― particularly money. While the drivers do not want to offend a friendly customer and they would probably appreciate a drink of warm cocoa on a cold day, they are discouraged from taking money or any elaborate gift. When in doubt, refer to the UPS code of business conduct and use your best judgment when offering a gift, said Gottsman.",
        "FedEx employees may accept gifts valued at $75 or less, but cash of any amount may not be accepted. And government regulations forbid U.S. Postal Service workers from taking cash gifts but allow nonmonetary gifts under $20.",
        "Flower delivery people may be tipped, especially if your house is hard to find and they went out of their way to ensure the flowers were protected from the elements. Teleflora suggests a $2 to $5 tip on an average-size arrangement, more if multiple arrangements are involved.",
        "Food delivery services? GrubHub co-founder Matt Maloney pretty much laid out the standards for tipping delivery people in a Facebook post. GrubHub’s website recommends a $5 tip or 20 percent of the bill, whichever is higher. Emily Post recommends tipping $2 to $5 for pizzas, depending on the size of the order and difficulty of delivery.",
        "Valets",
        "Do you tip the valet who takes your car or the one who returns it to you in one piece ― or both? Even when there is a hefty fee for valet parking?",
        "Yes, valet parking is expensive, said Gottsman. But as she noted, if there is an on-site valet, you are probably going to a hotel or restaurant with a higher price point anyway. “Yes, it’s appropriate to leave a tip,” she said, suggesting “$2 to $5 when they bring your car up to the curb.” You can tip in advance as well if you request a special service like leaving your car by the entrance while you run into your room to change, she said.",
        "Furniture delivery",
        "If the furniture doesn’t fit in your building’s prewar elevator or delivery people having to climb five flights of stairs on the hottest day of the year, that qualifies as service above and beyond the call of duty. Give the delivery guys $5 to $10 a person ― more if they’ve assembled it and carted off your old things. Make sure you offer them plenty of water and your undying thanks, said Gottsman.",
        "Peeps at the hotel",
        "If the concierge is just giving you fast directions to the nearest coffee shop, no tip is expected. For general theater tickets or dinner reservations, tip $5 to $10 ― and $20 and up for scoring hard-to-get tickets or reservations.",
        "Housekeepers, who depend on tips, should be tipped $2 to $5 a night — more if there are more than two people occupying a room. When the maid brings you extra towels, blankets and more shampoo for your teenager, it’s worth handing her a dollar or two.",
        "Breakfast buffets that are included in the price of the hotel room also can confuse us. Do you tip the people who keep the food trays filled, or is that just their job?",
        "“Attendants who walk around and fill your water glass, retrieve an additional bread roll, utensil or clear your dishes should be accommodated with $1 to $2 dollars per diner,” said Gottsman.",
        "Teachers and teachers’ aides",
        "Tipping is not necessary. In fact, it’s inappropriate. Gottsman said instead of tipping these professionals, give them a gift during Teacher Appreciation Week or the holiday season. Avoid giving cash and instead contribute to a class gift or gift certificate. A tip or cash gift looks like a bribe.",
        "Others who you would never tip: bankers, lawyers, dentists, doctors and chiropractors."

        "It’s been nearly 20 years since the beloved teen drama premiered, airing for four seasons on The WB network from 1998 to 2002. While its cast members have gone onto play other roles (a Russian spy, vice president of the United States, a telepath, etc.) they’ll always have a soft spot for the story of the girl who chose to follow her crush across the country and change her life forever.",
        "Keri Russell, Scott Speedman, Scott Foley, Amy Jo Johnson, Tangi Miller, Ian Gomez and Greg Grunberg reunited at the ATX Television Festival earlier this month to talk about the show’s enduring legacy ― it’s way more than just a haircut, OK? ― and the possibility of a full-blown revival.",
        "“It was just such a sweet story. I just think [J.J. Abrams and Matt Reeves] who created it and wrote it ― and still to this day, it’s such a sweet, kind of romantic idea for a story,” Russell said during an interview on the “Today” show. “I feel like everyone can relate to that on some level, that idea of ‘what if I had chosen this and taken this path,’ and still to this day it’s one of my favorite stories.”",
        "At the beginning of the second season, the titular teen chopped off her famous curls, which somehow became the show’s most polarizing storyline ― even more than the time travel.",
        "“It’s what college girls do. They break up with a guy and go cut their hair,” Russell explained, joking that her takeaway from the experience was that TV viewers really want girls to have long hair.",
        "“The haircut is the reason that a lot of people ever even heard of the show. ” co-star Amanda Foreman, who played Felicity’s roommate, added. “But it was not her idea. It wasn’t her fault.”",
        "Both Russell and Foley have wrapped up their work on other series for this year (though the “Scandal” actor does have another one in the pipeline), so naturally, the question of a “Felicity” revival arose.",
        "Russell put forth the idea of a “Felicity” Christmas movie in the same vein as “The Brady Brunch,” while Foley ruled out the possibility altogether.",
        "“I think ‘Felicity’ is so specific to that time in someone’s life when you’re going from college to adulthood and that transitory period,” Foley said, advocating for an entirely new cast. “We are past that period.”",
        "Speedman, however, is fully on board.",
        "“I’ve always said yes,” he said. “It’s going to be good.”",

    "articleContent": [
        "“I think all men are chauvinistic pigs now. I’d like to know what to do about that,” a young woman reads into the camera, one of 27 vignettes in “Yours in Sisterhood,” an unconventional and provocative documentary featuring women in the present day reading and discussing letters sent by women in the 1970s to the editors of Ms. magazine.",
        "In developing the project, filmmaker Irene Lusztig read thousands of archived letters to the magazine, founded by feminist icon Gloria Steinem, most of which were unpublished. Then, from 2015 to 2017, she traveled to 32 states and filmed women reading selected letters.",
        "What resulted was a film, which screened at this year’s AFI Docs Festival in Washington last week, that inventively fuses the past with the present — and reminds viewers how, in many ways, little has changed for women in America. The letters, which encompass topics such as sexual harassment and assault, and racism and white supremacy, instantaneously bring to mind parallels to the current day.",
        "“Everything that was happening constantly felt like it was in conversation with [the film],” Lusztig said in an interview.",
        "Working on the film during the 2016 election and its aftermath, when issues of gender and race were never far from view, Lusztig said that her approach to the film evolved, as it increasingly took on a new relevance.",
        "She began asking the contemporary women how it felt to read the letters or what they thought of the writers, creating a conversation between past and present.",
        "After one reader in the film, Kathleen, reads a letter from a North Carolina woman who describes being in an interracial relationship and her fears about local Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazi groups, she summarizes a sentiment recurring throughout the documentary.",
        "“It just reminds me that time isn’t naturally progressive,” she says of the letter. “I think people just assume that as the years go by, things get better and better. And that’s just not the case. It’s just not the case at all.”",
        "Aside from its relevance, the film is also a fascinating experiment in space and performance. In some ways, the concept is simple, with every reader standing in front of the camera, reading the letter from a teleprompter. Yet each letter turns into an intimate snapshot, revealing details about both the writer and the reader. The backdrop — sometimes a town square, or a parking lot, or the front yard of the reader’s home — can also take on significance when interpreting the letters.",
        "Occasionally, Lusztig found the letter writers themselves, who poignantly reflect on their younger selves, 40 years later.",
        "When pairing the old letters with present-day readers, Lusztig was interested in what she called “matchmaking.” In some cases, she sought specific commonalities, like finding a female police officer to read a letter from an aspiring police officer in the 1970s, who writes of being told that “we don’t hire women.”",
        "In other cases, the connections between writer and reader were merely coincidental. Often, they were not hard to find.",
        "For instance, with letters about body image or sexual harassment, “every woman has had that experience, it turns out,” Lusztig said. “Almost any woman in the whole world would be able to read and have something to say about it.”",
        "In selecting which letters to use in the film, Lusztig said that she strove to capture diversity in race, sexual orientation and geography, trying not to replicate Ms. magazine’s mostly white and “New York and California” readership.",
        "“I wanted to make a project about the U.S.,” she said. “Through the letters, you really feel the difference between someone in a small town in Nebraska, and it is about what someone’s isolation is, or what it means to encounter Ms. in a drugstore, or a pharmacy, or an airport, or a supermarket, when you’re not in a community where you have a lot of access to feminist political organizing or activism.”",
        "She also chose some letters that represented different ideologies, showing how feminism can take on various forms, and reflecting the public discourse — both then and now — about who feels included in social movements, and who is not.",
        "In the film, a woman at a shooting range in upstate New York defends her gun rights, and a Minnesota woman writes that she is deeply religious and opposes abortion.",
        "“There’s more than one way to be a feminist,” her letter reads, also emphasizing that she is “not a man-hater.”",
        "But the project also captures tension between past and present. Some of the readers point out objections and criticisms to the letters that they are tasked with reading. According to Lusztig, she sometimes looked for pairings that were not as literal or direct, illustrating “what it feels like to not just listen to, but embody a voice that is different from yours,” she said.",
        "“Yours In Sisterhood” will appear at several other film festivals around the country this summer. Lusztig said she also plans to show the film at colleges, and in the next year or two, release an online archive of all of the letter readings.",
        "After filming more than 300 letters, Lusztig painstakingly selected 27 for the final film, which she hopes is representative of the range of letter writers and readers. Yet she still fell short in some ways — for example, she said that she regrets not including more women with disabilities.",
        "“I hope the film is diverse enough that for any viewer, there’s at least one or two readers who don’t represent their views, or feel challenging to listen to,” she said.",
        "In addition to encapsulating the importance of listening to different voices, the film and the unearthing of the letters also personify how the past can be reinterpreted and reconceived in new contexts.",
        "“History isn’t static,” she said. “It’s constantly moving and changing and looking different, depending on where you are.”"

        "BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia’s President-elect Ivan Duque, who swept aside leftist Gustavo Petro in Sunday’s election, pledged to unite his South American nation after a divisive campaign but insisted he would change a landmark peace accord with leftist rebels.",
        "Duque’s decisive victory in Sunday’s poll, with 54 percent of votes to Petro’s 42 percent, is likely to reassure investors in Latin America’s fourth-largest economy who were alarmed by the leftist candidate’s promise to overturn Colombia’s orthodox economic model.",
        "Yet, in the first presidential election since the 2016 peace deal with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), Duque worried Colombians with a promise to overhaul the accord that ended a five-decade conflict which killed more than 220,000 people and displaced millions. He has promised to impose tougher punishments on rebels for war crimes.",
        "Surrounded by friends and family, Duque thanked voters for handing him the biggest electoral victory in Colombia’s history based on a number of votes received. He struck a conciliatory tone, calling for the nation of more than 50 million people to unite behind him after a polarizing campaign.",
        "“With humility and honor, I tell the Colombian people that I will give all my energies to unite our country. No more divisions,” Duque told a crowd of cheering supporters in Bogota.",
        "“I will not govern with hatred.”",
        "Duque, 41, the business-friendly protégé of hardline former President Alvaro Uribe, has promised to toughen the peace deal while keeping Colombia’s business-friendly economic policies intact.",
        "By contrast, former guerrilla Petro had pledged to take on political elites, redistribute land to the poor and gradually eliminate the need for oil and coal in Latin America’s fourth-largest economy. His positions prompted critics to compare him to Venezuela’s former socialist President Hugo Chavez.",
        "Although Petro won a majority in only eight of 32 provinces, and the capital Bogota, the fact that a leftist advanced to the presidential runoff is historic in Colombia, where traditionally conservative politicians have held sway. Petro won 8 million votes versus 10.3 million for Duque.",
        "Petro, 58, had called on supporters to take to the streets if he felt there was widespread manipulation of the tally, but he accepted the outcome of Sunday’s election.",
        "“We accept Duque’s triumph. He is the president of the Republic of Colombia... Today we are the opposition to his government,” Petro, he will return to the Senate, told cheering supporters in Bogota.",
        "FRACTURED LEFT",
        "Duque will face significant challenges when he takes office in August. The economy remains weak; drug trafficking gangs have moved into areas once controlled by the FARC and more than half a million Venezuelan migrants have crossed into Colombia, looking for food and work.",
        "His plans to change the peace deal will face considerable opposition in Congress and from Colombia’s Constitutional Court.",
        "On Sunday, he said he would make necessary “corrections” to the accord so victims’ rights receive greater priority and justice and reparations are respected.",
        "“Peace is something all Colombians yearn for, and peace means that we turn the page on the fractures that have divided us into friends and enemies of peace,” he said, as confetti rained down and supporters danced and honked horns.",
        "“Today, we’re all friends to build that peace and it must be a peace that above all allows the guerrilla base its demobilization, its disarmament and its effective reinsertion.”",
        "FARC leader Rodrigo Londono, known as Timochenko, congratulated Duque on Twitter, calling for reconciliation and saying he respected Colombians’ decision.",
        "Duque has also promised to bolster the $324 billion economy, keep investors happy by cutting business taxes, support the oil and coal sectors - top exports - and help manufacturing.",
        "“It is a result that’s very in line with what the market had been expecting and it guarantees that Colombia’s reputation - political and economic stability - is still valid,” Felipe Campos, head economist at Alianza brokerage, said.",
        "Duque is the candidate for the Democratic Center Party, a movement started in 2013 by Uribe, seen as the power behind the throne.",
        "A one-term senator, Duque worked at the Inter-American Development Bank in Washington until 2014, when Uribe asked him to return to Colombia and take a seat in Congress. Duque’s running mate, Marta Lucia Ramirez, will be Colombia’s first female vice president.",
        "“Our hope has arrived,” said 52-year-old publicist Carlos Cortes, a Duque supporter. “Now, with more respect for private enterprise, more jobs will be generated and we’ll move forward as a country.”",
        "For decades, Colombia’s fractured left has failed to come close to winning the presidency or exercising control in Congress, overshadowed by right-wing contenders who have promised strong security policies.",
        "Yet the 2016 deal with the FARC clearly shifted priorities for many voters in the Andean country of nearly 50 million people.",
        "Despite Petro’s loss, voter interest in tackling inequality, corruption and inadequate social services looks set to create opportunities for the left in future, possibly as soon as 2022."

        "Several White House officials have defended the U.S. stance on illegal border crossings. Last week, White House adviser Stephen Miller appeared to characterize the ongoing separations as a “simple decision” by the Trump administration to combat unauthorized border crossings.",
        "“No nation can have the policy that whole classes of people are immune from immigration law or enforcement,” he told The New York Times. “It was a simple decision by the administration to have a zero tolerance policy for illegal entry, period. The message is that no one is exempt from immigration law.”",
        "An unnamed White House official also alluded to The Washington Post that Trump was using the enforcement to force lawmakers to pass new immigration laws.",
        "“The president has told folks that in lieu of the laws being fixed, he wants to use the enforcement mechanisms that we have,” the official told the newspaper. “The thinking in the building is to force people to the table.”",
        "White House adviser Kellyanne Conway also acknowledged the existence of the policy in an interview with NBC on Sunday, although she said “nobody” liked it. And last week, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders cited the Bible as justification “to enforce the law.”",
        "Federal courts have repeatedly ruled that changing immigration detention policy to deter unauthorized border-crossing is illegal. To date, Nielsen has avoided characterizing the new policy as a deterrent or even as a policy at all.",
        "Her latest tweets prompted a widespread outcry from critics on Twitter:",
        "President Donald Trump has blamed Democrats for his own administration’s policy, accusing the party of hosting a “horrible and cruel legislative agenda.” But there is no law that requires families to be separated for crossing the border, and previous administrations often made exceptions in such cases to keep children and their parents together.",
        "Trump also appeared to confirm that there was some “breakup of families” at the border this weekend, even as he shirked the blame:"

        "TOKYO, June 18 (Reuters) - A magnitude 6.1 earthquake shook Osaka, Japan’s second-biggest metropolis, early on Monday, killing three people, halting factory lines in an industrial area and bursting water mains, government and company officials said.",
        "No tsunami warning was issued. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said authorities were assessing damage and their top priority was the safety of residents. About 150 people were injured, the broadcaster NHK said, lowering an earlier toll after a revision by city officials.",
        "Live footage showed toppled walls, broken windows and gushing burst water mains after the quake hit Osaka, which will host next year’s Group of 20 summit, just before 8 a.m. as commuters were heading to work.",
        "Quakes are common in Japan, part of the seismically active “Ring of Fire” that stretches from the South Pacific through Indonesia and Japan, across to Alaska and down the west coast of North, Central and South America.",
        "The epicenter of Monday’s earthquake was just north of Osaka city at a depth of 8 miles, said the Japan Meteorological Agency. The agency originally put the magnitude at 5.9 but later raised it to 6.1.",
        "The quake struck an important industrial area of central Japan.",
        "Osaka-based Panasonic said it was halting production at three of its plants. Daihatsu Motor Co, a unit of Toyota Motor Corp, stopped its factories in Osaka and Kyoto while it checked for damage. It said it would resume operations at the Osaka plant on Monday evening.",
        "Tractor maker Kubota Corp. said it halted two plants in the area, while air conditioner maker Daikin Industries Ltd suspended operations at two plants, one of which had restarted by noon.",

        "Three people were killed, authorities said. Collapsing walls killed a 9-year-old girl as she walked to school and a man in his 80s, Japanese media said. Another man in his 80s was killed when a bookcase fell on him.",
        "‘TERRIFIED, CONFUSED’",
        "“We were sleeping and it woke us up abruptly,” said Kate Kilpatrick, 19, an American who was staying in a hotel in Osaka when the quake hit.",
        "“It was so terrifying because this is my first earthquake. I thought it was a nightmare because I was so confused,” she said. “The whole world was aggressively shaking.”",
        "Kilpatrick, visiting Japan for the first time, said alarms went off almost immediately in the hotel and a loudspeaker told guests to stay away from windows.",
        "No irregularities were detected at the Mihama, Takahama and Ohi nuclear plants to the north of Osaka, Kansai Electric Power said. More than 170,000 households in Osaka and neighboring Hyogo prefecture lost power temporarily but it was restored within two hours, the utility said.",
        "Most trains in the Osaka area were still not running by late afternoon, police said.",

        "A massive 9.0 quake hit much further to the north in March 2011, triggering a huge tsunami that killed some 18,000 people and triggered the world’s worst nuclear disaster in a quarter of a century at Tokyo Electric Power’s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant.",
        "Japan introduced a law after the Kobe quake requiring owners of large buildings such as hotels and hospitals to have their buildings inspected for earthquake resistance.",
        "UPDATE: An earlier wire story placed the number of injured at more than 200. City officials later lowered that toll."

        "America’s most popular soccer team kicks off its World Cup campaign on Sunday morning against defending champion Germany. Not the United States men’s national soccer team, which crapped out during qualifiers, but Mexico. El Tri, as the team is colloquially known. The choice of discerning yanqui bandwagoners everywhere.",
        "What follows is a very quick guide for new arrivals. Learn all about the team you have just now decided to love unconditionally for the next few weeks.",
        "Few international soccer teams have been as consistent as Mexico over the past three decades ― in ways both good and bad. El Tri has progressed past the World Cup’s initial group stage in six consecutive tournaments. But each time, Mexico has lost its first game of the tournament’s knockout stages, often in brutal fashion. In 2014, Mexico fell to The Netherlands in the round of 16 thanks to a last-minute, dubiously awarded penalty, and the repeated heartbreaks have become known as Mexico’s “curse of the fifth game.”",
        "Mexico ended World Cup qualifying in prime position to put that curse to bed. The team topped the final qualifying group for the North and Central American region, winning six of its 10 matches and losing just once. It was a run that included El Tri’s first World Cup qualifying victory in the United States since 1972.",
        "Mexico’s draw into Group F doesn’t leave this team much room for error if it hopes to continue its streak of success in the group stage. Germany is never a welcome sight in a World Cup group, and it’s tough to imagine Mexico taking points off the Germans on Sunday. But things should get easier next week, when El Tri faces one of the tournament’s lower-ranked teams in South Korea.",
        "Avoid disaster there, and Mexico’s hopes of advancing to the knockout stage will almost certainly come down to its match on June 27 against Sweden, which sits behind Mexico in FIFA’s rankings but is considered a slight favorite to finish second in the group, according to FiveThirtyEight’s projections.",
        "5 Players To Watch",
        "Hirving Lozano: It’s almost impossible to predict how coach Juan Carlos Osorio will line Mexico up on any given day ― he ran out a different lineup in each of the first 46 games he managed ― but it seems a safe bet that 22-year-old Lozano will be on the pitch. The winger El Tri fans know affectionately as “Chucky” was probably Mexico’s best player of any age over the past year, when he bagged 19 goals in 34 appearances for his Dutch club, PSV Eindhoven. Lozano has seven goals for El Tri since Osorio handed him his national team debut in 2016; now, he’s a candidate to become one of this World Cup’s breakout stars.",
        "Javier “Chicharito” Hernández: Chicharito is Mexico’s all-time leading scorer, with 49 tallies in 102 career appearances for El Tri. This is his third World Cup, and he’s spent Mexico’s tune-up matches fighting to gain Osorio’s trust as the starting striker. The 30-year-old had a fair but not earth-shattering year in the English Premier League, notching eight goals in 28 appearances for West Ham United. Look for him in his favorite spot: heading home a goal from the back post.",
        "Carlos Vela and Jesús Corona: Osorio will have a choice to make on the wing opposite Lozano, but he’ll likely rely on both Vela and Corona during the group stage. Vela, 29, is back with El Tri after missing the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. And the former Arsenal prospect is back in form, too: Vela scored seven goals in 12 matches for Major League Soccer’s Los Angeles Football Club before reporting for national team duty.",
        "Corona struggled a bit this season at FC Porto in Portugal, even as the club won its first league title since 2013. Still, the 25-year-old winger known as “Tecatito” is looking to replicate the breakout he had on the international stage two summers ago, when he turned in a series of sparkling performances at the Gold Cup and Copa America.",
        "Andrés Guardado: Guardado has 147 appearances for El Tri, more than all but three players in Mexico’s history. At 31, this is probably the last World Cup for the man who plays his club soccer for Spain’s Real Betis. How he pairs with Héctor Herrera, Miguel Layún or whomever else Osorio puts in the midfield with him could determine Mexico’s fate, especially against a German squad laden with superstars that like to dominate the middle of the park.",
        "Skip Google And Use These Facts To Impress Your Friends",
        "Hernández knows all about Mexico’s World Cup curse: His father, Chícharo, was a member of the 1986 team that made the quarterfinals. Hernández has had an odd World Cup career. He’s one of Mexico’s biggest stars, yet has started just one match for El Tri across two World Cups. He has made eight total appearances and scored three times at those tournaments, though, and has a knack for big goals.",
        "He scored Mexico’s opening goal in a 2-0 defeat of France in South Africa in 2010, then sealed El Tri’s crucial group stage victory over Croatia with a late goal in Brazil. If Chicharito scores twice in Russia, he’d become Mexico’s all-time leading World Cup scorer ― and he might have to if El Tri hopes to advance.",
        "At age 39, Rafael Márquez could become just the third player ever to appear in five separate World Cups, should he make it onto the field during the tournament. Márquez, who’s played twice as many World Cup matches as any other Mexican player, would also become the oldest player to ever appear for El Tri at the tournament.",
        "On the flip side, 20-year-old Edson Álvarez gives Osorio an option on the other end of the age spectrum. Álvarez is capable of playing in both the midfield and defense, and that versatility could make him an appealing option in the wake of an injury that will force defender Diego Alves to sit out the World Cup.",
        "The Schedule",
        "Sunday, June 17: vs. Germany, in Moscow",
        "Saturday, June 23: vs. South Korea, in Rostov",
        "Wednesday, June 27: vs. Sweden, in Ekaterinburg",
        "The Outlook",
        "Mexico isn’t necessarily riding high into this tournament, and the team faces a tough group draw, to boot. But that’s been the case before: Four years ago, El Tri needed a last-minute qualifying goal from the United States just to get into the World Cup, then found itself drawn into a similarly daunting group with a pre-tournament favorite. Still, the team found a way to advance.",
        "It wouldn’t be surprising to see Mexico do that again, but El Tri is going to need some good fortune to break the quarterfinal curse. If it finishes second to Germany in Group F, Mexico would almost certainly face Brazil ― the odds-on favorite to win the World Cup ― in the round of 16. That feels like too tough of a task for this squad.",
        "This story has been updated to include more details about Jesús Corona’s club team, FC Porto."

        "MOSCOW (Reuters) ― Tiny Iceland made a stunning first-ever World Cup appearance on Saturday when they held 2014 runners-up Argentina to a 1-1 draw in a dramatic match where Lionel Messi blew his chance to win it when he had a penalty saved by Hannes Por Halldorsson.",
        "Sergio Aguero had given the twice world champions the lead after 19 minutes of the Group D match. However, Iceland showed exactly the same commitment and self-belief as when they stunned the soccer world with their run to the quarter-finals of the European Championship two years ago and hit back four minutes later through Alfred Finnbogason.",
        "Argentina, playing in all-black and roared on by the vast majority of the crowd in the Spartak Stadium, eventually took command and delivered wave after wave of attacks in the second half but they actually created few clear chances either side of the poorly-struck 64th-minute penalty by Messi, who had a remarkable 11 shots during the match.",
        "Iceland, by far the smallest country by population to appear at the World Cup, famously beat England in the last 16 of Euro 2016 and again inspired by their “thunderclapping” fans ran tirelessly and fought for everything to write another glowing chapter in their short but glorious major tournament story.",
        "“I hope it is going to prove important to us to reach our goal to qualify,” Halldorsson said of the penalty save.",
        "“I did my homework, I looked at a lot of penalties by Messi, and I also looked at how I had been behaving in previous penalties, so I tried to get into their mindset, how they would be thinking about me.",
        "“I think the Argentinians felt a bit frustrated that they weren’t getting through and it was important we equalized so quickly. I guess our game plan worked almost perfectly.”",
        "Argentina coach Jorge Sampaoli said: “We need to find more variety of options going forward. It’s a very competitive group.",
        "“The circumstances around the missed penalty and that led to Leo’s mistake, that’s just another statistic, it’s part of the past... football is like that. We need to be strong as a group, believe in ourselves and know we have all the tools to beat anybody.”",
        "COMMITMENT",
        "His players won’t have to look far for inspiration when it comes to self-belief.",
        "After poor-quality, low-intensity performances from some of the other tournament outsiders in the opening days in Russia, Iceland showed yet again their magnificent commitment, spirit and fitness.",
        "They signaled their intent from the kick off, sending seven men charging into the box to challenge as the ball was pumped long and it proved to be just the first of many uncomfortable moments for a decidedly shaky Argentine defense.",
        "The South Americans looked more assured in attack, though, and went ahead when Aguero turned tightly in the box and smashed in an unstoppable shot.",
        "Iceland, however, are not a team to sit back and sulk and soon forced an equalizer when keeper Willy Caballero palmed Gylfi Sigurdsson’s low shot straight into the path of Finnbogason to sweep into the unguarded net.",
        "After Cristiano Ronaldo’s hat-trick in Portugal’s 3-3 draw with Spain on Friday, all eyes were on Messi to respond but he was generally kept at arm’s length by the rugged but controlled Iceland defenders, no respecters of even the greatest reputation.",
        "The great man was then given the ultimate opportunity after Hordur Bjorgvin Magnusson got entangled with Aguero in the box, only for Halldorsson to fly to his right and palm the penalty clear.",
        "Iceland then defended superbly, almost fanatically, and when substitute Cristian Pavon did break through in the dying moments, Halldorsson made another fantastic full-length save to touch his shot clear.",
        "Iceland’s players rushed to the stands to share their celebrations with their fans and now will have real belief that they can get out of a group that also contains Croatia and Nigeria, who meet later on Saturday."

        "Streamline recommends “The ABC Murders” on Amazon Prime this week. Amazon debuted this new show on Feb. 1.\n\nPremise: Based on an Agatha Christie novel, this takes place in the 1930s and tells the story of a once-famous detective who longs for his glory years while spending much of his time alone. A serial killer starts to send messages to the detective, which sets off a cat-and-mouse mystery that, of course, involves murder.\n\nStars: Rupert Grint and John Malkovich.",
        "How excited should you be? Amazon doesn’t have as many British crime shows as Netflix, so adding this highly stylized detective thriller should be a welcome move for fans of that genre. Malkovich elevates everything he stars in (even with a ridiculous accent this time around) and Grint looks nothing like Grint in this role, so that’s kind of fun. Although this show wallows in grimness, clever moments of humor peek through occasionally.\n\nAny reasons to be skeptical? This show plods along at a glacial pace. During multiple scenes, I wondered if my internet had slowed down and I was watching this at half-speed. The poor direction and dialogue make this hard to get through, so you really have to love detective thrillers to find enjoyment here. Sometimes I watch shows with hourlong episodes that feel too long, but it’s hard to say what should have been cut. That’s not the case here, as the show decides to spend a laughable amount of time focusing on shots of sinks and typewriters and other uninteresting inanimate objects.",

The service adds this on Sept. 16.\n\n“Moonrise Kingdom” stars two unknown child actors ― Kara Hayward and Jared Gilman ― along with a notable cast of adults that includes Tilda Swinton, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Frances McDormand and Bruce Willis. Wes Anderson directed this and co-wrote the screenplay with Roman Coppola.\n\nThe two children run away and try to make a life for themselves together ― a very twee life. Then the adults start looking for them ― in a very twee way.\n\nAlthough the Anderson aesthetic is kind of out right now during this more hardened, ultra-cynical Donald Trump era, I still love this movie.

        "WASHINGTON ― With a strong economy and a new “success” in North Korea, President Donald Trump will cruise to re-election in 2020, his lawyer predicted, particularly if the Democrats nominate a “moron” like former Vice President Joe Biden.",
        "“They need someone new, who would be more threatening to us,” Rudy Giuliani, himself a failed presidential candidate in 2008, told HuffPost. “They’ve got to hit us with a surprise.”",
        "“The unknown frightens me more than Elizabeth Warren or Biden,” he said.",
        "Giuliani said not one of the candidates currently receiving attention as potential 2020 opponents worries him, but he reserved his harshest comments for the former vice president.",
        "“Joe Biden is a moron,” he said, claiming that Biden finished last in his law school class at Syracuse University and had been unable to understand issues Giuliani tried to discuss with him when he was a federal prosecutor and Biden was a Delaware senator. “I’m calling Joe Biden a mentally deficient idiot.”",
        "Giuliani further said Biden’s time has passed. “He’s also too old. He’s four years older than Trump,” Giuliani said.",
        "Biden is 75. Trump just turned 72.",
        "Biden unsuccessfully ran for president in 1988 and 2008. He considered running in 2016, as the sitting vice president under President Barack Obama, but did not, citing the recent death of his son Beau from brain cancer.",
        "An aide to Biden declined to comment on Giuliani’s remarks.",
        "It’s unclear why Giuliani felt compelled to attack Biden personally. In a poll early this year, 58 percent of Americans saw Biden favorably compared to 28 percent who saw him unfavorably. In contrast, approval ratings for Giuliani’s boss, Trump, have ranged from the mid-30s to the low 40s through his presidency thus far.",
        "Giuliani also said Democrats would hurt themselves if they asked Obama to campaign for Democratic congressional candidates this fall, saying that would limit them to just 42 percent of the vote. “Please, bring him back,” he said.",
        "A recent poll, however, showed Obama’s approval rating as even higher than Biden’s, with 63 percent approving and 36 percent disapproving.",
        "Giuliani has taken charge of the legal team defending Trump in the ongoing investigation into contacts between Trump’s 2016 campaign and Russian spy agencies, which the U.S. intelligence community determined had worked to elect Trump.",
        "The FBI had begun its probe of possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians well before Election Day. Control of the investigation was shifted to special counsel Robert Mueller after Trump fired then-FBI Director James Comey in May 2017. Soon after, the president told NBC News as well as senior Russian officials visiting the Oval Office that he had fired Comey because of the investigation.",
        "Mueller’s investigation has so far resulted in the guilty pleas of five individuals, including three former Trump campaign staffers, and the indictment of 15 other people and three companies. That total includes 14 Russians, Trump’s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, and the Internet Research Agency “troll farm” that was used to create and disseminate propaganda to help Trump win.",
        "A related investigation by Giuliani’s former office is examining the dealings of longtime Trump lawyer Michael Cohen. A former business partner of Cohen has agreed to cooperate in that probe and plead to New York state charges.",
        "Notwithstanding all this, Giuliani said the ongoing investigation into contacts between Russia and Trump’s 2016 campaign would not result in anything damaging to Trump. At most, he said, it would offer a possible basis for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to seek an impeachment vote, should Democrats take control of the chamber in November.",
        "Giuliani predicted she would not do so, though, because she was in the House in the late 1990s, when Republicans chose to impeach Democratic President Bill Clinton and saw it backfire against them.",
        "“She’s seen this before,” Giuliani said."

        "Virunga National Park, a gem of the African wilderness home to many of the last mountain gorillas, has closed its gates to visitors for the rest of the year due to the worst spate of violence in years, the park said earlier this month.",
        "“It is abundantly clear that the Virunga region is deeply affected by insecurity and that this will remain the case for some time,” the park’s warden, Emmanuel de Merode, wrote in a statement to visitors on June 2. “For Virunga to be safely visited, much more robust measures are needed than in the past. This will require a very significant investment, and makes it impossible for us to re-open tourism this year.”",
        "The decision comes after 25-year-old Virunga ranger Rachel Masika Baraka last month was murdered defending two British tourists on a trip through the park. The pair was kidnapped, as was their driver, although they were released two days later.",
        "Virunga, located in Democratic Republic of Congo, is the oldest national park in Africa. It has been plagued with violence for years and it is among the most dangerous postings for wildlife rangers in the world. At least 170 officials have been killed in the region in the past two decades and in April, six Virunga park workers were killed in a militant attack that officials said was the deadliest in recent history.",
        "But violent conflicts have skyrocketed this year even as tourism has increased, bringing more revenue to the economy. De Merode, who was shot himself by unknown attackers in 2014, told National Geographic 16 employees have been killed this year alone, making this year the worst it’s been in a decade.",
        "“This has been a profoundly difficult decision for me, and carries with it enormous disappointment for all of those, including yourselves, that invested such hope in the extraordinary impact that tourism was having on people’s lives around Virunga,” de Merode wrote in his letter. “It also represents an enormous financial strain for the park, but we are convinced that it is the only responsible decision that we can make under the current circumstances.”",
        "Tour operators have already begun to worry about the closure. Several told The New York Times that visitors paying about $400 a day to see gorillas have asked for refunds.",
        "Virunga was designated as a Unesco World Heritage Site in 1979 and is home to around half of the world’s critically endangered mountain gorillas.",
        "Despite the ongoing violence, conservation efforts have helped the imperiled populations recover. In June, a new survey announced the number of mountain gorillas had risen above 1,000, a 25 percent increase since 2010."

        "A dramatic proposal to split California into three separate states has gathered enough signatures to appear on the ballot during the upcoming midterm elections in November.",
        "Tim Draper, the main proponent of the initiative and its prime bankroller, gathered at least 402,000 signatures to divide California into three parts: a state called Northern California sprawling from Oregon down to San Francisco, another called California that would primarily include Los Angeles and a band of land up the coast, and another dubbed Southern California that would include Fresno, Bakersfield and San Diego.",
        "The plan would create three differently sized regions, but all would have roughly the same population. And while California currently has two U.S. senators, the new bloc of three Californias would have six under the new proposal.",
        "“Three states will get us better infrastructure, better education and lower taxes,” Draper told The Los Angeles Times last summer after his proposal for the measure was submitted. “States will be more accountable to us and can cooperate and compete for citizens.”",
        "While voters will get to decide on the measure, it faces an uphill battle regardless of the outcome. If passed, the state constitution mandates both houses of the California legislature approve the proposal before it’s submitted to Congress, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. It’s also likely to be challenged in court.",
        "The Times notes that, if the unlikely event were to take place, it would be the first state to divide itself since West Virginia became an official entity in 1863.",
        "This is the third time Draper has attempted to split up the state. He bankrolled efforts in 2012 and 2014 to divide the region into six different Californias, spending around $5 million in his most recent endeavor.",
        "“California government has rotted,” Draper told The Mercury News last month. “We need to empower our population to improve their government.”",
        "A separate coalition, dubbed NoCaBreakup, has already begun organizing to fight Draper’s proposal. Opponents are worried how the state’s vast resources would be divided were the state to break apart and say the proposal would harm poor regions while demarcating rich areas that generate most of California’s current tax revenue.",
        "“This measure would cost taxpayers billions of dollars to pay for the massive transactional costs of breaking up the state, whether it be universities, parks, or retirement systems,” Steven Maviglio, a political consultant who helped fight Draper’s past proposals, said on Twitter. “California government can do a better job addressing the real issues facing the state, but this measure is a massive distraction that will cause political chaos and greater inequality.”",
        "The new initiative will be certified by the California Secretary of State, Alex Padilla, on June 28 and will appear on the ballot in November."

        "McFarland was released on $300,000 bail in June 2017 after federal prosecutors accused him of giving investors fake documents to convince them to plow more than $1 million into his company and the Fyre Festival.",
        "“In March of 2018, William McFarland pled guilty to defrauding investors and vendors of the Fyre Festival, but it is apparent that he did not stop there,” William F. Sweeney Jr., FBI assistant director-in-charge, said in a statement Tuesday.",
        "McFarland sold nearly $100,000 worth of fraudulent tickets to approximately 15 customers through a company he controlled called NYC VIP Access, according to federal prosecutors. He either failed to provide the tickets or didn’t provide them as advertised, they said.",
        "McFarland sent proceeds from the fraudulent sales to other people’s accounts in an attempt to conceal his connection to the funds, prosecutors said.",
        "“Today’s charges depict our intolerance for such fraudulent activity, and we will continue to diligently investigate acts such as this,” Sweeney said in the statement.",
        "Each of the three wire fraud charges, as well as the money laundering charge, carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison."

        "Elon Musk’s Boring Company will soon have some boring to do.",
        "The tech billionaire’s tunnel-building endeavor confirmed to HuffPost late Wednesday that it had been selected to construct an express transit network between downtown Chicago and O’Hare International Airport.",
        "The company claims the trip through its futuristic tunnels will ferry up to 16 passengers in high-speed electric vehicles. The cars, called “skates,” could leave as frequently as every 30 seconds and travel more than 100 miles per hour, The New York Times reported.",
        "The trip will reportedly take about 12 minutes each way.",
        "There are few speedy options to get from downtown to O’Hare; travelers can either drive on the often traffic-clogged roadways or take the L train. Both options can take more than 40 minutes, The Verge reported.",
        "Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel (D) opened up the bidding process to companies with ideas on how to reduce that commute to less than 20 minutes.",
        "“This transformative project will help Chicago write the next chapter in our legacy of innovation and invention,” Emanuel told The Times on Wednesday. He will provide more details at a news conference with Musk on Thursday.",
        "The project, which still needs approval from the city council, is expected to cost around $1 billion and will be entirely financed by the Boring Company. Rides would cost about $20 to $25, and all fares and branding associated with the project would go to the company itself, per The Chicago Tribune.",
        "It’s unclear how quickly the project will be completed after the contracts are signed. Boring Co. is still building its first test tunnel in California. But Emanuel expressed optimism that Musk was up to the task.",
        "“I’m betting on a guy who has proven in space, auto and now a tunnel, that he can innovate and create something of the future,” Emanuel told the Tribune. “Given his track record, we are taking his reputation and saying, ‘This is a guy in two other transportation modes who has not failed.’ That’s what we’re doing.”",
        "One of Musk’s other company’s, Tesla, Inc., recently announced plans to lay off about 9 percent of its workforce in an effort to become profitable. About 3,500 people, most of them salaried employees, are expected to lose their jobs. The automaker has lost money every year since its founding more than a decade ago and has struggled to keep up with orders for its electric cars.",
        "“What drives us is our mission to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable, clean energy,” Musk wrote in an internal email to staff that he later posted to Twitter. “We will never achieve that mission unless we eventually demonstrate that we can be sustainably profitable. That is a valid and fair criticism of Tesla’s history to date.”",
        "Aside from tunnels, the Boring Company recently caused a literal firestorm on social media after Musk sold 20,000 branded flamethrowers for $500-a-pop. The company made $10 million from those sales."

        "Comedy Central has ordered a pilot to turn the satirical women’s website Reductress into a late-night talk show.",
        "Former “Saturday Night Live” actress Abby Elliott is slated to host the potential series, titled “The Reductress Hour,” according to The Hollywood Reporter. The iconic website ― known for its sardonic headlines like “8 Sex Positions That Will Blow His Mind And Destroy His Penis” and “Woman Quits Job To Hydrate Full-Time” ― has become the women’s media version of The Onion since it was founded by Beth Newell and Sarah Pappalardo in 2013.",
        "The potential late-night show will reportedly include highlights from the week’s news, original interviews and segments. Elliot will be in character when hosting the show, which will ironically “embody the tone of women’s media,” THR reported.",
        "Newell, Pappalardo and Elliott are executive producers for the series, along with JAX Media’s Tony Hernandez, John Skidmore, Brooke Posch and Genevieve Aniello.",
        "In an interview with Vulture earlier this year, Pappalardo and Newell discussed the tricky balance of using satire in women’s media.",
        "“It can be tough. We try to satirize things without putting other women down, and that can be a little tricky when certain people are doing really insane things in media,” Newell said.",
        "Pappalardo added: “And a lot of it is just being as specific as possible in our satire, especially when it’s on touchy subjects or specific people. We’re not out to broadly demonize most women or people that we criticize, so we try to make sure our writing is specific and tight and not just a broad demonization. Unless it’s deserved.”",
        "If the pilot goes well, “The Reductress Hour” would be one of the only female-led shows on Comedy Central. “Broad City,” which is entering its final season, and “Inside Amy Schumer,” which is on hiatus, are the only other female-led comedy shows on the network."

        "SAN FRANCISCO ― London Breed will be the next mayor of San Francisco after fellow front-runner Mark Leno announced his concession Wednesday, marking a milestone in the diverse city’s political history.",
        "“The message that this sends to the next generation of young people growing up in this city is that no matter where you come from, no matter what you decide to do in life, you can do anything you want to do,” Breed said on the steps of City Hall steps shortly after Leno conceded.",
        "“Her success is San Francisco’s success,” Leno said. As of Tuesday, Breed had a 1,861-vote lead over Leno, with just over 9,000 votes left to be counted, according to the city’s Department of Elections.",
        "This marks the end of the road for the other leading candidates, Jane Kim and Angela Alioto, who also vied to finish the late Mayor Ed Lee’s term that runs through 2020. Though San Franciscans voted to elect his replacement more than a week ago, the use of an unusual ranked-choice voting system in an extremely close race slowed down the count.",
        "Kim also congratulated Breed in a Facebook post on Wednesday. “I’m proud to live in the largest city in America with a woman as mayor,” she wrote.",
        "Breed, the Board of Supervisors president, will be San Francisco’s first black woman to permanently hold the role, which she held temporarily late last year when she stepped in as acting mayor after Lee’s sudden death in December of cardiac arrest.",
        "Shortly after she announced that she would then run for the permanent office, the board voted to replace her as interim mayor with Supervisor Mark Farrell. Those who pushed for the replacement said that letting her continue to serve as interim mayor gave her campaign an unfair advantage, but the emotions surrounding her contentious ouster may have ultimately given her a leg up in the June election.",
        "Breed, a lifelong San Franciscan who grew up in public housing in the district she now represents, was first elected to the Board of Supervisors in 2012 and was named its president in 2015.",
        "Leno could have been the first openly gay mayor of San Francisco, a city that’s long been on the forefront of LGBTQ rights. But this election cycle hasn’t been Leno’s first opportunity to break down barriers.",
        "In 2008, he became the first openly gay man to be elected to the California Senate ― a role held until November 2016. Prior to that, he became one of the first two openly gay men elected to the California Assembly in 2002 after serving on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors starting in 1998.",
        "Kim could have been the city’s first Asian-American woman to serve as the city’s mayor and only the second Asian-American to land the job. That milestone was set by the late Mayor Ed Lee, whose death prompted this election to choose a mayor who would finish off his term.",
        "Kim has served on the city’s Board of Supervisors since 2011, representing many of the neighborhoods bearing the brunt of the city’s homelessness crisis. In 2016, she ran for the California Senate but lost to then-fellow San Francisco Supervisor Scott Wiener.",
        "Former Supervisor Angela Alioto, the daughter of former San Francisco Mayor Joseph Alioto, served on the board until 1997 and unsuccessfully ran for mayor in 1995 and 2003. She, Breed and Kim all stood a chance to be the city’s second female mayor, following in the footsteps of Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who was mayor from 1978 to 1988.",
        "The candidates clashed mainly over their visions of how to address San Francisco’s housing shortage and its skyrocketing cost of living. Their divergent perspectives on SB827, a stalled statewide proposal to give developers broad freedom to build multifamily housing complexes near public transportation regardless of local zoning restrictions, emerged as a defining issue for many voters.",
        "Breed fully supported the proposal and has often argued that encouraging new construction is as an opportunity to let luxury housing provide funds for middle- and lower-income living spaces. Kim emerged on the opposite end of the spectrum, arguing that it would allow developers to destroy the character of neighborhoods and would put more pressure on San Francisco to build while letting suburbs with minimal public transit off the hook. Leno and Alioto settled somewhere in the middle on the issue.",
        "The winner was selected through the city’s uncommon ranked-choice voting system, which is thought to save money on expensive runoff elections and elect the most broadly supported candidate. The system asks voters to rank their first, second and third choice for mayor, and if one candidate wins at least 50 percent of the vote, that person is named the winner. But if not, a complicated process ensues in which the last-place finisher is eliminated and any voters who ranked that person first will now have their vote count toward their second choice. The process continues until there is a majority winner.",
        "Under that system, it’s possible that the candidate with the most first-choice votes won’t win. Oakland, San Francisco’s neighbor to the east, saw that happen with its mayoral race in 2010.",
        "Hoping to keep votes away from occasional front-runner Breed and leverage the ranked voting system, Leno and Kim teamed up last month to encourage their supporters to name them as their first or second choices. The plan of attack appeared to be working in Leno’s favor for a while, as votes for eliminated candidates trickled down to him. But Breed pulled ahead as the remaining votes were counted.",
        "Breed must now name a successor to her seat on the Board of Supervisors, which will then vote on a new president.",
        "This article has been updated with additional details about the race and a statement from Breed.",
        "CORRECTION: A previous version of this story indicated that Breed’s term would extend into the next one starting in 2020. Her victory this week only secures her position for the remainder of Lee’s term."

He was questioned on Tuesday by the State Department’s Diplomatic Security Service and maintained that his name was Barry O’Beirne. But when pressed on inconsistencies in his story, he admitted that he was the fugitive Air Force officer.",

He told authorities that he had been depressed about being in the military and had fled to California, creating the fictitious identity. He said he had lived in California since then.",

Two weeks after the e-commerce giant rolled out discounts for Prime members at 121 Whole Foods stores across 12 states and Whole Foods Market 365 stores nationwide, the company said it has expanded to an additional 10 states, including its headquarter state, Washington. (The perk is available in only one city in Missouri —Kansas City.)",

Within a day after Whole Foods started offering deals in Florida, the app’s ranking jumped to No. 18 from No. 256 among shopping apps in the Apple App Store based on downloads, App Annie data shows.",

Amazon has sped up the rollout of the perks before the annual $20 Prime membership hike, effective June 16, according to a source.",

        "Last week’s deaths of celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain and fashion designer Kate Spade have led to a significant increase in calls and text messages to suicide prevention organizations, the groups said.",
        "The Crisis Text Line, which invites people to communicate with a crisis counselor for free by texting 741-741, said it saw a 115-percent increase in volume from Friday to Sunday, compared with the weekend before.",
        "“The top two emotions texters discussed were scared and pained,” Liz Eddy, Crisis Text Line’s director of communications, told HuffPost. The group also provides counseling to those in the U.S. who send messages through its Facebook page.",
        "Crisis Text Line said it saw a 9-percent rise in contacts from people ages 25 to 54, who are likely familiar with Spade and Bourdain.",
        "There was a similar jump in requests for help after the deaths of Linkin Park musician Chester Bennington in July 2017 and comedian Robin Williams in 2014, Eddy said.",
        "The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, whose phone number (1-800-273-8255) had been widely broadcast and shared on social media in the wake of Spade and Bourdain’s deaths, said calls increased 25 percent on Thursday and Friday from the week before.",
        "“The Lifeline has been proven to de-escalate moments of crisis and help people find hope,” Frances Gonzalez, the director of communication, told USA Today of her organization, which offers free and confidential emotional support to people in crisis or distress.",
        "The group’s director, John Draper, said people often feel connected to celebrities. Their deaths can cause a “collective sense of loss that many people feel,” he told The Wall Street Journal.",
        "The Lifeline’s number is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and will connect callers to trained counselors located at more than 150 crisis centers.",
        "“The research is really clear that these calls have been shown to reduce emotional distress and suicidal crisis,” Draper said.",
        "Dan Reidenberg, executive director of Suicide Awareness Voices of Education, which works to prevent suicide through public awareness and education, also emphasized that connection.",
        "“We need to have people understand that just because there was a high profile death by suicide it doesn’t mean it has to be your outcome, too,” Reidenberg told USA Today.",
        "Those wanting to volunteer to help can contact Crisis Text Line or The Lifeline through either organization’s website.",
        "If you or someone you know needs help, call 1-800-273-8255 for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. You can also text HOME to 741-741 for free, 24-hour support from the Crisis Text Line. Outside of the U.S., please visit the International Association for Suicide Prevention for a database of resources."

        "The Twitterverse exploded in a spyware panic after a Dutch journalist in Singapore posted a photo of a press kit freebie of a tiny fan that connects to computers via the USB portal. It was part of a goodie bag for the journalists covering U.S. President Donald Trump’s meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.",
        "Techies flooded Twitter with warnings not to plug the fans into computers because to do so would risk a serious spyware or malware incursion.",
        "USB keys have been used in a number of successful computer infiltrations. In 2008, the Russians planted bugged thumb drives in kiosks near NATO headquarters in Kabul, hoping that American military personnel would buy a drive and plug it into a secure computer, which they reportedly did. The Telegraph reported that the Kremlin spied on delegates to the Group of 20 meeting in 2013 by passing out USB pen drives capable of downloading information from laptops.",
        "The fan was one of a number of freebies provided to reporters that included a bottle of water branded with images of Trump and Kim and a Trump-Kim handheld fan, both provided from The Straits Times newspaper. The kit also included a guide to Singapore’s resort island of Sentosa, where the summit is being held.",
        "It wasn’t immediately clear who provided the USB fan, but it triggered immediate suspicion.",
        "The uproar began with a tweet in Dutch from journalist Harald Doornbos, who posted a photo of the USB fan still in a plastic bag. “Handy,” he posted. “In the press kit for the Trump Kim summit is a USB fan. Handy to stay cool while writing. Here in Singapore it gets quite hot.”",
        "The little fan was also in a photo of freebies posted by CNBC’s Amanda Drury, who works out of Sydney and who is also covering the summit.",
        "Several who responded on Twitter to Doornbos or to those who retweeted the post were stunned anyone would consider using the USB fan. “Seriously?” asked one. Another tweeted: “COME ON.” Several who tweeted wanted the gadget to study it.",
        "About 2,500 journalists have been accredited to cover the summit, and 80 percent of them are from overseas. Japanese, South Korean and American journalists make up the largest contingents."

Wes Anderson directed this and co-wrote the screenplay with Roman Coppola.\n\nThe two children run away and try to make a life for themselves together ― a very twee life. Then the adults start looking for them ― in a very twee way.\n\nAlthough the Anderson aesthetic is kind of out right now during this more hardened, ultra-cynical Donald Trump era, I still love this movie. I think you’ll find much to enjoy whether you’re revisiting it or watching for the first time.",

        "SINGAPORE — Secret Service agents and U.S. military service members arriving by the busload. Workers hurriedly repainting driveways and grooming roadside flowering shrubs. Barriers erected on roads, and warnings spreading on social media of impending traffic and flight delays.",
        "Just days before Tuesday’s scheduled summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, final preparations are underway on the sunny shores of host country Singapore.",
        "The hotels expected to host the Trump and Kim delegations are steeling themselves for their guests’ arrival. Capella Hotel, confirmed by the White House as the venue for the summit, was swarming with construction workers, U.S. officials and security personnel on Thursday — even as other hotel guests lounged at the bar and lolled by the poolside.",
        "A hotel spokeswoman said the entire 5-star resort, located on Sentosa, a small island off Singapore’s southern coast, would shut its doors to the public this weekend and would remain closed until June 17.",
        "At The Shangri-La Hotel, expected to be Trump’s base, hundreds of people who appeared to be from his entourage were checking into their rooms on Thursday. Tents, likely for security personnel, have been erected near the hotel’s pool, and the property’s underground car park has been closed off, with a sign indicating that it would be out of bounds until June 15.",
        "At the nearby St. Regis Hotel, said to be where Kim and his delegation will stay, workers were seen this week installing security cameras in the car park and in the hotel’s driveway.",
        "Neither the Shangri-La nor the St. Regis would confirm that the leaders are staying at their properties. The Singapore government, however, has declared the area around the two hotels as a “special event area” for the period of June 10 to June 14. The same designation has been extended to Sentosa and portions of its surrounding waters.",
        "A hotel source familiar with the planning for the summit confirmed that Trump would be staying at the Shangri-La, and said Kim was likely staying at St. Regis. “But with these two, who really knows what can happen?” said the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
        "Capella Hotel",
        "An expansive and secluded resort, Capella is surrounded by lush greenery and perched on a hill overlooking the ocean. Celebrities like Lady Gaga and Madonna have reportedly stayed there. Rooms can cost upwards of $430 a night, and a three-bedroom manor can cost $8,000 or more.",
        "Experts say Capella was likely chosen as the meeting venue for security reasons. Its “secluded location” atop a hill surrounded by foliage could “shield the summit from security threats,” Muhammad Faizal Abdul Rahman, a research fellow at the Center of Excellence for National Security at Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University, told HuffPost. Sentosa has many security measures already in place to protect its visitors, he added.",
        "Ong Kok Leong of Secura Group, a Singapore-based security agency, told Today newspaper that the open, green spaces around the hotel could allow for aircraft landings in the case of an emergency.",
        "Because Sentosa is only accessible from the mainland by a single bridge, known as the Sentosa Gateway, security personnel can better inspect individuals and vehicles coming into the island, Ong noted.",
        "Workers were seen along the roadside on Sentosa Gateway on Thursday, grooming shrubbery and other plants that line the bridge. On Capella’s property, workers were busy repainting the long and winding driveway that leads to the lobby, which is housed in a restored colonial-era building. The resort’s white colonnades and facades were also being repainted.",
        "Shangri-La Hotel",
        "Across Sentosa Gateway and back on the mainland, activity was similarly buzzing at the Shangri-La, a luxury hotel in the heart of downtown Singapore.",
        "The 15-acre hotel, which boasts relative seclusion despite its central location, is accustomed to hosting high-security guests. Earlier this month, it hosted the annual Shangri-La Dialogue, a defense summit attended by world leaders, ministers and delegates from more than 50 countries.",
        "Former U.S. Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush have both stayed at the hotel’s presidential suite, which has its own private entrance and elevator. Trump is expected to stay in the same suite.",
        "Trump’s delegation is believed to have booked hundreds of the hotel’s 747 rooms. On Thursday morning, buses carrying dozens of Secret Service agents and military personnel were seen arriving at the hotel.",
        "“The selection of the three hotels [involved in the summit] is likely a decision that strikes a balance between the diplomatic and security requirements of both countries,” Faizal said. “Shangri-La and St. Regis are located in a vicinity that is no stranger to hosting important international meetings that come with high security. Shangri-La has many years of experience in working with security forces when hosting such events.”",
        "A resident of the Shangri-La Apartments, located adjacent to the hotel, photographed workers erecting scaffolding on a road next to the building on Thursday night. The Shangri-La Hotel had initially been rumored as the preferred venue for the summit. The resident said he was “relieved” the meeting would be held on Sentosa instead. A drive from Shangri-La to Capella Hotel would take about 20 minutes with no traffic. St. Regis is about a 10-minute walk away.",
        "St. Regis Hotel",
        "St. Regis has also hosted high-level delegations. In 2015, Chinese President Xi Jinping stayed at the hotel when he traveled to Singapore for a historic meeting with then-Taiwanese President Ma Ying Jeou, reported The Straits Times.",
        "The hotel’s lobby entrance is located off a busy main road, so the property may not provide the same kind of privacy that Shangri-La or Capella can. With 299 rooms and suites, the hotel is also significantly smaller than the Shangri-La.",
        "But if Kim does stay at the St. Regis, he won’t lack for luxury. The hotel’s opulent presidential suite, which can cost upwards of $10,000 a night, ranks among the largest and most expensive hotel rooms in the country.",
        "Choosing a smaller hotel may well have been part of a meticulously crafted plan by Pyongyang, Jasper Kim, director of the Center for Conflict Management at Ewha Womans University in South Korea, told HuffPost this week.",
        "“Kim Jong Un is just as concerned in optics as Donald Trump. Choosing a smaller, ‘humbler’ location would cater to his domestic audience, composed of a population that makes less than $1,000 GDP per capita,” Kim said. “It also signals to [North Korean] senior party officials that Kim will be singularly focused on securing North Korea’s national interests.”",
        "Mintaro Oba, a former State Department expert on the Koreas, said the North Korean delegation likely gave prime concern to security and comfort when considering Kim’s accommodation.",
        "“We know North Korean leaders and their entourages prioritize personal security and comfort, even to the point of bringing their own bathrooms when they travel so that intelligence services can’t analyze the waste for signs about the North Korean leader’s health,” Oba said. “I think we can reasonably expect the North Koreans to favor accommodations that are luxurious and well-protected.”",
        "Earlier reports suggested that Pyongyang was seeking outside funding to help pay for Kim’s trip to Singapore. It remains unclear who this sponsor might be.",
        "The U.S. has insisted it will not foot the North Koreans’ bill. Singapore and an anti-nuclear weapons organization have both offered to cover some summit expenses.",
        "Singapore, known as one of the world’s safest countries, is expected to pull out all the stops to ensure the tightest security for Kim and Trump. Reuters reported this week that Singaporean police, including its renowned Gurkha Contingent ― an elite force of Nepali soldiers armed with assault rifles and traditional curved knives called khukri ― would support U.S. and North Korean security personnel to secure the three hotels and nearby roads.",
        "Elsewhere in Singapore, life appeared to carry on as normal as the summit approached. Social media buzzed with summit-related chatter, adding to the undercurrent of anticipation.",
        "Digitally altered images showing Trump and Kim posing at city landmarks, including an old shopping complex called Peace Centre, made rounds on Facebook and the chat app Whatsapp. A long list of roads that would either be closed or subjected to police checks was also widely shared. “Do Share & AVOID AT ALL COST!” the notice read.",
        "Trump and Kim impersonators thrilled onlookers and posed for photos on Friday in front of a statue of the Merlion, Singapore’s unofficial mascot. (The Kim impersonator, an Australian-Chinese man who identified himself only as Howard X, told reporters on Friday that he was detained by Singapore authorities and questioned about his political views. He was told “to stay away from Sentosa Island and the Shangri-La,” Reuters reported.)",
        "South Koreans living in Singapore, which has released three commemorative coins to mark the historic meeting, said they hoped for something positive from the dialogue. Americans living here shared a similar optimism.",
        "“I am cautiously optimistic,” Christina Liew, an American who’s lived in Singapore for 13 years, told HuffPost. “I believe that dialogue and engagement is always a step in the right direction, especially given the tenuous relationship these two leaders have had.",
        "“I don’t think there are many heads of states in this day and age who are more polarizing than Trump and Kim,” added Liew, 41. “So if they can take some steps toward de-escalating threats toward one another, and the rest of the world, I would of course want that to happen.”",
        "Some Singaporeans said they were excited that such a significant diplomatic event was happening on their small island, which is about half the size of Los Angeles but home to about 5.6 million people.",
        "“I was surprised but also quite proud that they chose to hold it here,” said Sarah Lin, co-founder of local burger joint Wolfburger.",
        "“It’s a good platform for people to find out more about Singapore and also realize that we’re not in China,” she added with a laugh.",
        "Wolfburger created a “Burger for World Peace” to recognize the summit. The burger features Korean-style bulgogi brisket, kimchee mayonnaise and American sharp cheddar.",
        "“It doesn’t sound like it’d go together, but it actually really works together,” Lin said.",
        "She said she hopes the summit participants will mesh equally well.",
        "“We hope it will be a good outcome for everyone,” Lin said."

        "The populist businessman brother of the notorious late former mayor of Toronto is set to lead Canada’s most-populous province in a stunning political turnaround for one of the country’s most contentious political dynasties.",
        "Doug Ford ― the older brother of Rob Ford, who died in 2016 and who gained international infamy and the ridicule of late-night talk show hosts after a mobile phone video showed him smoking crack cocaine ― pulled off an election rout for the Progressive Conservative Party on Thursday in Ontario.",
        "Despite Thursday’s result for Ford, a self-styled anti-politician who defeated the country’s first openly gay premier, it may not be the Donald Trump-lite moment in traditionally liberal Canada that many have characterized it as.",
        "“Tonight we have sent a clear message to the world: Ontario is open for business,” Ford said in a victory speech promising an “era of prosperity” the likes of which the province has never seen.",
        "Ford, 53, will become the province’s 26th premier, a role roughly similar to that of a U.S. governor. He ousted the Liberal government of Kathleen Wynne, who in 2013 became Canada’s first openly gay premier and the province’s first female leader.",
        "Despite the lowest unemployment rate in decades, polls suggested that nearly 15 years of Liberal rule, with its share of spending, scandal and speculation that the concerns of those outside big cities weren’t being heard, had voters hungry for change.",
        "Despite a surge from the left-wing New Democrats of Andrea Horwath, Ford’s party captured more than 70 of a possible 124 seats, more than enough for a commanding majority government that will put him firmly in charge of the health care and education systems.",
        "The outspoken Ford, a former one-term Toronto city councilor, was often seen by his brother’s side during the 2013 drugs scandal that rocked Canada and captivated people around the world.",
        "His four years on council, largely as the mayor’s pugnacious wingman, felt like one big public fight. Fighting to defend his deeply troubled brother. Fighting with the chief of police over an investigation into the then-mayor and his friends. Fighting with the father of a young man with autism. Fighting with fellow councilors and constituents calling for some semblance of order.",
        "When Rob Ford abandoned his 2014 mayoral re-election bid after a cancer diagnosis, big brother stepped in to run. In so doing, he became the torchbearer for “Ford Nation” ― the community of ardent fans, largely outside Toronto’s downtown core, who embrace the family’s bumper-sticker brand of standing up for the little guy, respecting taxpayers and “stopping the gravy train.”",
        "Doug Ford finished a respectable second in his 2014 bid for mayor. He returned to Deco Companies, a family label-making business, but announced earlier this year he would run again for the city’s top job.",
        "A bigger job opened up in January, when the Ontario Tories lost their otherwise forgettable leader, Patrick Brown, following Me Too-style accusations involving two young women.",
        "Ford launched his bid to replace Brown in the basement of his mother’s suburban home, sparking the exact kind of derision an outsider taking on the establishment might hope to spark.",
        "He pledged little in the way of vision during an abridged leadership race, beyond promising to fight Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s plan to price carbon pollution. Ford also charmed social conservatives by pledging to reopen the province’s revamped sex education curriculum.",
        "Mostly it was all about cutting taxes and pinching pennies. That was enough. In his leadership victory speech in March, he gestured to the heavens while referencing his brother.",
        "The Trump comparisons came right away. It didn’t help that Ford was an avowed fan of the U.S. president, telling a local TV station in October 2016 that he wouldn’t waver in his support of the Republican over “Crooked Hillary.” This was after the “Access Hollywood” tape.",
        "His Liberal opponent similarly wasted no time trying to paint Ford with the Trump brush.",
        "“Doug Ford sounds like Donald Trump and that’s because he is like Donald Trump,” Wynne said just before the campaign. She was responding to Ford’s claim that her “shady tricks” with public money would, in private life, land her in jail.",
        "About a week later, the province’s auditor general released a scathing report accusing the Wynne government of downplaying its budget deficit by billions.",
        "At a campaign rally, a Ford supporter barked out “lock her up” — twice — as he complained about hydro rates under Wynne’s leadership. The quip made Ford laugh, but he told reporters the next day he didn’t “condone” that kind of chant.",
        "But despite the urging of some fans to “Make Ontario Great Again,” Ford rejected comparisons to the U.S. president, lest they scare off country club conservatives turned off by reality-show politics.",
        "While Trump thrived on outrage and outrageousness on his unlikely march to power, Ford tried to keep things scripted with teleprompters and talking points. As the race tightened, some wondered aloud if he was playing things too safe.",
        "While Trump obsessed over getting his face on TV, Ford did not have a media bus follow him on the trail, and would typically take just a handful of questions.",
        "While Trump’s campaign openly targeted Mexicans and Muslims, Ford didn’t deliberately stoke racial animus in the same way.",
        "Trump said he’d build a wall. Ford said he’d bring back buck-a-beer and make fuel a bit cheaper.",
        "Still, Ford faced heat for suggesting in a debate that the province had to “take care of our own” before encouraging immigrants to move to northern Ontario.",
        "“There’s no politician that probably has more support out there for new Canadians,” he said when pressed to explain himself. “Ford Nation’s full of new Canadians.”",
        "White nationalists, however, interpreted the line as a “dog whistle” and have been happy to claim Ford as their guy.",
        "Perhaps the biggest parallel to Trump involves Ford’s stinginess with details and the lingering questions about his actual grasp of governing. When a reporter asked him early on to explain how, precisely, a bill becomes a law, Ford called it a “gotcha question” and promised he’d pass “endless” bills. The defensiveness and the odd boasting felt like quintessential Trump.",
        "Though Ford promised a costed platform before voters cast their ballots, he instead released a list of priced promises with no information about how his government would pay for them. He pledged to find $6 billion in “efficiencies” in government spending, which his opponents said is just another word for cuts to public services.",
        "And, like Trump, drama follows him.",
        "Ford was accused of being involved in selling bogus party memberships to support a preferred candidate in 2016 and directly intimidating a female rival. He denied both allegations.",
        "It was revealed in the last days of the campaign that Renata Ford, the widow of Rob Ford, filed a lawsuit alleging that as trustees of her husband’s estate, Doug Ford and his brother Randy deprived her two young kids of millions of dollars. She alleges that Ford negligently mismanaged the family business while paying himself extravagant sums.",
        "Though he said he was “floored” and hurt by the lawsuit, Ford wouldn’t share audited financial statements or reveal his salary to help put the matter to rest. That, too, had shades of Trump’s refusal to release his tax returns.",
        "Ford’s mother released a statement calling Renata Ford an addict. In the end, the public drama didn’t derail Ford’s central pitch as a business success, family man, helluva guy.",
        "“I know that my brother Rob is looking down from heaven,” Ford told his jubilant supporters Thursday night, yielding his biggest applause.",
        "“I’m just getting chills talking about him right now. Rob is celebrating with us tonight. We owe so much to Rob’s legacy. A legacy of service to the people.”",
        "The late mayor’s demons, and his very public battles with alcohol and drugs, made household names of him and Doug both. But it also brought negative attention to the Ford who was supposed to be the steady one.",
        "In 2013, in the thick of Rob Ford’s problems, a radio host asked him if he worried he was damaging his brother’s brand, should he ever want to run provincially.",
        "“You know what, Doug will be provincial one day,” Rob Ford said, with noticeable anger in his voice. “He will be premier one day.”"

        "The pharmaceutical industry’s image has been significantly damaged in recent years as the public discovered the role its aggressive marketing played in fueling the opioid epidemic. But the American people are still largely in the dark about what may be pharma’s most effective tactic for pushing drugs — marketing diseases.",
        "There’s a substantial body of medical literature dating back to the early ’90s about the practice known as “disease mongering.” Pharmaceutical companies regularly pathologize everyday experiences, convince doctors that they are serious problems, tell a hypochondriacal public it needs help and offers the cure: a new drug. Against the onslaught of billions of dollars in marketing campaigns each year, however, researchers’ warnings about these tactics have gone largely unheeded.",
        "To be clear: Pharmacology has helped countless people recover from illness or lead more productive lives. But the number of patients receiving any given drug is often greater than those who would benefit from it, and often includes people it could harm.",
        "The United States was still the largest single pharmaceutical market in 2017, generating more than $450 billion of revenue. In contrast, all of Europe accounted for roughly $214 billion. U.S. pharmaceutical spending alone is double the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average. According to the Mayo Clinic, nearly 70 percent of Americans take at least one prescription drug.",
        "Adriane Fugh-Berman, a professor of pharmacology at Georgetown University Medical Center, said the pharmaceutical industry medicalizes normal life by positing that a vague, highly relatable, everyday condition is symptomatic of a newly invented disease. In other cases, pharma exaggerates the prevalence or severity of an existing condition to entice more customers.",
        "“Marketing for a drug can start seven to 10 years before they go on the market. Because it’s illegal to promote a drug before it goes on the market, what they’re promoting is the disease. That’s not illegal to do because there’s no regulation on creating diseases,” Fugh-Berman told Yahoo News.",
        "Lisa Schwartz and Steven Woloshin, co-directors of the Center for Medicine and Media at Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice, said disease-awareness campaigns may seem caring or educational but are often just marketing in disguise. The campaigns often follow three basic steps: lower the bar for diagnosis, raise the stakes so people want to get tested and spin the evidence about a drug’s benefits and risks. These steps were seen in campaigns on testosterone deficiency, bipolar disorder and restless leg syndrome.",
        "“Low testosterone was among the biggest cases of disease mongering — a huge increase in prescribing a drug before the benefits and harms of treatment were established,” Schwartz said. “And yet, manufacturers claimed ‘low T’ — not aging or other medical conditions — was the reason why older men might have less energy, worse sports performance or even feeling more tired after dinner than younger men. There are no specific rules about how companies can talk about symptoms in awareness campaigns.”",
        "Jack James, a clinical psychologist at Reykjavik University in Iceland, said the image of the pharmaceutical industry as a dynamic global enterprise burgeoning with breakthrough innovations serving the common good is a public relations concoction that obscures the fact that most new drugs are minor variations on existing formulations.",
        "“Most are, at best, expensive marginal improvements on the older and cheaper drugs they are intended to replace, and a substantial proportion of new drugs are more harmful than older formulations. In practice, the emphasis in drug development is on marketing fake innovation rather than genuine innovation,” James said.",
        "James’s book “The Health of Populations” focuses on the importance of behavioral changes to prevent diseases. He said the cultivation of direct personal relationships between industry representatives and physicians is nearly universal at all levels of private and public healthcare. For example, he said, the pharmaceutical industry gives gifts both large (e.g., sponsored trips) and small (e.g., pens and note pads) to encourage particular prescribing patterns — a boon to the industry at the potential cost of harm to the patients, or at best a waste of money by consumers, insurers and the government.",
        "Leonore Tiefer, a sexologist and psychologist at New York University School of Medicine, said the public is susceptible to exploitation by drug companies and thinks the trend will likely continue in the wrong direction.",
        "“I feel that we’re still in the ascendant in terms of people expecting more from medicine and therefore being gullible to disease-mongering claims. People are vulnerable and fearful,” Tiefer said.",
        "According to a study in the British Medical Journal, pharmaceutical companies spend $19 on advertising a new drug for every one dollar spent on the research and development process.",
        "When asked about disease mongering, Mitchell J. Katz, a public affairs specialist at the Federal Trade Commission, said his agency does not have jurisdiction over pharmaceutical advertising and that it’s handled by the FDA.",
        "“We also don’t ‘regulate’ advertising, but we do bring action in cases where ads are deceptive, misleading, or the claims they make are not supported by competent and reliable scientific information. But only ads for products within our enforcement jurisdiction,” Katz wrote in an email.",
        "Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the FDA requires that all drug advertisements and promotional labeling include a brief summary of side effects, effectiveness and indications of when the drug should not be taken. The FDA prohibits ads from omitting relevant facts, including misleading information or failing to present a fair balance between effectiveness and risks. But promotional material that does not actually mention prescription drugs would not fall under the FDA’s jurisdiction, which is established by Congress.",
        "The FDA has an expedited approval process for drugs that address rare diseases, defined as those that affect fewer than 200,000 people. In some cases, drug companies subdivide common diseases so they can be classified as rare diseases to get expedited approval. More often, though, they do the opposite: broaden the definition of an actual disease that only affects a handful of people to increase the market for a drug to treat it.",
        "In the end, Fugh-Berman said, there’s no authority that protects against questionable disease categories in any meaningful way.",
        "Schwartz and Woloshin work to improve communication between doctors and the public by helping both see through the disproportionate fears and hopes created by medical advertising and selective reporting. They note that health conditions occupy a spectrum from clearly sick to clearly well, but there’s a large gray area in-between. When does a mildly bothersome experience become the symptom of a disease? In many cases, they said, the pharmaceutical industry draws these lines aggressively so the boundaries of normal get smaller and smaller. And they do so unilaterally — no regulators are watching.",
        "“Everyone’s legs feel restless now and then, or they feel occasional stinging or burning sensations in their eyes. But far less people have symptoms severe enough to need medical treatment. The problem is that manufacturers increasingly target people with mild symptoms in order to turn them into patients. Unfortunately, treatment may offer little benefit and may not outweigh side effects, cost and inconvenience,” Woloshin said.",
        "Woloshin said pharmaceutical company print or online advertisements sometimes feature quizzes that include symptoms associated with a condition, but which the drug did not help in clinical trials.",
        "“Consumers naturally think, ‘I see the list of things on this quiz. The drug must treat these things,’ even though it doesn’t. It’s a trick,” Woloshin said.",
        "My interviews for this article suggest that the public should be skeptical about quizzes for diseases, as they are often unreliable and ask leading questions meant to convince healthy people they suffer from a newly discovered ailment.",
        "Schwartz and Woloshin wrote an article for the JAMA Internal Medicine journal on how the low T campaign was essentially a template for how diseases are sold. Are you a middle-aged man who sometimes feels tired? Has your athletic ability declined at all since your early 20s? Well, that used to be called aging. But these unvalidated online quizzes might suggest you suffer from low T. Lucky for you, Abbott Laboratories manufactures Androgel.",
        "“I think social media can be a disaster for blurring the line between marketing and public health. The marketing world is trying to get more and more companies to do disease-awareness on Facebook since they can tell stories and directly interact with people,” Schwartz said. “These sites give you the feeling that someone out there is just trying to help you and give credence to your suffering — not that a company is trying to sell a drug.”",
        "Fugh-Berman recalled taking an online test with her coworkers at PharmedOut, a group she directs at Georgetown that exposes pharmaceutical marketing and promotes evidence-based prescribing. The test on pseudobulbar affect (PBA), which manifests when specific brain damage leads to laughing or crying that is inappropriate and unconnected to a person’s emotions, suggested that normal human expressions could be signs of PBA with questions like “Do you ever find things funny that other people don’t find funny?” and “Do you cry easily?”",
        "“Almost every woman failed. Only one woman passed. Most of the men failed, but more of them passed. I would say that anyone who passed the test I was actually worried about,” Fugh-Berman said.",
        "PharmedOut’s research focuses on the effectiveness of continuing medical education (CME) funded by the pharmaceutical industry, as well as contrived or exaggerated diseases. She said pharmaceutical companies get doctors on their advisory boards and pay them to educate other influential doctors at CME events. These thought leaders also sign their names to articles — whether written by them or not — so that the company’s views find their way into medical literature. When drugs are approved and diseases are accepted as treatable, medical students are then taught to treat what were once considered benign conditions.",
        "“The trouble is that people are very reluctant to believe that things that sound so scientific and medical and are promoted so aggressively by scientific and medical experts could be mythical or at the very best exaggerated,” Tiefer said. “People don’t want to believe that.”",
        "James said private and public interests are so entangled in the health care industry’s research infrastructure that it undermines the integrity of scientific research ostensibly conducted for public benefit.",
        "“Studies show that pharmaceutical industry ‘normal’ business is characterized by persistent deceit, ranging from subtle image manipulation to outright and frequent research fraud,” James said. “Individual researchers, who may have the best of intentions but whose work is conducted in collaboration with industry, are subject to a variety of biasing influences.”",
        "Self-serving bias, an unconscious process in which judgments, decisions and conclusions favor personal interests over the general good, is chief among these cognitive blind spots. James said these sorts of cognitive biases affecting researchers are nearly impossible to regulate through ethical-conduct codes or public disclosure of conflicts.",
        "“Despite irrefutable evidence of extensive patient harm, years of attempts to prevent harm due to conflicts of interest have failed dismally,” James said.",
        "Cindy Pearson is the executive director of National Women’s Health Network (NWHN), which came into being 40 years ago. Many women had been given drugs they didn’t need or were never told the truth about the drugs they were taking. Although drug mongering affects men too, she said, women are more likely to be targeted partly because they are often the health-care decision makers for their families, keeping abreast of what’s new and making sure their families meet recommendations for hygiene, vaccinations and medical tests.",
        "She said the NWHN looks at claims of new conditions very skeptically and is willing to tell women, “Don’t believe the hype about this new drug, don’t believe the hype about this supposed under-recognized condition and don’t rush to get a screening test you’ve been told is new and can help you.”",
        "“I feel that there are people involved in creating new diseases and promoting drugs that aren’t really needed who are pretty amoral. Their measurement of success for themselves is strictly sales,” Pearson said. “There are good-spirited and good-hearted people in companies who are proud of developing something that provides help to some people — and then their marketing department gets ahold of it and turns it into something else.”",
        "Fugh-Berman said gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is essentially what used to be called reflux or heartburn. Doctors used to tell patients to eat less, drink less alcohol, not go to sleep on a full stomach and take Tums as needed. But the problem with heartburn is that customers would only need a drug when they are experiencing it.",
        "“What’s really brilliant about having people take it chronically is when they stop they get a high acid rebound syndrome that will cause them to be in pain. They think, ‘Oh I really need this drug,’ and go back on it,” Fugh-Berman said.",
        "Fugh-Berman pointed out that there have been invented diseases in the past, such as female hysteria and chlorosis in the 19th century, but that “they weren’t invented by drug companies.”",
        "Medical journalist Lynn Payer coined the phrase “disease mongering” in her 1992 book “Disease Mongers: How Doctors, Drug Companies, and Insurers are Making You Feel Sick.” She defined the practice as “trying to convince essentially well people that they are sick, or slightly sick people that they are very ill.” Evidence supporting her thesis has only grown since the book was published.",
        "Journalist Ray Moynihan and pharmacologist David Henry continued this research into the new millennium, arguing in a 2002 British Medical Journal (BMJ) article that informal alliances of pharma staff, doctors and consumer groups have engaged in “public awareness” campaigns about underdiagnosed conditions — promoting a disease as pervasive and serious, yet curable. Pharma marketing strategies, they said, downplay the importance of personal coping strategies — or the fact that a condition is essentially benign.",
        "“Pharmaceutical companies are actively involved in sponsoring the definition of diseases and promoting them to both prescribers and consumers. The social construction of illness is being replaced by the corporate construction of disease,” Moynihan and Henry wrote.",
        "PLOS (Public Library of Science) Medicine published a special issue in April 2006 focused on disease mongering following an inaugural conference on the topic. Tiefer described the conference as the beginning of a “less-is-more” movement to roll back over-diagnosing and excessive treatments. This movement is largely but not exclusively aimed at challenging the claims of pharmaceutical advertisers. These activists, researchers and doctors are also concerned about traditional, ritualistic practices of medicine, like vast amounts of screening and routine testing that leads to more diagnosis and treatment than is beneficial.",
        "Pearson advocates for regulations on drug marketing, both in medical education and consumer-directed campaigns, to scale back a competitive environment in which every new drug needs to be a blockbuster and make a billion dollars in annual sales.",
        "“You can’t do that unless you’re willing to price a new drug for a relatively small group of people through the stratosphere, which we do see in cancer and other terribly serious conditions. But if you’re marketing a drug that no one will pay that much for because the condition isn’t that terrible, then you have to market it to a heck of a lot of people.”",
        "For example, she said osteoporosis, an actual condition in which fragile bones are more susceptible to fracture, was blown out of proportion by drug companies who overpromoted bone-strength screening tests — leading many women into drug use that only harmed them.",
        "“Companies who brought the first non-hormonal drug to market about 30 years ago wanted a larger market than just the very old who were already suffering from osteoporosis,” she said.",
        "So pharmaceutical companies invested in the mass production of what had been a research tool called DEXA (Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) and made it ubiquitous. They placed DEXA machines in primary care physicians’ offices for free, manufactured them en masse so the price would drop, funded an older women’s group to run an education campaign about the importance of screening, funded another group to run a toll-free hotline that women could call to learn of where they can get screened and funded a meeting of experts to determine which level of bone loss would be considered osteoporosis.",
        "“What they also did at that meeting, which was supported by the drug companies, was create a condition called osteopenia, which is less than normal but not osteoporosis,” she said. “Then the company started telling doctors that they should get women on these treatment drugs to prevent the development of full-blown osteoporosis.”",
        "In other words, they created osteopenia as a disease and outlined recommendations to treat healthy women with the same drug used by women with actual osteoporosis. This worked for about 20 years. Millions of women took the drug who didn’t need to with no proof that it would prevent hip fractures when they’re older.",
        "“Some of those women suffered as a result with a type of fracture that had been previously rare called ‘atypical femur fractures,’” Pearson said. These are fractures in the long bone of the thigh that cause trauma. “They created a trap with a screening test that was useful to the few, but the creation of this so-called condition of osteopenia pushed millions of women to take a drug that wound up hurting them.”",
        "Pearson called osteopenia “disease mongering plain and simple.”",
        "Tiefer said that the creation and promotion of female sexual dysfunction (FSD) is a textbook example of disease mongering. She explained that FSD assumes there’s such a thing as “Female Sexual Function,” a normal sex life regarding sex drive, sexual response, kinds of desires or preferred sexual activities. She said these qualities have far more to do with individual and cultural preferences than any sort of medical norms or health standards.",
        "“But people have been influenced by a parade of experts who wanted to create a field called ‘sexual medicine’ — an industry. And they of course were aided and abetted by the pharmaceutical industry. I think it’s both of those things together. It’s ambition on the part of a lot of health practitioners and the bottomless greed of the pharmaceutical industry,” she said.",
        "The marketing strategy behind disease mongering is to link a disease with a drug. In the face of such close brand association, it can be difficult for a new drug to break into the market, so companies have an incentive to develop diagnostic distinctions. If you alter the description slightly and come up with a new disease, you can open up an entirely new market that you can dominate.",
        "“That happened with Paxil. They had a serotonin reuptake inhibitor that was late to market, so they redefined shyness to be social anxiety disorder,” Fugh-Berman said, “Cymbalta was the drug where it was just another antidepressant, so they linked depression and pain. They didn’t really create another disease but they distinguished their antidepressant as the one you should use in your patient with depression and pain. It’s really sort of brilliant and their advertising line was “depression hurts.’”",
        "Fugh-Berman said hypoactive sexual desire disorder was invented to prepare the market for a testosterone patch, which never got approval in the U.S. But the disease stuck around. It was revived by the company that wound up selling Addyi (flibanserin).",
        "“So, the disease was already out there, having been invented by one drug company and expanded by another, which is really kind of depressing,” Fugh-Berman said.",
        "The experts agreed that medical harm from disease mongering, which ranges from temporary to fatal, constitutes a health crisis in which damages are borne almost entirely by patients — despite going largely unnoticed by them.",
        "According to James, prescription drugs are responsible for more harm than both surgery and health care-acquired infections. Though it’s difficult to measure the full extent of prescription-fueled harm, successive studies show that it has been growing.",
        "“For example, estimates of the extent of harm in the United States published by the Institutes of Medicine in 2000, which at that time were considered so shocking as to be disbelieved by some authorities, have since been consistently eclipsed by new and more detailed analyses,” James said. “Recent studies show that harm caused by prescription drugs alone exceeds that which was previously thought to represent the total of health care-related harm from all causes.”",

        "Democrats have long hoped they will win back working-class voters who backed President Donald Trump in 2016 in the midterm elections with attacks on the GOP’s tax cut plan and support for repealing Obamacare.",
        "New polling, based on a case study in a key congressional district in Maine, appears to offer proof.",
        "Clarity Campaigns, a Democratic polling firm, conducted the surveys In Maine’s 2nd Congressional District, a sprawling, heavily forested rural district that includes almost the entire state outside of Portland and its suburbs. The district, represented by Republican Congressman Bruce Poliquin, flipped from backing Barack Obama by a 9-point margin in 2012 to supporting Trump by 10 percentage points in 2016.",
        "Two Democratic groups, Not One Penny and Protect Our Care, paid for the polls. They have spent the past 10 months on a sustained campaign against Poliquin in the Bangor media market, which includes half the district, and their polling shows real damage.",
        "In a memo provided to HuffPost, Clarity Campaigns said the more voters found out about Poliquin’s votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act and to support the GOP tax bill, the less they liked him. At the beginning of the campaign, 28 percent of voters in the media market approved of Poliquin and 38 percent disapproved. By the end, his numbers were significantly weaker: Just 25 percent approved, and 45 percent disapproved.",
        "“The results in ME-02 demonstrate clearly that voters care deeply about these issues and are willing to hold members of Congress who voted for them accountable for those votes,” the pollsters wrote.",
        "The experiment reinforces the major Democratic strategy for winning back House districts where voters flipped from Obama to Trump: Focus relentlessly on unpopular GOP policies on taxes and health care, not directly on Trump’s behavior or the Russia investigation. Democrats need to win 24 seats to take back control of the House in November.",
        "In an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll released Thursday, registered voters said that health care was the most important issue in the battle for Congress. Just 39 percent of voters were comfortable or enthusiastic about a candidate who would repeal Obamacare, while 49 percent preferred one who would not. Thirty-six percent they would be more likely to support a candidate who backs Trump’s tax reform plan, while 42 percent said it would make them less likely.",
        "Not One Penny and a local group, Mainers Against Health Care Cuts, employed a variety of attack ads against Poliquin, including a spot contrasting his approach with that of Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who refused to back Republican attempts to repeal Obamacare.",
        "On tax reform, Not One Penny contrasted the treatment of the permanent corporate tax cuts included in the bill with the tax cuts aimed at the middle class, which expire after 10 years.",
        "Voters in Bangor aren’t deeply negative on the GOP tax plan: 34 percent support it, while 42 percent oppose it. But just 18 percent approve of Poliquin’s handling of the issue, while 45 percent oppose it. On health care, just 15 percent approve of Poliquin’s handling of the issue and 45 percent disapprove.",
        "Republicans nonetheless remain bullish on Poliquin’s chances at reelection. The incumbent, a former banker, has $2.8 million in the bank. Democrats competing in the June 12 Democratic primary for the right to challenge him include businessman and outdoorsman Lucas St. Clair and state Rep. Jared Golden."

        "During the recent Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, for instance, the South Korean government earmarked about $2.6 million to cover the travel expenses of members of the North’s visiting delegation, including a cheering squad, an orchestra and an art troupe, and the International Olympic Committee bankrolled the 22 athletes who represented North Korea at the games.",
        "“These norms were laid in the early 2000s, when Seoul’s so-called sunshine policy took off,” Sung-Yoon Lee, a Korea expert at Tufts University, told The Washington Post last week, referring to a rapprochement policy adopted by South Korea. “North Korea can build nukes and ICBMs, but claim they are too poor to pay for foreign travel costs.”",
        "The Post, citing two individuals familiar with talks about logistics for the summit, reported that “the prideful but cash-poor pariah state” was now looking for an outsider to pay for Kim and his entourage’s stay at the five-star Fullerton Hotel in Singapore, which the paper said is the North Korean delegation’s “preferred lodging” for next week’s meeting. A presidential suite at the five-star hotel costs more than $6,000 per night, and a regular room costs upward of $220.",

        "The U.S. is “open to covering the costs,” the Post wrote, citing the two individuals, though such a payment would require a sanctions waiver and could cause Pyongyang to lose face.",
        "U.S. officials are thus reportedly mulling whether to ask host nation Singapore to bear some of the costs ― a suggestion that the small but wealthy city-state apparently would be happy to comply with.",
        "Ng Eng Hen, Singapore’s defense minister, said on Saturday that the country was willing to pay for some of North Korea’s expenses, though he did not specify how much Singapore was willing to spend or whether it was at Washington’s urging.",

        "The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, an anti-nuclear-weapon organization, has also expressed willingness to cover North Korea’s summit-related expenses, saying over the weekend that it would gladly chip in part of the more than $1 million cash award from its 2017 Nobel Peace Prize to contribute to the landmark event.",
        "“Our movement is committed to the abolition of nuclear weapons, and we recognize that this historic summit is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to work for peace and nuclear disarmament,” ICAN official Akira Kawasaki said in a statement, according to USA Today. “The Nobel Peace Prize included a cash prize, and we are offering funds from the prize to cover the costs for the summit in order to support peace in the Korean Peninsula and a nuclear-weapon-free world.”",
        "In addition to Kim’s hotel room and other budget matters, U.S. and North Korean officials have many logistical details to hammer out before next week’s summit, reported the Times,",
        "“The two sides will be negotiating everything from the site of the meeting to which leader sits where at the table, who is allowed in the room with them, the number of meals and breaks, what to use in a toast between the two leaders (given that Mr. Trump does not drink alcohol) [and] what gifts could be exchanged,” among other issues, the paper wrote."

        "SEOUL/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - North Korea’s top three military officials have been removed from their posts, a senior U.S. official said, a move analysts said on Monday could support efforts by the North’s young leader to jump-start economic development and engage with the world.",
        "Kim Jong Un is preparing for a high-stakes summit with U.S. President Donald Trump in Singapore on June 12, the first such meeting between a North Korean leader and a sitting U.S. president.",
        "The U.S. official, who spoke on Sunday on condition of anonymity, was commenting on a report by South Korea’s Yonhap news agency that all three of the North’s top military officials were believed to have been replaced.",
        "Kim’s motivation remains unclear but analysts said the shake-up allows him and the ruling party to tighten control over the Korean People’s Army (KPA) at a critical time of international engagement and domestic development.",
        "“If Kim Jong Un is set on making peace with the U.S. and South Korea and dealing away at least part of the nuclear program, he will have to put the KPA’s influence in a box and keep it there,” said Ken Gause, director of the International Affairs Group at CNA, a non-profit research and analysis organization.",
        "“This reshuffle has brought to the fore the officers who can do just that. They are loyal to Kim Jong Un and no one else.”",
        "Trump revived the Singapore summit on Friday after cancelling it a week earlier.",
        "SOME DISSENT",
        "The United States is seeking a negotiated end to North Korea’s nuclear weapons program and U.S. officials believe there was some dissension in the military about Kim’s approaches to South Korea and the United States.",
        "Trump wants North Korea to “denuclearize”, or get rid of its nuclear arsenal, in return for relief from economic sanctions. North Korea’s leadership is believed to regard nuclear weapons as crucial to its survival, while Kim has said he plans to focus on economic development.",
        "The U.S. official did not identify the three ousted military officials.",
        "Citing an unidentified intelligence official, Yonhap said No Kwang Chol, first vice minister of the Ministry of People’s Armed Forces, had replaced Pak Yong Sik as defense chief, while Ri Myong Su was replaced by his deputy, Ri Yong Gil.",
        "North Korean state media previously confirmed that Army General Kim Su Gil had replaced Kim Jong Gak as director of the KPA’s General Political Bureau.",
        "The White House, State Department, CIA and Office of the Director of National Intelligence did not respond immediately to requests for official comment.",
        "South Korea’s unification and defense ministries declined to confirm the report, while an official at the Unification Ministry said the government was watching the North’s leadership very closely.",
        "South Korean foreign minister Kang Kyung-hwa had a 15-minute phone call with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday to discuss the upcoming summit between Kim and Trump, the foreign ministry in Seoul said.",
        "ECONOMIC FACTORS, PARTY CONTROL",
        "Given the military’s secondary role in the North’s nuclear and missile programs, the moves are likely more about installing a younger, even more trusted cohort of officials who Kim Jong Un can rely on as he confronts a variety of domestic and international issues, said Michael Madden, a North Korea expert at Johns Hopkins University’s 38 North website.",
        "“The nuclear weapons are a side issue,” he said.",
        "The moves are likely linked in part to Kim Jong Un’s drive to have the military take a bigger role in critical infrastructure projects. That could explain why newly appointed director of the KPA’s General Political Bureau, Army General Kim Su Gil, accompanied Kim Jong Un on a field guidance trip to a beach tourist zone with other officials, Madden said.",
        "Kim Jong Un is also likely expecting to receive more international economic aid and investment soon as part of the ongoing talks and he wants to prevent corruption that plagued some past projects, Madden said.",
        "All of the newly promoted officials are younger than their predecessors, including 63-year-old Ri Yong Gil, who is 21 years younger than Ri Myong Su.",
        "“This points to two things: the consolidation of Kim Jong Un’s power as the sole leader of North Korea and strengthened cooperation between the North’s party and military as the country works towards further economic development,” said Yang Moo-jin, professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul.",
        "“They’re all young but capable people,” Yang said.",
        "Lower-level U.S.-North Korean talks to prepare for the summit are continuing but have made only “halting progress”, according to a second U.S. official briefed on the discussions.",
        "That official said U.S. negotiators’ efforts to press for definitions of immediate, comprehensive, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization by North Korea had run into opposition from the White House.",
        "In a remarkable shift in tone eight days after cancelling the summit, citing Pyongyang’s “open hostility”, Trump welcomed North Korea’s former intelligence chief, Kim Yong Chol, to the White House on Friday, exchanging smiles and handshakes.",
        "Yonhap reported that Kim Yong Chol had transited Beijing on Monday on his way back to Pyongyang from the United States.",
        "All three of the new military officials have at least some experience interacting with foreign delegations, a factor that is critical as Kim seeks to line up meetings with leaders from the United States, China, Russia, and Syria.",
        "“They are shaping these guys up because there is going to be a lot of foreign interaction,” Madden said. “They know to sit there and not get too drunk at the parties ... they know how to behave themselves.”",

        "Duterte, 73, was in South Korea for an official visit to the country organized by the Overseas Filipino Workers’ organization. According to Reuters, there were over 3,000 people in the crowd, most of them Filipino workers living in South Korea.",
        "During the event, two women were called up to the stage to receive a book from the Filipino president. Both were visibly excited to meet Duterte and receive the gifts. As the two shook Duterte’s hand they brought it up to their foreheads in a sign of excitement and gratitude.",
        "As they went to exit the stage, Duterte called them back and gave one of the women a hug and peck on the cheek. The Filipino president then gestured to the second woman ― later identified as Bea Kim ― to kiss him on the lips, and the crowd responded with applause and laughter.",
        "“Are you single? You’re not separated from [your husband]? But you can tell him that this is just a joke?” Duterte asked Kim, according to Filipino news outlet Rappler.com.",
        "Kim squealed and put her hands in front of her face while looking nervous, but eventually acquiesced and gave Duterte a quick kiss on the lips.",
        "“Don’t take it seriously. It’s just for fun, a gimmick,” Duterte, who has a longtime partner and four children, told the crowd after the kiss. The Filipino president is well-known for past sexist and controversial remarks including jokes about rape and violence against women.",
        "Kim, who has lived in Seoul for seven years, is married to a South Korean man and has two children. She told the government-run Philippine News Agency that meeting Duterte was a “once in a lifetime” experience.",
        "“The kiss doesn’t mean anything except to entertain and make other Filipinos in the gathering happy. I assure you, for me and even the President, there was no malice in the kiss,” she said, according to Newsweek.",
        "Many people, including a number of women’s activists, were not happy with the public kiss from such a powerful figure.",
        "“It was a despicable display of sexism and grave abuse of authority. President Duterte acted like a feudal king who thinks that being the President is an entitlement to do anything that he pleases,” senator Risa Hontiveros said in a Monday statement.",
        "“It was not a meeting of two consenting individuals on equal terms,” she added. “Uneven power relations were clearly at play. And President Duterte took advantage of that severe power disparity.”",
        "Joms Salvador, secretary general of Filipino women’s rights organization Gabriela, denounced the kiss as the “disgusting theatrics of a misogynist President who feels entitled to demean, humiliate or disrespect women according to his whim.”",
        "“It is unfortunate that the woman found it her obligation to publicly defend the act as ‘no malice,’ when it is the President who is duty-bound to explain not only because it was upon his prodding but he is bound, as a public official, by rules of ethics to explain his unruly conduct,” Salvador wrote in a Monday statement."

        "Details, including who will attend the meal, were not released. The dinner is typically hosted by the president and first lady. Trump’s wife, Melania Trump, has not been seen publicly since May 10, leading to speculation on her whereabouts ― though a tweet from the first lady’s account Wednesday said she is at the White House.",
        "Trump, in a statement last month, sent his “greetings and best wishes to all Muslims observing Ramadan in the United States and around the world.”",
        "“Ramadan reminds us of the richness Muslims add to the religious tapestry of American life. In the United States, we are all blessed to live under a Constitution that fosters religious liberty and respects religious practice,” the statement said.",
        "Trump faced criticism last year after choosing not to host the dinner. Previous presidents, including Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, hosted the dinner.",
        "Trump and his wife last year instead released statements that acknowledged the religious days. One, released at the start of Ramadan, highlighted terrorist attacks overseas and America’s “resolve to defeat the terrorists and their perverted ideology.” That statement, which sparked public backlash, appears to have since been removed from the White House’s website.",
        "A second statement, released at the end of Ramadan, took a more positive approach.",
        "“During this holiday, we are reminded of the importance of mercy, compassion, and goodwill. With Muslims around the world, the United States renews our commitment to honor these values,” that statement said.",
        "Trump has had a fraught relationship with the Muslim community.",
        "In addition to enacting a series of travel bans that targeted mostly Muslim nations, Trump before his inauguration said he’d consider surveilling and closing down mosques in the U.S. to fight terrorism, as well as creating a national database for Muslims in the U.S. He also falsely suggested that Obama is secretly a Muslim."

        "WASHINGTON — In President Donald Trump’s world populated only with winners and losers, the on-then-off-now-on-again summit with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un has one sure winner already — and, say Korea experts, it’s not Trump.",
        "“Absolutely,” said Jenny Town, the assistant director of the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University. “It was a big win for Kim Jong Un.”",
        "Trump on Friday declared the recently canceled Singapore summit with Kim back on. “You’re going to have a very positive result in the end,” he said after a 90-minute meeting at the White House with a senior North Korean aide.",
        "But Kim scored his victory, Town said, way back on March 8, when Trump excitedly accepted Kim’s invitation to a meeting that was relayed by a top South Korean aide. Trump almost immediately changed his tone toward Kim, calling him “very honorable” not long after questioning his sanity and deriding the size and potency of his nuclear arsenal.",
        "“He’s done quite well for himself,” Town said of Kim, who reportedly had a number of top North Korean officials executed by anti-aircraft gun and his half-brother assassinated with a nerve agent in a foreign airport. “He’s really done quite a lot to rehabilitate his reputation.”",
        "Perhaps more dangerous for the U.S., Japan and particularly South Korea, Trump’s eagerness for the summit has given more leverage to Kim, who may now be in a much better position to give only token concessions in return for a meeting that puts him on par with the world’s only real superpower, Town said.",
        "“The messaging now on the summit is more ‘We have to have a summit,’” she said, adding that none of the groundwork for a meaningful deal — such as even understanding precisely how many nuclear weapons and how much nuclear material North Korea possesses — has been completed. “That’s the risk we run now, having the show for the sake of the show. This isn’t normal diplomacy.”",
        "The White House disputed that Trump is overly eager for the summit or that he is in any danger of getting played by Kim.",
        "“We continue to actively prepare for a meeting between the president and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un,” said National Security Council spokesman Robert Palladino.",
        "Trump’s lawyer and adviser Rudy Giuliani called the summit “a historic achievement” and said there was no way Trump would be taken advantage of by Kim. “No. No. No. You don’t know Donald Trump if you think that,” Giuliani said. “He has understood from the start what he wants … We’re not equal powers. And I think Trump realizes that.”",
        "Yet others close to Trump wonder if he has any understanding of that at all. They point to his fondness for holding mini press conferences with foreign leaders and his receptivity to flattery from them — and said it is possible that Trump is not aware that Kim and his father, North Korea’s previous dictator, have been trying to stage a summit with an American president for decades.",
        "One Republican adviser said on condition of anonymity that Trump knows almost nothing of the intricacies of nuclear disarmament in general or of North Korea in particular and is not interested in learning them. “He thinks that all he needs to do is get into a room with Kim for two hours, and he thinks he can get it all worked out,” the adviser said and then pointed to how much Trump enjoyed it when allies on Capitol Hill suggested he should be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his yet-to-occur summit. “The three best days of his presidency were the days he was talking about the Nobel Prize. He was loving up on that.”",
        "Trump’s statements have clearly shown how enthusiastic he is for a summit to take place, even after his May 24 letter to Kim calling off the June 12 date, said Joshua Pollack, a senior research associate at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies.",
        "“He’s eager. You could see it in his withdrawal letter. He really wanted it,” Pollack said, adding that he did not understand Trump’s fixation on June 12. “He just seems to equate the meeting with the outcome, and he doesn’t seem to care much about the process … What is so damn special about that date? I don’t know. It just creates this artificial pressure.”",
        "Trump’s continued optimistic — even boastful — comments about the summit and its outcome are often at odds with statements from North Korea and even his own staff.",
        "On May 10, deputy press secretary Raj Shah told reporters on Air Force One that North Korea promised to stop testing nuclear devices and long-range missiles and to avoid publicly criticizing planned U.S.–South Korean military exercises.",
        "Within days, North Korea criticized those joint exercises and threatened to back out of the summit — leading the United States to cancel a portion of the drills that involved B-52 bombers.",
        "Then, after Trump fired off his letter canceling the summit — but before he started saying it could be back on as scheduled — a senior White House official gave reporters a list of steps North Korea said it would take before a summit but did not complete. Among them was allowing in international observers for the much-publicized destruction of a nuclear test site.",
        "“There has been a trail of broken promises that gave the United States pause,” the official said.",
        "(Trump later became angry when a published report accurately reflected the official’s sense that a June 12 summit would not be possible at that point because of the lack of time for preparation. Trump falsely claimed the official did not exist, even though the White House staged the briefing and insisted the official’s name not be published.)",
        "On Friday, after walking Kim’s envoy, Kim Yong Chol, to his SUV on the White House driveway, Trump again praised North Korea, saying he was holding off on new sanctions because of how well things were going. He said the June 12 meeting might not accomplish an agreement — he called it a “getting to you know you plus” summit — and thus might be just the first in a series of summits with Kim Jong Un.",
        "“He really wants it,” Pollack said. “I don’t know what this summit will amount to. It looks like he just wants the damned photo op. When he agreed to this in the first place, going over his advisers’ head, it was obvious he really wanted it.”"

        "Streamline recommends “The ABC Murders” on Amazon Prime this week. Amazon debuted this new show on Feb. 1.\n\nPremise: Based on an Agatha Christie novel, this takes place in the 1930s and tells the story of a once-famous detective who longs for his glory years while spending much of his time alone. A serial killer starts to send messages to the detective, which sets off a cat-and-mouse mystery that, of course, involves murder.\n\nStars: Rupert Grint and John Malkovich.",
        "How excited should you be? Amazon doesn’t have as many British crime shows as Netflix, so adding this highly stylized detective thriller should be a welcome move for fans of that genre. Malkovich elevates everything he stars in (even with a ridiculous accent this time around) and Grint looks nothing like Grint in this role, so that’s kind of fun. Although this show wallows in grimness, clever moments of humor peek through occasionally.\n\nAny reasons to be skeptical? This show plods along at a glacial pace. During multiple scenes, I wondered if my internet had slowed down and I was watching this at half-speed. The poor direction and dialogue make this hard to get through, so you really have to love detective thrillers to find enjoyment here. Sometimes I watch shows with hourlong episodes that feel too long, but it’s hard to say what should have been cut. That’s not the case here, as the show decides to spend a laughable amount of time focusing on shots of sinks and typewriters and other uninteresting inanimate objects.",

        "The shoes, arranged in neat rows, formed an impromptu memorial for the dead as people held protest signs nearby.",

Nearly six months after a New York Times report suggested 1,052 deaths may have been linked to the hurricane, a research team led by Harvard University put the figure even higher, at 4,645.",
        "Late Friday, the Puerto Rico Department of Health released data that showed a sharp year-over-year increase in fatalities in the months after the hurricane hit. There were at least 1,400 additional deaths from September through the end of December 2017 compared to the same time period in 2016.",

The storm knocked out power to nearly the entire island, with repair efforts stretching several months, and it cut off access to clean drinking water for more than half the population. Researchers say many of the deaths resulted from inability to access medical care, particularly affecting those who were elderly or sick.",

Wes Anderson directed this and co-wrote the screenplay with Roman Coppola.\n\nThe two children run away and try to make a life for themselves together ― a very twee life. Then the adults start looking for them ― in a very twee way.\n\nAlthough the Anderson aesthetic is kind of out right now during this more hardened, ultra-cynical Donald Trump era, I still love this movie.

School superintendent Marc Gee told the outlet that the district would release a statement when it had more details about the charges.",
        "In March, multiple reports stated that Crosland fed a small, sick puppy to his classroom snapping turtle after school, while three students were present. Though the incident sparked national outrage, some locals in Preston spoke out to defend Crosland, saying feeding the very ill puppy to the snapping turtle was the right thing to do.",
        "“[The students] saw the physical state of the very young puppy,” local parent Farahlyn Hansen wrote in a Facebook post supporting Crosland, as reported by the Los Angeles Times. “It was sick, wouldn’t accept food, and was dying. All of the three kids that were there felt Robert did the humane and right thing.”",
        "Hansen, the mother of two of the three boys who were present at the feeding, told The Preston Citizen that the puppy was an orphan someone brought to Crosland.",
        "The incident, and the ensuing media attention, also ended up leading to the death of the snapping turtle. When the Idaho State Department of Agriculture learned that Crosland was keeping the snapping turtle, an invasive species for which he did not have a permit, authorities seized and killed the reptile. An ISDA statement sent to Fox 13 Salt Lake City said that the turtle was “euthanized humanely.”",
        "If Crosland is convicted, he could face up to six months in jail and a fine of up to $5,000."

So now this door for the moment is closed.”",

        "For the EU, a decision on just how far to push back will require agreement among the 28 member states that make up the world’s biggest trade bloc. Germany, by far the biggest exporter to the United States, is keen to avoid a wider trade war, especially as the Trump administration has floated the prospect of tariffs on cars. Other countries such as France favor more forceful retaliation against what they see as American bullying.",
        "EU members have so far given broad support to a European Commission plan to set duties on 2.8 billion euros ($3.4 billion) of U.S. exports. EU exports subject to U.S. duties are worth 6.4 billion euros ($7.5 billion).",
        "While the U.S. administration’s decision to hit its European and North American allies with the metals tariffs was not aimed directly at China, it also sets the background for negotiations with Beijing, where Ross was headed on Friday for talks.",
        "The Trump administration wants China to buy more American goods to lower a trade deficit. Opponents of the tariffs on European and North American metals say it is hurting allies when it needs them most to help put pressure on Beijing.",
        "“All countries, especially the major economies, should resolutely oppose all forms of trade and investment protectionism,” China’s foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a media briefing, when asked about the U.S. move.",
        "Malmstrom said China’s over-production was to blame for the glut of steel that prompted the U.S. action against its allies. She also announced a case against China at the WTO over the alleged infringement of intellectual property rights, saying the action simultaneous with its case against the United States showed that the EU was being evenhanded.",

        "Socialist party head Sanchez becomes Spain’s seventh Prime Minister since its return to democracy in the late 1970s following the dictatorship of Francisco Franco.",
        "But Rajoy’s departure after six years in office casts one of the European Union’s top four economies into an uncertain political landscape, just as another - Italy - pulled back from early elections.\n\nSanchez won Friday’s no-confidence motion with 180 votes in favor, 169 against and 1 abstention.\n\nHe suggested on Thursday he would try to govern until the scheduled end of the parliamentary term in mid-2020. But it is unclear how long his administration, with only 84 Socialist deputies in the 350-member legislative assembly, can last.\n\nWith most Spanish parties and Sanchez himself being pro-European, investors however see a less broad political risk there than in Italy.\n\nAnti-establishment parties in Rome revived coalition plans on Thursday, ending three months of turmoil by announcing a government that promises to increase spending, challenge European Union fiscal rules and crackdown on immigration.\n\n“We’ve had a rude awakening of European political risks this week... but the situation in Spain is very different from Italy,” said Michael Metcalfe, head of global macro strategy, State Street Global Markets.\n\n“The parties leading in the polls in Spain are centrists so we’re not getting the proposals for fiscal extremes as we have in Italy.”",
        "Many observers said Sanchez was in any case unlikely to call any vote until after European, local and regional elections take place in May next year.",
        "He has already committed to respecting a budget passed by Rajoy, and the fragmented parliament means Sanchez will find it hard to row back on structural reforms passed by his predecessor, including new labor laws and cuts in healthcare and education.",
        "Leftist Podemos, which will offer parliamentary support to Sanchez’s government, is also unlikely to gain big influence over the new Prime Minister, who is keen to differentiate his Socialist party from its anti-austerity ally and win back centrist voters.",
        "Rajoy had conceded defeat prior to the no-confidence vote, earlier telling deputies: “Mr Sanchez will be the head of the government and let me be the first to congratulate him.”",
        "Rajoy’s position had become increasingly untenable, undermined by his status as head of a corruption-tinged minority government as well as a divisive independence drive in the wealthy region of Catalonia.",
        "The Basque Nationalist Party, whose five seats were key to Sanchez securing enough parliamentary backing, withdrew support from Rajoy after dozens of people linked to his center-right People’s Party (PP) were sentenced to decades in jail in a corruption trial.",
        "Two Catalan pro-independence parties as well as Podemos also backed Sanchez. Market-friendly Ciudadanos, leading in the national opinion polls, was the only major party that supported Rajoy.",
        "Sanchez, who is expected to be sworn in by Monday and appoint his cabinet next week, has promised to start talks with the Catalans but said he will not give them an independence referendum."

        "Sesame Workshop, formerly the Children’s Television Workshop, sued Happytime producer STX last week, arguing that the trailer and tagline infringes on its trademark. Sesame Workshop also complained that the film depicted “explicit, profane, drug-using, misogynistic, violent, copulating and even ejaculating puppets” which could damage the organization’s wholesome brand, The Associated Press reported.",
        "“Sesame seeks to enjoin Defendants’ deliberate effort to appropriate its SESAME STREET mark, and its trusted brand and goodwill, to promote their R-rated movie ... by way of a violent and sexually-explicit trailer,” the lawsuit stated.",
        "But Manhattan federal judge Vernon Broderick ruled on Wednesday that the intention of the tagline was to differentiate “The Happytime Murders” from “Sesame Street.“ Broderick said Sesame Workshop failed to demonstrate that would-be moviegoers were confused or that parents or sponsors were offended.",
        "Brian Henson, son of puppeteer and “The Muppets” creator Jim Henson, directed the raunchy murder mystery, People reported. Daughter Lisa Henson is the film’s executive producer. Henson died in 1990. The rights to “The Muppets” characters were acquired in 2004 by Disney.",
        "“We fluffing love ‘Sesame Street’ and we’re obviously very pleased that the ruling reinforced what STX’s intention was from the very beginning ― to honor the heritage of The Jim Henson Company’s previous award-winning creations while drawing a clear distinction between any Muppets or ’Sesame Street’ characters and the new world Brian Henson and team created,” STX said in statement.",
        "Although the judge denied a temporary restraining order against film’s marketing campaign, he told the parties to meet and suggest next steps for the case at a hearing next week.",
        "Here’s the trailer for the movie that’s coming out August 17. Warning: It features graphic language, sexual scenarios and violence against puppets."

        "Russia has tried on several occasions to issue warrants for Browder in the past to no avail. He’s on the country’s blacklist for exposing a $230 million Kremlin tax fraud scam involving Hermitage Capital Management, the company he started in Moscow in the 1990s.",
        "Browder turned to activism once Sergei Magnitsky, the lawyer who worked with him to uncover the corruption scandal, was killed in a Russian prison. Browder successfully lobbied Congress to pass the Magnitsky Act in 2012, which imposes sanctions on Russian individuals believed to be implicated in Magnitsky’s murder. Several countries including Canada and the UK have since followed suit, introducing legislation for their own Magnitsky Acts.",

        "White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed that Kim Yong Chol, 72, would be meeting with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in New York, making Kim the highest-ranking North Korean official to visit the U.S. since 2000 when Jo Myong Rok, the late vice marshal, met with then-President Bill Clinton in Washington.",
        "Here’s what you need to know about Kim and his upcoming visit:",
        "He’s played a key role in recent denuclearization negotiations and other major diplomatic events.\n\nKim, a vice chairman of the ruling Workers’ Party, was among a small and select group of North Korean officials who accompanied Kim Jong Un to the Demilitarized Zone dividing the Korean peninsula to meet twice with South Korean President Moon Jae In.\n\nOften referred to as the North Korean leader’s “right-hand man,” he was also at Kim Jong Un’s side during recent meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping, and to welcome Pompeo to Pyongyang during the U.S. official’s two trips to the North Korean capital.\n\nIn February, Kim, a four-star general and former spy chief, was part of the North Korean delegation at the closing ceremony of the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. He was pictured sitting behind Ivanka Trump, though the pair reportedly did not exchange so much as a greeting during the event.",
        "North Korea experts said Kim’s visit to New York bodes well for the North Korea-U.S. summit, which had been scheduled to take place in Singapore in June before President Trump abruptly cancelled the meeting last week.\n\n“He is probably one of the most up-to-date North Korean officials about what North Korea’s requirements are for the summit,” Catherine Dill, a senior research associate at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, told CNN of Kim.\n\n“I think it’s a pretty big deal and to me this raises whatever the estimates were of the summit actually occurring,” she said.",
        "Kim has been described as the “ultimate regime insider.”",
        "Kim, despite sharing the same last name, is not related to the family that’s ruled North Korea since 1945; but his connection to the Kim dynasty still runs deep.",
        "One of the longest-serving officials in the Kim regime, he’s served all three of its leaders ― first as a border guard at the DMZ and then as a liaison officer with the United Nations. In 2006 and 2008, he rose to prominence as Pyongyang’s chief military negotiator during talks with South Korea, reported BBC.",
        "In 2009, Kim was appointed the director of the General Reconnaissance Bureau (RGB), North Korea’s intelligence service. He was promoted to four-star general a few years later.",
        "Kim left the RGB in 2016 and took charge of the United Front Department, an arm of the Workers’ Party that handles inter-Korean affairs.",
        "“He wears several hats,” Duyeon Kim, a visiting senior research fellow at the Korean Peninsula Future Forum think tank, told The Guardian. “He is extremely well-versed in denuclearization matters, and seems to have secured himself a spot in Kim Jong Un’s inner circle.”",
        "He’s been linked to the torpedoing of a South Korean vessel and a hacking attack against Sony.",
        "While Kim was the head of the RGB, he was accused of masterminding attacks on the South Korean warship Cheonan in 2010. Forty-six South Korean sailors were killed in the attack. Pyongyang has denied any involvement in the torpedoing of the vessel.",
        "Kim was also linked to a cyber-attack on Sony Pictures in 2014, aimed at blocking the release of “The Interview,” a comedic film about the assassination of Kim Jong Un by two American journalists.",
        "To travel to the U.S., Kim had to be given a waiver from travel sanctions.",
        "Kim, who’s been sanctioned by Washington, is prohibited from traveling to the United States.",
        "A waiver will need to be granted for him to enter the U.S., an American diplomat told The New York Times this week. It’s likely, however, that “one would automatically be given under extraordinary circumstances like these,” the paper said."

        "At least 13 people in the Indian state of Kerala have died from the Nipah virus in the recent outbreak. On Monday, The Hindu newspaper reported that a patient with Nipah-like symptoms was under observation in a hospital in Goa, a state in western India. If diagnosed with the disease, the patient — reportedly a 20-year-old man who’d traveled to Goa from Kerala — could be the first case of Nipah infection outside Kerala since the recent outbreak began earlier this month.",
        "The Nipah virus, which was first identified in 1999 after an outbreak in Malaysia and Singapore, is a disease thought to be transmitted by bats, pigs or other animals to humans. The virus, which has a mortality rate of up to 70 percent, can cause encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain, as well as severe respiratory symptoms, according to the World Health Organization. There is currently no cure or vaccine for Nipah, though research into a possible vaccine is reportedly underway.",
        "The current outbreak is believed to have originated with a family living in the coastal Kerala city of Kozhikode. India’s Ministry of Health and Family Welfare said last week that public health workers had found several bats in a water well that had been used by three family members who died after contracting the Nipah virus. The Times of India reported, however, that samples taken from the bats tested negative for the virus.",
        "Health officials said this week that they would ramp up testing of other animal samples from the region in an effort to pin down the origins of the current outbreak. Officials said they were particularly keen to test samples from fruit-eating bats, which are known carriers of the disease. The Times of India said the bats in the well were insect-eating bats, which are not known carriers.",
        "Reuters reported Monday that a 26-year-old rickshaw driver from Kozhikode was the latest Nipah virus victim.",
        "Last week, a nurse who treated Nipah victims perished from the disease.",
        "“I think I am almost on my way. I may not be able to see you again. Sorry,” Lini Puthusheri wrote to her husband from her hospital bed, according to the Associated Press. “Take care of our children.”",
        "According to the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, people can be infected with the Nipah virus after direct contact with patients of the disease. “This is most commonly seen in the family and caregivers of Nipah virus-infected patients,” the CDC said.",
        "The Nipah virus was listed this year on the WHO’s priority list of emerging diseases that could cause a global health emergency. Ebola and Zika were also on the 2018 list, which the WHO said identifies diseases that “pose a public health risk because of their epidemic potential and for which there are no, or insufficient, countermeasures.”",
        "Stanford epidemiologist and Nipah expert Stephen Luby said recently that Nipah could conceivably become a “global pandemic threat” if there emerged a strain of the disease that could efficiently be transmitted from person to person.",
        "“It is conceivable that there is currently a strain of Nipah virus circulating among bats that, if it infected people, would efficiently transmit from person to person,” Luby told the Stanford Report, though noting that “so far, we have not identified such a strain.”",
        "“Characteristics that might increase the risk of person-to-person transmission would be a virus that has a stronger tendency to move to the respiratory tract in high numbers,” he said. “It is conceivable that the virus could acquire a mutation that would enhance this capacity. One concern is that anytime a virus infects a human, it is in an environment that selects for survival in that context.”"

        "“I don’t think it was a slide. I think it was just a matter of the tree root system had failed,” Tennant said. He estimated that the tree was about 3 feet in diameter.",
        "Tennant said that he and McCormick had ended their interview by telling each other to stay safe.",
        "McCormick had been employed by WYFF since April 2007, when he joined the Spartanburg newsroom. In 2014, he became the anchor of the station’s 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. broadcasts on Sundays, the news outlet said. Smeltzer joined WYFF’s Spartanburg bureau as a photographer in February.",
        "North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper issued a statement urging residents to be cautious in the severe weather conditions. He also expressed his condolences about the deaths of McCormick and Smeltzer.",
        "“Two journalists working to keep the public informed about this storm have tragically lost their lives, and we mourn with their families, friends and colleagues,” Cooper said.",
        "WYFF anchors also voiced their grief over the journalists’ deaths.",
        "“Mike and Aaron were beloved members of our team, our family,” Carol Goldsmith said on the station’s 6 p.m. newscast.",
        "“All of us here at WYFF 4 are grieving,” Michael Cogdill added. “We are a family. And you, our extended family, we thank you for your comfort as we mourn and as we seek to comfort the families.”"

        "Flight MH370, carrying 239 people, vanished enroute from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, 2014, becoming one of the world’s greatest aviation mysteries.",
        "The government of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said last week that U.S. seabed exploration firm Ocean Infinity, which had scoured the southern Indian Ocean for the aircraft since January, would end its hunt on Tuesday.",
        "The previous administration of Najib Razak, who was defeated in a stunning election upset on May 9, had promised up to $70 million to the Texas-based firm if it found the plane within 90 days.",
        "Malaysia’s transport minister, Anthony Loke, said a full report into MH370′s disappearance would be published in the near future, but he did not give a date.",
        "“I can assure you the final report will be published with full disclosure. There will not be any edits, or anything hidden,” he told reporters late on Monday.",
        "Asked whether the report would refer to controversial elements of the MH370 case, he said: “To me, whatever elements, we will just publish it”.",
        "Last year, Australian authorities said the MH370 captain had flown a route on his home simulator six weeks before the disappearance that was “initially similar” to the course actually taken by the aircraft.",

        "This was despite investigators calling for the target area to be extended north by 9,653 square miles.",
        "Ocean Infinity CEO Oliver Plunkett said on Tuesday their team had searched more than 43,243 square miles of ocean floor in a little over three months.",
        "While the outcome was “extremely disappointing”, Plunkett hoped the company would be able to offer its services again in a future search for the airliner.",
        "Asked if China would consider further funding for the search, or whether search organizations had asked China for more resources, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said China had always maintained close communication with the relevant parties.",
        "“We will continue to maintain communication with relevant parties,” Hua Chunying told a regular news briefing in Beijing.",
        "Voice 370, a group representing the relatives of those aboard the flight, has pressed the new Malaysian government to review all matters related to MH370, including “any possible falsification or elimination of records related to MH370 and its maintenance”.",
        "Calvin Shim, whose wife was a crew member on the plane, said he was concerned that the accident report would not include key information such as the plane’s full cargo manifest and the results of a separate investigation by Malaysian police.",

        "It would only resume if there was “credible evidence which identifies a specific location of the missing aircraft.”",
        "“We will always remain hopeful that one day the aircraft will be located,” McCormack’s office said in a statement.",
        "The only confirmed traces of the plane have been three wing fragments found washed up on Indian Ocean coasts."

        "Magma has drained from Kilauea’s summit lava lake and flowed around 25 miles (40 km) east underground, bursting out of about two dozen giant cracks or fissures near the plant.",
        "“The flow from fissures 21 and 7 was widening and advancing,” Janet Snyder, a spokeswoman for the County of Hawaii, said in an email on the position of lava heading northeast toward PGV at 12:30 p.m. (6:00 p.m. ET)",
        "Hawaii Governor David Ige has said the wells are stable.",
        "But lava has never engulfed a geothermal plant anywhere in the world and the potential threat is untested, according to the head of the state’s emergency management agency. Local residents fear an explosive emission of deadly hydrogen sulfide and other gases should wells be ruptured.",

        "Residents have complained of health hazards from emissions from the plant since it went online in 1989 and PGV has been the target of lawsuits challenging its location on the flank of one of the world’s most active volcanoes.",

        "DENTON, Texas ― Amanda Painter sat at the kitchen table in an unfamiliar apartment with an absurd dilemma: She had nothing to wear to a vigil for her three dead children.",
        "Her clothes were at home, but her home was now a crime scene.",
        "Less than 100 hours after her children were murdered, Amanda, 29, found herself in a Walmart, hobbling down the aisles, the gunshot wound to her neck concealed by a gauze bandage. She found a suitable purple shirt and kept her head down. She hadn’t expected to see so many children at the store, laughing and playing. For eight years, Amanda answered to “Mommy.” Now, her babies ― Odin, 8, Caydence, 6, and Drake, 4 ― were gone. Each time she closed her eyes, even to blink, they returned.",
        "Last week, Amanda’s ex-husband, Justin Painter, 39, entered her home in Ponder, Texas, and fatally shot her boyfriend, Seth Richardson, 29, her three children and then himself. He intentionally kept Amanda alive, he told her, to live with the pain.",
        "It was an unthinkable tragedy.",
        "Two days later another unthinkable tragedy occurred, more than 300 miles away. A student opened fire in a high school in Santa Fe, killing 10. Both events were mass shootings ― that is, they each involved at least four fatalities ― and both were in Texas.",
        "There’s no place worse than Texas when it comes to mass shootings. Since 2009, the state has experienced 20 incidents, the most of any state. In 65 percent of cases, the victims included a romantic partner or family member of the shooter, just like what happened to Amanda.",
        "Yet most people only hear about the school shootings ― and not Amanda’s story.",
        "When HuffPost interviewed Amanda, she had just been released from the hospital and was settling into an apartment 20 minutes away from her home, provided by the local domestic violence organization, Denton County Friends of the Family. Advocates stocked the apartment with comfort food, flowers, bath bombs and toiletries, and scribbled inspirational messages on the mirrors. “We are here for you!” someone had written in dry-erase marker. “This is a place to heal and feel safe.”",
        "Amanda was visibly in pain, and moved slowly around the apartment, wincing.",
        "She’d been asleep in bed with her boyfriend when her ex-husband showed up that morning. Seth was lying next to her, his arm wrapped around her body, his stomach pressed into her back, when Justin came in and shot Seth in the head. The bullet went through Seth’s body and into Amanda’s, fracturing her neck and breaking her ribs. Her physical injuries were nothing, she said, compared to her emotional pain. In conversation, Amanda would appear composed for a minute, sometimes two, but then her face crumpled, contorted by grief.",
        "“Your life can always get worse,” she said, breaking down. “I don’t think mine can get any lower. Somehow, I’m still fucking standing, and I’m going to keep going, and I don’t know how, but I’m going to keep going.”",
        "Everyone kept asking her what she needed, she said. The only thing she needed she couldn’t have.",
        "“My kids were my coping mechanism, and now they are gone,” Amanda said. “He knew when he took them from me, he took everything. He’s won.”",
        "The relationship",
        "Amanda met Justin online when she was 17. They both played “World of Warcraft.” Her username was Amarella; he was Torak. She lived in Richmond, Virginia, and he lived in Tulsa, Oklahoma. They chatted on the internet for a year, getting to know each other’s stories.",
        "Amanda’s was complicated: Her mother struggled with drug addiction, and Amanda and her identical twin sister, Ashley, were frequently uprooted as kids, bouncing from school to school.",
        "Justin offered stability, and a chance at a fresh start. He was 10 years older and had a job at a Walmart distribution center in Oklahoma. When she was 19, he drove to Virginia to pick her up and bring her home with him. It was the first time they’d met in person.",
        "Once they were in Oklahoma, Amanda recalled, it seemed like Justin wanted her to stay indoors and only play video games. Within a few months, she was stir-crazy. She planned a trip back to Virginia to see her family. While there, she discovered she was pregnant. She didn’t really want to go back to Oklahoma, she said, because she already harbored concerns about the relationship. But she also worried about being a single mother. She had grown up in poverty, and she didn’t want that for her baby.",
        "Without much choice, she went back to Oklahoma to be with Justin. Her son Odin was born in 2009. Caydence came next, in 2012. They moved to Texas to be closer to Justin’s family. Then came Drake, in 2013.",
        "During their nine-year relationship, Justin was not physically abusive toward her, Amanda said, but sometimes she felt afraid of him. When he was angry, he would slam things ― the television remote, his computer chair. She said he was controlling, especially when it came to family finances. She was not given a debit card until after Caydence was born. Before that, every time she needed anything ― diapers, milk, gas for the car ― she had to ask for cash.",
        "Amanda said she often felt depressed. Every so often, she said, she would tell Justin she wasn’t happy and he’d beg her to stay, saying he couldn’t live without her.",
        "She said he also threatened that if she did leave, she’d lose the kids.",
        "“It’s not a huge surprise to me that there wasn’t a lot of physical violence, because it wasn’t necessary,” said Donna Bloom, director of legal services at Denton County Friends of the Family and one of the advocates who stayed with Amanda in the days after the shooting. Physical violence, she said, is just one of many tools people use to control their partners.",
        "“Amanda is a pretty compliant person, so it didn’t have to escalate to physical violence,” Bloom said. “He could use these other tools to achieve the same objective, which is to be in control.”",
        "The separation and the gun",
        "Last year, Amanda finally decided to leave Justin. She was about to turn 28 and felt a growing sense of independence, thanks to a new job. “I thought, if I’m going to take care of the children and work full-time and take care of the house, I just need to get out,” she said.",
        "On April 21, 2017, she told Justin she wanted to try separating, and that she was going to move in with a friend. That night, she said, she and Justin went to sleep together, but in the morning, he wasn’t in bed. She found him in another room, crying. She said he told her that while she was asleep, he had gotten out his gun, loaded it and planned to kill himself.",
        "Scared for the safety of her children, Amanda decided to leave right away. Justin grew angry, she said, and starting throwing things, breaking their flat-screen television over his knees. She buckled the kids in the car and went back in the house to get the gun. It was still loaded, she said. She put it in the trunk.",
        "“I took it because I was afraid he was going to shoot himself,” Amanda said.",
        "She wasn’t the only one who was worried. According to a police report obtained by HuffPost, Justin’s stepfather called 911 that morning to request a welfare check on his son, and an ambulance was called. Police confirmed to HuffPost that Justin was voluntarily admitted into a mental health facility.",
        "While he was seeking medical help, Amanda moved out with the kids. When he returned home, she said, they both took turns caring for the children. Her shifts at a nursing home were unpredictable, and she needed his parenting support. Still, she was surprised when he filed for divorce that summer. He fought for primary custody, and got it.",
        "“I didn’t have any money,” Amanda said. She went to court without a lawyer.",
        "Amanda was granted visitation with her children every other weekend. This worked out for a while, she said. Their relationship grew amicable. Sometimes Justin came over for dinner. Other times, they did stuff with the kids together.",
        "But there was one point of contention: the gun.",
        "Earlier this year, Amanda recalls, Justin’s family asked her to return his gun. Amanda didn’t want to give it back, she said, but she felt like she had no choice. Justin told her she could get in trouble for allegedly stealing it. So she reluctantly gave it back to Justin’s family, she said. At some point, Amanda believes, they returned it to him.",
        "It was the same gun he brought to her house and used to kill her children, police confirmed to HuffPost.",
        "Justin’s family did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.",
        "The incident",
        "On the evening of May 15, Amanda and Justin took the kids out for pizza. During the car ride, Amanda told Justin about her new boyfriend, that it was serious and he was planning to move in with her.",
        "For the past few months, Amanda had been in a long-distance relationship with Seth Richardson, whom she knew from her teen years. They, too, had met through “World of Warcraft,” and had kept in touch for a decade.",
        "“We just had this bond, it never left,” Amanda said. “There was so much positivity when we were together.”",
        "Seth lived in South Carolina, and had recently decided to move to Texas for Amanda. They hoped to start a family together. At the time she broke the news to Justin, Seth was already on the road, making the 19-hour drive to Texas.",
        "Justin’s face fell, Amanda said. Even though they’d been separated a year, he was still holding out hope for reconciliation.",
        "“I saw him fall apart,” she said. “He kept saying, ‘I’m trying to love you, I’m trying to change.’”",
        "He started driving erratically, she said, and screamed at her and the kids. When they got back to her house, she had to plead with him to allow the kids to stay for dinner. She promised to bring them back to his house afterward.",
        "Amanda and her kids ate pizza on her bed (pepperoni for Odin and Caydence; black olive, sausage and mushroom for Drake; onion for her) and watched the movie “Atlantis.” They cuddled. After dinner, Amanda drove them back to Justin’s house, and gave each of them a goodnight kiss. She watched them file inside.",
        "Once she got home, she fell asleep. Around 6:30 the next morning, she got a call from Seth. He had finally arrived at her house.",
        "“I didn’t even hang up the phone. I threw it on the bed and ran outside,” she recalled. “I hugged him and kissed his neck and hugged him and hugged him. I was just so excited he was there. It meant our life was about to start.”",
        "Seth was exhausted from driving, and they soon fell asleep together, spooning on her bed. They didn’t rest long. Some time around 8 a.m., Amanda woke to a loud bang next to her head.",
        "It was unlike anything she’d ever heard, and her back was alight with searing pain. Her ears rang and she was paralyzed with confusion. Then she heard more bangs.",
        "“Seth!” she screamed. “Seth!”",
        "Moments passed ― minutes? Seconds? Time collapsed for Amanda. Then she heard a voice in the doorway. It was Justin.",
        "“Seth’s dead. The kids are dead. And you’re going to have to live with it,” she recalls him saying.",
        "He shot himself in front of her.",
        "She managed to turn herself over, and saw Seth lying beside her. He was shot.",
        "Amanda grabbed her phone and dialed 911, stumbling into the living room. She prayed that Justin was bluffing about the children, trying to scare her. Then she saw a shoe lying on the ground. A little leg. Closer, and she could see all three children, shot to death.",
        "Neighbors said they saw Justin arrive at the house Wednesday morning with the children and bring them into the home.",
        "Amanda collapsed on the ground. For some reason, her arms weren’t working. She wanted to pick up her children, but she couldn’t. “I thought my body was breaking down because of my mental state,” she said.",
        "In reality, she had been shot. When Justin shot Seth, who was asleep cuddling her, the bullet went through him and into her body.",
        "The ambulance arrived to take her to the hospital, but she didn’t want to go. She didn’t want to leave her children behind. Later, a female detective told her that the first responders all made a pact ― they would not let the children ride in the same vehicle as their deceased father, the man who stole their lives.",
        "While in the hospital, Amanda posted a series of emotional videos on her Facebook page, explaining what had happened. She felt a desperate urge to share, to unload her grief for others to see and reckon with. But it backfired. In the comments, she said, people were blaming her for what happened.",
        "Why? Because she left.",
        "The vigil",
        "It was a bright, clear evening at Parkview Elementary School in Fort Worth, where Odin had been in second grade and Caydence was in kindergarten. At 4, Drake was still in day care, but he’d been looking forward to attending the school when he was old enough, like his big sister and brother.",
        "Around 100 people gathered to mourn. Parents held on to their children tightly. The crowd was quiet, save for the sounds of sniffles and subdued crying. In front of the school, people left offerings of teddy bears and bouquets of flowers.",
        "Amanda sat near the back, on a stone bench, flanked by her twin sister. Her face was pained. She cried, on and off, and listened as student after student took the microphone to offer a memory of her children.",
        "“Odin always used to hit my head with his locker accidentally because he had the locker above me.”",
        "“Caydence used to play with me at recess.”",
        "“Whenever I was on the lonely bench, Odin would ask if I wanted to play with him.”",
        "“He was always happy. I never saw him not be happy. He always had a big smile on his face.”",
        "Afterward, each child was handed a helium balloon to write a message on and send up to heaven ― up to their friends. One balloon popped loudly next to Amanda and she startled, jumping up and retreating tearfully to the parking lot.",
        "It sounded too much like a gunshot.",
        "Once the balloons were up in the air, fading into the night sky, she came back.",
        "She sang “Amazing Grace” along with the crowd, and held a flickering white candle. The program was over, and people started to disperse, gathering up their families and walking to their cars.",
        "Amanda stood alone. And then, one by one, children began to approach, lining up to see her. They hugged her legs, squeezed her chest, kissed her cheek. They knew what she needed.",
        "Need help? In the U.S., call 1-800-799-SAFE (7233) for the National Domestic Violence Hotline."

        "Streamline recommends “The ABC Murders” on Amazon Prime this week. Amazon debuted this new show on Feb. 1.\n\nPremise: Based on an Agatha Christie novel, this takes place in the 1930s and tells the story of a once-famous detective who longs for his glory years while spending much of his time alone. A serial killer starts to send messages to the detective, which sets off a cat-and-mouse mystery that, of course, involves murder.\n\nStars: Rupert Grint and John Malkovich.",
        "How excited should you be? Amazon doesn’t have as many British crime shows as Netflix, so adding this highly stylized detective thriller should be a welcome move for fans of that genre. Malkovich elevates everything he stars in (even with a ridiculous accent this time around) and Grint looks nothing like Grint in this role, so that’s kind of fun. Although this show wallows in grimness, clever moments of humor peek through occasionally.\n\nAny reasons to be skeptical? This show plods along at a glacial pace. During multiple scenes, I wondered if my internet had slowed down and I was watching this at half-speed. The poor direction and dialogue make this hard to get through, so you really have to love detective thrillers to find enjoyment here. Sometimes I watch shows with hourlong episodes that feel too long, but it’s hard to say what should have been cut. That’s not the case here, as the show decides to spend a laughable amount of time focusing on shots of sinks and typewriters and other uninteresting inanimate objects.",

        "date": "2018-05-26"
    },
    "articleContent": [
        "NEGUAC, Canada ― When the harbors aren’t frozen, Maxime Daigle and his older brother Jean-Francois often take to the cold waters off New Brunswick in one of their family’s flat-bottomed boats to harvest oysters. The siblings are among hundreds of producers along this rocky coast who grow oysters for La Maison BeauSoleil in the company’s distinctive floating bags.",
        "For the Daigles this is a family business. Maxime’s father, Maurice, co-owns La Maison BeauSoleil, an oyster grower, packer and distributor that he runs with his business partner, Amédée Savoie, whose son, Allain Savoie, also works in the company.",
        "When the business started growing and selling oysters from the coastal village of Neguac, at the southern end of the Acadian Peninsula, each wooden box was painstakingly packed by hand.",
        "That was 18 years ago. La Maison BeauSoleil ― called simply BeauSoleil within the seafood business ― has since become Canada’s largest producer of cocktail-sized oysters. Demand for its tasty, teardrop-shaped product is at an all-time high. While the company is working hard to keep up, business as usual isn’t cutting it.",
        "So a new generation of robots is coming.",
        "While details are still closely guarded, the company is developing a state-of-the-art automated sorting and packing line that will revolutionize its business. Software-controlled robots, able to mimic the small, complicated movements of human oyster pickers, will give the company a new competitive edge, says Savoie, and allow them to double production.",
        "This is the type of investment and technology that has often been missing from this country’s traditional fishing economy. Many of Atlantic Canada’s rural coastal communities have been treading water since overfishing caused cod to collapse in the 1990s, and falling further behind could signal the end for the region’s historic way of life.",
        "But this is a family business, and the co-owners are trying to build a legacy for their children in this remote region.",
        "According to a recent report from Ryerson University’s Brookfield Institute, 62 percent of resource-sector jobs, including those in the fisheries, are vulnerable to automation. While profoundly needed by most production-oriented industries, that isn’t always a good news story in a small town like Neguac, says Creig Lamb, a study co-author.",
        "“There’s an understanding that automation is happening and you either adapt or perish,” he says. “The danger is that the people who either don’t want to or can’t acquire the new skills that are required, they’re the most vulnerable.”",
        "Helping these workers, like BeauSoleil’s oyster packers, can be a major challenge, he says. But while many fear losing jobs to technological change, many industry observers ― including the Daigles and Savoies ― say a revolution can’t come soon enough.",
        "Creepy Robots",
        "Shellfish is not an easy sector to automate, particularly in a region like New Brunswick where fisheries harvest a hugely diverse range of species. While the same robot can be used to manufacture different types of cars or computers, for example, the physical differences between a crab and a lobster, or a shrimp and a scallop, mean the processing equipment needed is often radically different.",
        "But innovation is happening. A few years ago, a short, slightly grainy video with the creepy vibe of a horror film was quietly posted online by a mechanical engineer. The video shows a robot methodically picking up a leggy snow crab by its central shell and depositing it into a clamp. With eerie precision, a round, spinning blade descends and rapidly dismembers the animal’s leg sections from its body.",
        "That robot is now in commercial testing. It was developed by the St. John’s, Newfoundland-based Canadian Centre for Fisheries Innovation, a nonprofit organization owned by Memorial University. Managing Director Robert Verge says this type of device has been badly needed by processors in the region for a long time.",
        "Another issue the shellfish industry faces is the seasonality of Canada’s fisheries. A million-dollar robot doesn’t provide great return on investment if it’s only used a couple of months a year.",
        "In coastal New Brunswick, like many rural Atlantic communities long kept afloat by seasonal employment in fish processing plants or on boats, demographics are becoming increasingly dire. Young people “vote with their feet,” as Verge says, by moving west and to more urban communities. The workforce is plummeting as demand for Canadian seafood spikes. Between 2011 and 2016, the region saw the biggest decline in the proportion of people aged 15 to 64 since 1871, according to Statistics Canada, and the largest increase in the proportion of seniors.",
        "This sounds familiar to BeauSoleil’s Savoie, who says fish plant work often requires long days and physically demanding, repetitive tasks. Right now, two of his best oyster packers are over 60 years old.",
        "“[They] have all said to their children, ‘Don’t do what we do, go for something else,’ and I don’t blame them,” he says. He’s concerned about finding enough workers, as well as competition on price and consistency from overseas producers.",
        "“If industry doesn’t [adapt] in the next 10 years, there’ll be bigger problems,” Savoie says.",
        "Anything You Can Do, It Can Do Better (Maybe)",
        "Back when BeauSoleil first hit the North American market, oysters were typically sold by weight, so number counts didn’t matter. But as the company made a name selling its bite-sized, individually priced oysters into a seemingly insatiable market, the importance of getting the right number in each box became increasingly important. It invested in cutting-edge optical sorting machines from France in 2005 and was the first Canadian company to adapt the technology for use with oysters.",
        "In 2004, the company sold 25 tons of oysters; in 2017, it sold 800 tons. The company currently employs about 50 people, says Savoie, and spends the equivalent of about $776,000 on wages every year. Without new so-called “pick and place” automation on its processing line, capable of packing boxes like a human worker, they’re at the point where growth is nearly impossible.",
        "Plus, robots don’t make errors the way humans often do. “Human beings aren’t able to judge [precise measurements] perfectly,” software developer Michel Caissie says in French. He owns Infraprotech, the company contracted by BeauSoleil to program its new robots.",
        "Three years ago, when this project with BeauSoleil started, Caissie’s devices identified a whopping 29 individual human movements in the packing process, including picking an oyster up, measuring it, looking at it and eventually placing it in the box.",
        "“Just to pick one oyster takes three-quarters of a second,” Savoie says. “That times 12 million oysters [the number they ship each year] ― that’s a lot of time.”",
        "Then there’s the cost to human bodies. Automating the simplest, yet most straining tasks done by humans can dramatically reduce risk of workplace injury, says Caissie, whose software calculates where the most acute dangers are.",
        "“We can’t continue working this way. The process isn’t adapted to human beings,” Caissie says. “That’s why people don’t like this work.”",
        "Still, robots are fallible, and Savoie has been careful to build in workstations where humans can still pack boxes of oysters ― just in case the robots break down.",
        "Not A Fear Of Change; Fear Of Loss Of Control",
        "At a recent international seafood show in Boston, BeauSoleil bought a $7,000 waterproof remotely operated vehicle that can be used to locate oyster bags sunk to the ocean bottom for winter storage and help the company drill more accurately into the rocky seabed.",
        "Maxime Daigle used it a couple of weeks ago and was thrilled to discover a cache of oysters that had drifted away from its GPS marker. He’s excited by the potential that technological advances, including automation, have for his industry.",
        "“I think it makes my job way more interesting. When you’re sorting oysters by hand it’s the most boring thing,” he says. “With automation it goes by way faster, you’re able to focus on other things. It makes my job a bit more specialized.”",
        "Currently the company’s youngest employee at 26, Daigle says it’s important for the company to be able to supply the demand for its product.",
        "“You want to be able to face the future,” he says. “Particularly with the population of labor here in New Brunswick, which is dying a bit.”",
        "Automation definitely scares some members of his community, says Savoie, but he’s emphatic that the company’s goal is to increase production, not to cut jobs. Yet, in the face of all this change, there’s at least one thing BeauSoleil says it won’t be automating: its blue-stamped, handmade wooden oyster box, which is manufactured year-round locally.",
        "Verge, who spent much of his career helping businesses in financial trouble, says that Atlantic Canadians aren’t necessarily afraid of change.",
        "“They’re afraid of being changed without any involvement or input or opportunity to direct their destiny,” he says. “The fishery, for a long time, was considered an employer of last resort.”",
        "He says the region’s industry needs to be more efficient and humane, and technologies could help.",
        "“We’ve got to reinvent this industry for the future, not perpetuate a model that really didn’t work that well in the past,” Verge says. “If we can do that, there’s tremendous opportunity.”",

    "articleContent": [
        "The FBI has obtained secret wiretaps collected by Spanish police of conversations involving Alexander Torshin, a deputy governor of Russia’s Central Bank who has forged close ties with U.S. lawmakers and the National Rifle Association, that led to a meeting with Donald Trump Jr. during the gun lobby’s annual convention in Louisville, Ky., in May 2016, a top Spanish prosecutor said Friday.",
        "José Grinda, who has spearheaded investigations into Spanish organized crime, said that bureau officials in recent months requested and were provided transcripts of wiretapped conversations between Torshin and Alexander Romanov, a convicted Russian money launderer. On the wiretaps, Romanov refers to Torshin as “El Padrino,” the godfather.",
        "“Just a few months ago, the wiretaps of these telephone conversations were given to the FBI,” Grinda said in response to a question from Yahoo News during a talk he gave at the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington. Asked if he was concerned about Torshin’s meetings with Donald Trump Jr. and other American political figures, Grinda replied: “Mr. Trump’s son should be concerned.”",
        "The comments by Grinda were the first clear sign that the FBI may be investigating Torshin, possibly as a part of special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Torshin — a close political ally of Vladimir Putin — had multiple contacts with conservative activists in the United States during the election, seeking to set up a summit between the Russian president and then candidate Trump. Although the summit never transpired, Torshin did meet briefly with the president’s son at a private dinner in Louisville during the May 2016 annual convention of the NRA. A member of the NRA since 2012, Torshin has been a regular attendee of the group’s conventions in recent years and hosted senior members of the group in Moscow.",
        "Grinda said that the FBI, in its request for the evidence to the Guardia Civil, the Spanish National Police, provided no explanation as to why it was interested in the material and he didn’t ask for one. “I don’t have to ask them why they want this information,” he said. But Grinda added that if Mueller or any other U.S. prosecutor seeks to use the material as part of a court case, they would have to make a second, more formal request to do so to the Spanish government.",
        "Spokesmen for the FBI and Mueller’s office did not respond to requests for comment. Alan Futerfas, a lawyer for Trump Jr., said he was in a meeting and was unable to comment when contacted by Yahoo News.",
        "Torshin has been the subject of intensifying U.S. government and congressional scrutiny over the past year and was recently among a lengthy list of oligarchs and Russian political figures sanctioned by the Treasury Department. As reported by Yahoo News and the Spanish newspaper El País last year, the Spanish National Police were preparing to arrest Torshin in August 2013, when he was expected to fly to the Spanish island of Mallorca in August for the birthday party of Romanov. The arrest plan, which involved the deployment of more than a dozen police officers at the airport and at the hotel where the party was supposed to take place, grew out of a lengthy investigation headed by Grinda into Russian organized crime and money laundering. As part of the probe, the Guardia Civil wiretapped Romanov’s phone and picked up 33 conversations with Torshin.",
        "But Torshin never showed up for the party and he was never arrested. Grinda confirmed in an interview after his talk that some in the Guardia Civil suspected that Torshin had been tipped off to the arrest plan by Russian officials who had been asked to cooperate in the Spanish probe. But Grinda added that he was unable to prove that was why Torshin never showed up for the party.",
        "Despite the suspicions about his ties to Russian money laundering, Torshin continued to travel frequently to the United States and even showed up as part of a Russian delegation in February 2017 to the National Prayer Breakfast, where he was at one point scheduled to meet with President Trump. (The meeting was canceled the night before, after National Security Council officials raised concerns about it.) More recently, Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden sent multiple letters to the NRA asking about its ties to Torshin and other Russian figures, questioning whether Russian money was funneled to the NRA to help pay for the more than $30 million the group spent on political ads and get out the vote efforts during the 2016 election.",
        "An NRA lawyer, in responses to Wyden, said that Torshin has only paid his membership dues to the group and that, based on an internal review, the NRA received a total of only $2,500 from about 23 Russia-linked contributors since 2015. However, the NRA is now reviewing its relationship with Torshin in light of the Treasury Department blacklisting him last month. “Based on Mr. Torshin’s listing as a specially designated national as of April 6, we are currently reviewing our responsibilities with respect to him,” NRA general counsel John Frazer wrote to Wyden.",

        "The landmark referendum heralds a new era for women’s rights in a government that for centuries operated as a theocracy. Ireland’s parliament is now expected to write a more liberal law on the procedure, which will likely allow a woman to complete an abortion until up to 12 weeks of pregnancy.",
        "The legalization of abortion in Ireland delivers a huge blow to the global anti-abortion movement, which had looked to the Western country’s near-total ban on the procedure as a beacon for other efforts around the world. International religious and anti-abortion groups ― many of them American ― had poured money and resources into a sophisticated digital campaign to uphold the ban in Ireland.",

        "The moral influence of the Roman Catholic Church is waning in the country. In 2016, Roman Catholics made up 78.3 percent of the Irish population, down from 86.8 percent in 2006. A series of scandals — chief among them the clerical sex abuse revelations in the 1990s — has undermined the church’s authority. A younger generation in Ireland was poised to bring the country’s reproductive rights laws up to speed with most other rich Western nations.",
        "“It just seems a bit absurd to me that we essentially have abortion in Ireland already,” said Aisling Grace, 20, in an interview three weeks before the vote. “The eighth amendment is a continuation of this Irish culture of burying our heads in the sand,” the student at Trinity College in Dublin added.",
        "Ireland is one of the richest countries in the world, but since adopting the eighth amendment in 1983 it has banned abortion except to save the life of the mother. This puts it in the unlikely company of countries like El Salvador and Nicaragua, which have some of the world’s most draconian restrictions on reproductive rights. Ireland’s enforcement of the abortion ban was not quite as extreme as El Salvador’s, where a woman might be sentenced to decades in prison for having a miscarriage. But the European nation has denied women abortions even in cases where the pregnancy severely affects the mother’s health.",
        "The most infamous case is that of Savita Halappanavar, a 31-year-old dentist who died in 2012 from complications related to a septic miscarriage. Her medical team had denied her request for an abortion at 17 weeks of pregnancy. But that’s not the only example. Just this year, 30-year-old Claire Malone, who has a congenital heart condition and one lung, was denied an abortion because Irish doctors decided that while her pregnancy was “high risk,” her life was not sufficiently threatened.",
        "Progressives pointed to these cases in the campaign to liberalize Ireland’s abortion laws, and women across the country used the Facebook page “In Her Shoes” to tell their own harrowing abortion stories. Leaders of the pro-repeal campaign had considered themselves the underdogs since the other side appeared to benefit from a great deal of foreign influence, an international anti-abortion fundraising network and an intense digital targeting effort.",
        "Advocates for the repeal were also fighting a status quo that was wrapped up in certain conceptions of Irish identity. One 65-year-old man in Dublin, who asked HuffPost not to publish his name, said he believed that women should have the legal right to choose abortion, but he was still emotionally conflicted about which way to vote. “There are so few things that make Ireland unique anymore,” he said. “We don’t allow abortions, and our policemen don’t carry guns. If you start changing those things, what incentive would people have to come visit our country?”",
        "But pressure to change came from many directions. The United Nations Human Rights Committee began leaning on Ireland in 2017 to reconsider its abortion ban, which it called “cruel and inhumane.” (Until Saturday, Malta was the only other nation in the European Union to outlaw the procedure.) And the U.K.’s Brexit vote in the same year made it unclear whether Irish women would still be able to travel to England as easily to obtain care safely and legally.",
        "Progressive groups were also bolstered by the fact that Ireland voted to legalize same-sex marriage in 2015. Many of the same activists who had pushed for marriage equality moved on to reproductive rights advocacy with a favorable wind at their backs.",
        "“Two years ago, we constantly had not only politicians but a lot of political media and those opposed to any progress saying, ‘Nobody’s interested in this. This will go nowhere,’” said Colm O’Gorman, executive director of Amnesty International Ireland. “We were able to demonstrate and show and build a very clear call for change.”",

        "date": "2018-05-26"
    },
    "articleContent": [
        "In January, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke traveled to Las Vegas to mingle at the SHOT Show, an annual gathering of the shooting, hunting and outdoor trade industries. The people there were “all great conservationists, really good people, dedicated to the outdoors,” he said in an interview with NRA-TV.",
        "An avid hunter and angler himself, Zinke has often said that the best stewards of wildlife are America’s sportsmen and -women. But after taking over the Department of the Interior in March 2017, he made quick work of angering some of those would-be supporters.",
        "Zinke and his team focused on boosting fossil fuel production and rolling back national monument protections. And he repeatedly voiced support for budget requests that would gut federal funding for land acquisition and conservation programs.",
        "Several hunting and fishing groups that initially found a lot to like about the self-proclaimed “Teddy Roosevelt conservationist” have become outspoken critics.",
        "Now, after a tumultuous first year at the Interior helm, Zinke appears to be signaling a new direction.",
        "Earlier this month, he hosted a roundtable of more than two dozen outdoor sporting and conservation organizations to get their input on his planned reorganization of the department. He promised them a “grand pivot” away from energy development and toward species and habitat conservation, according to E&E News.",
        "At the end of December, Zinke vowed to “create a conservation stewardship legacy second only to Teddy Roosevelt.” As the chief steward of America’s natural resources, he is responsible for managing some 500 million acres of land, or one-fifth of the United States, as well as protecting endangered species and managing migratory birds.",
        "Many conservation organizations and leaders, including the late president’s great-grandson Theodore Roosevelt IV, complained that he was falling far short of the lofty mark.",
        "Besides the conservation roundtable, Zinke has taken a number of steps in recent months that might reel back those groups.",
        "The Interior Department made several pro-hunting announcements in the week after the conservation roundtable. It moved to scrap a 2015 rule that bans aggressive hunting tactics in national preserves in Alaska, including shooting bear cubs and wolf pups in their dens and swimming caribou from motorboats. It proposed expanding hunting and fishing opportunities on numerous wildlife refuges. And it named 17 members to a new panel, the Hunting and Shooting Sports Conservation Council, which will advise Zinke on wildlife and habitat conservation.",
        "Some of those who attended this month’s roundtable are now sounding a more optimistic note about Zinke.",
        "Whit Fosburgh, president of the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership, told HuffPost last July that it was “troubling” to watch Zinke work solely on the development of natural resources “without even lip service to conservation.” Fosburgh’s nonprofit advocates for access to public lands for hunting and fishing.",
        "At the roundtable, he said, the secretary acknowledged that energy was the major push in 2017 and declared that the next few years would be about conservation, departmental reorganization and tackling the maintenance backlog at national parks.",
        "“We’re going to take him at his word,” Fosburgh told HuffPost this week. “He seemed sincere about it.”",
        "Fosburgh noted he is particularly pleased with a February order from Zinke that aims to improve habitat and migration corridors for big game species, including elk, antelope and mule deer.",
        "Collin O’Mara, president and CEO of the National Wildlife Federation, also voiced newfound optimism after the meeting, telling E&E that his group is “committed to working with Secretary Zinke more closely on priorities like increasing America’s wildlife populations, conserving wildlife corridors and expanding outdoor recreation opportunity.” And Steve Moyer, vice president for government affairs at Trout Unlimited, told the publication he was “glad to hear of a change of direction from Mr. Zinke.”",
        "Other conservation-focused organizations sound more skeptical about the secretary’s proclaimed shift.",
        "Jamie Rappaport Clark, president and CEO of the nonprofit Defenders of Wildlife, told HuffPost that non-game and endangered species are still missing from the conservation conversation. Zinke’s pivot, she added, seems largely geared toward rebuilding crumbling park infrastructure and reorganizing the agency.",
        "“I didn’t come out of [the meeting] believing that our nation’s natural resources chief steward was either enlightened or energized to conserve biodiversity,” Clark said. “Not at all.”",
        "Zinke is mistaken, she said, if he thinks shuffling employees around will lead to more sustainable fish, wildlife and plant habitat and resources.",
        "In a statement after the roundtable, David O’Neill, chief conservation officer of the National Audubon Society, said that while he appreciated the opportunity to join the discussion, the group continues to “fundamentally disagree with the Department of the Interior’s interpretation of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.”",
        "A little more than a week later, the National Audubon Society joined Defenders of Wildlife and other conservation groups in suing the Interior Department over its recent decision to slash protections for migratory bird species.",
        "The Interior Department had announced in December that accidentally killing birds — with windmills, power lines or oil rigs — would no longer be treated as a violation of federal law. The Trump administration’s re-interpretation of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act protects energy companies from prosecution for these unintentional, albeit not always unpredictable, deaths."

        "NBC News affiliate KHQ-TV was the first to report on the charges made this week against Dolezal. KREM 2, a CBS news affiliate, later confirmed the charges with the Spokane County prosecutor’s office. If convicted, Dolezal could face up to 15 years in prison.",
        "Dolezal came to national attention in 2015 after her family revealed she’d been presenting herself as a black woman for years, even though they said she was born white. At the time, Dolezal was president of the Spokane chapter of the NAACP and worked as a part-time instructor of Africana studies at Eastern Washington University.",
        "The revelation forced Dolezal to resign from the NAACP. She also stopped teaching at EWU. In 2016, Dolezal, a mother of three, officially changed her name to Nkechi Diallo, though she still uses her former name on her art website and social media pages.",
        "Washington state’s Department of Social and Health Services began investigating Dolezal in March 2017 after learning that Dolezal, who was receiving public assistance from the department, had published a book.",
        "The investigator found that Dolezal’s book publisher typically offers contracts that include payments of $10,000 to $20,000 ― but a review of her records revealed that she’d only reported an income of $300 per month in the form of gifts from friends, according to court documents published by KHQ-TV.",
        "The Spokane County prosecutor’s office accused Dolezal of being overpaid a total of $8,847 for food assistance and child care assistance from the state’s Department of Social and Health Services between Aug. 1, 2015, and Nov. 30, 2017.",
        "During that period, according to the investigation, an estimated $83,924.96 had been deposited into Dolezal’s bank account in monthly installments.",

        "“We’ve probably all been guilty of sharing Dolezal’s story, or at least parts of it, at some point ― but we must recognize that it is distracting, counterproductive and unnecessary,” Lilly Workneh, then the senior editor of HuffPost Black Voices, wrote in March 2017. “Let’s return our focus to more pressing matters affecting marginalized, overlooked and misrepresented communities of color.”"

        "The Caribbean island of Barbados elected its first female prime minister Thursday, adding to a growing list of woman-led countries in the Western Hemisphere.",
        "Mia Amor Mottley, head of the Barbados Labour Party, will soon be sworn in as the country’s next prime minister after the party won all 30 seats in the country’s House of Assembly. Mottley campaigned on a platform attacking high taxes and the expensive cost of living on the island. She attributed these issues to policies ushered in by the current ruling Democratic Labour Party, which has held a majority of seats in government since 2008.",
        "The landslide victory is considered a strong rebuke of the incumbent’s agenda. Leader of the Democratic Labour Party and current Prime Minister Freundel Stuart conceded defeat as results still poured in early Friday morning. The win makes Mottley just the eighth prime minister to lead Barbados since the island first gained independence from Great Britain in 1966.",
        "Mottley may have even received the unofficial backing of Barbados’ most famous national: Rihanna. Fans of the pop star pointed to her comment on the Instagram post of her close friend Leandra Goodridge. After Goodridge commented “Watching my next Prime Minister all day on @Bajantube stories,” Rihanna replied “Yes…. She deserves it!” Mottley then thanked Rihanna for her “love, support and blessings.”",
        "While the soon-to-be prime minister now basks in her historic win, she has also faced unprecedented attacks along the way. During the campaign, some detractors accused Mottley of orchestrating an illegal tax write-off for her father in the early 1990s, and others even demanded that she publicly declare her sexuality. Supporters allege the criticism and attacks have more to do with her being female than unqualified, as Mottley has held positions in Barbadian government for nearly 30 years.",
        "Female leadership in the English-speaking Caribbean isn’t new, however. Once sworn in, Mottley will become the fifth female head of government following Dominica’s Eugenia Charles in 1980, Guyana’s Janet Jagan in 1997, Trinidad and Tobago’s Kamla Persad Bissessar in 2010 and Jamaica’s Portia Simpson Miller in 2012.",
        "It’s a tough road ahead for Mottley and Barbados’ new ruling party. Since 2009, the island’s economy struggled because of the global financial crisis, which drove up the national debt and contributed to a drop in tourism, a major source of the country’s gross domestic product. In recent years, the small island of nearly 300,000 residents has also seen several international credit rating agencies downgrade its economic outlook.",
        "The general election results give Mottley and the Barbados Labour Party a five-year mandate to govern."

        "“As a young corporate attorney I saw my role as the protector of the BET brand and its employees, and today, more than 32 years later, I still see myself as the protector and defender of a brand that I have helped to grow as a top destination for audiences across the globe,” Lee, who was hired in 1986 as the company’s first vice president and general counsel, said in the announcement.\n\nShe was promoted to president and chief operating officer in 1996 and was made chairman and CEO in 2005, according to Variety.\n\n“Debra’s vision and creativity has cemented BET Networks as a premiere network for African Americans and lovers of black culture,” said Bob Bakish, president and chief executive of Viacom, BET’s parent company. “As BET continues to move forward, we will always be grateful to Debra for her leadership and commitment to creating top-notch entertainment that both entertains and empowers.”\n\nBakish has overseen several executive changes at BET since he became Viacom’s chief executive in late 2016, the Los Angeles Times notes.\n\nZola Mashariki, the head of original programming, was fired in April 2017 while she was on medical leave for breast cancer treatment, Variety reported at the time. She sued the company, alleging gender discrimination, and settled out of court. Stephen Hill also stepped down as president of programming last year.\n\nLee, who has been the face of BET for three decades, has kept the network No. 1 in the ratings with black viewers for 17 years, according to The Hollywood Reporter. She oversaw the addition of such programs as “The Game,” “Being Mary Jane,” “Real Husbands of Hollywood” and “In Contempt.”\n\nLee plans to keep working on corporate and nonprofit boards, and to continue her work with the Time’s Up movement and the Recording Academy Diversity and Inclusion Task Force, according to BET’s statement."

        "When former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick took a knee during the national anthem in August 2016, it was in protest of unjust police killings of black Americans.",
        "For his courage, Kaepernick lost his job, the NFL lost its mind by forbidding the peaceful action ― and meanwhile, at least 378 black Americans have lost their lives in police killings.",
        "That most recent estimate of black police violence victims comes from data compiled by The Washington Post and analyzed by HuffPost.",
        "Last August, HuffPost reported that based on the Post’s data, at least 223 black Americans had been killed by police gunfire in the year since Kaepernick first sat, then took a knee, to protest police violence. Less than a year later, that number has increased by at least 155 people.",
        "It’s likely that the real number of victims is higher. Between Aug. 14, 2016 ― when Kaepernick first sat out the national anthem ― and now, at least 253 of the people listed in the Post’s database did not have their race confirmed. Furthermore, the database only includes shooting deaths, so people like Eric Garner, a black father who was unarmed when an officer put him in a fatal chokehold, would not be included.",
        "In total, 3,357 people have been fatally shot by police since 2015, according to the Post’s data.",
        "The sobering numbers come just after the NFL announced its cowardly decision on Wednesday to ban kneeling during the national anthem. The league can now fine teams that participate in protests, with the punishment of individual players left up to their team.",
        "In a statement, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said that “on-field protests created a false perception among many that thousands of NFL players were unpatriotic.” (He did not seem to understand that silencing a peaceful protest might also come across as unpatriotic.)",
        "Polling has shown that views on the NFL protests are deeply polarized, but most Americans polled last fall said they believed the players were protesting police violence, not the American flag. Kaepernick also made it clear that he was protesting racism, police violence and inequality.",
        "Yet President Donald Trump has called the protests a “total disrespect of our heritage,” and “a total disrespect of everything we stand for.”",
        "Trump even suggested that protesting players should leave the country.",
        "“You have to stand proudly for the National Anthem or you shouldn’t be playing,” Trump said. “You shouldn’t be there. Maybe you shouldn’t be in the country.”",
        "Trump also said he’d like NFL owners to say, “get that son of a bitch off the field right now, he’s fired” if a player protested.",
        "Despite the vitriol, Kaepernick did reach out to veterans to make sure his protests were respectful. Initially, the former quarterback simply sat out the anthem, but former Green Beret Nate Boyer says he persuaded him to kneel.",
        "“That’s how it all started with Colin and I, neither of us knew that kneeling would be the result of our conversation,” Boyer wrote in an open letter to both Kaepernick and Trump last October. “Colin wanted to sit, I wanted him to stand, and so we found a common ground on a knee alongside his teammates. I believe that progress and real change happens in this world when you reach across the divide, you build a bridge, you swallow your pride, you open your mind, you embrace what you don’t understand, and ultimately you surrender.”",
        "One person killed by police since Kaepernick began protesting was 22-year-old Stephon Clark, who was shot at 20 times by two officers in his own backyard in Sacramento, California, earlier this year. He was armed with only a cellphone.",
        "Clark’s death sparked a wave of protests across the city. And why not? The killing was sickening, and Clark deserved more than to be another statistic.",
        "But the NFL doesn’t seem to care about that."

        "date": "2018-05-25"
    },
    "articleContent": [
        "President Donald Trump posthumously pardoned Jack Johnson on Thursday, erasing the black boxer’s century-old conviction for violating the Mann Act — a 1910 law that prohibited transporting “any woman or girl” across state lines “for the purpose of prostitution or debauchery, or for any other immoral purpose” — by driving his white girlfriend from Pittsburgh to Chicago.",
        "The timing of Trump’s decision was remarkable. Two months ago, Trump signed into law the bipartisan Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA), which holds websites accountable for any sex-trafficking-related content posted by users. Its backers pitched it as a way to combat human trafficking. But like the Mann Act, FOSTA targets some of the people it ostensibly aims to protect: It has already shuttered many of the websites that voluntary sex workers — those who are not trafficked — used to screen clients and keep themselves safe.",
        "Although drafted and signed more than a century apart, both laws are part of the United States’ long history of citing human trafficking as a pretext to crack down on consensual but taboo sex.",
        "All this has happened before",
        "The Mann Act, also known as the White-Slave Traffic Act, was enacted in response to public hysteria about sensational yet unconfirmed reports of white women being kidnapped and trafficked by foreign men.",
        "“There’s a huge range of things that [the act] allowed the government to punish and control,” Alexandra Levy, a law professor at the University of Notre Dame, told HuffPost. “It gave tremendous leverage to punish interracial marriage, polygamy and promiscuity.”",
        "Throughout the first half of the 20th century, thousands of people were prosecuted under the act. Johnson’s conviction in 1912 was a prime example of the broad power of a law pitched as a way to stop what was at the time called white slavery. His crime was, essentially, being black and driving across state lines with a white woman, even though she went voluntarily and was his girlfriend.",
        "Seven years after the Mann Act passed, federal officials instituted the American Plan to protect U.S. servicemen from acquiring sexually transmitted diseases before they took off to fight in World War I. The initiative allowed for the detention of women suspected of having a venereal disease. It was celebrated across the political spectrum for keeping American troops safe and for “curing” thousands of women of sexually transmitted infections ― though those “cures” often meant arsenic- and mercury-based medicines and involuntary sterilization.",
        "Just like the Mann Act, the plan took aim at some of the most vulnerable, like Nina McCall, a young poor white woman from Michigan who was arrested in 1918 under suspicion of being a prostitute. After her arrest, she was forcefully examined and medicated, then detained in a federal medical institution for three months. In Michigan alone, more than a thousand women were detained under the plan by 1918.",
        "The Mann Act and the American Plan were swift responses to changes in American culture and the seemingly sudden rights and privileges granted women, said Scott W. Stern, who recently published a book about the McCall case.",
        "“In the early and late 1910s, women were getting the vote in various states, women were beginning to get formally educated, women were joining political parties, and premarital sex was skyrocketing, as was divorce,” he said. “Both the Mann Act and the American Plan were really about controlling women, and especially working-class and nonwhite women at a time when women were becoming ‘uncontrollable.’”",
        "“The Mann Act today is most famous because of the prosecutions of certain very prominent men, like Charlie Chaplin, Chuck Berry and Jack Johnson,” Stern continued. “Certainly those are notable cases, but what I think far too few people know is that the Mann Act was used to lock up huge amounts of women and police their lives.”",
        "The first people arrested by officers of the Investigation Bureau — the Justice Department agency that would later become the FBI — for violating the Mann Act were a madam and five sex workers traveling together from Michigan to Chicago, Stern noted.",
        "So while the Mann Act and the American Plan were ostensibly aimed at saving vulnerable women, in practice the initiatives allowed the Justice Department to control them, their sexuality, and the men they associated with ― many of whom were black or Chinese.",
        "A Pattern Repeated, Again and Again",
        "Measures like the Mann Act and the American Plan set the stage for legislation like FOSTA.",
        "The law aimed to curb human trafficking by holding websites and social platforms accountable for hosting content related to the sex trade. But much like the Mann Act and the American Plan, it polices members of already marginalized communities.",
        "The new regulations pushed sites like Craigslist and Backpage to scrub their platforms of not only sex-trafficking-related content but sex-related content in general. That meant that not just sex traffickers but also voluntary sex workers and people who engage in online sexual activities were forced further underground.",
        "Melissa, a Phoenix-based escort, told HuffPost that FOSTA forced her back onto the streets. Lexi, a Florida-based escort, said she couldn’t screen her clients anymore without access to the sites.",
        "Sex workers are often already members of marginalized communities, lacking easy access to banking and health care and safety from sexual or physical violence.",
        "“It’s an important parallel,” Levy said.",
        "The Mann Act and FOSTA used similar tactics to pass with overwhelming majorities. The Mann Act was passed unanimously, Stern said. The House and Senate versions of FOSTA passed almost unanimously.",
        "The Mann Act was written in response to accounts of enslavement of white women. Similarly, FOSTA used hysterical anti-trafficking rhetoric — often provided by evangelical Christian organizations that oppose all sex work — to garner support from the public.",
        "“The public is so easily manipulated when you say ‘trafficking,’” Levy said. “It’s a very emotionally provocative issue. You can sort of leverage that term.” In both cases, the public was galvanized by terrifying (and misleading) anecdotes of sex-trafficked children or white women, only for the legislation to be used against marginalized people after it was signed into law.",
        "Trump’s decision to pardon Johnson shows progress. But Johnson’s story also offers an important lesson, Levy argued.",
        "“It should call our attention to the fact that laws that purport to be anti-trafficking can mask very serious social agendas,” she said. “Hopefully we can learn from this.”"

        "date": "2018-05-25"
    },
    "articleContent": [
        "WASHINGTON ― In 1882, Congress voted to ban an entire ethnic group from immigrating to the United States.",
        "The Chinese Exclusion Act, iterations of which remained on the books for over 60 years, had a lasting effect on the history of U.S. immigration, as depicted in a new PBS documentary airing Tuesday.",
        "Filmmakers Ric Burns (brother of Ken) and Li-Shin Yu trace not only the law’s development and implementation but also its connection to other integral parts of American history unfolding contemporaneously, like segregation in the Jim Crow South, urbanization on the East and West Coasts, and trade abroad.",
        "At a screening of the film last week, Burns called the Chinese Exclusion Act a “quintessentially American story” and described it as “the biggest part of American history that people don’t know about,” because you would be hard-pressed to find it mentioned in many history courses.",
        "In the film, several historians marvel that some Americans are shocked to learn about the Chinese Exclusion Act.",
        "“Many Americans today cannot believe this happened. How could this country, with its culture, with its politics, with its economics, do what it did against a whole class of people?” NYU professor John Kuo Wei Tchen says.",
        "But while watching the documentary amid today’s political climate, it isn’t unbelievable at all. Burns and Yu acknowledged that it doesn’t take much effort to see parallels to President Donald Trump’s America — though this was not their original intention, as they began working on the film six years ago, Burns said.",
        "Central to the bill’s 1882 passage were political attacks on Chinese immigrants that labeled them “unassimilable” and portrayed them as economic threats to white Americans and a filthy scourge on society. The film shows how newspaper headlines and editorial cartoons from that period disseminated this propaganda.",
        "Nineteenth-century politicians’ nativism and fear-mongering are remarkably similar to today’s anti-immigrant rhetoric. President Donald Trump famously began his presidential campaign by saying that Mexico was sending rapists, drug dealers, and criminals to the U.S.",
        "Other right-wing political figures have raised the old complaint that certain immigrants are unassimilable. During an NPR interview earlier this month, Trump’s chief of staff, John Kelly, said that undocumented immigrants are “not people that would easily assimilate” and “don’t integrate well” — an uncanny reminder of how this political language persists.",
        "Burns sees another commonality in the rhetoric: the “factless nature” of claims that immigrants are stealing our jobs.",
        "“Both then and now, there’s zero truth to it,” he said. “These things almost never have any basis in reality. It becomes a function of playing to fears, playing to usually white vulnerabilities, and finding wedge issues for politicians.”",
        "These parallels make it particularly difficult and infuriating to watch the history of the Chinese Exclusion Act unfold in the film, including how it raised questions about birthright citizenship that were later settled in an 1898 Supreme Court case.",
        "Trump is among those who have relitigated the issue in the decades since: During his presidential campaign, he suggested abolishing birthright citizenship.",
        "There are also echoes of the Chinese Exclusion Act in the legal battle over Trump’s travel ban, which bars people largely from majority-Muslim countries from entering the U.S. It’s yet another compelling piece of evidence for the film’s central argument: The Chinese Exclusion Act tells us all we need to know not just about immigration, but about the story of America.",
        "The events of the film intersect with another grim period of American history: the Jim Crow era in the South. According to the film, the California politicians spearheading discrimination against Chinese immigrants built support for the exclusion act by compromising with Southern politicians trying to pass measures to systematically disenfranchise black people. The political maneuvering, which Burns referred to as “horse-trading,” essentially amounted to exchanging one form of discrimination for another.",
        "Sexism and misogyny also fueled the fire. Laws that helped lay the foundation for the 1882 bill were particularly discriminatory against Chinese women, who were stereotyped as prostitutes. As Columbia University historian Mae Ngai relates in the film, Chinese women were required to prove they were not prostitutes to be admitted to the U.S, a process so stringent that it effectively discouraged most women from immigrating.",
        "Through these connections, the documentary effectively makes the case that the Chinese Exclusion Act is fundamental to questions of American identity.",
        "“It is not a melodramatic or breathlessly hyperbolic thing to say that if you want to know about immigration in America and you don’t know the story of Chinese exclusion, it would be like saying you want to know about race relations in America but you’ve never heard of slavery,” Burns said.",
        "Burns and Yu said they intend for the film to be an educational tool, and PBS and the Center for Asian American Media are distributing it to schools so that learning about Chinese exclusion becomes a given in U.S. history class.",
        "“Just the way you know about the Fourth of July, you know about the Civil War, and you know about the Pilgrims — usually a ludicrously cartoonish way,” Burns said, “you’ll at least have a ludicrously cartoonish version of the Chinese Exclusion Act.”",
        "“The Chinese Exclusion Act” premieres on PBS on Tuesday at 8 p.m. Eastern."

        "Curry joined dozens of other progressive Christian leaders in Washington, D.C., on Thursday night for a candle-lit vigil and march to the White House that aimed to “reclaim” Christianity. An organizer told HuffPost that up to 2,000 people packed into the National City Christian Church to hear Curry and other prominent Christians preach before the march.",
        "Curry, a Chicago native and the presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church, emphasized the importance of love in a time when he believes the integrity of the Christian faith is at stake.",
        "“Love your neighbor,” Curry said during the service. “Love the neighbor you like and the neighbor you don’t like. Love the neighbor you agree with and the neighbor you don’t agree with. Love your Democrat neighbor, your Republican neighbor, your black neighbor, your white neighbor, your Anglo neighbor, your Latino neighbor and your LGBTQ neighbor. Love your neighbor! That’s why we’re here!”",
        "The event had been planned for weeks before Curry gave his impassioned sermon about love during the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s wedding on May 19. But some Christians are hoping that the bishop’s newfound popularity will help highlight the progressive faith movement ― and prove that conservative evangelicals don’t have an exclusive claim on interpreting Christianity.",

        "The speakers did not mention President Donald Trump directly during the service on Thursday night. Curry himself insisted that “we are not a left-wing group; we are not a right-wing group. We are a Jesus movement.”",
        "However, the leaders signed a declaration that contained references to the Trump administration’s actions and policies.",
        "Curry said that he and other Christian leaders from various denominations had gathered for a Lenten retreat this year to talk about the state of Christianity in an increasingly polarized nation. Curry said the result of that meeting was a declaration calling on other Christians to “reclaim Jesus.”",
        "In the declaration, the leaders rejected Trump’s “America First” philosophy, which purports to put the interests and security needs of the American people first, as “theological heresy for followers of Christ.”",
        "“While we share a patriotic love for our country, we reject xenophobic or ethnic nationalism that places one nation over others as a political goal,” the leaders wrote in the statement. “Serving our own communities is essential, but the global connections between us are undeniable. Global poverty, environmental damage, violent conflict, weapons of mass destruction, and deadly diseases in some places ultimately affect all places, and we need wise political leadership to deal with each of these.”",
        "The leaders also condemned the “normalization of lying” and politicians who neglect the ethic of public service and accountability “in favor of personal recognition and gain often characterized by offensive arrogance.”",
        "“We are deeply concerned for the soul of our nation, but also for our churches and the integrity of our faith,” the leaders wrote.",
        "The White House did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.",
        "Watch a livestream of the service below.",
        "The declaration was co-signed by Rev. Jim Wallis, president of the progressive Christian organization Sojourners, which helped organize Thursday’s vigil.",

Hunter, a former megachurch pastor from Florida who served as one of former President Barack Obama’s spiritual advisers. It also featured other prominent black Protestant, mainline Protestant, Catholic and evangelical leaders.",
        "Following the service, the crowd participated in a silent march to Lafayette Square, a park facing the White House. There, leaders of the movement took turns reading out the declaration, The Guardian reports.",

We’re just students,” Abdelmoaty told The Post. “The basic idea that he charged us and attacked us for this, for our religion, for our home country and background, it’s kind of scary. In the first place, we’re just human beings — names and descriptions came afterward. We don’t hate him for what he did. We’re just sad.”",

        "UPDATE: May 26 ― Scott R. Brunton, a former model who has accused George Takei of drugging and groping him without consent 36 years ago, says he is not walking back his allegations against the “Star Trek” actor.",
        "Brunton accused the New York Observer of mischaracterizing his comments in an article published this week, headlined, “Exclusive: George Takei’s Accuser Has Changed His Story of Drugging and Assault.”",
        "“I’m not a liar,” Brunton told HuffPost. “I am sticking to my story.”",
        "One key detail that the Observer construed as Brunton changing his story, Brunton said, was really a matter of semantics.",

        "But Brunton told HuffPost the details he does remember certainly qualify as groping.",
        "“My pants were down around my ankles, my shirt was pulled up,” Brunton said. “I’m in this bean bag chair that George had guided me to. He’s on top of me, he’s trying to wrestle my underwear down off of me.”",
        "He added, “His hands were all over me trying to get the underwear off. And to me, that’s groping.”",
        "Brunton was dismayed that the media had been treating the Observer story as vindication for Takei.",
        "“It’s as if there’s a trial, and he’s been proven not guilty,” he said.",
        "PREVIOUSLY:",
        "Months after George Takei was accused of sexual assault, former model Scott R. Brunton, who said the “Star Trek” actor drugged and groped him without his consent 36 years ago, is walking back certain parts of his story.",
        "In a lengthy interview with The New York Observer‘s Shane Snow published Thursday, Brunton recounts the night at the actor’s home where the alleged incident occurred but admits he didn’t remember Takei touching his genitals.",
        "He previously accused the actor of “groping my crotch and trying to get my underwear off” as he came to after having a drink Takei provided, which left him feeling dizzy and led him to pass out.",
        "After the allegations surfaced, Takei flatly denied Brunton’s account ― he maintains that he doesn’t even remember them meeting ― and said he was “shocked and bewildered” by the allegation.",
        "“Right now it is a he said / he said situation, over alleged events nearly 40 years ago,” Takei wrote on social media in his one and only statement. “But those that know me understand that non-consensual acts are so antithetical to my values and my practices, the very idea that someone would accuse me of this is quite personally painful.”",
        "In addition to parsing out the details of the alleged groping, Snow notes various inconsistencies in accounts Brunton shared with numerous outlets, including his alcohol consumption that night, his weight at the time, whether Takei was wearing a shirt during their interaction and whether the two met for coffee years later.",
        "As for the accusation that Takei drugged Brunton’s cocktail, toxicologists interviewed for the story “immediately ruled out a spiked drink,” as the drugs available at the time would have impaired his ability to drive home after the incident or remember that it occurred at all.",
        "“There are drugs today that may do this, but they did not exist [in 1981],” one toxicologist says in the piece.",
        "While Snow describes Brunton as “a sympathetic and well-intentioned man,” he concludes that the model altered “key details and let slip that, in his effort to be listened to, he’d fabricated some things.”",
        "Snow adds: “This and other evidence would indicate a hard-to-swallow conclusion: We ― both public and press ― got the George Takei assault story wrong.”",
        "Takei has yet to respond to the story. HuffPost has reached out to his representatives for a comment."

        "At the end of the new “Avengers” film, Thanos (Josh Brolin) snaps his Infinity Gauntlet–clad finger and causes many of the Marvel Cinematic Universe characters to crumble to dust instantaneously. Spider-Man, however, receives an extended final moment, allowing Tom Holland to deliver a tear-jerking and mostly improvised death scene.",
        "“I don’t feel so good. I don’t know what’s happening,” he says after Thanos’ snap. “I don’t want to go. I don’t want to go, Mr. Stark, please,” he mumbles, embracing Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) as he melts away to nothing.",
        "So why did Spidey get so much time to deliver a heartbreaking monologue, while his compatriots died on the spot?",
        "In an interview with HuffPost, directors Joe and Anthony Russo confirmed the reason: It was due to his Spidey sense, his ability to perceive danger before it hits.",
        "“That’s correct,” Joe Russo said after I asked if Peter Parker’s Spidey sense was behind the early warning. “He was aware of something.”",
        "Though it’s a mainstay power of the character in the Marvel comics, Spidey sense wasn’t established in the previous Spider-Man solo film “Spider-Man: Homecoming.” In fact, it was big news among fans when “Infinity War” showed Peter had Spidey sense in his repertoire in the trailers for the film.",
        "Now we know why.",
        "It all led to Holland’s delivering the most emotional scene of the movie, inspiring memes everywhere:",
        "But the Spidey sense inquiry was far from the only question I had in the wake of watching and rewatching “Infinity War.” Since I had the Russo brothers on the phone, I posed a few more questions for the directors to clear up:",
        "Why is Gamora?",
        "It’s the question on everyone’s minds.",
        "In “Infinity War,” the Guardians of the Galaxy crew initially assumes that the Avengers are working with Thanos and thus have custody of Star-Lord’s boo, Gamora (Zoe Saldana).",
        "So when Star-Lord (Chris Pratt) meets the Avengers, he asks Iron Man, “Where is Gamora?” Iron Man responds, “I’ll do you one better: Who is Gamora?” Drax (Dave Bautista) follows that up with the nonsensical but earnest, “I’ll do you one better: Why is Gamora?”",
        "Really, though: Why is Gamora?",
        "When I asked Joe Russo about the line and whether he has pondered an answer to it, he got a little philosophical. “Why do you think is Gamora?” he asked me, inscrutably. “I don’t know if there is an answer in Drax’s twisted brain.”",
        "Anthony Russo said, “No, sometimes [you] just wonder, has he made a connection there?”",
        "“Remember, this is a man who thinks he can stand so incredibly still that he’s invisible,” Joe Russo said.",
        "What was the secret behind Captain America’s phone number?",
        "A gag in “Infinity War” is that Tony Stark has the number for Captain America (Chris Evans) on a flip phone if he’s needed. The movie prominently shows Cap’s number (678-136-7092) on screen.",
        "The Marvel movies are known for Easter eggs, and this had all the markings of one. But if you were one of the many people who called the number after seeing the film, you know the number doesn’t work and appears to be random. So what’s the point?",
        "“We actually had intended to create a fake voicemail from Steve Rogers,” Joe Russo said. “For the people that left the theater and called that number, they would get a voicemail from Steve Rogers.”",
        "“And that number was the actual number that we were going to use. We were sort of given that number,” said Anthony Russo.",
        "Sadly, the movie’s affiliated legal department got in the way.",
        "“We had it all ready to go, but legal took that away from us,” he added.",
        "Can Groot regenerate from the handle of Stormbreaker?",
        "The end of the first “Guardians of the Galaxy” gave us a new Groot (Vin Diesel), showing us that the treelike creature can regenerate after pretty severe injuries. So given that Groot spared some of his body to create the handle of Thor’s new Stormbreaker weapon, some people have been wondering: Can that handle eventually turn into a new Groot?",
        "Joe Russo left it up in the air.",
        "“I don’t know if every piece of him that detaches ... can grow a future version of him, but who’s to say? That’s an interesting question.”",
        "Was “dad” really Groot’s last word in the script?",
        "Before Groot disappears at the snap of Thanos’ finger, he lets out one last “Groot” to Rocket (Bradley Cooper). “Guardians of the Galaxy” director James Gunn said the last word translates to “dad.” Was that word actually in the script?",
        "“It was, and it was ‘dad,’” said Anthony Russo.",
        "Why did everyone’s clothes disappear too?",
        "When peeps start disappearing in “Infinity War,” so do their clothes. But clothes don’t die. Clothes are forever, until you shrink them in the laundry. That’s how it works for me. So what’s going on here?",
        "Joe Russo explained that the clothes disappear because they are “part of their identity.”",
        "“Whatever was elemental to somebody’s presence went with them,” Anthony Russo said.",
        "Should people blame Star-Lord?",
        "The Avengers devise a plan to get the Infinity Gauntlet off Thanos’ hand by slipping it off after Mantis (Pom Klementieff) incapacitates him with her empathy/mind-controlling capabilities. It almost works, but Star-Lord ruins everything by punching Thanos in the face after he learns Gamora is dead.",
        "Thanos gets out of Mantis’ grasp, and the destruction of half the life in the universe ensues.",
        "Star-Lord has been getting a lot of hate since the movie was released. Does he deserve it?",
        "The directors said no.",
        "“His mother was dying of cancer when he was kidnapped by pirates at the age of 10. He was raised by pirates. He had to murder his father to avenge the death of his mother. His girlfriend, who he was in love with, was murdered by another corrupt paternal figure ... He made a very emotional choice,” said Joe Russo.",
        "Anthony Russo reiterated that the shock of Gamora’s death just lets Star-Lord’s emotions get the better of him, adding that Thor also makes this mistake.",
        "“Thor also let his emotions get the better of him. Thor could’ve killed Thanos more quickly than he tried to with the ax. He showed up, and he took a moment — because of his anger, because of his motivation — to tell Thanos that he told him he would die ... and finish him off in a very deliberate way. Thor sort of got lost in his emotions in a similar way as Star-Lord and could also have been responsible for Thanos.”",
        "According to Joe Russo, the mistakes the characters make are all about relatability.",
        "“They make very human choices. I think if we learn anything from narrative is to put yourself inside the POV of someone — or the character itself — you should be able to empathize with that character, understand the choices that they make,” he said.",
        "Was the movie inspired by “The Leftovers”?",
        "It doesn’t take a genius billionaire playboy philanthropist to see the connections between HBO’s “The Leftovers” and “Infinity War.”",
        "Not only do the projects both involve a bunch of people vanishing to some unknown fate, but they both also star actress Carrie Coon, who plays Nora in “The Leftovers” and Proxima Midnight in “Infinity War.”",
        "Is there any inspiration?",
        "Joe Russo said Coon was in the project just because “she’s one of the best actresses working today.” It had nothing to do with a “Leftovers” connection.",
        "He also said he believes “The Leftovers” might have been inspired by the Marvel comic writer Jim Starlin’s ‘Infinity Gauntlet’ story (a source for “Infinity War”) “in the first place.”",
        "“It’s just a cyclical loop there. But we’re just drawing from the original source material,” said Joe Russo.",
        "Did Drax really disappear, or is he just standing still?",
        "Drax disappeared along with half the other heroes at the end of the movie, but as the directors mentioned, he believes he possesses the ability to stand so still, he becomes invisible.",
        "Did he really disappear? Or was he just standing reallllly still?",
        "“That’s a spoiler,” joked Joe Russo.",
        "“That’s to be decided,” Anthony Russo said, laughing. “All we know is what we can gather from the film. Anything more than that can potentially be addressed down the line.”",
        "It seems there’s a chance we may see Drax again, after all. You know, if he ever moves."

    },
    "articleContent": [
        "The boys club is alive and well in Hollywood ― and it’s so entrenched that male celebrities will unwittingly go on the record about it.",
        "This week a New York Times interview with the “Arrested Development” cast went viral after matriarch Jessica Walter opened up about how her co-star Jeffrey Tambor (who was also present during the interview) used to verbally abuse her on set. In a stunning, but wholly unsurprising, turn of events, her other male co-stars jumped in ... on behalf of Tambor. Jason Bateman suggested that Tambor’s behavior occurred in part because the cast was like a “family,” suggesting that the entertainment industry was simply a “breeding ground for atypical behavior and certain people have certain processes.”",
        "The backlash was swift, and Bateman and co-star Tony Hale have since publicly apologized for not supporting Walter during the interview. And the conversation raised a few questions: Are all sets truly “breeding grounds for atypical behavior,” including verbal assaults? Is that simply the cost of creating art?",
        "To find out, we asked Vella Lovell, a 32-year-old actress who has spent her fair share of time on TV sets ― specifically the set of “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,” a CW show on which she has played Heather over the last few years. Lovell isn’t part of Hollywood’s old boys club, though she is certainly part of Hollywood. Much of her career has been spent on sets run by and/or dominated by women ― “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,” “Younger,” “Girls.” She’s been working for years, but is also young enough to imagine that her work culture could be different than what Bateman described.",
        "“It maybe has been the norm,” she told HuffPost over the phone while doing her grocery shopping, reacting to Bateman’s characterization of the industry she’s a part of, “but as tides are turning, it’s kind of like, if there’s an alternative, what are we doing?”",
        "When you first read that New York Times interview, what was your reaction?",
        "It seemed like the women [Jessica Walter and Alia Shawkat] didn’t get to talk a lot. It seemed like the guys kind of took over the interview and I think that’s part of the problem. It didn’t seem like [Walter] felt heard ― just from that article. So that says to me that it’s not an equal playing field ... I think that can happen a lot with women and men in creative fields ― women can end up feeling a little silenced.",
        "From your perspective, does the set dynamic that Jason Bateman described as typical of the entertainment industry ring true to you? Is that something you’ve experienced ― verbal altercations that might cross a line into feeling abusive?",
        "The set I’ve spent the most time on is “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,” and it’s run all by women. Honestly, I’ve never experienced that, so I would have to say no. But I also think that all the women on set set a precedent. And I think it’s up to the people at the top to set that vibe and example of what is acceptable and what’s not.",
        "I will say, just being in the theater and on sets, the more power someone has, the more things are dictated by them. Whoever the number-one person is on the set kind of sets the tone. It’s their behavior and their moral center that dictates how the set is gonna be. So for us, because it’s Rachel [Bloom] and because she’s a creator, the respect is kind of implied.",
        "But I think that [verbal abuse] can happen, especially with the older men generation. They’re used to a certain amount of power and respect. And so because they’re the person in power, I do think the younger actors ― even if it’s just younger in your career ― you end up looking up to them as the norm. Does that make sense? I think that’s maybe what [Jason Bateman] is saying [in The New York Times piece], that it’s become the norm.",
        "Let me read you exactly what Bateman said to Sopan Deb. He said: “Again, not to belittle it or excuse it or anything, but in the entertainment industry it is incredibly common to have people who are, in quotes, ‘difficult.’... And what you learn is context. And you learn about character and you learn about work habits, work ethics, and you start to understand. Because it’s a very amorphous process, this sort of [expletive] that we do, you know, making up fake life. It’s a weird thing, and it is a breeding ground for atypical behavior and certain people have certain processes.”",
        "OK, Emma, if you could see me right now, I’m just shaking my head. I just feel like what’s been the “norm,” isn’t actually acceptable. And I have met, in my short time on sets, too many people who are kind and respectful and inclusive for that to be acceptable. And that’s the thing ― it maybe has been the norm, but as tides are turning, it’s kind of like, if there’s an alternative, what are we doing?",
        "There are too many incredibly talented creative people that are also kind. I’ve met so many of those people. And you meet them, and then you’re like, so why then do I need to be verbally abused to get a great performance? Do those things actually go hand in hand? And I don’t think they need to.",
        "I think it’s probably true that someone with [Jeffrey Tambor’s] stature comes on set and dictates how people will be treated. As a younger actor, you’re just like, sure ... and then that behavior becomes the norm. But it’s just not OK.",
        "I loved that Alia Shawkat pointed that out in the middle of the interview. “But that doesn’t mean it’s acceptable,” she said in response to Bateman. “And the point is that things are changing, and people need to respect each other differently.”",
        "Right? But you hear that [argument] with all of the things that are happening [with Me Too]. With Dustin Hoffman, they’re like, no but this is normal. And it’s like… but why? Why does it have to be? And I think it’s been an accepted exchange ― that for an amazing performance, you put up with bad behavior. But I don’t think that means it’s right or that it’s how every set is at all.",
        "Right. From what you’ve said it sounds like that hasn’t been your experience, and you’ve been working on a network TV show that’s been on for three years.",
        "Yeah. And guest-starring on other sets. On the “Younger” set, because Sutton Foster’s number one, everyone is happy to be there and grateful. People set the tone. And so it depends who the power players are on set.",
        "If you were to experience some sort of verbal abuse on a set, who would you go to to talk about that?",
        "Well it depends what your role is. If you’re a guest star and you came on set and someone yelled at you, you have less authority than if someone came on to your show. But definitely the producers, the showrunner, the ADs [assistant directors] ― there are so many people there to protect you and make sure that things are OK.",
        "If you weren’t getting the answers from your set, I guess you could go to your union rep. But I think usually your producers would want to help you. But then again, it depends on what the situation is. And I honestly feel that since a year ago, or whenever the [Me Too] stuff started coming out, people are more responsive.",
        "So you feel like there’s been a shift that you’ve witnessed in the last seven months of this national dialogue around sexual harassment and assault?",
        "Yeah. Because people know that it’s not just going into a vacuum. There is room for dialogue now because of the platform that’s happening.",
        "The calculation that you spoke of ― this idea that you put up with horrible behavior because someone’s talented. Do you think that same latitude is offered to women and people of color?",
        "I don’t know. I don’t think it’s just exclusive to white men. I think it’s dependent on the person. And sometimes because people are talented and genius, their behavior gets excused and they get into positions of power and no one is calling them out. It’s a lot about power, so it can happen across the board. Obviously it’s mostly white men, because that’s usually who’s in power.",
        "Also, the entertainment industry is so relationship-based. There is a casualness built in, which seems to allow people more easily to brush potentially violating behaviors off as just joking around.",
        "Yeah, I think that’s where that fine line is that gets really tricky. If you’re with a group of people for a long time who are creative artists, hopefully there is an understood sense of respect for each other and honor. And so some of those boundaries go down because you all trust each other, and you think a joke is a joke, and ultimately everyone is on the same page. And that’s best-case scenario: You all trust each other, you’re all there for each other, and then amazing creative things can happen. And people’s impulses are free and accepted.",
        "But then there’s that fine line, where someone, it can be just one person, doesn’t hold that respect and crosses a boundary. And then the lines get really blurry and confusing. And it’s so complicated because everyone wants that creative freedom. But respect has to be the baseline. One person thinks that they can do or say something that isn’t said with love or respect, and then all of a sudden you’re like, “I don’t feel safe anymore.”",
        "It’s such a fine line and I think it has to do with checking your privilege and actually respecting each other. I think that’s what’s underneath everything.",
        "This interview has been edited and condensed."

    "articleContent": [
        "Donald Trump’s former campaign adviser Roger Stone pressured an acquaintance to ask WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange for “damaging” emails on Hillary Clinton during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday.",
        "Stone has long denied any involvement with the trove of hacked Democratic National Committee emails that WikiLeaks published during the 2016 campaign. He also testified before the House Intelligence Committee last year that he only “wanted confirmation” that Assange had information about Trump’s opponent.",
        "But according to a series of emails The Wall Street Journal reviewed for its Thursday article, Stone did more than ask for confirmation. In September 2016, he apparently badgered radio personality Randy Credico to press Assange for emails related to Clinton’s alleged role in disrupting a purported Libyan peace deal while she was secretary of state.",
        "Credico reportedly emailed back that Stone should check the WikiLeaks website for the information he wanted, since WikiLeaks had already posted the hacked DNC emails that July. According to the Journal, Stone responded: “Why do we assume WikiLeaks has released everything they have???”",
        "Credico reportedly wrote to Stone that the Libya information would likely be in a “batch probably coming out in the next drop,” presumably meaning in the next set of hacked emails WikiLeaks published.",
        "“I can’t ask them favors every other day,” Credico complained, according to the Journal. “I asked one of his lawyers ... they have major legal headaches ... relax.”",
        "Stone became so insistent that Credico told the Journal that he “got tired” of Stone “bothering” him. Credico said he didn’t even pass along Stone’s message to Assange, whom he had interviewed for his radio program, but still told Stone that he had.",
        "Stone tweeted during the election that he had a “back channel” to Assange, which could have meant Credico. He soon deleted the tweet.",
        "In response to the Journal’s story, Stone sent a text message claiming that Credico and WikiLeaks had “provided nothing” to him and that his testimony before the House intelligence committee was “complete and accurate.”",
        "Investigators have scrutinized Stone for his claims that he communicated with both Assange and Guccifer 2.0, the Kremlin operative identified by U.S. officials as responsible for the DNC hack.",
        "Stone also appeared to know about WikiLeaks’ actions in advance. The day before WikiLeaks published hacked emails of Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta, Stone said Assange was going to deliver “a devastating expose of Hillary.” The emails were published the day the “Access Hollywood” tape was released of Trump boasting about grabbing women’s genitals.",
        "Stone said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet The Press” that he was prepared for an indictment as special counsel Robert Mueller investigates the Trump campaign’s possible collusion with the Russian government. The Mueller team may “conjure up some extraneous crime pertaining to my business,” Stone said. But he insisted he would not be charged with Russian collusion.",
        "Mueller’s team has not yet talked to Stone. But Stone told “Meet The Press” that eight of his former colleagues had been “terrorized” by investigators."

        "Protests prompted supermarket chain Publix to suspend all political contributions after it was revealed to have given more than half a million dollars to a Florida Republican who called himself a “proud NRA sellout.”",
        "Publix was found to have given $670,000 in donations over the past three years to Adam Putnam, Florida’s current agriculture commissioner, who is now running for governor. But in Florida, where a school shooter in Parkland killed 17 people earlier this year, many locals aren’t about to let a National Rifle Association “sellout” run their state.",
        "On Wednesday, Parkland shooting survivor and gun-control activist David Hogg issued a call on Twitter for people to stage a “die in” at the grocery store, which has locations throughout the Southeast.",
        "Prior to the demonstration, Publix issued a statement expressing “regret” that its political contributions had led to an “unintentional customer divide.” On Friday, it released a new statement saying it would be suspending political contributions.",
        "“We would never knowingly disappoint our customers or the communities we serve,” the company said in a statement provided to HuffPost. “As a result, we decided earlier this week to suspend corporate-funded political contributions as we reevaluate our giving processes.”",
        "The same day, Hogg attended a protest at a Coral Springs Publix, where he and supporters lay on the floor for 12 minutes.",
        "“USA over NRA!” the activists chanted at one point.",
        "“Suspended means nothing,” Ryan Deitsch, a March for Our Lives activist at the Coral Springs store, told the Sun Sentinel. “Publix knows we’re not going away.”"

        "Twitter bots could have swayed the presidential election enough to account for Donald Trump’s margin of victory, according to new research.",
        "Automated tweeting played a small but potentially decisive role in Trump’s win, according to a working paper released by the nonprofit National Bureau of Economic Research. The research suggests that bots touting Trump or attacking rival Hillary Clinton could have accounted for 3.23 percentage points of the vote for president, putting Trump over the top. Clinton won the popular vote, and a small added margin in critical districts could have put her over the top in some states and affected the Electoral College total.",
        "The research also suggests that the bots may have handed Brexit a win by influencing just 1.76 percent of the tally.",
        "“Our results suggest that, given narrow margins of victories in each vote, bots’ effect was likely marginal but possibly large enough to affect the outcomes,” said the paper’s authors, Yuriy Gorodnichenko from the University of California at Berkeley and Tho Pham and Oleksandr Talavera from the U.K.’s Swansea University.",
        "U.S. security officials have said the Kremlin attempted to sway the election for Trump via social media, using bots to inflate the impact of the messages. The research was an attempt to determine a concrete effect of bots on the 2016 presidential election and Brexit vote.",
        "The researchers amassed a database of tweets starting a month before the election. They identified human tweets vs. bots and examined how closely votes were correlated with pro-Trump Twitter activity in particular areas. They then calculated how much the accounts they defined as bots added to the volume of tweets that supported Trump.",
        "But some experts have criticized the research, saying it doesn’t have evidence to back up the assumption that pro-Trump tweets actually influenced voters.",
        "The working paper found that bots were most effective when they backed up a target’s prior opinion. Trump supporters, for example, tended to react to and spread messages sent by pro-Trump bots. Also, tweets with a “high degree of emotionality” reached a wider readership and were more likely to be disseminated, according to the paper. Pro-Trump tweets steadily outnumbered pro-Clinton tweets in the period examined, except for the final few days into the election, the research found.",
        "The New York Times reported earlier this year on research showing what little effect bot tweets likely had on voters’ ballots.",
        "In January, Twitter told Congress that 50,000 automated bot accounts linked to Russia retweeted Trump messages almost 500,000 times between September and November 2016 — nearly 10 times the number of their retweets for Clinton. Russian bots were also responsible for 200,000 retweets of WikiLeaks’ Twitter account during the same period when WikiLeaks published unflattering Democratic National Committee emails obtained by Russian hackers.",
        "Given the effect the bots may have had on the election outcome, the working paper’s authors suggest that bot control should be considered for future elections.",
        "“Cherishing diversity does not mean that one should allow dumping lies and manipulations to the extent that the public cannot make a well-informed decision,” the paper concludes. “Where one should draw the line (e.g., disclose ultimate owners of accounts, improve media literacy, introduce a ‘code of practice’ for social networks) is a central question for society.”"

        "The Proud Boys is a misogynistic far-right group with members who flirt with and often fully embrace white nationalism.",
        "Vic Berger is a comedy video editor who works for Super Deluxe. He has published a few videos outing Gavin McInnes, founder of the Proud Boys and co-founder of Vice Media, as a racist oaf.",
        "Then someone showed up outside his door.",
        "The new thing in right-wing goonery, apparently, is house calls.",
        "As Berger tells it, the encounter was brought on by several of his videos of McInnes, one of which is embedded below. In it, McInnes throws up a Nazi salute, says “nigger” over and over and plays with his butt:",
        "The Proud Boys, labeled a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, apparently took offense to the tweeted videos. Days after Berger posted the one above, the self-described “Western chauvinists” went nuclear.",
        "On May 9, a tipster sent Berger an internal document from within the Proud Boys’ network, which called on all members to find Berger’s personal information and threaten him.",
        "“Let’s get the social media profiles, phone numbers and addresses for their bosses, mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, boyfriends, friends and get to work,” it reads. “LET’S SHOW THEM THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES!!!”",
        "Less than two weeks later, a man rang the doorbell at Berger’s house in Pennsylvania. Suddenly, the email he’d brushed off as a joke became a very real threat.",
        "“When I answered the door, he seemed nervous, like he wasn’t expecting me. It was the middle of the day, and my wife was home,” Berger told HuffPost. “He said, ‘Are you Vic? Your videos are hurting a lot of people. You’re really hurting the Proud Boys. You need to stop making these videos.’”",
        "Berger, now terrified, turned back and screamed for his wife to call 911. He chased the man to his car and snapped a photo of the license plate:",
        "Berger reported the encounter to the police. An officer in the town, which Berger asked that we not reveal to protect his safety and privacy, confirmed that a report was filed.",
        "An in-person visit from the Proud Boys was revelatory. Sure, they and other hate groups online have a predilection for threats and doxing ― publishing personal information online as a form of harassment ― but this was an escalation. They were willing to physically intimidate a Twitter user they found disagreeable.",
        "“It was scary as hell,” he said. “I thought this was all just bullshit from the internet, they’ve always harassed me online. But now they’re sending thugs.”",
        "Proud Boys tend to cause problems, and attract white supremacists, wherever they go: the deadly Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville (former Proud Boy Jason Kessler helped organize it); the Portland Patriot Prayer; a march in Boulder, Colorado; a Boston march at which one Proud Boy was arrested after punching a 19-year-old woman.",
        "Meanwhile, their dear leader, McInnes, has called on the Proud Boys and other conservatives to commit violence in the past ― and Berger has documented it:",
        "The man who showed up on Berger’s doorstep appears to be Kenneth Lizardo, 54, a self-proclaimed Proud Boy who lives in Massachusetts. The license plate that Berger snapped in the photo, along with various public records, led us to Lizardo, whose Facebook page is decked out in Proud Boy regalia. Berger confirmed that the guy on the right in the photo below, Lizardo, is the man who showed up at his house:",
        "Lizardo responded to requests for comment via phone calls and direct messages by blocking us on social media.",
        "The Proud Boys have distanced themselves from the incident, with some accusing Berger of making the whole thing up. But internal communications between McInnes and his followers, sent to HuffPost by a source close to McInnes on the condition that we not quote the material, show McInnes alluding to the incident and saying he thought Berger deserved it.",
        "Berger and his cohorts don’t think this is an isolated incident involving one disgruntled Proud Boy, either. The same day Berger got word that the Proud Boys were coming after him, his friend and fellow videographer, Nathan Bernard, got a similar threat from a man who can be seen in Facebook photos with Lizardo. On Twitter, Proud Boy Vincenzo Molino wanted Bernard to know that he had his address (redacted by HuffPost):",
        "This is a classic intimidation tactic online. In this case, it’s intended to get Bernard and Berger to stop doing their jobs and to not call out racism and fascism when they see it. But both are worried that there’s no recourse for less prominent victims of the harassment mob.",
        "“I happen to have a platform that allows me to make this public, but the Proud Boys are most likely targeting people who do not have a platform,” Berger said. “They should be contributing positively to society instead of targeting and threatening people at their houses and trying to silence free speech.”",
        "Bernard likened the incident to “Pizzagate,” a conspiracy theory that started online and led to a man showing up at a Washington, D.C., restaurant and firing a gun. All you need is one person to take the online guff seriously for things to get scary.",
        "“At the end of the day, Gavin McInnes’ involvement doesn’t matter ― because of that one post, they went and got addresses, and they’re taking action based on that,” Bernard said. “This is now a trend. It’s like Pizzagate. It’s serious, and it needs to stop. Somehow.”"

        "date": "2018-05-25"
    },
    "articleContent": [
        "The Trump administration is poised to hand religious conservatives another victory: a slew of new federal rules that would give religious health care providers wide latitude to refuse to treat patients or perform procedures if doing so would violate their religious beliefs.",
        "Some of the most powerful hospital networks in the country have lobbied for these “conscience” rules, claiming they shouldn’t fear a legal risk for practicing medicine according to their religious beliefs. But those same hospital networks are already using religious justifications to place women in life-threatening situations with impunity, documents obtained by HuffPost show.",
        "At a hospital owned by Ascension, the largest Catholic hospital network in the country and a staunch proponent of a rule that would give nearly any health care worker the right to refuse care, doctors refused to intervene as a woman was undergoing a life-threatening miscarriage because they believed that doing so would be the same as performing an abortion, the documents show. Instead, they carted her out to the hospital parking lot so a relative could drive her to a different emergency room, where she underwent a massive blood transfusion and emergency surgery.",
        "Ascension, which operates more than 150 hospitals according to these same religious principles, also runs a hospital where doctors refused to perform a tubal ligation, even though the patient was at risk of dying if she ever became pregnant again. And at hospitals controlled by Trinity Health, a network that manages nearly 100 care centers around the Midwest, multiple women have accused doctors of withholding emergency medicine because it violated their prohibitions on certain kinds of reproductive health care.",
        "One of the new rules, which the Trump administration proposed in January but has not finalized, would limit patients’ and advocates’ ability to protest these incidents. The rules would broaden and define the legal right of virtually any health care worker, from surgeons to nursing home attendants to receptionists, to refuse to provide or facilitate medical services that go against their personal religious beliefs or their employer’s.",
        "The reach of the new guidelines would be widespread. The American health care system relies heavily on Catholic and other religiously affiliated hospitals. Around 1 out of every 6 hospital beds in the U.S. is located in a Catholic facility, according to a 2016 report. That means for many Americans, the closest hospital is one that might refuse to treat them.",
        "That’s what happened on Oct. 25, 2012, when a woman arrived at St. John Hospital and Medical Center of Detroit in an ambulance. The woman was between 17 and 23 weeks pregnant — a point where an infant would not survive outside the womb — and in the midst of a miscarriage. Her condition was life-threatening and indicated that she needed an emergency termination to prevent the risk of bleeding to death, according to a complaint later filed by a medical staffer at another hospital.",
        "Doctors at St. John recognized they would not be able to prevent the death of the woman’s fetus. But they refused to offer her emergency intervention.",
        "“I’m not sure why you’re here,” a doctor at St. John told the woman, according to the complaint. “We can’t help you since you’re having an abortion.”",
        "For a hospital, failing to try to stabilize a patient in a medical emergency is a violation of federal law. St. John broke this rule, then violated regulations again when it failed to transfer the woman to another hospital, federal investigators determined. When the woman left St. John, her heart rate was elevated and she was bleeding so much that staff were constantly cleaning blood off her body, according to documents from the investigation. But instead of calling an ambulance, St. John staff gave her directions to another hospital, placed her in a wheelchair and wheeled her into the parking lot. An unidentified woman then drove her away.",
        "“I think it was her mom or her aunt,” one staff member told an investigator. “I just saw her get into a car with a woman. Do you know if she got care at [the other hospital] and if she is OK?”",
        "In fact, once the woman arrived at Hutzel Women’s Hospital, she had a miscarriage and underwent emergency surgery to stop a “massive hemorrhage,” according to notes from the investigation. The woman had to be hospitalized for three days.",
        "Several weeks later, a staff member at Hutzel filed a complaint about the woman’s treatment with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid for “multiple episodes of poor care.” “It seems inconceivable that a major hospital with labor and delivery services lacks the ability to care for a pregnant patient who is having a miscarriage or postpartum hemorrhage,” wrote the staff member, who is unidentified in the documents. “I believe that further investigation into these events is warranted to determine... why she received improper management of her life-threatening condition. She is interested in understanding also.”",
        "In an interview with a federal investigator, a St. John staff member said, “We are a Catholic institution and we do not perform abortions here if there are fetal heart tones.” All of Ascension’s hospitals adhere to a set of ethical guidelines written by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops that bans abortion services or “material cooperation” in an abortion. The guidelines do allow doctors to perform certain procedures as long as the primary goal is not to terminate the pregnancy but to save the life of the mother. But in practice, many Catholic hospitals place a blanket ban on any procedure they consider an abortion.",
        "Ascension is not the only Catholic health care system pressing the Trump administration to protect it from consequences for risking patients’ lives. Trinity Health, which has lobbied the Trump administration to dismantle an Affordable Care Act rule prohibiting gender discrimination, owns and operates several hospitals that have been accused of violating federal laws requiring hospitals to provide patients with basic care. One woman accused a Trinity hospital of refusing to remove her intrauterine device, which had been dislodged when she fell down, causing her weeks of pain.",
        "Mercy Health Partners in Michigan, which Trinity owns, risked the lives of five women who were having dangerous miscarriages by failing to offer a kind of medical intervention the hospital considered to be abortion, a whistleblower told federal authorities. All of the women suffered potentially fatal infections for which the typical treatment is to hasten the miscarriage. The whistleblower later reported three more cases where medical records suggested the hospital withheld certain treatment options because of its Catholic affiliation, according to federal records obtained by HuffPost.",
        "A spokesperson for Mercy Health Partners declined to comment. Ascension did not respond to a request for comment for this story.",
        "Religiously affiliated hospitals already rarely face consequences for refusing to provide treatments. Under former President Barack Obama, the Department of Health and Human Services made a brief and perfunctory threat to suspend St. John’s right to participate in Medicare, but dropped it once St. John took “corrective action.” Trinity Health did not receive any major citations for breaking any laws after federal investigators received the complaints about Mercy. And courts have dismissed a string of lawsuits against Catholic hospitals for refusing reproductive health care.",
        "With the new rules in place, they could enjoy even more protection."

    "articleContent": [
        "The U.S. Justice Department this month is expected to approve a merger of two huge corporations ― St. Louis-based seed company Monsanto and German crop-chemical conglomerate Bayer ― and the consequences could be enormous.",
        "The $66 billion deal, already approved by the European Union, will create the world’s biggest pesticides and seeds monopoly. The hookup will confine 61 percent of global seeds and pesticides production in the hands of just three megacorporations ― the other two being newly merged DowDuPont, and ChemChina, which acquired pesticides and seed company Syngenta last year.",
        "Is that a problem?",
        "It depends who you ask. Monsanto and Bayer are pitching their consolidation as a way to develop the technology and innovation necessary to feed a world that in two decades is likely to be home to 10 billion people. For critics ― environmentalists and many farmers ― it’s a terrifying step toward a near-monopoly in agriculture, giving giant companies unprecedented access to farmer data, squeezing out small farmers, and potentially raising food prices for consumers.",
        "Monsanto is already a bogeyman for environmentalists because of its genetically modified seeds ― which critics say promote monocultures, trapping farmers into a cycle of dependence as well as an increased reliance on chemicals ― along with its history of producing controversial chemicals such as Agent Orange and the weedkiller glyphosate.",
        "Many conservationists fear the merger continues a trend of concentrating huge power over the global food supply in just a handful of corporate giants.",
        "“We will witness in our lifetimes the total disappearance of biodiversity from our farms, the disappearance of small farmers, and the end of real food and our food freedom,” Vandana Shiva, the veteran seeds campaigner, has previously warned.",
        "Evgeniy Kozarenko, CEO of the Dublin-based organic seed treatment company Nagritech, is worried. The U.S. and the European Union “just approved the creation of a monster,” he told HuffPost. “Together, these two companies will influence farmers’ opinions and markets all over the world on a scale we’ve never seen before. We do not have the budgets to market our organic fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides. Other organic manufacturers also will not be able to compete.”",
        "These fears are amplified by a growing concern that farming is on the cusp of a digital revolution that could allow the agribusiness to exert unprecedented control over farmers. Friends of the Earth Europe and several nongovernmental organizations have accused the EU of allowing a “Facebook of farming” to be created. Companies would be able to access farmers’ data to sell them seeds and pesticides.",
        "“It’s not difficult to imagine a smartphone ad arriving within seconds of a farmer encountering weed or insect damage while he’s harvesting his crop,” the Missouri Farm Bureau Federation has said.",
        "Monsanto itself has hinted that data is a key reason for seeking the merger with Bayer. “There is no new dirt,” Monsanto CEO Hugh Grant told Fortune. “We need to get much smarter societally about how we farm.”",
        "The seed company has already invested heavily in the digital economy, shelling out nearly $1 billion in 2013 to buy the Climate Corp., a data company that provides farmers with weather data and predictions. The technology was reportedly being used on more than one-third of all U.S. farmland in 2014.",
        "Monsanto’s “farm-to-fork” data platform, Climate Fieldview, which the company promotes as a “key 2018 growth driver,” uses tractors fitted with sensors and GPS, algorithms, and data drones to monitor field conditions and advise farmers in real time.",
        "“The merger will create the biggest platform of its kind ― and give Bayer-Monsanto a ‘first mover’ advantage similar to Facebook, in the way that it affects competitors,” said Mute Schimpf, a spokeswoman for Friends of the Earth Europe. “The new platform allows Bayer-Monsanto to control how, where, when, and by whom food is produced. As Facebook’s algorithms decide which newsfeeds we see, so ‘Baysanto’ will decide which pesticides are used, and which seeds are planted.”",
        "Friends of the Earth was one of more than 70 environmental organizations that signed a letter to the European Commission arguing that “Bayer-Monsanto would become the biggest player in the field of data platforms and data collection, exposing farmers to risks and problems similar to those seen in existing data platforms such as Google, Amazon and Facebook.”",
        "Monsanto, however, says it’s the farmers who will benefit from the deal. “Now more than ever, farmers need access to tools that support the decisions they make to maximize their return on every acre,” said Brian Carroll, a company spokesman. He added that this kind of data helps farmers farm more sustainably and manage their risks.",
        "Other Monsanto officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because of company restrictions on discussing the issue, told HuffPost that farmers were “a pretty cynical bunch” and would reject any platform they see as too self-serving.",
        "But not everyone is convinced. More than 1 million people last year petitioned the EU’s competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, to block the deal, which polls showed was deeply unpopular.",
        "In the U.S., groups representing farmers and conservation organizations wrote to the Justice Department predicting negative impacts on competition, farmers and consumers. They argued that the combination of seed and digital businesses would allow huge corporations to “create proprietary platforms that are closed to competition.”",
        "Monsanto officials are cagey about the need for new laws. “The worry would be if regulation drives paranoia,” one company official said. “If the debate ended in a situation where farmers were scared about sharing their data, it would undermine a huge opportunity for, ultimately, more sustainable farming practices.”",
        "Opportunities remain, though, for price discrimination and the use of data platforms to sell seeds, pesticides and fertilizers ― all of which, for now, is unregulated.",
        "The Missouri Farm Bureau Federation says it’s in ongoing negotiations with agroindustry representatives about who owns data collected by digital apps such as Climate Fieldview.",
        "“Two major concerns we have are: How is this going to affect the prices of products, and how is it going to affect the availability of products,” Spencer Tuma, the federation’s legislative affairs director, told HuffPost. She added that the group was worried about potential impacts on farmers, ranchers and ultimately consumers in the form of higher food prices.",
        "“We think there is a responsibility for Congress to review some of the existing statutes governing whether those sorts of mergers have the ability to go through,” Tuma said.",
        "Congress has the power to revise or rewrite existing merger laws. In July, 19 senators set out their concerns about the merger to the Justice Department’s antitrust division, so congressional action cannot be ruled out.",
        "Carroll, though, was sanguine. “Bayer’s acquisition by Monsanto has undergone a lengthy and robust regulatory review process by the relevant competition authorities,” he said.",
        "U.S. environmentalists are demanding that Monsanto sell Climate Fieldview as a condition of the deal. That leaves the fate of the world’s agricultural data ― who owns it, and how it is used ― undecided.",

        "The Texas shooting was the 16th school shooting this year. Another school shooting took place while this article was being written.",
        "But the NRA says guns aren’t the problem. Here’s a look at all the other things the group has said are the reasons for the horrifying uptick in gun violence at schools.",
        "A “culture of violence”",
        "Incoming NRA president Oliver North said the solution to mass shootings at schools is to focus on the “disease,” which is not about easy access to guns.",
        "“The disease is youngsters who are steeped in a culture of violence,” North said on Fox News Sunday. “They have been drugged in many cases. Nearly all of these perpetrators are male and they are young teenagers in most cases.”",
        "Godlessness",
        "NRATV host Grant Stinchfield said it’s helpful to offer “thoughts and prayers” after every mass shooting because it brings God back into the discussion.",
        "“Taking God out of our culture ... is at least partly to blame for the violence we see today,” he said on his Monday show.",
        "Too many doors in schools",
        "Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, a fierce opponent of gun control, said the Santa Fe shooting may have been caused by schools having “too many entrances” and that it may be time “to look at the design of our schools moving forward.”",
        "NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch tweeted that Patrick is “exactly right.”",
        "Unhealthy diets",
        "NRA board member Ted Nugent said Tuesday that kids’ unhealthy diets are making them want to shoot up their schools.",
        "“Mark my words when the studies are finalized, you will find that Columbine, Virginia Tech, Aurora, certainly Sandy Hook, these maniac murderers in Parkland and now Santa Fe, if you really studied the slovenliness and the zombie-like conduct of these murderers, you go back to their diet and examine what they’ve put into their sacred temple, and it’s all garbage,” Nugent said in an interview on Newsmax TV, a conservative media outlet.",
        "“I know people think I’m trying to get away from the gun issue, but it’s not a gun issue,” he added. “It is a conduct issue.”",
        "Ritalin",
        "North said the combination of kids growing up in a violent culture and then taking medication for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is causing a spike in school shootings.",
        "“They have come through a culture where violence is commonplace. All you need to do is turn on the TV, go to a movie,” he said on Fox News Sunday. “If you look at what has happened to the young people, many of these young boys have been on Ritalin since they were in kindergarten.”",
        "The overmedication of children",
        "“The problems that are producing scores of isolated young disturbed children who have convinced themselves that murdering their classmates is the way to get attention will not be solved at the gun store. It is in the home,” Loesch said Tuesday on an NRATV segment titled “The Overmedication of Children Is an Epidemic.”",
        "“It’s about the kind of people we’re raising these kids to become,” she said.",
        "“Progressive culture”",
        "NRATV commentator Colion Noir said loose gun laws aren’t the problem behind school shootings. It’s America’s progressive culture.",
        "“When are we going to be completely honest and acknowledge the awkward, bullied, sexually frustrated, psychotropic drug-laced, suicidal, mass shooters in the room for what they are?” he said on a Sunday NRATV segment. “Or are we just going to keep acting like we don’t know what’s going on in the name of not confronting the miserable reality that they are a creation of our so-called progressive culture and media?”",
        "Criticizing masculinity as toxic",
        "In the same segment, Noir blamed school shootings on parents failing to teach their kids “how to cope with the harsh realities of life.”",
        "“We shield them in safe spaces and give them participation trophies incentivizing mediocrity, and tell our young boys that their masculinity is toxic and our young girls that being a woman means acting like a man, further confusing the hell out of kids who are naturally going to struggle with their identity as is,” said Noir.",
        "Mainstream media",
        "NRATV host Grant Stinchfield said Monday that mainstream media outlets “wrote the mass shooters playbook.”",
        "“I place some of the blame on the #MSM. They recruit new players to their dark real life mass shooting reality show,” he tweeted."

        "The best way to watch Harvey Weinstein walk himself into a Manhattan police precinct on Friday morning was via NBC News’ Periscope.",
        "As the former Oscar-winning Hollywood producer and “king of indie film” marched from his black car into the police station, NBC correspondent Craig Melvin began naming some of the 95 women who have come forward with allegations against Weinstein ― Lucia Evans, Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie, Lupita Nyong’o, Uma Thurman, Salma Hayek. Reaction icons started floating up the right side of the screen, little hearts of different colors, one after another after another, until they formed a cloud of “likes.”",
        "We, the people of the internet, were engaging in a collective act of schadenfreude, and it was delicious.",
        "Women are so often told to contain our anger, to make it more palatable, less “aggressive,” small enough to contain within the male prerogative. But I’m angry at men like Harvey Weinstein, and there’s nothing palatable about it.",
        "The man who beckoned young women to his hotel rooms for the sole purpose of using them, who hired ex-Mossad agents to track anyone liable to expose him, who had vast resources at his fingertips and used them liberally to try to silence the dozens of women he (allegedly) victimized ― even that man is no longer untouchable.",
        "That man had to walk past reporters as he entered a police station, submitting to the cheap cop pornography of the perp walk. That man looked haggard and tilted his head low to avoid eyes and questions. That man also carried two books with him into the police station, biographies of Big Men in Show Biz — Elia Kazan, and Rodgers and Hammerstein — because he is, after all, exactly the kind of prick who fancies himself both a legend and a victim of a pious mob. That man was charged with rape, committing a criminal sex act, sexual abuse and sexual misconduct.",
        "It is still shocking to see powerful men face criminal charges for harming women, and even more shocking to see them convicted. And the process leading up to that ― the public offerings of private pain (hers and hers and hers and hers and hers and hers and hers and hers and hers and hers and hers …), the scrutiny of that pain, the way it’s picked apart and held up to the light and valued according to how neatly it can be added to a pile of other women’s pain ― is not a pretty one. The rapid rise of the Me Too movement has been exhilarating to witness but also exhausting.",
        "There are few moments of relief when an eternity of systemic abuse is being unpacked and processed. When those moments do present themselves, your instinct is to seize them like a prize. Weinstein is the man behind some of the most recognizable films of my lifetime, but surely the footage many of us will most remember him for is Friday’s walk. A big man in a blue sweater, displayed like any other perp for our delectation, tokens of self-pity and self-regard in the crook of his arm.",
        "As Rose McGowan tweeted Friday morning: “We got you, Harvey Weinstein, we got you.”",
        "I hope all 95 women who have said Weinstein violated them saw the footage, and I hope they let themselves feel even a nanosecond of pleasure. When (some) men are (finally) held accountable for their abuses, it does not undo the pain and damage they’ve wrought. But maybe, just maybe, it feels damn good to watch."

        "President Donald Trump on Friday signed a series of executive orders that could make it easier to fire federal government employees, potentially undermining the unions that represent them.",
        "The three executive orders Trump issued would reduce the timeframe for firing poor performers, curtail the amount of paid time federal employees can receive for union work and direct agencies to negotiate more restrictive union contracts in a timely fashion.",
        "By signing the orders, the president was “fulfilling his promise to promote a more efficient government by reforming civil service rules,” Andrew Bremberg, director of the White House Domestic Policy Council, said in a call with reporters.",
        "“Every year, the Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey shows that less than one third of federal employees believe poor performers are adequately addressed by their agency,” Bremberg said, according to Government Executive. “These executive orders make it easier to remove poor performing employees, and ensure that taxpayer dollars are more efficiently used.”",
        "Unions representing federal workers denounced the orders on Friday, calling Trump’s actions an “assault on democracy.”",
        "J. David Cox Sr., president of the American Federation of Government Employees, said in a statement that the orders constituted “a direct assault on the legal rights and protections that Congress has specifically guaranteed to the 2 million public-sector employees across the country who work for the federal government.”",

    "articleContent": [
        "By Chris Riotta",
        "John Peery self-identifies as a few things: he’s a straight white male, an actor who goes by the stage name “John Pizza” and, perhaps most importantly, a “RuPaul’s Drag Race” super fan. He and his girlfriend, Candace Thompson, watch the show at viewing parties hosted by Syndicated, their local watering hole in Brooklyn, each week.",
        "“Porkchop is a hometown hero,” he told me at the bar, recalling one of the most famous drag queens from the show’s first season, who hails from Peery’s hometown of Raleigh, North Carolina. “If they were playing the hockey game when we walked in at 7:30, I can guarantee you we wouldn’t still be standing here right now.”",
        "In its tenth season, the reality TV show in which drag queens compete to win $100,000 appears to be going mainstream. After moving from the Logo network to VH1 last year, when it broke viewership records and quickly became the highest-rated original program in its competitive time slot, the show has grown from having a cult-like following into a full-blown pop culture phenomenon, with viewers from all walks of life becoming invested in the queens and their personal journeys.",
        "“Even if some people aren’t here to watch the show, they’re still catching and picking up things about a world they once knew nothing about,” Thompson, who identifies as queer, added. “The language, the culture…it’s making important progress.”",
        "Syndicated is just one of countless venues across New York City and the rest of the country that’s beginning to take notice of “Drag Race.” Gay bars, however, have been hosting weekly viewing parties for years, where guests drink RuPaul-themed cocktails and watch the drama unfold on projector screens, often followed by raucous, live drag shows.",
        "Now, bars and clubs that don’t cater exclusively to the LGBT community have started organizing similar weekly events, inviting straight fans to watch the competition side-by-side with the folks whose art form is responsible for the show’s commercial success.",
        "“Drag Race” viewing parties at non-LGBTQ venues provide an educational opportunity for mainstream society to learn more about queer culture, according to Ariel Italic, a drag queen and member of the nightlife entertainment trio, The Nobodies. Each week, Ariel spends three hours applying makeup and preparing for her hosting gig at Brooklyn Bazaar, where she said a “decidedly mixed crowd” seeks out an immersive experience while watching the show.",
        "“I think for a straight audience who is trying to figure the show out, having queer fans around can be a good way to get insight into how to interpret what’s happening on the screen,” Ariel told me. “Like, rather than having to ask questions, you can watch where everyone else is laughing or booing or cheering, and you can hear what sort of slang from the show they use in casual conversation and what doesn’t make it from the show into the real world. It gives context.”",
        "Fans pour into the Brooklyn Bazaar’s vintage grand ballroom just before “Drag Race” begins at 8:00 p.m., finding their place among a sea of blue and green lawn chairs under fringed chandeliers, with glasses of red wine and draft beer in hand.",
        "Ariel and The Nobodies remain busy throughout the entire night, conducting a game of bingo that correlates with the ongoing episode, cracking jokes and performing lip syncs during the commercial breaks. Straight couples and groups of straight friends often wander into the parties “to see what all the fuss is about,” Ariel said.",
        "“Drag is a way to push people to look at the walls they’ve put up around different parts of gender or sexuality or beauty or whatever else,” she continued. “I hope that as more people get used to drag as a light-hearted, comedic medium full of sparkles and death drops, it can pave a way to the appreciation of the more intellectual and political aspects of drag. There’s a lot of smarts behind the spectacle.”",
        "Mainstream pop culture isn’t the only thing to potentially benefit from the show’s continued prominence. Jee Song, director of events at the Museum of Sex in Manhattan, says ticket sales have been “steadily climbing” since the venue first decided to begin hosting viewing parties last year, describing the success of the weekly event as a “pleasant surprise.”",
        "The Museum of Sex offers a “Drag Race” viewing experience in a club-like atmosphere. A DJ plays top 40 music during commercials as drag queens, fans and party-goers socialize over RuPaul-themed Smirnoff cocktails. When the show returns from a commercial break, everyone temporarily shuts the party down and immediately turns their attention to RuPaul.",
        "Like most other viewing parties, the setting isn’t the typical cliche one thinks of when hearing the term “safe space,” since there isn’t much political correctness about “Drag Race” or the comedy employed by many queens in each episode. Still, the environment is one which allows for wide-ranging conversations to take place, and for straight people to ask questions to LGBT viewers about queer culture — so long as those questions “come from a place of genuine interest,” as Ariel Italic stressed. Song said the museum wanted to create an event surrounding “Drag Race” promoting “positive interactions” between the show’s fans of varying backgrounds and sexual orientations.",
        "“We wanted to create a community where there is no judgement,” Song said about the museum’s decision to host “Drag Race” viewing parties. “It’s like magic: everyone enjoys it ... It seems to be this key to opening up a lot of different doors, and having it all come together in a melting-pot kind of way.”",
        "“‘Drag Race’ taps into the psyche that life can be fun, it can be joyous, and it can be celebrated, no matter who you are,” she added.",

        "China Wants Summit",
        "China, North Korea’s main ally, said it hoped the summit between Kim and Trump could proceed smoothly, after Trump cast further doubt over whether it would go ahead.",
        "Both countries should cherish the opportunity and all parties should ensure that dialogue leads to a positive outcome, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said at a regular briefing.",

        "The apparent destruction of what North Korea says is its only nuclear test site has been widely welcomed as a positive, if largely symbolic, step toward resolving tension over its weapons. North Korean leader Kim has declared his nuclear force complete and amid speculation the site was obsolete anyway.",
        "According to recent academic reports, North Korea’s last test, in September, of what it said was a hydrogen bomb, was so large it triggered a collapse inside the mountain, rendering the site geologically unusable for more tests.",
        "Kim has insisted there were undamaged tunnels at the site, and U.S. intelligence officials have said Punggye-ri remains usable, despite what one official called “some minor geological disturbances” that could be natural or triggered by the September test.",

        "date": "2018-05-24"
    },
    "articleContent": [
        "President Donald Trump on Thursday canceled a highly anticipated summit with Kim Jong Un, claiming the North Korean leader had passed up a great opportunity at lasting peace. But experts tell HuffPost it was Kim who provoked Trump to ax the June 12 meeting ― isolating the U.S. from its Asian allies and indefinitely postponing talks of Pyongyang’s denuclearization.",
        "“Kim baited Trump into pulling out of the summit, and Trump took the bait,” said Vipin Narang, a professor of international relations at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",
        "The Breakdown",
        "The meeting was always a risky endeavor. Trump and Kim spent the better part of 2017 trading insults and threats over North Korea’s aggressive development of nuclear warheads. But on March 8, South Korea’s national security adviser announced from the White House that Trump and Kim had agreed to meet. As discussions over the details of the summit unfolded ― where would it take place, and what exactly would be at stake ― Trump boasted that the development was proof his belligerent stance against Pyongyang could bring the regime to the negotiating table.",
        "But many analysts were unsurprised that a Trump administration short on foreign policy experience wasn’t able to pull it off. “They clearly don’t have the personnel in place and the mindset to accomplish much in these delicate sorts of exchanges,” said Joshua Pollack, a senior research associate with the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey. “We can’t even reach and stick to trade agreements with close partners.”",
        "Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush spent years trying to reach agreements with North Korea to curtail its nuclear and missile programs, but the talks proved fraught with complications. North Korean diplomats are experts in sending mixed signals, often suggesting a willingness to compromise before reversing tack. During negotiations with the Trump administration, North Korea announced it would not agree to a summit if the U.S. insisted on denuclearization, the major focus of the talks. Just this week, North Korea proudly announced it would destroy a nuclear test site, but at the same time reportedly put off the Trump administration’s questions about arrangements for the summit.",
        "“I’m not at all surprised the whole thing blew up,” said Van Jackson, a North Korea expert at the Victoria University of Wellington. “The structure of the situation and the basic conflict of interests had not changed at all from last year.”",
        "As more and more fractures emerged in the lead-up to June 12, it became clear Trump wouldn’t get the easy public relations victory he’d envisioned.",
        "“This was never taken seriously as an arms control negotiation, it was only taken seriously as a stage show to make Donald Trump look big and powerful,” said Stephen Schwartz, an independent nuclear policy consultant. “I felt that as things drew closer and Trump realized like he wasn’t going to get the grand submission with Kim on his knees, that things were not going to go well.”",
        "Bruised egos were at least partly at the core of the summit’s collapse, said Jeff Lewis, the director of the East Asia nonproliferation program at the Middlebury Institute.",
        "“North Korea did the one thing Trump couldn’t handle: humiliate him. I think Trump was prepared to swallow the idea of Kim keeping his nuclear arsenal, but he is not prepared to swallow his pride,” Lewis said. “Trump is the one who’s going to take the blame for this.”",
        "The Risks",
        "Trump’s haphazard attempt at a deal, followed by his abrupt exit, may have far-reaching consequences, analysts fear. The lead-up to the summit provided Kim with an opportunity to reduce tensions and sanctions, and its breakdown brought North Korea the added benefit of creating a rift between the U.S. and its Asian allies.",
        "“Kim also wanted to drive a wedge between the U.S. and South Korea, the U.S. and Japan, the U.S. and China, and he’s done that,” Schwartz said. “Donald Trump fell right into it, and he has no one to blame but himself.”",
        "Thursday’s news was devastating to Seoul, which appeared blindsided by the announcement. South Korean President Moon Jae-in has been performing diplomatic gymnastics behind the scenes to minimize the possibility of a military confrontation on the Korean Peninsula.",
        "At the same time, the cancellation eases pressure on China, North Korea’s closest ally and trading partner. For months, the U.S. had strong-armed Beijing to pressure Kim’s regime into denuclearization. It’s unlikely the Chinese will once again be willing to ratchet up the pressure after the negotiations provided a softening of relations.",
        "“The maximum pressure campaign is broke,” Pollack said. “It’s over.”",
        "What’s Next",
        "It’s unclear how international negotiations with North Korea will unfold following Trump’s decision. Experts worry the U.S. may find itself diplomatically isolated, with few options to limit Pyongyang’s nuclear program through sanctions or negotiations. At the same time, Trump’s new national security adviser, John Bolton, has made it clear he wants to keep military options open.",
        "“If North Korea starts testing missiles or nuclear weapons again, then we’re back to 2017 or worse, and we now have a national security adviser that’s gone on the record talking about a first strike of North Korea. We could be in a very different world,” Narang said.",
        "Jackson also fears that tensions between Washington and Pyongyang could flare up to dangerous levels yet again.",
        "“With no summit in the offing, the preventive war narrative is likely to make a comeback,” he said. “Dangerous times ahead.”"

        "North Korea has escalated its war of words with the U.S., repeating a threat on Thursday to call off the planned June 12 summit with President Donald Trump and warning that a “nuclear showdown” could instead be on the table.",
        "In a statement published by North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency, the North’s vice minister of foreign affairs, Choe Son Hui, blamed “reckless” remarks made by top U.S. officials as the reason behind Pyongyang’s second thoughts.",
        "Choe took aim at Vice President Mike Pence in particular, calling him a “political dummy” who’d offended North Korea with his “unbridled and impudent” comments. Pence had warned in a Fox News interview on Monday that Pyongyang could follow the “Libya model” if leader Kim Jong Un “doesn’t make a deal” ― a reference to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, who met a brutal end following his decision to denuclearize after negotiations with the U.S.",
        "North Korea has long expressed distaste at comparisons with Libya. Pyongyang has said that its nuclear capabilities are far more advanced than Libya’s ever were ― and has stressed its expectation that it be treated as a nuclear state on equal footing with the U.S. and other nuclear powers.",
        "Choe echoed this scorn in her statement Thursday, saying North Korea has no interest in meeting the same “tragic fate” as the northern African nation.",
        "“I cannot suppress my surprise at such ignorant and stupid remarks gushing out from the mouth of the U.S. vice president,” Choe said, referring to Pence’s Libya comments, according to a Wall Street Journal translation.",
        "“In case the U.S. offends against our goodwill and clings to unlawful and outrageous acts, I will put forward a suggestion to our supreme leadership for reconsidering the [Kim-Trump] summit,” Choe added, saying that it was up to the U.S. to decide whether it wanted to negotiate in a “meeting room or encounter us [in a] nuclear-to-nuclear showdown.”",
        "Still, North Korea on Thursday invited journalists to witness what appeared to be the demolition of its main nuclear test site. The Associated Press and South Korean media reported several explosions at the secluded Punggye-ri location.",
        "This is the second time in about a week that North Korea has threatened to withdraw from the U.S. summit — deviating starkly from a monthslong trend of warming relations.",
        "Last week, Pyongyang abruptly canceled talks with South Korea and cast doubt on the meeting with Trump after taking issue with recent joint military exercises undertaken by Seoul and Washington.",
        "Kim Kye Gwan, another top North Korean official, said in a statement last Wednesday that Pyongyang would be forced to “reconsider” the Trump meeting if the U.S. insisted on “unilateral nuclear abandonment.”",
        "Criticism of the “Libya model” also came up in Kim’s statement, with the official criticizing White House national security adviser John Bolton for suggesting the U.S. would urge Pyongyang to rapidly dismantle its entire nuclear program as Libya did years ago.",
        "“If the United States is trying to drive us into a corner to force our unilateral nuclear abandonment, we will no longer be interested in such dialogue and cannot but reconsider our proceeding to the North Korea-U.S. summit,” Kim said.",
        "Trump suggested Tuesday that he’d be open to a phased dismantling of North Korea’s nuclear program ― a departure from his earlier demand for total and immediate denuclearization, reported The New York Times.",
        "Also on Tuesday, Trump, who met with South Korean President Moon Jae In at the White House, said there was a “very substantial chance” that the summit with Kim Jong Un could be postponed.",
        "“We’re moving along. We’ll see what happens. There are certain conditions we want to happen. I think we’ll get those conditions. And if we don’t, we won’t have the meeting,” Trump told reporters, without specifying what those “conditions” would be.",
        "On Wednesday, Trump told Fox News there was a “good chance” that the summit would take place.",
        "North Korea experts said they still expect the summit to happen, though the journey to get there may be rocky.",
        "“In effect, President Trump is getting a mini-lesson in talking to the North Koreans even before he talks to the North Koreans,” Jung Pak, a Brookings Institution fellow and former CIA analyst, told the Times this week.",
        "Mintaro Oba, a former state department expert on the Koreas, suggested last week that Trump “keep calm and carry on,” and that the North’s threat to cancel is “par for the course.”",
        "“The question is whether they’re willing to go so far as to go through with it, or whether they’re mainly trying to gain some leverage [or] test how much we want the summit,” he wrote on Twitter.",
        "This has been updated to include reports of North Korea’s nuclear test site demolition."

        "Given his dramatic history with the singer ― Cohen once joked about Katy Perry with Swift and it didn’t go down well ― it seemed like things could’ve been super awkward. Luckily, Cohen told HuffPost, it was anything but.",
        "“She was super nice ― so nice,” the talk show host said Tuesday at a Purina ONE and Petfinder Foundation event. “She turned around and was really sweet to me about my pink suit ― we were wearing the same color. She was awesome.”",
        "But did he bring up Perry again, now that the two singers have reconciled?",
        "“No, I did not,” Cohen said with a smile. And for good reason.",
        "Two years ago, Cohen was attending the Met Gala when he ran into Swift, who was looking for a seat to watch Lady Gaga’s performance. For some reason, he decided to point out where she could settle down.",
        "“Why I felt I needed to get involved I will never know (maybe I was auditioning for her squad?) but I innocently said exactly the wrong thing to her, which was, ‘Your friend Katy is sitting in the corner and there’s plenty of room around her,’” Cohen recounted in his book Superficial: More Adventures From the Andy Cohen Diaries.",
        "Swift apparently asked him, “Katy who?” and then, as you might expect, things escalated a bit.",
        "“I said ‘Perry,’ at which point she clearly let me know that she’s the exact opposite of her friend,” Cohen wrote.",
        "Despite Swift’s request that he not talk about the encounter on his show (to his credit, he did not), the 49-year-old obviously discussed the Met Gala encounter in his book.",
        "At this year’s gala (which Swift did not attend), Cohen chatted it up with a fellow “Vanderpump Rules” and Lisa Vanderpump fan ― Rihanna herself.",
        "The two talked about “Vanderpump Rules,” and then Cohen tried to convince Rih to sit down with him on “Watch What Happens Live.”",
        "“I was like ‘When are you coming on my show?’ I was just really trying to get her on,” Cohen told HuffPost. Maybe if Lisa Vanderpump is there, it just might happen.",
        "Cohen recently wrapped his reunion episodes with the cast of “Vanderpump Rules” after one of its best seasons yet. The three-part sit-down was nearly as dramatic as the season itself, with Jax Taylor talking about the death of his father, some Lala Kent and Scheana Marie Shay tension, and a tearful Scheana and Lala walk-off. Cohen told HuffPost that he’s “been encouraging them not to walk off, but you’re never gonna not have a walk-off,” which sounds about right.",
        "But preparing for the drama ― and the lines of questioning that audiences love and Bravolebrities hate ― doesn’t take Cohen long at all.",
        "“For me, I’m kind of born ready ’cause I’ve seen every episode, I know what happened behind the scenes, I know how the viewers feel from doing ‘Watch What Happens Live’ every week and reading my Twitter feed and stuff ― so ya know, I’m ready to go,” Cohen said.",
        "Even when he did his favorite interview ever ― with Oprah ― Cohen said it didn’t take long to get ready.",
        "“She means so much to me and I love her so much. I was really nervous for that and I wanted to be on top of my game,” he said. “Again, I was kind of born ready. I’d watched so many hours of ‘The Oprah Winfrey Show,’ I’d been like kind of a student of hers so I feel like I was sort of ready to go.”",
        "While preparation might not drag him down, there are some hard parts that come along with Cohen’s many jobs. For “Watch What Happens Live,” he says it’s the “shlong down to SoHo at 10 p.m. every night” (though we’d also suspect trying to get Swift and Rihanna on the show is a bit tough, as they haven’t made appearances yet).",
        "“And then, the hardest part of the ‘Housewives’ is just kind of dealing with strong personalities,” he said of the iconic franchise he helps produce.",
        "That sounds like one work hazard that just won’t go away."

        "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Donald Trump administration has launched a national security investigation into car and truck imports that could lead to new U.S. tariffs similar to those imposed on imported steel and aluminum in March.",
        "The national security probe under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 would investigate whether vehicle and parts imports were threatening the industry’s health and ability to research and develop new, advanced technologies, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday.",
        "“There is evidence suggesting that, for decades, imports from abroad have eroded our domestic auto industry,” Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement, promising a “thorough, fair and transparent investigation.”",
        "Higher tariffs could be particularly painful for Asian automakers including Toyota Motor Corp, Nissan Motor Co, Honda Motor Co and Hyundai Motor Co, which count the United States as a key market, and the announcement sparked a broad sell-off in automakers’ shares across the region.",
        "The governments of Japan, China and South Korea said they would monitor the situation, while Beijing, which is increasingly eyeing the United States as a potential market for its cars, added that it would defend its interests.",
        "“China opposes the abuse of national security clauses, which will seriously damage multilateral trade systems and disrupt normal international trade order,” Gao Feng, spokesman at the Ministry of Commerce, said at a regular news briefing on Thursday which focused largely on whether Beijing and Washington are making any progress in their growing trade dispute.",
        "“We will closely monitor the situation under the U.S. probe and fully evaluate the possible impact and resolutely defend our own legitimate interests.”",
        "Courting Voters",
        "The probe comes as Trump courts voters in the U.S. industrial heartland ahead of mid-term elections later this year, and opens a new front in his “America First” trade agenda aimed at clawing back manufacturing jobs lost to overseas competitors.",
        "It could raise the costs for overseas automakers to export vehicles and parts to the world’s second-largest auto market.",
        "Growing trade tensions over cars and car parts, particularly with China, could raise risks for U.S. companies expanding their presence in the country, signs of which are already emerging.",
        "Earlier this month, Reuters reported that Ford Motor Co’s imported vehicles were being held up at Chinese ports, adding to a growing list of U.S. products facing issues at China’s borders.",
        "The majority of vehicles sold in the United States by Japanese and South Korean automakers are produced there, but most firms also export to the U.S. from plants in Asia, Mexico, Canada and other countries.",
        "Roughly one-third of all U.S. vehicle imports last year were from Asia.",
        "In addition to recently imposed 25 percent tariffs on steel and 10 percent tariffs on aluminum imports, the administration has threatened tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods over intellectual property complaints, and Beijing has vowed to respond.",
        "The administration is also trying to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement to return more auto production to the United States.",
        "Commerce said the new probe would determine whether lost domestic production had weakened the U.S. “internal economy” and its ability to develop connected vehicle systems, autonomous vehicles, fuel cells, electric motors and batteries, and advanced manufacturing processes.",
        "In a separate statement, Trump said: “Core industries such as automobiles and automotive parts are critical to our strength as a Nation.”",
        "A Trump administration official said before the announcement that the expected move was aimed partly at pressuring Canada and Mexico to make concessions in talks to update the NAFTA that have languished in part over auto provisions, as well as pressuring Japan and the European Union, which also export large numbers of vehicles to the United States.",
        "‘Fewer Choices, Higher Prices’",
        "An ad hoc industry group representing the largest Japanese, German and other foreign automakers called “Here for America,” criticized the effort.",
        "“To our knowledge, no one is asking for this protection. This path leads inevitably to fewer choices and higher prices for cars and trucks in America,” said John Bozzella, chief executive of Global Automakers, a trade group representing Toyota, Nissan Motor Co Ltd, Hyundai Motor Co and others.",
        "A Toyota spokeswoman said that the company was monitoring the situation.",
        "Chinese automaker Geely Holding Group urged free trade practices for the auto industry, which is built on a complex supply chain under which vehicle components for any given car often originates from numerous countries.",
        "“As a global manufacturer, Geely Holding Group is in favor of free trade and open markets. Free trade creates jobs, wealth and economic growth,” a spokesman said, adding that its plant in South Carolina to produce its Volvo brand cars showed its commitment to the country.",
        "Shares in Toyota, Honda and Hyundai each fell roughly 3 percent in local trade following the announcement, while Mazda Motor Corp, which does not have any U.S. production capacity at the moment, tumbled more than 5 percent.",
        "Late last week, Japan’s automakers’ association urged its export partners to keep tariffs on vehicles and components low and maintain free trade relationships.",
        "Roughly 12 million cars and trucks were produced in the United States last year, while the country imported 8.3 million vehicles worth $192 billion. This included 2.4 million from Mexico, 1.8 million from Canada, 1.7 million from Japan, 930,000 from South Korea and 500,000 from Germany, according to U.S. government statistics.",
        "At the same time, the United States exported nearly 2 million vehicles worldwide worth $57 billion.",
        "German automakers Volkswagen AG, Daimler AG and BMW AG all have large U.S. assembly plants. The United States is the second-biggest export destination for German auto manufacturers after China, while vehicles and car parts are Germany’s biggest source of export income.",
        "Asked if the measures would hit Mexico and Canada, a Mexican source close to the NAFTA talks said: “That probably is going to be the next battle.”",

        "President Donald Trump on Thursday canceled a scheduled June 12 summit in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un after recent sparring between the two countries over the planned nuclear talks.",
        "“Sadly, based on the tremendous anger and open hostility displayed in your most recent statement, I feel it is inappropriate, at this time, to have this long-planned meeting,” Trump wrote in a letter to Kim, which was sent to reporters.",
        "Read Trump’s letter (story continues below):",
        "South Korean officials appeared blindsided by the announcement.",
        "“We are attempting to make sense of what, precisely, President Trump means,” said spokesman Kim Eui-kyeom, according to The Washington Post’s Anna Fifield.",
        "South Korean President Moon Jae-In urged both Trump and Kim to hold direct talks, South Korea’s Yonhap News Agency reported.",
        "It’s also unclear whether State Department officials were aware of Trump’s decision before he released the letter. When asked if the announcement came as a surprise, a staffer in the office that works on North Korea issues said he had to check with State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert.",
        "Speaking at the White House later Thursday, Trump said he had just spoken with military officials, as well as the leaders of South Korea and Japan. They are “ready for foolish or reckless acts be taken by North Korea,” he said, adding that “an unfortunate situation is forced upon us.”",
        "“Hopefully positive things will be taking place with respect to the future of North Korea. If they don’t, we are more ready than we have ever been before,” he said, apparently a threat of military action.",
        "On a call with reporters, a senior White House official asserted that Trump “had constant communication with our allies,” but did not explain why U.S. allies were caught off guard. The official did not say whether Trump and Kim had spoken directly.",
        "Of the letter, the official said Trump had “dictated every word himself.”",
        "Trump’s announcement came hours after North Korean officials threatened to cancel the summit, angered by recent comments from Vice President Mike Pence and national security adviser John Bolton, who compared North Korea with Libya.",
        "North Korean officials view Libya as a cautionary tale and called Bolton’s remarks “awfully sinister.” After Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi gave up his nuclear weapons program in 2003, an armed revolution aided by a U.S. and NATO military intervention ousted him in 2011. Rebel forces captured and brutally killed Gaddafi during the conflict.",
        "“World knows too well that our country is neither Libya nor Iraq which have met miserable fate,” a senior North Korean official said in a statement this month.",
        "Earlier Thursday, North Korea announced that it had destroyed tunnels at what they say is the country’s only nuclear test site. Trump did not acknowledge the concession in his letter.",
        "The senior White House official said there was no way to confirm whether the tunnels had been destroyed because only a select group of foreign journalists had witnessed the process. No nuclear experts or monitors were present to inspect the site.",
        "Cracks began to emerge in plans for the summit last week, after North Korea threatened to call off the meeting if the Trump administration demanded the country completely denuclearize. Trump appeared to soften his rhetoric toward North Korea this week, saying that a more gradual option of denuclearization was a possibility.",
        "But he teased the summit’s uncertain fate.",
        "“We’re moving along. We’ll see what happens. There are certain conditions we want to happen. I think we’ll get those conditions. And if we don’t, we won’t have the meeting,” Trump told reporters Tuesday, without specifying what those conditions would be.",
        "The next day, Trump told Fox News there was a “good chance” the summit would take place.\n\nTrump, in his remarks Thursday, suggested that the summit could still happen “at some later date.”\n\n“Hopefully everything will work out well with North Korea,” he said. “A lot of things can happen.”\n\nTrump had touted the renewed diplomacy with North Korea as a triumph for his administration, suggesting that he should win a Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts.\n\nThe White House push for negotiations in recent months was a dramatic shift from Trump’s initial posture toward North Korea. Last year, Trump and Kim were locked in an escalating battle of insults, which included Trump threatening North Korea with “fire and fury” if the country took action against the United States.\n\nJessica Schulberg and Akbar Ahmed contributed reporting.",
        "This article has been updated to include Trump’s comments and information from a call with reporters."

        "Bain, whose Twitter handle is @bainboozled, tweeted about her desire for the job on April 22.",
        "In her tweet, calling Spotify to action, she attached a link to a website. The customized site features a photo of Bain, a playlist that she says has “a few of my favorite black artists from old to new school,” three reasons the company should choose her for the job and a brief intro about what black culture means to her.",
        "“Black culture is making earth-shattering art out of the darkest parts of our history. It’s Alvin Ailey’s Revelations, interpreting the journey from slavery to freedom through dance, set to African-American spirituals and gospel music,” she writes.",
        "“It’s Michael and Janet Jackson performing Scream in the most expensive music video ever made, as a retaliation to public scrutiny and harassment. It’s the Queen Bey reimagining the 1991 film, Daughters of the Dust, to turn the lemons of being a Black woman in America into her sweet LEMONADE.”",
        "Bain goes on to say that encountering these moments “informed my understanding of the world at large and on a micro level, my taste in music.”",
        "“Black history is happening now and it’s everything to me, which is why I’m applying to the Shows & Editorial, Black History & Culture Fellowship,” she writes.\n\nShe told HuffPost via email that she got the idea to make a website because she knew “it would be the best way to showcase my technical skills, creativity and passion for Black history and culture in a way my resume wouldn’t.”\n\n“I didn’t want to make a basic cover letter because I wanted the team to be able to actually see my relevant projects and the campaigns I’d been a part of within the Black community. Since August, I’ve been curating and sharing playlists on Instagram and Twitter, so I figured if I was going to apply for a position like this, it’d only make sense to post it on social media as well,” she said.\n\nBain also said her original tweet didn’t go viral until after she got the job at Spotify.\n\n“Instagram was more helpful for me getting noticed. I created an Instagram highlight on my page to follow my journey from application to interview to getting hired and now going viral.”",
        "Her website is so detail oriented, Bain even changed the Spotify logo to feature the pan-African colors.",
        "Clearly the site got the attention of the people at Spotify, because she shared a follow-up a little over a month later: She got the job.",
        "On successfully shooting her shot, Bain told HuffPost that her message to other dreamers is this:",
        "“Don’t be afraid of taking risks on yourself, because if you don’t, then who will? My mindset going into this was, ‘I’m going to put my all into this whole process so that whichever way it goes, I’ll be satisfied knowing I tried my hardest.’ I wasn’t afraid of putting myself out there because I knew it was my best work and I did all my research. Also, have patience, and it’s not just about the likes and RTs — it’s about actually being prepared if and when your opportunity comes.”",
        "Many on social media applauded Bain’s efforts and new job:",
        "Several of her fellow Spotify employees shouted her out to welcome her to “the band”:",
        "Most intriguingly, one of the above tweets is from Francine Tamakloe, who also made a website in an effort to get hired at Spotify, and it worked. Bain said Tamakloe was “a resource” for her when she was putting her site together.",
        "All the best to you and your new gig, Jessica. And to everyone else: If you want to work at Spotify, get your website-making skills in check right quick."

        "Every Republican on the committee voted for Vitter, a New Orleans lawyer and President Donald Trump’s choice for a lifetime seat on the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. Those GOPers were Sens. Chuck Grassley (Iowa), Orrin Hatch (Utah), Lindsey Graham (S.C.), John Cornyn (Texas), Mike Lee (Utah), Ted Cruz (Texas), Ben Sasse (Neb.), Jeff Flake (Ariz.), Mike Crapo (Idaho), Thom Tillis (N.C.) and John Kennedy (La.).",
        "Every Democrat voted against Vitter.",
        "During her April confirmation hearing, Vitter, 57, repeatedly avoided saying whether she still agrees with a May 2013 speech she gave in protest of a new Planned Parenthood clinic in New Orleans.",
        "“Planned Parenthood says they promote women’s health,” she said at the time, per New Orleans’ Clarion Herald. “It is the saddest of ironies that they kill over 150,000 females a year. The first step in promoting women’s health is to let them live.”",
        "Many of Trump’s court picks have records of being anti-abortion. Vitter, who is general counsel of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans and is married to former Sen. David Vitter (R-La.), has been pretty upfront about her background, too.",
        "But her refusal to say whether she stands by her past comments didn’t sit well with Democrats on the committee. It didn’t help that she failed to disclose that speech to the panel, along with other speeches she’s given.",
        "Vitter also didn’t tell senators that she moderated a panel at a 2013 anti-abortion conference peddling false information about the dangers of abortion ― or that she urged audience members to tell their doctors to put materials in their waiting rooms saying that abortions cause breast cancer, which is not true. Vice News uncovered these missing materials in March.",
        "Omitting details like this is a big no-no to senators on the committee, who expect a thorough submission of background materials for judicial nominees. It also at least creates the appearance of Vitter not wanting the panel to know about some of her controversial comments.",
        "“All I’m looking for are judges that are fair and impartial,” Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) said in Thursday’s hearing. “They need to exhibit judgment, not to mention common sense. Ms. Vitter’s public endorsement of these obvious falsehoods... and her urging of the audience to distribute materials containing such obvious lies shows she lacks the judgment for a lifetime appointment.”",
        "Vitter has also taken heat for not saying if she agreed with the landmark civil rights case that desegregated U.S. public schools, Brown v. Board of Education.",
        "Her nomination now heads to the Senate floor for a confirmation vote.",
        "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has been confirming Trump’s judges at a breakneck pace and has vowed to confirm every court nominee this year who makes it out of the judiciary committee."

        "WASHINGTON ― After weeks of describing June’s planned meeting with North Korea as all-consuming, President Donald Trump’s lawyer said the canceled summit does not mean Trump will soon be speaking with prosecutors investigating his campaign.",
        "“No,” Rudy Giuliani said with a laugh. “It means he can talk to me.”",
        "He said the cancellation of the Singapore meeting that had been set for June 12 gives him more time to work with Trump to decide next steps.",
        "“We could probably decide by June 12 whether to testify,” Giuliani told HuffPost on Thursday.",
        "That decision, though, will apparently hinge on whether Trump is given whatever report is produced following a Justice Department probe of the FBI’s use of an informant to learn about his campaign’s contacts with Russia. Trump demanded the review on Sunday following a coordinated effort by his Capitol Hill allies and conservative media to discredit the informant.",
        "“Are we going to get a report on ‘spygate’?” Giuliani said, using the term Trump invented this week.",
        "Giuliani allowed that, as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, he never would have turned over all of his investigatory material to a potential target in that manner.",
        "“But I wasn’t investigating the president,” he said, justifying the demand for the FBI informant details. “You cannot compel criminal process on the president.”",
        "Giuliani said he still would prefer for Trump to avoid Mueller completely.",
        "“I would not like to talk to Mueller at all,” he said. “I don’t see what you gain from that.”",
        "But, Giuliani added, Trump himself has the opposite opinion. “He has a strong view that he should testify,” Giuliani said. “He believes he’s telling the truth: He didn’t collude with the Russians and he didn’t obstruct justice.”",
        "Giuliani conceded that Trump’s habit of saying false things on a near-daily basis could create a problem for him. But, he added, that could be avoided if Trump had enough time to prepare for a session with Mueller.",
        "“If we sat him down for an interview, we would be careful that it would be a solid explanation,” Giuliani said.",
        "He added that he has not asked Trump to stop issuing tweets about the investigation ― based on his unsuccessful attempts to persuade Trump to stop tweeting during the 2016 campaign. “No use,” he said. “Didn’t work.”",
        "But Giuliani has come up with a strategy he thinks might be working: taking a higher profile with inflammatory public comments of his own.",
        "“It’s one of the reasons I’ve become so aggressive, so his tweeting would be confined to the subject that we’ve chosen for the day,” he said.",
        "Giuliani said the cancellation of the trip to Singapore next month opens up more time for him and Trump to plan strategy, in addition to the daily or twice-a-day phone calls they have been sharing. He said he met Trump for half an hour Wednesday evening in New York City, where Trump had traveled for a fundraiser. “That half hour was devoted to the investigation,” Giuliani said.",
        "The U.S. intelligence community concluded during the 2016 campaign that Russia was interfering in the U.S. election, and was actively trying to help Trump and hurt Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.",
        "The FBI began its probe of possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians well before Election Day. Control of the investigation was shifted to special counsel Robert Mueller after Trump fired then-FBI Director James Comey in May 2017. Soon after, the president told NBC News, as well as senior Russian officials visiting the Oval Office, that he had done so because of the investigation.",
        "“The fact that he did it because of the Russian investigation is not obstruction of justice,” Giuliani said. “If he did it for that reason, that would be a legitimate reason to fire [Comey]. He works at the will of the president.”",
        "Mueller’s investigation has so far resulted in the guilty pleas of five individuals, including three former Trump campaign staffers, and the indictment of 14 other people and three companies. That total includes 13 Russians, Trump’s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, and the Internet Research Agency “troll farm” that was used to create and disseminate propaganda to help Trump win.",
        "A related investigation by Giuliani’s former office is examining the dealings of longtime Trump lawyer Michael Cohen. A former business partner has agreed to cooperate in that probe and plead to New York State charges.",
        "Giuliani, though, said Mueller’s investigation thus far has been tangential to Trump, and asserted that none of those who have pleaded guilty or are under indictment have any information that can hurt Trump.",
        "“They haven’t gotten anyone to flip on this,” Giuliani said, using courthouse slang for those accused of crimes to testify against associates in return for leniency. “They’re not going to do it on the bullshit that they have. Manafort’s not flipping. Cohen’s not flipping. And he has nothing to flip about.”"

        "DUBLIN — Three weeks before Ireland’s historic vote on whether to legalize abortion, which happens Friday, I sat in a noisy pub here with Gavin Sheridan, an Irish data journalist and transparency campaigner who has closely followed the referendum. Sheridan fancies himself something of an election-whisperer, having predicted Donald Trump’s 2016 victory after a road trip through West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Ohio, and he spoke with an ominous urgency about the coming vote.",
        "The conventional wisdom may have it wrong, he worried. The polls suggest the referendum will be an easy walk for abortion rights supporters. A recent survey showed 56 percent of voters said they’ll vote “yes” to repeal the 8th Amendment ― a near total ban on abortion, except to save the life of the mother ― while roughly a quarter (27 percent) said they’ll vote to keep the ban in place.",
        "But Sheridan wasn’t convinced. The “no” side, he explained, was running a much stronger and better-funded digital operation. Money was pouring into its coffers from God knows where. Irish voters were being bombarded with anti-abortion ads on Facebook and Youtube, some of which were carefully targeted at undecided voters. If you knew where to look, you could discern the fingerprints on the “no” side of American anti-abortion groups and some of the same firms who contributed to the surprise outcomes in the Trump election and Brexit.",
        "He walked me through one example. An anonymous Facebook page and website called “Undecided on the 8th” purported to offer voters neutral information on the referendum. But its purpose was to entice undecideds to identify themselves so that anti-repeal groups could target them before the vote. Sheridan traced the origins of that page and was able to link it to at least two U.S. Catholic groups ― The Community of St. John and New York Franciscan Friars of the Atonement.",
        "Facebook and Google tried to crack down on foreign influence in the Irish referendum last week, banning all ads on the issue from outside Ireland to “help ensure a free, fair and transparent vote.” But those decisions haven’t stopped U.S. groups from helping out behind the scenes. Storyful, a Dublin-based social media intelligence agency where Sheridan used to work, reports that only 37 percent of digital ads for the anti-abortion rights campaign are being managed solely from inside Ireland, compared with 81 percent of ads on the abortion rights side.",
        "Sheridan was nervous, and so were the leaders of the pro-repeal campaign.",
        "“I’m a very optimistic person, and I always think we’ll win this if we do the work,” said Colm O’Gorman, executive director of Amnesty International Ireland, in an interview before Facebook and Google handed down their bans. “But there’s a lot of concern about the impact of a very, very, very well-resourced and targeted digital campaign being launched by the other side, and we’re really anxious about it. There has been a big concern here, understandably ― given what we saw in the last U.S. general election and in the Brexit campaign ― about influence, and how influence might be exacted online in quite disingenuous ways.”",
        "The pro-repeal campaign in Ireland has had to raise money largely from inside the country, especially after the country’s electoral regulator earlier this year forced the “yes” effort to return a $23,450 donation from U.S. billionaire George Soros’ group, Open Societies Foundation. Ireland has a law against foreign spending on local political causes. But so far, the Standards in Public Office Commission has yet to ask the anti-abortion side to return any foreign donations or to stop the flow of help from foreign groups.",
        "“The indication is that there are huge amounts of money now being spent by the ‘no’ side online, both by the official campaign but more significantly by people outside the country,” O’Gorman said. “They’ve done a huge amount of work over the years raising money in the U.S. We’re looking at what we can do, and how we can scale up what we’re doing online, but we would never have that kind of money. It’s just not going to happen, because we are generally much more transparent, accountable and open about our funding. We don’t fundraise unethically, and that does put us at a disadvantage.”",
        "The “Save the 8th” campaign leading the anti-repeal effort in Ireland did not respond to a request for comment.",
        "Steven Aden, general counsel for Americans United for Life, said U.S. activists are meddling in Ireland’s vote because the country is considered the crown jewel of the global anti-abortion movement.",
        "“We don’t want to see Ireland go down the road of elective abortion like the United States has,” Aden told me. “Ireland is at the top of a very slippery slope, and we’re at the bottom, unfortunately. We’re concerned this would accelerate a trend of imposing abortion-on-demand on unwilling nations in the name of women’s health.”",
        "When I asked him how exactly AUL is involved in Ireland’s referendum and how much money it’s spending, Aden hesitated to answer. “There’s not a lot I can tell you,” he said. “Most of it goes on behind the scenes. But we’re certainly encouraging our friends in the Irish Republic to vote wisely.”",
        "Offline, even three weeks before the vote, the referendum had a physical presence in Dublin. It was impossible to walk 20 feet here with encountering both a “Vote Yes” and a “Vote No” poster on every street corner, often stacked one on top of the other.",
        "On a gray and misty afternoon earlier this month, a handful of students from Trinity College wearing “Tá” pins — the Irish word for “yes” — stood on the sidewalk of the city’s main thoroughfare asking passersby if they were registered to vote.",
        "Drivers would occasionally beep their horns and flash a supportive thumbs-up. An elderly man waited for a break in traffic and crossed the street to approach the volunteers. “I know you’re presuming I’m going to vote ‘no,’” he confided in a low voice. “But I have daughters, granddaughters. I’m voting yes.”",
        "The referendum campaign was unfolding on an intimate personal terrain. The amendment banning abortion almost entirely passed in 1983 by a 34-percentage-point margin. Thirty-five years and 10 governments later, Irish women are still forced to travel to the United Kingdom for abortions or illegally obtain abortion pills online.",
        "While the campaign to repeal the amendment has been ongoing since its passage, these latest efforts were born in the aftermath of Savita Halappanavar’s 2012 death, from a septic miscarriage; doctors had denied her an abortion, figuring that her life was not in danger.",
        "One of the Trinity students I met on the sidewalk, Kevin Keane, 23, noted a recent report that three Irish women a day order abortion pills illegally to induce the procedure on their own.",
        "“That’s the big thing for me, that three women today are having abortions in their bedrooms and bathrooms, and no one knows this is happening,” he said. “They’ll go to work tomorrow in excruciating pain, mental anguish, and we’re just pretending it’s not happening.”",
        "Two of his best friends had traveled to Liverpool to get abortions, Keane said.",
        "“It just seems a bit absurd to me that we essentially have abortion in Ireland already,” added Aisling Grace, 20. “The 8th Amendment is a continuation of this Irish culture of burying our heads in the sand and ignoring social issues.”",
        "Not everyone was so eager to speak about the issue. It was difficult to find a “no” voter or even an undecided one willing to speak to me about the referendum. One 65-year-old, who asked that I leave out his name, told me he is still emotionally conflicted about which way to vote.",
        "“There are so few things that make Ireland unique anymore,” he said. “We don’t allow abortions, and our policemen don’t carry guns. If you start changing those things, what incentive would people have to come visit our country?”",
        "Ireland’s alleged uniqueness may be on the ballot, but the dynamics of the campaign itself were anything but novel. In addition to foreign influence and a sophisticated digital targeting effort, Sheridan saw other parallels to the U.S. presidential election. The abortion rights side seemed to be struggling with messaging, in the same way that Hillary Clinton’s “Stronger Together” failed to resonate with voters in the same way as Trump’s “Make America Great Again.”",
        "The pro-repeal campaign had struggled to come up with a slogan that’s as simple and effective as the inflammatory messages being used by the other side. Framing abortion as murder in a deeply Catholic country is an easy way to tell the story.",
        "“If killing an unborn baby at six months bothers you,” read one poster I saw, “vote no.”",
        "“Six months is horrific,” read another.",
        "The “yes” posters are far less direct.",
        "“Vote yes for compassion in a crisis,” said one. “Sometimes a private matter needs public support,” said another.",
        "Progressives had little problem legalizing same sex marriage in Ireland’s 2015 referendum using the message “love is love.” Explaining why people should be compassionate toward women who don’t want to continue their pregnancies and should value a woman’s life over a developing life, O’Gorman said, “is a more complicated story to tell. And in a referendum, it’s the more simple stories that can pull through.”",
        "The anxiety on the left may simply be a hangover from 2016. But having lived through Brexit, no one is taking a win for granted.",
        "“There is undoubtedly overwhelming public support for a legal and medical framework for abortion that would require the repeal of the 8th Amendment,” said O’Gorman. “Whether or not the ‘no’ side will between now and then manage to confuse and frighten and disrupt people’s commitment to understanding that remains to be seen.”",
        "CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated Colm O’Gorman’s last name as O’Gordon."

        "President Donald Trump told reporters Thursday that he is pardoning late heavyweight boxing champion Jack Johnson, who was arrested in 1912 for driving his white girlfriend across state lines.",
        "Trump indicated last month he was considering pardoning the boxer at the urging of actor Sylvester Stallone, who was present at Thursday’s announcement at the White House.",
        "Johnson, the first black man to earn the title of heavyweight boxing champion of the world, died in 1946 after serving time for violating the Mann Act, which banned traveling with a woman across state lines for an “immoral purpose.”",
        "“Johnson served 10 months in federal prison for what many view as a racially motivated injustice,” Trump said Thursday. “He was treated very rough, very tough.”",
        "The son of former slaves, Johnson gained fame and wealth through his boxing career despite rampant racism and violence against blacks at the time.\n\nThis marks only the third posthumous pardon in U.S. history.\n\nIn 2016, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), now-retired Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.), Rep. Pete King (R-N.Y.) and Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.) wrote a letter to President Barack Obama urging him to pardon Johnson for his “improper and unfair” conviction.\n\n“While it is unfortunate that this unjust conviction was not corrected during the boxer’s lifetime, a posthumous pardon today represents the opportunity to reaffirm Jack Johnson’s substantial contributions to our society and right this historical wrong,” the lawmakers wrote at the time.",
        "Obama, however, kept to the presidential tradition of almost never granting a posthumous pardon.\n\nTrump disparaged Obama at Thursday’s announcement for not issuing the pardon, but others said issuing clemency for Johnson is merely a symbolic move that falls short of addressing present-day racism in the criminal justice system.\n\nThough Obama granted clemency to nearly 2,000 people under an initiative aimed largely at commuting sentences of nonviolent drug-law offenders, his administration was unable to address the nearly 8,000 additional petitions that remained at the end of his term, Kevin Blackistone, a professor and sports commentator, wrote in The Washington Post last month.\n\nUnlike Johnson, ”[t]hey are of living, breathing people ... with children, spouses, partners and futures that can be regained and realized with a second chance.”\n\nThose remaining petitions, he noted, “were left behind in a file, as is customary historic practice, for the review of the next president.”\n\nThe previous presidents to issue posthumous pardons were Bill Clinton in 1999 and George W. Bush in 2008. Clinton pardoned Lt. Henry Ossian Flipper, the first black West Point graduate who years later was convicted of conduct unbecoming an officer. Bush pardoned Charlie Winters, who had been convicted of violating the Neutrality Act by helping Israel obtain bomber planes in 1948.\n\nThe pardon of Johnson was the fourth of Trump’s term. He previously pardoned former Dick Cheney advisor Scooter Libby, former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, and a case of Navy sailor whose pardon request was promoted on Fox News. So far, there’s been no indication that any of his pardons have gone through the standard procedure through the Justice Department’s Office of the Pardon Attorney, which evaluates requests for pardons and clemency and makes recommendations to the president.\n\nThis story has been updated with details of the previous posthumous pardons.\n\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this story indicated President Barack Obama pardoned nearly 2,000 people. In fact, that number reflects the total of both pardons and commutations he granted."

        "Among the GOP members is Pennsylvania’s Rep. Lou Barletta, the Republican nominee challenging incumbent Democratic Sen. Bob Casey in November. Barletta became famous for leading a crackdown on illegal immigration while mayor of Hazleton more than a decade ago and was personally encouraged by Trump to run for the Senate.",
        "“It’s time to take a hard look at what lawmakers say and what they actually do when it comes to reining in overspending,” said Americans for Prosperity spokesman Bill Riggs. “The $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill passed by Congress in March showed a complete disregard for fiscal responsibility. Both parties are responsible for putting the country on an unsustainable fiscal path, which is why AFP is committed to holding both parties accountable.”",
        "The expansive spending package narrowly passed the House and survived a brief veto threat from the president. The goal of the new campaign is to ensure that the next spending deal includes significant cuts to government spending.",
        "The Koch brothers’ expansive political network spent heavily to help the GOP win and retain control of the Senate in 2014 and 2016, and it’s highly unusual for them to attack a GOP Senate candidate in a swing state, even if most handicappers consider Barletta an underdog in November.",
        "Former Koch network operatives are also ubiquitous throughout the Trump administration and the group pushed aggressively for the GOP’s tax reform plan. But the network’s leaders have become more open about their frustrations that the president and his party aren’t following the network’s libertarian-influenced policy preferences on immigration, trade and government spending. Earlier this month, the group’s Hispanic outreach arm, LIBRE, sent out mailers thanking four Democratic lawmakers for their work to protect Dreamers.",
        "“We will be looking for allies wherever we can find them ― on the left, the right, or in the middle,” James Davis, the executive director of the Koch-backed Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, wrote in a CNN op-ed last month. “We welcome all comers. And we will hold those accountable who stand in the way of progress, regardless of their party.”",
        "This isn’t to say that the network, which has spent billions to advance conservative policies and elect Republicans over the past decade, is suddenly turning bipartisan. While they’re attacking Republicans like Barletta and vulnerable Michigan Rep. Mike Bishop, for example, they’re also slamming Democratic Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas, who is challenging GOP Sen. Ted Cruz this fall, and hitting Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the former chair of the Democratic National Committee.",

Marsha Blackburn and Jim Renacci, the GOP nominees for Senate in Tennessee and Ohio; and Reps.

        "On Thursday, the “No Tears Left To Cry” singer posted an emotional tribute to the victims of the attack, which left 22 people dead, with a photo of a bee tattoo inked just above one of her ears.",
        "“Forever,” the 24-year-old wrote in the caption of the photo posted to Twitter and Instagram, alongside an emoji of a dark cloud.",
        "The worker bee is a symbol of Manchester and celebrates the city’s industrious spirit. According to the BBC, it’s even incorporated into the city’s coat of arms.",
        "In June 2017, PRI reported that many Manchester residents showed their solidarity with the victims and survivors of the devastating bombing by getting the bee tattoo.",
        "The Sun also reported in June 2017 that after Grande’s One Love Manchester benefit concert, which raised money for those affected by the tragedy, the singer and her tour team got the bee tattoo backstage.",
        "Though this could very well be the tattoo featured in Grande’s post on Tuesday, the Daily Beast reported that when Grande got the bee tattoo backstage after her tribute concert, she got it on her arm, not above her ear — so this could possibly be a new tattoo.",
        "Yet regardless of how many worker bee tattoos the singer may have, Grande still feels the sting of the attack.",
        "In a moving interview, she recently told Time that even though she’s been relatively private about her feelings about the experience, there’s a reason for it.",
        "“I don’t want to give it that much power,” Grande told the magazine while sobbing. “Something so negative. It’s the absolute worst of humanity. That’s why I did my best to react the way I did. The last thing I would ever want is for my fans to see something like that happen and think it won.”"

        "Woody Allen’s son Moses Farrow came to the filmmaker’s defense on Wednesday in a long essay that accused his mother, Mia Farrow, of child abuse.",
        "Farrow, 40, disputed sister Dylan’s claim that Allen sexually abused her as a child and blamed their mother for years of turmoil in their household.",
        "“I’m a very private person and not at all interested in public attention,” Farrow wrote in an entry on his blog titled, “A Son Speaks Out.” “But, given the incredibly inaccurate and misleading attacks on my father, Woody Allen, I feel that I can no longer stay silent as he continues to be condemned for a crime he did not commit.”",
        "Allen has denied Dylan Farrow’s claims, and no charges were filed after an investigation. But the accusations have resurfaced amid the Me Too movement against sexual misconduct, and Allen has been reduced to a pariah in some circles. Some actors have denounced him or donated salaries they earned on Allen films.",
        "Moses Farrow wrote that the abuse his sister alleges never happened, and pointed to what he said were inconsistencies in her claim. Of Dylan’s recollection that she was abused in an attic while Allen asked her to play with an electric train, Moses said there was no train in the attic and the space was too small for anyone to play there.",
        "Mia Farrow, Moses wrote, had been telling the children for months that their father was a “monster,” he added. “None of us would have allowed Dylan to step away with Woody, even if he tried.”",
        "It was Mia Farrow, Moses wrote, who was the abuser. He said she struck him multiple times, and once made him strip and stand in a corner. She dragged physically disabled siblings down a stairway and locked them into a closet, he claimed.",
        "She punished her son Thaddeus, a paraplegic, by shutting him in an outdoor shed overnight, Moses said. She was especially hard on Soon-Yi Previn, Allen’s future wife, Moses wrote. Farrow threw a porcelain centerpiece at her head and beat her with a telephone, he alleged.",
        "“For all of us, life under my mother’s roof was impossible if you didn’t do exactly what you were told, no matter how questionable the demand,” Moses wrote. “It was important to my mother to project to the world a picture of a happy blended household of both biological and adopted children, but this was far from the truth.”",
        "Dylan Farrow responded to her brother’s claims with a statement on Twitter, calling them “beyond hurtful to me” and “easily disproven.”",
        "Ronan Farrow also weighed in on Moses Farrow’s claims, saying Mia Farrow did an “extraordinary” job of raising them.",
        "A rep for Woody Allen declined to comment. Mia Farrow’s rep didn’t immediately respond.",
        "Read Moses Farrow’s essay here.",
        "This article has been updated to include Ronan Farrow’s comment."

        "Inspired by October exposes in The New York Times and The New Yorker, dozens of women began coming forward late last year with stories about the alleged sexual abuse and harassment they sustained at his hands. Reporters for the Times and The New Yorker ― Jodi Kantor, Megan Twohey and Ronan Farrow ― received the Pulitzer Prize for public service earlier this year for their effort to expose Hollywood’s culture of abuse.",
        "Their work is credited with sparking the Me Too and Time’s Up movements against sexual misconduct.",
        "After the Times delivered the first devastating blow, Weinstein issued a bizarre statement quoting Jay-Z to apologize for his actions. He explained that they stemmed from growing up “in the 60’s and 70’s, when all the rules about behavior and workplaces were different.”",
        "Since then, Weinstein has repeatedly denied engaging in any nonconsensual sex acts through his attorneys.",
        "A number of women spoke out against Weinstein following the lead of Ashley Judd, Rose McGowan and Asia Argento, who were among his first public accusers.",
        "Hollywood stars including A-list actresses Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie began sharing stories that started feeling grossly similar to those told by women who agreed to be named in initial media reports. A pattern of abuse quickly emerged: Much of the time, Weinstein would use his position of power to lure individual young women to his hotel rooms, offices or other private spaces under the guise of speaking about work. Sometimes he would tell them another woman would be present in order to make his female guests more comfortable; the woman would either be completely absent or quickly leave.",
        "Their accusations have ranged from uncomfortable sexual harassment to brutal sexual assault.",
        "The charges against him are reportedly related to an accusation made by Lucia Evans, who told The New Yorker the disgraced Hollywood producer forced her to perform oral sex during a meeting ostensibly on a work opportunity.",
        "As part of its investigation, the NYPD also examined the alleged 2010 sexual assault of “Boardwalk Empire” actress Paz de la Huerta, The Wall Street Journal reported.",
        "In 2015, New York District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. let Weinstein off the hook for an alleged sexual assault by an Italian model, deciding there was insufficient evidence for charges after he allegedly groped her. In March, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) ordered the state attorney general to review the decision, which Vance has defended.",
        "Weinstein was fired from the studio he co-founded, The Weinstein Company, in October 2017.",
        "He had been reportedly spending much of his time at a rehabilitation facility in Scottsdale, Arizona, after becoming a pariah in the industry where he once loomed large."

        "Fans have come out in droves on social media to express support for actress Jessica Walter the day after a story in The New York Times included the actress opening up about being verbally harassed by “Arrested Development” co-star Jeffrey Tambor.",
        "“I’ve always wanted to see a day devoted to how much we love Jessica Walter, but not like this. She deserves better all the way around,” said one person.",
        "The support comes about after several stars of TV’s “Arrested Development,” including Tambor, talked with the Times about the show’s revival on Netflix. Tambor was fired from his latest show, “Transparent,” in February when one of his co-stars and his former personal assistant alleged that he had sexually harassed them.",
        "Tambor denies the allegations, though he did admit to The Hollywood Reporter that he had “volatile and ill-tempered” tendencies. Behavior, he said, that led to a “blowup” a few years ago directed at Walter, who plays Tambor’s wife on “Development.”",
        "In the Times interview, Walter said, “In like almost 60 years of working, I’ve never had anybody yell at me like that on a set.” Through tears, the Times reported, she also said,“I have to let go of being angry at him.”",
        "Co-stars Jason Bateman, David Cross, and Tony Hale responded to her reveal by hedging about Tambor’s behavior.",
        "Bateman said all actors have their “processes,” citing the entertainment industry as “a breeding ground for atypical behavior.” Cross said Tambor has “learned from the experience and he’s listening and learning and growing,” while Hale simply said, “we’ve all had moments.”",
        "The only “Development” cast member to immediately rally to Walter’s defense was Alia Shawkat, who told Bateman: “But that doesn’t mean it’s acceptable.”",
        "Much like Shawkat, many on social media came to Walter’s side and rallied to call out the culture we’re currently living in:",
        "Both Bateman and Hale have since apologized to Walter via social media, but the memo has been sent.",
        "Walter herself said in the interview, “There’s so much testosterone in this room” ― and the same can be applied to the cultural climate, despite the emergence of the Me Too movement and women being encouraged to speak up about harassment.",
        "Walter didn’t immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment."

    "articleContent": [
        "Alabama is suing the Trump administration to force the Census Bureau not to count undocumented people as part of the decennial tally used to determine how many seats in Congress each state gets.",
        "The suit signals a continued conservative interest in changing the way the census counts immigrants. In a statement, Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.), one of the plaintiffs in the suit, said apportionment should exclude immigrants and be based on only the citizen population. Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R) have made similar calls. Missouri lawmakers are considering legislation to base their state legislative districts based only on citizen population.",
        "Last week the top official in the Department of Justice’s civil rights division said the Trump administration had “no position” on whether districts should be apportioned based solely on citizen population.",
        "Every 10 years, the census counts all people in the United States, regardless of their immigration status, and that tally is used as the basis to figure out how many congressional seats each state gets. The 14th Amendment says congressional seats should be apportioned based on simply the number of “persons.”",
        "But in a suit filed Tuesday in federal court in Alabama, Brooks and the state’s Attorney General Steve Marshall (R) argue that in the 18th and 19th centuries, the word “persons” would not have been understood to include undocumented people in the country. They argue that including undocumented immigrants in the count to determine congressional representation unfairly allows states with large undocumented populations to have inflated political representation. Alabama is projected to lose a congressional seat after the next census.",
        "In March the Commerce Department announced it would add a question asking about citizenship to the 2020 census ― the first time it will do so on a decennial survey since 1950. Civil rights groups say including the question will drive down response rates among immigrant groups.",
        "The results of the census have significant consequences; in addition to determining how many House seats each state gets, the count determines how hundreds of billions of dollars in federal funds are allocated.",
        "The suit seeks to block a census rule directing the bureau to count citizens and foreign nationals in the United States at the address where they live or sleep most of the time. The plaintiffs argue that the rule violates the 14th Amendment “by robbing the people of the state of Alabama of their rightful share of political representation while systematically redistributing political powers to states with high numbers of illegal aliens and their citizens.”",
        "Legal experts and historians cast doubt on the lawsuit’s foundational claim ― that the word “persons” was previously understood to exclude undocumented immigrants.",
        "Franita Tolson, a law professor at the University of Southern California and a scholar of the 14th Amendment, said she was “unaware of any historical support” for Alabama’s argument. She said the legislative history surrounding the 14th Amendment shows that those who passed it understood the word “persons” to apply to those ineligible at the time to become citizens.",
        "“To say that Alabama’s argument is a stretch is being overly generous,” she wrote in an email. “The text says ‘persons’ and the history illustrates that this term applies broadly.”",
        "Michael Ramsey, a law professor at the University of San Diego, noted that the founders added a clause to Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution to prevent slaves from being counted as people for the purpose of determining how many congressional seats each state gets. If the Founding Fathers had intended to exclude people illegally in the United States, he said, they could have added a clause to explicitly say so.",
        "Pamela Karlan, a professor at Stanford Law School, pointed to information on the website of United States Customs and Immigration Services noting that immigration in the 18th and 19th centuries was “relatively free and open.” It wasn’t until 1875 that the U.S. Supreme Court said the federal government had a responsibility to regulate immigration, and it wasn’t until 1880 that Congress began to enact immigration legislation.",
        "“At the time of the Founding, there simply wasn’t a category of ‘undocumented’ immigrants,” she wrote in an email.",
        "John Thompson, a former director of the Census Bureau, noted that there is no good way for the census to determine whether people are in the country legally. Census officials, he said, can’t simply walk up to people and ask them if they are legally in the United States and expect to get an accurate count.",
        "The suit offers no method for the Census Bureau to count legal immigrants but exclude unauthorized residents.",
        "Mike Lewis, a spokesman for Marshall, dismissed the practical concerns.",
        "“It is important to know who is here both legally and illegally. Our lawsuit is only focused on the question of counting illegal immigrants in the apportionment portion of the census,” he said in a statement. “There are a variety of proposals that would allow the census to identify immigrants without legal status. We will address the appropriate remedy in the course of the litigation.”",
        "Jeffrey Wice, a Washington lawyer who has worked with Democrats on redistricting issues, said the case could go to the Supreme Court. He added that it was “fiction” that the Founding Fathers intended to exclude undocumented people from the census.",
        "“Whoever filed the suit did not think this through,” he said."

        "The bill, which did not pass either time, faded from Pruitt’s political legacy. But the legislation merits new examination as the EPA chief faces down an avalanche of corruption accusations. As HuffPost previously reported, Pruitt’s support from right-wing evangelical Christians, a group that largely opposes abortion, has helped him keep his job amid calls from droves of Democrats and a handful of Republicans to fire the administrator.",
        "And while his current role atop the EPA does not give him any official control over abortion policy, he has appeared alongside President Donald Trump in meetings with evangelical leaders, and his draconian history on the issue is of a piece with the administration. In one of Trump’s first acts after taking office, he reinstated and expanded the Reagan-era “global gag rule,” withholding federal funding from charities and aid organizations that counsel women on family planning options that include abortion. Last week, the White House proposed a new “domestic gag rule” that would strip Planned Parenthood of funding.",
        "“It’s not surprising that another member of Trump’s inner circle is hostile to women,” said Dawn Huckelbridge, a senior director at the progressive super PAC American Bridge, which opposes Pruitt and supports abortion rights. “But framing a fetus as a man’s property is a new low.”",
        "American Bridge resurfaced the legislation and shared it with HuffPost. The EPA did not respond to a request for comment.",
        "Pruitt has spent his 15 months at the EPA pushing to keep government out of the private sector. He’s sought to radically deregulate the fossil fuel and chemical industries, clear the way for companies to produce more asthma-triggering pollution, allow deadly chemicals to remain on the market, and revise restrictions on teenage workers handling dangerous pesticides.",
        "By contrast, the bill from his time as a state legislator stated that “it is the responsibility of the state to ensure that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law,” referring to a “fetus” as “property” that has been “jointly created by both father and mother.”",
        "The legislation would have barred doctors from performing abortions without signed statements of permission from the father, or evidence that the man could not be located “after diligent effort.” If the pregnancy resulted from rape, the woman would be required to show “such assault has been reported to a law enforcement agency having the requisite jurisdiction.”",
        "Doctors who performed the procedure without that documentation would have risked losing their medical licenses, been “civilly liable to the father of the aborted child for any damages caused thereby,” and had to pay punitive fines of $5,000.",
        "In a statement to The Associated Press in 1999, Pruitt said a pregnant woman who were to obtain an abortion without meeting the bill’s criteria would face legal consequences. “She’ll be held accountable for it,” Pruitt said.",
        "Pruitt also sought to restrict abortion in other ways. In 2001, when the Legislature was considering a bill to require that pregnant minors show parental permission before obtaining an abortion, he introduced an amendment to define a “fetus” as “any individual human organism from fertilization until birth.”",
        "The timing of the bills came nearly a decade after the Supreme Court issued its landmark decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, in which it ruled that provisions requiring a woman to obtain her husband’s permission for an abortion were unconstitutional.",
        "“He doesn’t agree with the court’s not viewing women as property and also doesn’t believe in the intellectual concept that women should have agency over their own reproductive choices,” said Leslie McGorman, deputy director at the advocacy group NARAL Pro-Choice America. “Frankly there’s not a whole lot more to tell except that he is the guy who his record indicates he is.”",
        "“He carries that lack of concern for the greater good throughout all of the things he’s done in his career,” she added, referring to his rollback of environmental safeguards.",
        "Until 2017, Pruitt served on the board of trustees at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky, an institution that has said “a wife is to submit herself graciously” to her husband. Around the time he first introduced the abortion bill, in 1999, Pruitt served on the board of the MEND Medical Clinic and Pregnancy Resource Center. Its current executive director, Forrest Cowan, has said unwed mothers have been “failed” by a “boyfriend, who values his own selfish gratification over responsibility, and her father, who should have had her back.”",
        "Pruitt’s crusade against abortion rights continued after he left the state Senate to become Oklahoma’s attorney general. When a district court found a law requiring women to undergo an ultrasound before an abortion to be unconstitutional, Pruitt appealed the decision to the Oklahoma Supreme Court. After losing there, he unsuccessfully petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to take the case.",
        "In 2012, The Tulsa World excoriated Pruitt in an editorial for wasting “more taxpayer money … on this misguided effort to control doctor-patient interaction and the practice of medicine ― but only when women are concerned.”"

        "WASHINGTON ― Civil rights groups contend a new Senate bill that is supposed to crack down on sexual harassers in Congress is full of problems and lets lawmakers off the hook too easily.",
        "The bill, which quietly sailed through the Senate on Thursday, makes some needed updates to the Congressional Accountability Act, a decades-old law that set up the process for handling workplace complaints about harassment and discrimination on Capitol Hill. It eliminates rules forcing people claiming sexual harassment to undergo counseling, mandatory arbitration and an absurd 30-day “cooling off” period before taking a complaint to court.",
        "But the American Civil Liberties Union has “grave concerns” that the bill is still too weak to be effective. It narrowly defines sexual harassment as actions that are “severe or pervasive” and requires that such harassment be “unwanted” (suggesting an alleged harasser could defend himself by claiming “she wanted it”). It lets lawmakers hide past discrimination settlements they’ve paid for with taxpayer money. It does not provide legal representation to accusers, a measure that was included in a similar House-passed bill.",
        "“Members of Congress should be held accountable for their discriminatory conduct, but instead this bill appears to provide numerous opportunities to evade responsibility, while also failing to offer Senate professional staff the same kind of legal counsel and support that members of Congress receive,” said Vania Leveille, the ACLU’s senior legislative counsel.",
        "The ACLU, the National Women’s Law Center and other groups outlined their concerns in a Wednesday letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.).",
        "Read the letter here:",
        "The Senate has had a much harder time overhauling sexual harassment policy than the House, which unanimously passed its bill in early February. Why? Some anonymous male GOP senators did not like a provision in the House bill requiring lawmakers to pay out-of-pocket when they settle a lawsuit accusing them of sexual harassment or discrimination.",
        "After three months of inaction, Sens. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) finally hashed out the current Senate bill this week. It passed Thursday on a voice vote.",
        "Lead negotiators of the House bill also said the Senate plan does little to hold harassers accountable.",
        "“Democrats and Republicans on the House side are disappointed,” Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) said Thursday on CNN.",
        "“The House passed a very strong bill that protects the victim,” she said. “Hopefully we can iron out some of those differences, because in the end, the balance of power has always been with the harasser and the institution. We want to equalize that so that the victim has protections as well.”",
        "Aides to Blunt and Klobuchar did respond to a request for comment.",
        "The next step is likely a conference committee, which involves select lawmakers from the House and Senate going into a room and trying to agree on a final bill. House and Senate leaders will have to name those negotiators."

        "date": "2018-05-24"
    },
    "articleContent": [
        "Facebook began disclosing political advertising on its site on Thursday, two years after a Russian troll factory bought ads to influence the 2016 presidential election. The new policy is meant to shine light on the previously undisclosed ways that politicians and other groups aim to shift public opinion on elections and political issues. But the self-regulatory approach will occur at Facebook’s direction and without any public oversight.",
        "The social media giant will require all election-related ads and many issue-related political ads placed on its platform and on Instagram to disclose the buyer’s identity, the advertising budget, how many people saw the advertisement and their demographic information ― age, location and gender. Starting from May 7, 2018, all ads will remain in a searchable archive for seven years.",
        "Users will also be able to report advertising that they believe should be disclosed as political. The company says it will hire 3,000 to 4,000 content moderators to review these complaints, and will deploy machine-learning algorithms when possible. (You can read more about this plan on Facebook’s blog.)",
        "In addition to ads that explicitly call for the election or defeat of a candidate, Facebook is also targeting issue-based advertising. The company explained in a blog post that it worked with the nonpartisan Comparative Agendas Project to select 20 issues that will be covered by the disclosure policy, ranging from abortion to foreign policy to Social Security. An ad calling for the Department of Education to ban the use of public student loans at for-profit colleges, for example, would need to be disclosed. An ad run by a specific for-profit college that simply promoted the school would not.",
        "Facebook’s new policy follows the company’s revelation to Congress in 2017 that the Internet Research Agency, a Russian digital propaganda company that works with both the public and private sector in the country, purchased advertisements for a range of pages that sought to inflame American racial tensions and that, depending on the page, advocated for the election of Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, Jill Stein or Bernie Sanders. In some cases, these pages bought ads to gain followers in the U.S. and later called for voters to boycott the election. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg first announced plans to require political ad transparency in a speech from Facebook headquarters in September 2017.",
        "While Facebook’s moves are supported by advocates of online political advertising disclosure, the new policy also highlights how the failure of elected officials and regulatory agencies to impose actual disclosure rules through the democratic process is enabling the private sector to assert its authority over the conduct of U.S. elections.",
        "Facebook’s new disclosure plan is not bound by federal regulations and will not be overseen by the Federal Election Commission or the Federal Communications Commission. In 2014, Ann Ravel, then the chairwoman of the FEC, proposed a meeting to discuss the disclosure of online ads. Her Republican colleagues pilloried her for the suggestion, and conservative news sites claimed she was trying to destroy free speech and censor their views. Ravel received a torrent of anti-Semitic death threats, and the three FEC Republicans voted against a rule to mandate online ad disclosure.",
        "“The failure to regulate this space all together is a pretty abject failure,” John Wonderlich, executive director of the pro-transparency nonprofit Sunlight Foundation, told HuffPost. “So, now we have private sector campaign finance regulation. That’s a pretty dystopian present.”",
        "The public is now left with the Facebook Election Commission ― and maybe the Google Election Commission and the Twitter Election Commission. Both Google and Twitter have proposed some form of online ad disclosure on their respective platforms after they were also used by Russian trolls in 2016. For now, online political ad disclosure will be balkanized, as digital platforms will have different policies due to a lack of federal enforcement.",
        "In some cases, that may result in stronger disclosure requirements than Congress or the FEC would mandate, as seen with Facebook’s broad issue-advertising disclosure approach. In other cases, though, the lack of public enforcement will likely result in worse outcomes. Indeed, that is also the case with Facebook, which launched a searchable archive of political ads that is only accessible if you have a Facebook account. This means a person must submit to Facebook’s terms and conditions, including the collection of personal data, if they want to learn about the election ads purchased by U.S. politicians. Rob Leathern, Facebook’s director of product, said on Twitter that the company is considering ways to open the archive to non-users. A Facebook spokesman said the company would not collect data on what people search for in the political ad archive in order to better target ads at them.",
        "Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), a lead sponsor of the Honest Ads Act, a bipartisan bill to officially mandate online ad disclosure, praised Facebook’s decision in a tweet but noted the underlying problems of industry self-regulation.",
        "“Big step in the right direction ― and I’m glad Facebook followed through on my recommendations to improve upon earlier proposals,” Warner tweeted Thursday. “I’ll be pushing other companies to follow suit. But until we pass the #HonestAds Act, there’ll still be a patchwork of disclosure across social media.”",
        "So far, the Republican-controlled Congress has refused to move the bill through committee or to the floor for a vote. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is a notorious opponent of any and all campaign finance regulation or disclosures.",
        "Meanwhile, commissioners on the FEC, the nation’s actual election disclosure regulator, spent Thursday arguing over whether they should release a report on their 40th anniversary. That 40th anniversary was three years ago."

        "The Trump administration spent time last year mulling over what its public position on climate science should be — and, according to a report published Wednesday by The Washington Post, outrightly “ignoring” new research was one option that officials considered.",
        "Citing an internal memo drafted in September by President Donald Trump’s then-top energy and environmental aide, Michael Catanzaro, the Post reported that White House officials had discussed whether to “consider having a firm position on and a coherent, fact-based message about climate science ― specifically, whether, and to what extent, anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases are affecting the climate system, and what level of concern that warrants.”",
        "Three options were reportedly presented in the memo: The first was to conduct “red team/blue team” debates to “highlight uncertainties” in climate data; the second was to review scientific studies under the Administrative Procedure Act; and the final option was to simply “ignore, and not seek to characterize or question, the science being conducted by Federal agencies and outside entities.”",
        "An option to endorse scientists’ findings was not put on the table.",
        "No formal policy ever did materialize from the memo or subsequent discussions on the issue. Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt was reportedly an advocate of holding “red team/blue team” debates to publicly critique climate science, but that idea was ultimately blocked by the White House, reported The New York Times in March.",
        "As the Post noted, the Catanzaro memo offers a glimpse into the challenges faced by the Trump administration on the issue of climate change. While White House officials continue to publicly downplay climate data and adopt policies to expand fossil fuel production in the U.S., federal agencies have continued to publish research showing that climate change is real, man-made and a growing threat to the U.S.",
        "On Friday, for instance, the National Park Service published a report that said the effects of climate change, like rising sea levels and intensifying storms, could damage park sites across the country. The report’s lead researcher had earlier accused the Trump administration of attempting to censor the study by removing all mentions of human-caused climate change.",
        "Following public outrage, the paper was quietly published with the climate change references intact.",
        "On Wednesday, Democratic lawmakers reacted with fury to the Post’s report.",

        "short_description": "We may not realize it, but retailers are conditioning us to be our own cashiers.",
        "date": "2018-05-24"
    },
    "articleContent": [
        "Customers checking out at Amber Vankleeck’s Walmart store in Tennessee find two convenient options before them: They can take their groceries to a bank of self-checkout machines and start scanning the items themselves, or they can wait in line for a living, breathing cashier like Vankleek who’s much more efficient at it.",
        "But to a certain degree, the choice is already being made for them. Vankleeck says that at her store, management wants 65 percent of all customers going through self-checkout rather than traditional registers. Since many shoppers dislike the machines, the workers themselves often have to nudge them there ― even if it means siphoning work away from wage-earning cashiers.",
        "“They want the self-checkout host to pull as many customers to self-checks as they can,” explained Vankleeck, 23. “They want you to invite them over, say, ‘Hey, have you used our self-checkouts? If not, I’d be happy to show you how it works.’”",
        "After two decades of freeze-ups and unfamiliar items in the bagging area, self-checkout may be in the midst of an expansion. RBR, a research firm focused on banking and retail automation, says that self-checkout terminals recently had a “breakout year,” with global sales increasing by 67 percent in 2016; a surge in U.S. big-box stores purchases was a driving factor. NCR Corporation, the leading manufacturer of self-checkout machines, says it’s had record growth over the past two years.",
        "The way retailers and industry watchers tell it, self-checkout is growing because customers want it to grow. Tech-savvy millennials would rather deal with a machine than make small talk, and even old-school shoppers might like to avoid a long cashier line if they’ve only got a couple items.",
        "Kory Lundberg, a Walmart spokesman, said shoppers’ preferences dictate what the checkout lane looks like. “The way people are shopping is changing, and the pace of change is only going to increase,” Lundberg said. “Our focus is on providing the options our customers are looking for and helping them save time and money.”",
        "But what retailers don’t mention are the ways they’re trying to shape our behavior as consumers, especially if it can save on labor costs. At Vankleeck’s store, for instance, a customer who’s successfully steered away from a cashier and to a self-checkout kiosk is known as a “pull.” The self-checkout hosts who oversee several kiosks track the number of pulls they accomplish in a shift.",
        "“Our assumption is that [retailers] are in a process to retrain customers’ expectations so that over time self-checkout becomes a bigger and bigger part of it,” said Dan Schlademan, co-director of the Organization United for Respect, a worker center for retail employees. “The whole industry is trying to think of how it can get rid of every human it can. This isn’t some secret.”",
        "Certain chains that used to steer 30 percent of shoppers to self-checkout lanes are now steering 60 or 70 percent, said Dusty Lutz, a vice president at NCR. A lot of the boom comes courtesy of smaller-footprint stores. Shoppers tend to be more amenable to self-checkout where they’re buying only a handful of items and don’t have to deal with produce. At the pharmacy chain CVS, self-checkout kiosks can now outnumber manned registers at many locations.",
        "In January, Amazon unveiled its first location for Amazon Go, a store concept with no checkout at all. Customers in the Seattle store grab what they please off the shelves, while computer vision puts the items in the online shopping carts of their Amazon accounts. It adds up to what Amazon calls a “just walk out” shopping experience without cashiers.",
        "In theory, the growth of self-checkout and “scan and go” technology could be a win-win for everybody, including cashiers. By letting customers handle their own scanning and bagging, workers can spend their time helping customers find what they need. Even in an Amazon Go store, someone has to keep the shelves stocked and answer questions. Self-checkout can free up workers to do other important tasks — or so the thinking goes.",
        "“There’s still an absolute need for the human touch in these stores,” said Lutz. “But we do see a shift: Let’s take them away from the almost menial task of scanning and do higher-value work.”",
        "That hypothesis rests on the assumption that retailers would put displaced cashiers in other roles. Wally Waugh is skeptical. He has spent decades working in grocery stores, an industry known for its low-profit margins. He insists that the advent of self-checkout has made grocers more reluctant to make full-time hires.",
        "Waugh said that he and other workers faced weekly self-checkout quotas when he worked for Waldbaum’s, a New York-based supermarket chain that closed in 2015. Managers hit their targets at the kiosks by manipulating how many traditional registers were open; closing the number of available lanes inevitably steered shoppers toward self-checkout.",
        "According to Waugh, what was originally billed as a supplement to workers is more likely to replace them.",
        "“When I first started in this business, it was not odd to hire full-time cashiers,” said the 54-year-old, who now manages the front end of a Stop & Shop on Long Island. “But as the years went on and these machines became more and more prevalent, that went by the wayside. Now I’d say it’s almost unheard of for someone to hire a full-time cashier.”",
        "In its latest occupational outlook, the Bureau of Labor Statistics forecasts a 1 percent drop in the number of cashiers between 2016 and 2026, or the loss of an equivalent of 30,600 positions out of around 3.5 million. That may not sound like a hemorrhaging of jobs, but BLS predicts that the number of cashiers will fall in spite of a growing retail sector, thanks to self-checkout and online sales. Cashier is one of the most common U.S. jobs for someone without a college degree.",
        "“It’s kind of solving a problem that was not a problem for the consumer ― it was a problem for the grocer,” said Erikka Knuti, a spokeswoman for the United Food and Commercial Workers union, which represents hundreds of thousands of grocery workers.",
        "Knuti argued that the shift toward self-checkout devalues customer service, noting that anyone who scans and bags all day is going to be much better at it than any shopper. “They’re looking at labor as a cost, rather than an opportunity to make more money,” she said of grocers.",
        "Self-checkout will grow faster if manufacturers can eliminate the most common hiccups: the struggle to find a code for items without barcodes, like produce; the dreaded unknown item in the bagging area; and the need for an age check on alcohol purchases. NCR’s Lutz says his company is already developing remedies. The answers all involve artificial intelligence and computer vision (and, in the case of buying booze without a human looking at your driver’s license, probably some lobbying and legislation, too).",
        "“We have solutions for those top three problems already in the lab,” he said.",
        "However the machines improve, Waugh says, there are certain things a cashier does that a computerized kiosk could never duplicate. He has a handful of elderly regulars who stop by his store two or three times daily; he figures they come by so often because his cashiers offer some of the only conversation they have over the course of the day.

        "“My personal opinion is there’s no substitute for people; we offer something that I think the machines can never offer,” Waugh said. “If you’re someone like me, heading home after long day’s work, you’re going to want to be catered to a little bit. But you see the trend and where the industry is heading; there’s really no way to stop this.”"

        "Family road trips can be a test for parents on how long they can keep kids occupied in the car before the children reach their breaking point, or more specifically, their tantrum point.",
        "We asked the HuffPost Parents community about their tips and tricks for keeping kids occupied during those long drives, and we’ve got two words for you: baby wipes. Even if your kids aren’t babies, our readers said.",
        "They also suggested other important items to always have in the car in case of emergencies and a few ways to keep the kids busy and happy. Here are 14 tips from our readers on how to make family road trips more manageable.",
        "“We move and travel often and I’ve learned a few tricks. If taking a road trip, consider covering your car’s seats with a waterproof cover. It’s much easier to clean, especially if your kids get carsick. It saves the upholstery from all kinds of messes: food, spills, vomit. I also recommend using Ziploc bags for carsick kids. That way you can seal it up and toss it without any spillage. Headphones are a lifesaver! I love Cozy Phones headphones for smaller kids. They are cute and totally wearable. And snacks are a must! Keep it simple and mess-free (or mostly mess-free) with fruit strips, applesauce pouches, jerky, etc. We like to keep a small soft-sided cooler in the car to store Lunchables and Go-Gurts. And no matter how old your kids are, bring baby wipes!” ― Heather Williams",
        "“DVD player, iPad, another tablet, plenty of snacks, drinks and rest breaks for meals like breakfast or dinner. We usually eat sandwiches in the car. I pack an entire cooler full of sandwiches, fruit, cheese, and veggies likes carrot and celery sticks. I pack another cooler of water, juices boxes, tea for myself and Cokes for my husband. I make individual bags with a sandwich, fruit, and cheese. That way each person can grab what they want. My son is very easy to travel with, and as long as he’s not hungry, sick or bored, he’s good to go.” ― Melissa Watson",
        "“I try to space things out, but it’s a mix of each kid having screen time on their tablets, movies on our flip-down screen in the car, and snacks ― lots of them. When we stop for gas/potty breaks, I let the kids get out to pick out a special treat at a gas station, even if it’s candy. On our most recent trip I stocked up a cheap plastic bin with dry-erase boards for each kid with markers, crayons and coloring books. Wipes of any kind, whether baby wipes or Wet Ones in a canister are a huge help to clean messy hands from all the snacking. A full-sized bottle of hand sanitizer with a pump, a roll of paper towels, and box of tissue that I can keep within an arm’s reach in the car, are also always on my necessities list.” ― Charlotte Kennedy",
        "“For road trips we bring toys that are magnetic and a grabber toy... so kids strapped in car seats can often pick up the toys they drop without help from Mom or Dad!” ― Jenn Otto",
        "“We have each kid pack a ‘go bag.’ They have toys, books, headphones, tablets, and coloring books and colored pencils. We also get travel books and games from Usborne Books. We have a travel case for movies and a car DVD player, since we drive eight hours back to our hometown. Snacks and juice pouches are easily accessible, and [we sometimes use] ‘calm-down candy’ as a bribe. I also have a container in the car for travel with Band-Aids, Pedialyte, Tylenol, Tums, wet wipes, and Neosporin.” ― Rachael Grayson",
        "“First we start with car bingo ($1 cards at Target). When that gets boring we move to books, and when all else fails (and it usually does), it’s screen time, baby! Lay on the iPhone, iPad, portable Blu-ray player! Works every time and gets us to where we are going with less bickering than when I was a kiddo.” ― Brianna Freeburn",
        "“I like to visit the local comic book store and get some new comics for my boys. They’re cheap and small enough for travel. They encourage reading and imagination. They also come in so many genres from ‘My Little Pony’ to superheroes to everything Disney to Spongebob. Really can’t go wrong.” ― Shannon Prieto",
        "“We traveled from Ontario to British Columbia in Canada with four kids ages 1 to 7. I brought a bag of toys for each one, which they had finished looking at a half hour into the trip. We discovered they enjoyed looking out the windows most and playing car bingo games, despite them being very active kids. Our success also rode on our timing. We would pack up each morning and be on the road between 5 and 6 a.m., stop for gas, a pee break and to change clothes, then eat breakfast on the road again. We’d stop for lunch at a park, but we’d have finished eight hours of driving by early afternoon, so they had all afternoon and evening to play. It made it not seem like such long days when we got so much driving done while they were groggy!” ― Sarah Devries",
        "“Some favorite toys/books and a couple new ones for emergencies. Lots of snacks. One or two containers of Play-Doh (keep it simple!), activity books and sticker books. Don’t forget to play games. My kids are always distracted by playing I Spy, or when we are in the car finding certain colored cars or houses, or all the letters in the alphabet in order.” ― Amy Kilpatrick",
        "“I pack magazines, coloring books and plain paper for drawing. Word search pads for our 8-year-old, and new coloring pens, as we travel by car a lot. We invested in a travel lap tray that wraps around her that has pockets and good edges so nothing can fall off. Oh, and not forgetting snacks!” ― Cheri Wickers",
        "“Magnetic ‘paper’ dolls are pretty cool and fun. They make lots of themes: pirates on a ship, animals on a farm, princess in a castle, etc.” ― Angela Ballard Peene",
        "“With my son, Audible. He can handle long car rides only as long as he has a book to listen to. Works for me!” ― Cat Williams",
        "“Whenever we go on road trips with the kiddos, we pack a portable DVD player, small toys, books, coloring books, drawing paper, and crayons/pencils. Also lots of snacks. I teach them games my brother and I played when we were younger and on the road. We talk about things we see out the windows, and I try to encourage talking about their books and what they mean to them.” ― Breanna Boenicke",
        "“Snacks on snacks on snacks! Did I mention snacks? Also, suckers, Legos, some action figures that he forgot about having so it’s like a new toy, and colorful pens/crayons to draw with. Play-Doh is nice as a last resort, but proceed with caution.” ― Crystal Michelle",

        "President Donald Trump just got one more reason not to visit this Southern California city.",
        "West Hollywood ― which has continuously gone out of its way to denounce Trump ― presented adult film star Stormy Daniels with the key to the city on Wednesday while proclaiming the day “Stormy Daniels Day.”",
        "Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, was honored for “her leadership in the #RESIST movement” ― in particular for being a “national figure in the resistance to the Trump Administration,” the city said in a statement.",
        "“In these politically tumultuous times, Daniels has proven herself to be a profile in courage by speaking truth to power even under threats to her safety and extreme intimidation,” the statement read.",
        "The 39-year-old actress and director, who was recognized at the Santa Monica Boulevard sex shop Chi Chi LaRue’s, won national fame after alleging that she’d had an affair with Trump in 2006. Daniels has continued to tell her story, though she said someone threatened her over it.",
        "In a tweet leading up to Wednesday’s event, West Hollywood Mayor John Duran shared that “right-wing hate mail is pouring in” over his city’s decision to recognize Daniels. It “tells me I am doing something right!” he tweeted.",
        "West Hollywood, also known as WeHo, has been frosty to Trump for some time. In 2016, its then-Mayor Lindsey Horvath wrote a letter to the then-presidential candidate, informing him that his “campaign of violence and intimidation is not welcome in our city.”",
        "“I demand that you renounce calls to violence and consider the role you play in shaping public discourse, specifically with the words you choose and the behavior you exhibit and encourage,” Horvath stated. “We do not have to agree or like one another, but as Americans and political figures in the public eye, we share a responsibility to lead by example.”",
        "In June 2017, West Hollywood’s City Council also passed a resolution that called on the U.S. House of Representatives to begin initiating Trump’s impeachment. The resolution cited a number of reasons, including his revenue from his businesses both in the U.S. and abroad; his refusal to release his tax returns; nepotism; concerns about collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government, and possible obstruction of justice with the firing of former FBI Director James Comey."

        "date": "2018-05-24"
    },
    "articleContent": [
        "The Trump administration is forging ahead with a previously sidelined plan to allow U.S. gun manufacturers sell their products abroad more cheaply and easily.",
        "The proposed rule, published Thursday in the Federal Register, would shift control of U.S. firearm exports from the State Department to the Commerce Department, in a move the regulatory language said is aimed at reducing “procedural burdens and costs” on American gunmakers doing international business.",
        "The plan would also save the U.S. government money by simplifying the licensing process, according to the proposal.",
        "As a result, gun companies would likely be able to expand foreign sales of popular civilian firearms and accessories that have attracted controversy in the U.S. These include semi-automatic military-style guns like AR-15s, .50 caliber rifles, scopes and certain high-capacity ammunition magazines.",
        "That would be a boon to an industry that has experienced sharp declines in sales since Donald Trump’s won the White House in 2016, after years of record sales driven by fears that former President Barack Obama would tighten gun laws. The Obama administration had mulled a similar export plan during his first term, but abandoned it following the 2012 mass shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut.",
        "If the rule change takes effect, foreign arms sales are expected to increase as much as 20 percent, according to the National Sports Shooting Foundation, the gun industry’s trade association. Other arms trade experts have predicted a much smaller boost.",
        "But the plan has also raised concerns among foreign policy experts and some Democratic lawmakers who say that the reduced oversight under the new system could increase gun violence in other nations by putting more powerful weaponry in the hands of human rights abusers and criminal factions, as well as the civilian population.",
        "Direct civilian access to U.S.-made weapons would depend on their nations’ gun laws.",
        "Under the current version of the Arms Export Control Act, the State Department issues licenses and attempts to monitor the flow of U.S. firearms, including who ultimately receives exported guns. Larger arms exports are also subject to scrutiny from Congress and the public, a system that has at times effectively prevented firearms from ending up in the hands of corrupt governments, terrorist organizations and especially violent foreign law enforcement bodies.",
        "In 2016, for instance, Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) blocked a proposed arms export deal between the U.S. and the Philippines, amid reports of human rights abuses by that nation’s police forces.",
        "The Commerce Department, critics of the proposed rule change said, lacks any of the infrastructure or oversight ability to properly monitor what happens to U.S.-made weapons once they leave the country.",
        "“When it comes to Commerce, the inspection program isn’t transparent, it doesn’t report to Congress, and it’s unclear what they do at all,” said John Lindsay-Poland, a researcher for Global Exchange, an international human rights group.",
        "“We anticipate there will be even less oversight by Commerce now than there was by State,” he said. “It was already problematic, and now all the indicators are that the gates will open and there won’t be any controls on who gets weapons that are legally exported.”",
        "Democrats and human rights groups have warned that the rule changes could worsen gun violence problems in foreign countries, particularly in Mexico and other Latin American nations.",
        "The proposed rule change, slated to go into effect no less than a month after a public comment ends in July, would be “extremely hazardous to global security,” Cardin said in a statement.",
        "“Small arms and light weapons are among the most lethal weapons that we and other countries export because these are the weapons that are most likely to be used to commit atrocities and suppress human rights, either by individuals, non-state groups, or governmental security and paramilitary forces,” Cardin said.",
        "House Democrats have introduced legislation to block transferring the arms export oversight to Commerce, but it’s unlikely to advance in the Republican-controlled Congress.",
        "From 2009 to 2014, more than 73,000 U.S.-made guns were seized in Mexico, and 70 percent of guns used in Mexican homicides in 2017 were manufactured in the U.S., according to the Violence Policy Center, a nonprofit that advocates for gun control. In past years, more than 90 percent of guns seized in the Bahamas and roughly 80 percent of firearms seized in Jamaica are made in the U.S. And in Brazil, police have reported finding an escalating number of American-made rifles in crimes and shootouts between rival drug gangs.",
        "Many of those guns are illegally smuggled into Latin America. But firearms also reach criminal factions thanks to legal exports and sales to police: in Mexico, more than 20,000 firearms, many of them American-made, have been lost by or stolen from police since 2006, Lindsay-Poland said.",
        "“All of the evidence and experience with gun violence in Latin America indicates that there will be more blood from U.S.-sourced weapons” thanks to the rule change, Lindsay-Poland said.",
        "Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a gun control advocate who opposes the proposed rule change, said this week that the U.S. could be on the verge of “exporting” its epidemic of gun violence to other nations.",
        "“We created the modern open economy, we created participatory democracy, we created the internet age, but on this one fundamental human concern, the thing that matters most to us, our physical safety, and the physical safety of our loved ones, we don’t lead,” Murphy said at a forum on the arms trade. “In fact, we do the very opposite. The United States runs at the very back of the pack.”"

        "Democratic caucus chairman Joe Crowley (D-N.Y.) and vice chair Linda Sánchez (D-Calif.), as well as Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Calif.), who chairs a House task force on gun violence prevention, and Rep. Ted Deutch (D-Fla.) sent a letter to fellow Democratic lawmakers encouraging them to offer summer internships to students who have been advocating for gun safety measures.",
        "“We have all been impressed with the leadership and passion shown by students around the country on the issue of gun violence prevention,” the lawmakers wrote. “Through efforts like the March for Our Lives, students have been speaking up and demanding action on this issue like never before, and they are an inspiration to many of us.”",
        "The internship announcement comes less than a week after 10 people were killed in a shooting at a high school in Santa Fe, Texas.",
        "The Feb. 14 Parkland shooting sparked a nationwide conversation on gun violence and prompted survivors, as well as thousands of other students across the country, to embrace gun control activism. The students created the March for Our Lives and #NeverAgain movements to continue public discourse on gun violence well after news coverage of the shootings petered out.",
        "Crowley said the idea for the internship program arose after the Parkland shooting, but things “kicked into gear” after the Santa Fe massacre.",
        "“These students have been through something none of us would ever want to experience,” Crowley told HuffPost. “It’s important that we learn from their experience.”",

    "articleContent": [
        "A federal judge has issued a ruling in a single immigrant’s legal case that could foreshadow problems for the Trump administration’s policy of detaining unauthorized immigrants indefinitely without a hearing, charge or trial.",
        "The government has 14 days to hold a bond hearing for Augustin Sajous, a 60-year-old originally from Haiti who has been held in immigration detention since September, Judge Alison J. Nathan ruled Wednesday in New York. Authorities must release him unless they can provide convincing evidence he is a flight risk or a danger to the community, the judge ordered.",
        "Nathan’s ruling applies only to Sajous. But it’s a key part of a bigger fight over a question affecting millions of people: How long can the government detain immigrants without allowing them to go before an immigration judge to challenge their detention?",
        "The answer to that question used to be “six months” — at least according to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, which ruled on the matter in 2013. Then, this February, the Supreme Court overturned the circuit court’s ruling, clearing the way for the government to continue detaining immigrants without hearings.",
        "The Supreme Court ruling was limited: It said only that immigrants had no specific right under immigration law to a bond hearing every six months. It didn’t rule on whether holding immigrants indefinitely without a bond hearing was constitutional.",
        "Nathan’s ruling offered an answer to that constitutional question — but only for Sajous. The continued detention of Sajous “without access to a bond hearing is unreasonable, and thus unconstitutional, as applied to him,” she wrote. His more than eight-month detention stemmed from two offenses that were each punishable by up to 30 days in jail, she noted, meaning he has already been detained “over four times longer than the maximum sentence he faced for his underlying offenses.”",
        "The court did not create a definitive standard for when the government must provide a bond hearing.",
        "Now Sajous’ case — or a similar one, if the Department of Justice doesn’t appeal — is likely to work its way up through the courts. That means the Supreme Court will likely be forced to weigh in on the question it avoided answering in February.",
        "The Justice Department declined to comment on the ruling or whether it plans to appeal.",
        "Sajous, who has lived in the U.S. on a green card since age 14 and has raised a family here, could be out of detention by early June. Although he is a legal permanent resident, Sajous, who has had depression and been homeless in recent years, is subject to deportation because of two misdemeanor convictions from 2015 for bending fare cards to use the New York subway without paying. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested him in September, and he has remained in detention since.",
        "“It feels almost impossible to fight your immigration case from detention,” Sajous said in a statement released by the New York Civil Liberties Union, which represented him. “I just want the chance to explain to the judge that I’m not a flight risk. When you’re free, it’s a lot easier to fight your case. A bond hearing is my chance.”",
        "Nathan’s ruling means he’ll get one. But the NYCLU estimates that unless courts intervene, in the next year about 200 people in New York state may be detained for longer than six months without a bond hearing.",
        "The other immigrants being held without hearings will likely have to sue the government in federal court to get their own — or to wait and hope for the Supreme Court to rule their detention unconstitutional."

Duran handed Daniels the keys to the city of 34,000 residents, in addition to a city proclamation.

        "short_description": "A failed startup suggested that Facebook mounted what could be described as mass surveillance.",
        "date": "2018-05-24"
    },
    "articleContent": [
        "Facebook stands accused of gathering substantially more information on users than it admits, according to claims laid out in court documents filed at the superior court in San Mateo, California, on behalf of a former startup, The Guardian first reported Thursday.",
        "The former startup, Six4Three, alleges that Facebook once used its associated apps to gather information on users by accessing text messages and photos, listening through device microphones and remotely turning on Bluetooth to pinpoint location ― sometimes without explicit consent.",
        "Six4Three detailed the accusations in the fifth version of its official complaint, initially filed in 2015.",
        "Although the case argues for the return of a Facebook policy that has been roundly criticized for failing to protect personal data, accusations of surveillance are enough to raise eyebrows in the wake of the privacy scandal wrought by the research firm Cambridge Analytica.",
        "Rumors that Facebook is secretly listening via users’ microphones have persistently circulated due to anecdotal evidence from Facebook users who have described seeing ads on the site oddly related to topics they discussed earlier. The company’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg was even asked about ― and denied ― the theory at an April U.S. Senate hearing.",
        "“These claims have no merit, and we will continue to defend ourselves vigorously,” a Facebook spokeswoman said in a statement provided to HuffPost. Facebook’s main interest, she said, is protecting “the user experience.”",
        "Six4Three started waging its battle against the social media giant in early 2015, when, after announcing that it would do so one year before, Facebook axed a policy that allowed third-party developers access to personal information. The startup had offered a controversial app for $1.99 called Pikinis that allowed users to easily locate friends’ swimsuit photos.",
        "The app failed to take off, and the policy change spelled the end of it. Pikinis is now defunct.",
        "Six4Three laid out its disturbing claims against Facebook in a January complaint unearthed by The Guardian.",
        "In the filing, the startup says Facebook “explore[d] and implement[ed] ways to track users’ location, to track and read their texts, to access and record their microphones on their phones, to track and monitor their usage of competitive apps on their phones, and to track and monitor their calls” from about 2013 through 2015.",
        "Specifically, the suit alleges that Facebook accessed and monitored Android users’ microphones without getting explicit permission from some of them.",
        "Facebook stated in March that call and text logging is an opt-in feature for people using Messenger or Facebook Lite, a pared-down version of the site for Android users. But the company said the feature allows it to check only contact information and not the content of calls or texts.",
        "Six4Three also alleged that Facebook has meddled with iPhone photo albums. According to the filing, the company “has not fully disclosed the manner in which it preprocesses photos on the iOS camera roll, meaning if a user has any Facebook app installed on their iPhone, then Facebook accesses and analyzes (using facial and other image recognition) the photos the user takes and/or stores on the iPhone.”",
        "The suit appears to refer to photo syncing, a feature that uploads photos from a device into a private Facebook album for easier sharing; Facebook says users must opt into the feature. The Moments app, which Facebook introduced in 2015, also syncs photos.",
        "In another claim, the company says Facebook “implemented a project” to remotely turn on Bluetooth in users’ devices without fully disclosing doing so, in order to discern their location.",
        "The startup also states that Facebook used data from Onavo, an app it purchased in 2013, to study what people did on their phones beyond using Facebook, “including detailed information on things such as which apps people generally are using, how frequently, for how long, and whether more women than men use an app in a specific country.”",
        "Six4Three alleged that Facebook only partially disclosed that it was gathering such data from users.",
        "Lawyers for the startup did not immediately return HuffPost’s request for comment.",
        "Court documents filed last week contain emails and messages between Facebook’s senior managers that are currently sealed but may become public in the coming weeks, pending a decision from Judge V. Raymond Swope.",
        "Facebook’s ability to disseminate private information has been intensely debated in recent months after a whistleblower revealed that a U.K. researcher used the site to gather data on millions of people and handed it to Cambridge Analytica, which helped Donald Trump’s presidential campaign."

        "date": "2018-05-24"
    },
    "articleContent": [
        "The hardware on Uber’s self-driving car that struck and killed a 49-year-old woman in Arizona this March worked just fine, a new report found — it’s the software that failed.",
        "That’s one of several takeaways from a preliminary report released Thursday by the National Transportation Safety Board, which found Uber’s self-driving Volvo SUV observed the woman six seconds before the fatal crash, but failed to take any action to avoid her.",
        "On-board software initially classified the pedestrian as an unknown object, then as a vehicle, and finally as a bicycle in the seconds leading up to the crash, though the vehicle couldn’t definitively predict the bike’s path and adjust accordingly.",
        "1.3 seconds before the collision, the SUV was traveling at about 40 mph and determined an “emergency braking maneuver” was necessary. No such action was taken, however, as the system is currently disabled “to reduce the potential for erratic vehicle behavior,” the NTSB said.",
        "Uber told HuffPost it disables the emergency braking system on all of its Volvo SUVs while the cars are operating in autonomous mode as it’s a Volvo system, not an Uber system. That aligns with a report earlier this month that concluded the Uber did in fact recognize the woman, but failed to avoid her because of a software setting.",
        "A human safety driver who was in the Uber at the time should have intervened and taken control of the car, but didn’t. Video from the accident shows the driver wasn’t looking at the road, and instead was “monitoring the self-driving system interface,” she told NTSB investigators.",
        "Uber suspended all of its self-driving operations after the accident, and permanently ceased testing in Arizona on Wednesday. An Uber spokesperson told HuffPost that when it resumes testing in its two remaining cities of San Francisco and Pittsburgh, it will likely be on a more limited basis.",
        "Adding to the confusion, the median the pedestrian crossed prior to the collision features two prominent brick-colored pathways, seen below forming a broad “X”:",
        "Despite looking like a safe spot to cross, however, the paths aren’t meant for pedestrians. A spokesperson for the City of Tempe declined to comment on the median’s design or the intended purpose of the brick pathways, citing the ongoing investigation.",
        "The NTSB report also noted the pedestrian tested positive for methamphetamine and marijuana. That information is of limited use ― the Uber should have identified and avoided her either way ― but it does potentially provide insight into why she didn’t cross at the crosswalk 360 feet to the north, and why she was unaware of the vehicle until immediately before impact.",
        "Investigators added the woman crossed in a section of road that isn’t illuminated by street lights, was wearing dark clothing at the time, and her bicycle had no reflectors that were visible to the car.",
        "“Over the course of the last two months, we’ve worked closely with the NTSB,” Uber said in an emailed statement to HuffPost Thursday. “As their investigation continues, we’ve initiated our own safety review of our self-driving vehicles program.”",
        "The company noted it also hired former NTSB Chairman Christopher Hart earlier this month in an advisory role."

        "Gallup’s annual Values and Morals poll, conducted May 1 through 10 and released on Wednesday, found that 67 percent of Americans surveyed said same-sex marriage should be legally valid.",
        "That’s up 40 percentage points from 1996, when Gallup first asked the question, and it is the highest level of support on record.",
        "Same-sex marriage has been legal nationwide since the Supreme Court’s landmark 2015 ruling in the Obergefell v. Hodges case. The decision was a historic victory for gay rights activists, who fought for years in lower courts for marriage equality, and it came over a decade after Massachusetts became the first state to legalize same-sex marriage. By 2015, 37 states and the District of Columbia already recognized marriage equality.",
        "Activists have noted, though, that despite the steady rise in popular support, same-sex marriage faces very real and persistent threats. Fewer than half the Republicans polled — 44 percent — said gay marriage should be legal, according to Gallup. Other polls have found support to be even lower among the most conservative Republicans and Christian evangelicals, who dominate the GOP base, which President Donald Trump has catered to since declaring his candidacy. From signing discriminatory “religious liberty” orders to banning transgender people from the military, Trump and social conservatives have found ways to challenge LGBTQ rights.",
        "Trump’s Supreme Court appointee, Justice Neil Gorsuch, is known to oppose same-sex marriage and in 2017 sent a message to state courts that they should challenge the Obergefell decision.",
        "As HuffPost editor-at-large Michelangelo Signorile warned, “The greater threat in the short term than outright overturning Obergefell is the effort to turn same-sex marriage into second-class marriage.”",
        "Some cities and states have thrown into question whether same-sex couples should receive spousal benefits, be allowed to adopt children and have both spouses’ names listed on birth certificates.",
        "Despite such obstacles, the percentage of LGBTQ Americans in a same-sex marriage has steadily grown since the Supreme Court ruling. As of June 2017, when Gallup last released findings on the topic, just over 10 percent of adult gay and lesbian Americans said they were married to their partner.",
        "That was far below the 50 percent for American adults overall, according to Pew Research, but was up from roughly 8 percent pre-Obergefell. “It’s likely that the percentage of married LGBT adults in the U.S. will continue to grow as new generations of same-sex couples enjoy their newfound rights,” Gallup writer Justin McCarthy said.",
        "This rise in gay marriages means that Americans are increasingly likely to know someone who has wed a same-sex partner, which Gallup said may play a role in reversing previously held opposition to the legal status of such unions.",
        "“Now that it’s been legal for nearly three years ― and even longer in certain states ― some opponents to gay marriage may be rethinking their previous opposition,” McCarthy wrote."

        "Italy’s President Sergio Mattarella approved the country’s far-right and anti-establishment parties’ nominee for prime minister on Wednesday, putting the nation on track to have one of the most populist and radical administrations in all of Europe.",
        "The far-right Lega and anti-establishment Five Star parties chose law professor Giuseppe Conte as their consensus pick for Italy’s next prime minister, despite his lack of governing experience. Mattarella giving Conte a mandate to form Italy’s next government clears one of the final hurdles for the two parties before they can begin to run the country.",
        "Both Lega and Five Star hold anti-migrant, anti-European Union views and look to bring the country closer to Russia through lifting economic sanctions against the Kremlin. The new populist government sets Italy up for a clash with the EU and brings more uncertainty for the country’s already fractured politics.",
        "The two non-traditional parties decided to band together after Italy’s election in March left no outright winner and resulted in months of negotiations to form a governing coalition. Italians rejected the country’s once-powerful establishment parties in the vote, leaving Lega and Five Star to fill the void.",
        "“The traditional Italian party system disappeared many elections ago,” said Sheri Berman, a professor of politics at Barnard College. “What you’re seeing now is the detritus of that ― which is a mess.”",
        "A Lega and Five Star coalition was widely seen as a worst case scenario for the EU after Italy’s vote, as both parties hold a longstanding opposition to the bloc. HuffPost Italia obtained an early draft of the coalition’s governing contract in which the two parties hoped to renegotiate EU treaties and identify ways they could potentially opt out of the euro.",
        "The documents showed Five Star and Lega also wanted to reduce Italy’s commitment to NATO, end compulsory vaccinations and ask for the European Central Bank to cancel nearly $300 billion in debt.",
        "The parties amended the contract and watered down their stance toward the European Union in subsequent drafts, but the leaked contract was enough to cause Italy’s stock market to plunge and bring speculation that Italy could cause a crisis in the eurozone.",
        "“Even if the more extreme promises or aspirations of leaving the euro don’t materialize, having this kind of government in a major European country is going to inject instability,” Berman said.",
        "Although the parties have moderated their opposition to the EU in recent years, critics are concerned that the new government’s radical social and economic policies will turn Italy into the latest “sick man of Europe.”",
        "Five Star and Lega have vowed sweeping changes to Italy’s economy, the third-largest in the eurozone. The two parties promised to restore higher pension levels, cut taxes and bolster the welfare system ― despite the fact that Italy has the highest debt ratio out of anywhere in Europe except for Greece.",
        "During the campaign, Lega leader Matteo Salvini also said he would deport 150,000 migrants within a year, and he accused immigrants of bringing crime and disease into Italy. Over 600,000 migrants entered Italy in the last four years, sparking a divisive debate over immigration and a swell of support for the far-right.",
        "Salvini has said he wants to close mosques, and critics say his rhetoric has emboldened far-right hate groups within the country, stirring dark memories of political violence in Italy’s past.",
        "To break the deadlock that followed Italy’s election, Salvini decided to abandon his party’s alliance with longtime Italian power broker Silvio Berlusconi’s center-right party. Instead, he aligned with the populist, ideologically amorphous Five Star.",
        "Five Star, less than a decade old was the party that won the highest percentage of Italy’s vote. The party is led by 31-year-old Luigi Di Maio, a university dropout who was living at home until five years ago. He took over leadership in 2017, offering voters a fresh face and vowing to fight government corruption.",
        "Although Five Star gained more votes in the election, Di Maio and Salvini agreed that neither would be Italy’s next prime minister. Instead, the parties chose law professor Conte as a consensus candidate. Conte, a 54-year-old who specializes in administrative law was until now not anywhere close to a household name.",
        "Within hours of Conte’s nomination, media and lawmakers began to scrutinize his academic credentials. Although he claimed to have studied at New York University, the institution told The New York Times that they had no record of him either as a student or a faculty member.",
        "But Salvini and Di Maio stood by Conte, and President Mattarella backed the nomination on Wednesday.",
        "Several other far-right and populist parties have joined coalition governments in Europe in recent years, including Austria last December. But unlike in Italy, most have been tethered to establishment parties that have limited their ability to carry out their more extreme policies.",

        "“Fuck you! ‘Let me tell GQ about my conversations with Louie,’” Silverman said when the magazine asked about C.K.",
        "“Life is complicated. Love is even more complicated. But you can’t not do it. I don’t have some definitive sound bite or nutshell of how I feel about it, even to myself. But I’m also okay with that.”",
        "While some men who have faced Me Too accusations have denied the charges and “continue to be the politicians or the filmmakers that they are,” others, like C.K., have admitted wrongdoing and have vowed to change, Silverman said.",
        "“And yet those are the ones that kind of are excommunicated forever,” she said. He’s my brother, so it’s hard. I may not have a very clear perspective on it, but I’m trying to.”",
        "On Ansari, who was accused by an unnamed woman of impropriety on a date in a now-viral essay, Silverman said: “I was just like, Gross, I don’t wanna know that about Aziz! Hopefully he’s dealing with things, looking inward, and will blossom from it.”",
        "Silverman also talked about the former comedian, ex-Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.), who stepped down in January after he was accused of inappropriately touching or forcibly kissing eight women.",
        "“I believe in my heart of heart of hearts he never copped a feel,” Silverman said. “The sketch, the whole Leeann Tweeden sketch, is online. You can see it for yourself. It’s not funny, but it’s innocuous. He may have touched some sideboob by accident, or a tush by accident, but I’m telling you, [Franken’s wife] Franni is his best friend and constant companion, and he has eyes for no one else.”",
        "Silverman said she believes Franken “got bullied into resigning” and that she’s “never met a more pure person.”",
        "“He’s a Jewish grandpa. He gives you big, Jewish, wet-lipped kisses. This is a guy whose passion was serving people and making the world a better place,” said Silverman. “There’s a lot of baby-in-bathwater stuff, I think. We’ll just get it in the process.”",
        "Reps for Silverman did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for further comment.",
        "Silverman previously talked about her feelings toward C.K. in November, on her TV show “I Love You America.” She posed the question, “Can you love someone who did bad things?” and talked about her conflicting feelings."

        "President Donald Trump is changing not just American politics. Canadians are increasingly concerned that the president’s nativist and anti-Muslim rhetoric is emboldening hate groups in a Canada, which has long prided itself on multiculturalism and tolerance.",
        "This weekend, far-right activists rallied against asylum seekers on the border between Quebec and New York as riot police and counterprotesters gathered nearby. Members of the Three Percent — a militia founded in the United States that has recently spread to every Canadian province — were at the event. It’s just one of the many far-right groups that have started chapters in the Great White North in the months since Trump’s election.",
        "“After he was elected, obviously the U.S. saw a spike in hate-inspired activity. But Canada did too,” said Ryan Scrivens, a fellow at Concordia University who specializes in tracking far-right groups. He refers to the phenomenon as the “Trump effect.”",

        "In Toronto hate crimes went up by almost a third from 2016 to 2017, with Muslims and Jews the primary targets. In Quebec City, reported hate crimes last year targeting Muslims doubled the 2016 total.",
        "Two mass killings in the last 18 months have added to Canadians’ fears of violent extremism. Both attacks were highly unusual for a country that has mostly been spared the kind of deadly violence that has become all too familiar in the United States.",
        "Last month, a 25-year-old man drove a truck into a crowd of pedestrians on a busy Toronto street, killing 10 people. A post on the suspect’s Facebook account called for a “rebellion” by incels, or involuntary celibates, who are part of the far-right manosphere and often espouse violent misogynistic rhetoric. The post celebrated Elliot Rodger, an American who killed six people after writing a hate-filled manifesto against women.",
        "In January last year, a man attacked worshippers at a Quebec City mosque, killing six Muslim men. Before the attack, the shooter obsessed over far-right Islamophobia, American mass killers and Trump.",
        "Trump’s rhetoric has “galvanized Canadian-based white supremacist ideologies, identities, movements and practices,” Scrivens and three fellow researchers argue in a forthcoming article in the Journal of Hate Studies.",
        "Canada now has as many as 130 active right-wing extremist groups, according to researchers ― about a 30 percent increase since the last assessment in 2015.",
        "Some Canadians are especially worried about the Three Percent, a group whose members often tote assault rifles at American white nationalist rallies. Canada’s stricter gun laws mean members can legally carry only items like baseball bats and tire irons. But, according to reports from Vice and other news outlets, the group conducts paramilitary training in private with guns and tactical gear.",
        "“The fact that there are armed militia groups in Canada right now is anathema. This is not something that we’re accustomed to,” said Barbara Perry, an expert on the Canadian far right at the at University of Ontario Institute of Technology.",

        "It’s not just American hate groups that have made inroads in Canada. Germany’s PEGIDA (Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West) has a Canadian chapter whose members have violently clashed with counterprotesters. Soldiers of Odin, originally a Finnish group with ties to neo-Nazis, is also active in Canada and carries out foot patrols in immigrant neighborhoods.",
        "Establishing what exactly has led to the far right’s growth is difficult. Although some say Trump’s rhetoric has fueled Canada’s hate groups, Canadian extremists have long borrowed far-right narratives from Europe and the United States.",
        "Justin Bourque, who killed three Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers in a shooting attack in 2014, spread anti-government Three Percent memes and anti-Semitic conspiracy theories on social media. He embraced American gun culture and kept a Confederate flag on his bedroom wall.",
        "Canadians also face similar anxieties over immigration and identity that have boosted the far right in other countries.",
        "In Quebec, where some residents fear changing demographics threaten the province’s French-Canadian identity, anti-Islamic and anti-refugee groups flourish. The Montreal Gazette revealed this month that one of North America’s most influential neo-Nazis lives in Montreal.",
        "Quebec’s largest far-right group is La Meute, or the Wolf Pack, which frequently protests against refugees and immigration. La Meute denies it is Islamophobic, but in private Facebook messages, its leadership has discussed using pig heads to vandalize mosques and intimidate Muslims.",
        "Canada has become a hub for far-right media, and several Canadians are “alt-right” darlings. The country’s Rebel Media has provided a launchpad for white nationalist, anti-Islam activists and bloggers who espouse hate and conspiracy theories.",

        "A prominent Southern Baptist Church leader who is known to have made inappropriate comments about abuse and women’s bodies was removed from his position early Wednesday after thousands of evangelical women signed a petition calling for his ouster.",
        "Paige Patterson, formerly the head of the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas, was demoted to president emeritus of the church after a 13-hour board meeting on Tuesday, according to a statement.",
        "He will receive compensation for the position. The statement didn’t refer specifically to his comments about women, but said the discussion about the new leadership direction focused on “challenges facing the institution, including those of enrollment, financial, leadership and institutional identity.”",
        "Dr. D. Jeffrey Bingham, dean of the School of Theology, was appointed as interim president. He currently serves as the vice president of the North American Patristics Society.",
        "More than 3,200 women affiliated with Southern Baptist churches and beyond signed a petition calling for “decisive action” this month.",
        "“We are shocked by the video that has surfaced showing Dr. Paige Patterson objectify a teenage girl and then suggest this as behavior that is biblical,” the letter says.",
        "“We are further grieved by the dangerous and unwise counsel given by Dr. Patterson to women in abusive situations. His recent remarks of clarification do not repudiate his unwise counsel in the past; nor has he offered explanation or repentance for inappropriate comments regarding a teenage girl, the unbiblical teaching he offered on the biblical meaning of womanhood in that objectification, and the inappropriate nature of his own observations of her body.”",
        "A 2000 audio clip resurfaced online recently in which he counseled physically abused wives to “pray through” the situation, stay in abusive relationships, “be submissive in every way” and try as hard as possible not to get divorced.",
        "“I had a woman who was in a church that I served and she was being subject to some abuse and I told her, I said ‘All right, I want you to do this every evening,’ ” Patterson said. ”‘Get down by your bed as you go to sleep, get down by the bed when you think he’s just about asleep, pray and ask God to intervene.’ I said, ‘Get ready because he may get a little more violent when he discovers it.’”",
        "He has also joked in the past about how everyone should “own at least one” woman and has spoken inappropriately about the body of a 16-year-old girl, defending the comments by claiming it’s what the Bible says.",
        "And he reportedly encouraged a woman who had been sexually assaulted not to go to the police and instead told her to forgive the assailant, the woman told The Washington Post.",
        "Although some Southern Baptists have urged Patterson to resign, others have defended him. A petition defending him, which garnered almost 600 signatures, referred to the resurfacing of Patterson’s past comments as “malicious attacks” and “wrong.”"

        "Alex Jones may start to learn that his actions as the conspiracy-minded host of Infowars have consequences.",
        "Family members of six victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, filed a defamation lawsuit on Wednesday against Jones, who for years has peddled the false conspiracy theory that the massacre never happened. FBI agent William Aldenburg, who was among those responding to the shooting in which 26 people were killed, joined the suit, which was obtained by HuffPost.",
        "The suit also names Jones’ Infowars contributor Wolfgang Halbig and Halbig’s associate, Cory Sklanka. It was filed by attorney Josh Koskoff of the Bridgeport, Connecticut-based law firm Koskoff Koskoff & Bieder.",
        "Part of Jones’ false narrative has been that interviews of Sandy Hook parents conducted by CNN were fake.",
        "“Folks, we’ve got video of Anderson Cooper with clear blue-screen out there,” Jones said in a 2014 Infowars broadcast. “He’s not there in the town square. We got people clearly coming up and laughing and then doing the fake crying. We’ve clearly got people where it’s actors playing different parts for different people ... covering up everything.”\n\nThe suit lists numerous videos made by Jones and articles he has written, including one story published just after the shooting titled “FATHER OF SANDY HOOK VICTIM ASKS ‘READ THE CARD?’ SECONDS BEFORE TEAR-JERKING PRESS CONFERENCE.” The story had a video attached to it titled “Sandy Hook Shooting Exposed As a Fraud.”\n\nIn a May 2014 broadcast, Jones asserted that former Mayor of New York City Michael Bloomberg knew about the shooting before it happened. This, of course, is a lie.\n\n“The whole thing, you’ve got ’em jumping the gun ... that Bloomberg was saying get ready the day before, get ready to fundraise on mass shootings ... had a false start, didn’t you Bloomy?” Jones said in a broadcasted conversation with Halbig, according to the suit.\n\nJones’ sidekick, Halbig, has called the Sandy Hook victims “crisis actors” and has also questioned whether the Pulse nightclub and Parkland mass shootings in Florida took place, according to Koskoff.\n\nHalbig, a 70-year-old former police officer and school administrator, harassed the victims and made more than 22 trips from his home in Florida to Connecticut to deliver “highly controversial testimony” to the Newtown Board of Education, the suit said. His many visits led police to warn that he would be charged with harassment unless he stopped contacting residents, according to the suit.\n\nIn a 2015 Facebook post, Halbig floated a false claim that a father of a Sandy Hook victim and Aldenberg were the same person. He’s called the shooting a “scam” and “the biggest illusion ever portrayed by Homeland Security and FEMA,” the new suit says.\n\nThe suit joins a long list of others filed against Jones this year. The parents of two Sandy Hook children filed one in April alleging they have been harassed by conspiracy theorists because of Jones. Earlier that same month, Jones was hit with a defamation lawsuit for misidentifying the Parkland school shooter. And in March, he was hit with a defamation suit for promoting a conspiracy about a witness to the Charlottesville, Virginia, Unite the Right rally last year in which counterprotester Heather Heyer was killed by an alleged white supremacist.",
        "Koskoff said in a statement that Jones “saw an opportunity” to profit off the Sandy Hook tragedy.",
        "“He went on a sustained attack that has lasted for years, accusing shattered family members of being actors, stating as fact that the shooting itself was a hoax and inciting others to act on these malicious lies,” Koskoff said. “He knew his claims were false but he made them anyway to further a simple but pathetic goal: to make money by tearing away at the families’ pain. This lawsuit seeks to hold Alex Jones and his financial network accountable for those disgraceful actions.”",
        "This story has been updated with details from the lawsuit."

        "Teachers whose protests have spread across the country scored one of their first major electoral victories on Tuesday night, when Travis Brenda, a teacher at Rockcastle County High School in Mount Vernon, Kentucky, defeated the state’s House majority leader in a Republican primary.",
        "Brenda ousted GOP state Rep. Jonathan Shell by 123 votes in Kentucky’s 71st House District to win a primary less than two months after educators blanketed the state capitol in protests over pension and budget cuts. The Associated Press called the race ― one of the state’s most closely-watched primaries ― late Tuesday evening.",
        "As the Republican House majority’s floor leader, Shell helped craft and pass a slate of controversial changes to the state’s public pension system that drew the ire of teachers and other state employees in late March and early April. In response to the legislation, which was tucked into a bill that previously dealt with public sewage, teachers shut down school districts in dozens of counties across the state on multiple days.",
        "Brenda opposed the pension cuts and was one of at least 40 teachers seeking public office in Kentucky during the 2018 cycle.",
        "Sixteen of those candidates had primaries on Tuesday, according to the Lexington Herald-Leader, which reported that Brenda used his victory speech to credit state employees and teachers for helping him push back against Gov. Matt Bevin (R) and Republican leaders “for what they did on the pension bill.”",
        "Kentucky’s teacher protests also targeted Bevin’s proposed cuts to the education budget, which has faced 20 separate rounds of spending reductions in the last three decades, according to the Kentucky Center for Economic Policy. The state legislature eventually voted to restore funding to many of the programs Bevin had sought to cut.",
        "But that hasn’t suppressed dissatisfaction with the governor or his allies in the legislature, especially as Bevin continued to criticize teachers in radio and television interviews (in one such case, Bevin blamed the teacher protests for instances of child abuse before later apologizing.)",
        "Teachers were successful in other Kentucky races, too, though none scored a victory quite as significant as Brenda’s.",
        "Unofficial results from the Kentucky Secretary of State showed that retired teachers Linda Edwards and Tom Williamson and current educators Jenny Urie and Lisa Willner appeared to have won Democratic primaries in state House races. Western Kentucky University history professor Patti Minter had a lead in her Democratic primary with nearly all precincts reporting late Tuesday night. And Scott Lewis, a school superintendent in Ohio County, won the Republican nomination in his House district.",
        "Amid the protests, teachers repeatedly promised that when it came time to vote in November, they would target lawmakers who’d supported changes to the pension system and further cuts to state education budgets. Now they’ve delivered a strong early warning to Bevin and those lawmakers that they have the power to follow through on the threats."

    "articleContent": [
        "Former Dallas County Sheriff Lupe Valdez won the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in Texas on Tuesday, kicking off a tough race against Republican Gov. Greg Abbott in November’s general election.",
        "Valdez’s victory in a runoff ― while somewhat expected, after she ran well ahead of Democratic opponent Andrew White in the nine-candidate primary in March ― broke historic barriers as she becomes the first Latina and first openly gay person nominated for governor by a major party in the state.",
        "In Valdez, Texas Democrats chose a lesbian woman of color running on a progressive platform over White, a straight, white Houston businessman and son of a former governor, running as a centrist.",
        "Valdez, 70, faces an uphill battle against Abbott in November. The incumbent, who is favored to win, has amassed more than $40 million for his re-election campaign, while Valdez in recent months raised only about $200,000. Abbott beat his 2014 opponent, then-state Sen. Wendy Davis, in a landslide, despite strong national support behind the pink-sneakered, pro-choice candidate.",
        "The solidly red state has also not elected a Democrat to statewide office since 1994. And it’s been since 1990 that a Democrat won the governor’s office.",
        "But Valdez, the eighth child born to Mexican-American migrant farmworkers, is used to overcoming long odds. When she became sheriff in 2004, she was the nation’s only Latina sheriff, and among the state’s first openly gay sheriffs.",
        "Now she aims to become Texas’ first-ever Hispanic governor.",
        "For Latino Texans, her win would be a triumph of representation in a state where they make up nearly 40 percent of the population.",
        "“It’s long overdue to have Latinas sit in these halls of power,” native Texan Amy Hinojosa, president of national Latina organization MANA, told HuffPost last month. “When you think of the generations of girls to come, to see a Latina, a queer woman in the state house, that just represents such power for young women to be able to aspire to that.”",
        "A Valdez victory in November would also break barriers for the LGBTQ community, as she would become the nation’s first lesbian governor (Oregon Gov. Kate Brown, who took office in 2015, identifies as bisexual).",
        "“You want to see my scars?” Valdez joked to HuffPost in March, speaking of the discrimination she had faced as a queer woman in her career in Texas law enforcement. “The first four or five years [as sheriff] were extremely difficult. I got hate email and faxes. I got pushback from a lot of the good old boys.”",
        "Analysts say that for Valdez to win in November, it will be essential for her to increase historically low turnout among Latino voters, a demographic Democrats have long sought to galvanize in the state. Latino Texans tend to vote Democrat ― though in 2014, Abbott got 44 percent of the Latino vote.",
        "On the key issue of immigration in the border state, where Trump wants to build part of his border wall, Valdez has made a name as a fierce opponent to Abbott.",
        "The governor signed the notoriously anti-immigrant Senate Bill 4 into law last year, which banned “sanctuary” policies that limit local cooperation with federal deportation efforts. In 2015, Valdez clashed with Abbott when she said Dallas County law enforcement officials would only cooperate with federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents on a case-by-case basis.",
        "“People who rape, murder and abuse, commit violent crimes, I have no trouble saying no to ― and I often joke I wish I could say that to a lot of Americans,” Valdez told HuffPost in March.",
        "“But people who came here for a better life, get picked up for a broken taillight or speeding, who make as many mistakes as the rest of us Americans make... which one of us who has no sin can cast the first stone?” she continued. “We should just leave them alone.”",
        "In the lead-up to the runoff, Valdez had faced criticism from local Latinx activists who questioned her record on immigration as sheriff, saying her department often cooperated with ICE in handing over undocumented detainees. Valdez’s team told HuffPost in April that as a local official, she faced challenges in pushing back against the anti-immigrant efforts at the federal and state levels.",
        "Another frequent critique of Valdez has been that she has appeared unprepared to address state-level policy issues ― a concern raised in local newspaper endorsements that went to White.",
        "“She’s demonstrated a really profound lack of understanding of major policy challenges facing Texas,” Mark Jones, a political science professor at Rice University in Houston and head of its Texas Politics program at the Baker Institute, told HuffPost last week.",
        "He said that Valdez, during a recent debate with White, couldn’t answer simple questions about state budgets, and would “fall back on her relatively inspirational personal narrative ― and that’s all she has going for her.”",
        "Responding to such critiques and the endorsements White garnered, Valdez’s team told HuffPost last month that “she can’t win them all,” and she was “used to people telling her she can’t do it or it can’t be done. Time and time again, she has been underestimated and proved them wrong.”",
        "Valdez’s victory will likely intensify speculation as to whether Texas could become a politically competitive state for Democrats.",
        "In another Texas race that will be closely watched, Rep. Beto O’Rourke, also a Democrat, seeks to unseat Republican Sen. Ted Cruz.",
        "“Maybe not this year,” Brittany Perry, an assistant professor at Texas A&M University who specializes in U.S. politics and Latino representation, told HuffPost last month of Valdez’s chances of beating Abbott. “Maybe down the road. Maybe we’re paving the way for future Latino candidates in Texas.”",
        "CORRECTION: A previous version of this story identified Rep. Beto O’Rourke as Latino; he is not."

        "Elizabeth Hill, press secretary for the U.S. Department of Education, provided HuffPost with a clarification of DeVos’ remarks on Wednesday. “Her position is that schools must comply with Plyler and all other applicable and relevant law,” said Hill.",
        "During the hearing, DeVos did note that the 1982 Supreme Court decision requires public schools to educate all students, including those who are undocumented. Still, she repeatedly said it was a school’s decision if it wanted to call ICE on kids and their parents.",
        "MALDEF, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, issued a statement saying that DeVos should resign for “abject incompetence” if she does not “issue an immediate clarification that emphasizes the holding in Plyler.” The organization also said it “stands ready to hold accountable through legal challenge anyone in public education who attempts to report a student to ICE.”",
        "DeVos’ comments could have a chilling impact on undocumented students attending schools, said Andrea Senteno, legislative staff attorney for MALDEF, on Wednesday. Indeed, around the country, schools have seen substantial drops in attendance after ICE raids at local businesses.",
        "“We are very concerned her statement yesterday leaves open to interpretation what the law actually is for schools and administrators and those in the community,” Senteno said. “There are going to be students and family members who are not going to know what that means.”",
        "The Education Department needs to make publicly clear “what the current law is and what students’ rights are,” said Senteno.",
        "The American Civil Liberties Union also blasted DeVos’ comments at the hearing.",
        "“Let’s be clear: Any school that reports a child to ICE would violate the Constitution. The Supreme Court has made clear that every child in America has a right to a basic education, regardless of immigration status. Secretary DeVos is once again wrong,” said Lorella Praeli, director of immigration policy and campaigns for the ACLU, in a statement.",
        "CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misspelled the name of MALDEF legislative staff attorney Andrea Senteno."

        "LONDON (Reuters) - A global team of scientists plans to scour the icy depths of Loch Ness next month using environmental DNA (eDNA) in an experiment that may discover whether Scotland’s fabled monster really does, or did, exist.",
        "The use of eDNA sampling is already well established as a tool for monitoring marine life like whales and sharks.",
        "Whenever a creature moves through its environment, it leaves behind tiny fragments of DNA from skin, scales, feathers, fur, faeces and urine.",
        "“This DNA can be captured, sequenced and then used to identify that creature by comparing the sequence obtained to large databases of known genetic sequences from hundreds of thousands of different organisms,” said team spokesman Professor Neil Gemmell of the University of Otago in New Zealand.",
        "The first written record of a monster relates to the Irish monk St Columba, who is said to have banished a “water beast” to the depths of the River Ness in the 6th century.",
        "The most famous picture of Nessie, known as the “surgeon’s photo”, was taken in 1934 and showed a head on a long neck emerging from the water. It was revealed 60 years later to have been a hoax that used a sea monster model attached to a toy submarine.",
        "Countless unsuccessful attempts to track down the monster have been made in the years since, notably in 2003 when the BBC funded an extensive scientific search that used 600 sonar beams and satellite tracking to sweep the full length of the loch.\n\nThe most recent attempt was two years ago when a high-tech marine drone found a monster - but not the one it was looking for. The discovery turned out to be replica used in the 1970 film “The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes”, which sank nearly 50 years ago.\n\nGemmell’s team, which comprises scientists from Britain, Denmark, the United States, Australia and France, is keen to stress the expedition is more than just a monster hunt.\n\n“While the prospect of looking for evidence of the Loch Ness monster is the hook to this project, there is an extraordinary amount of new knowledge that we will gain from the work about organisms that inhabit Loch Ness,” Gemmell said on his university website.",
        "He predicts they will document new species of life, particularly bacteria, and will provide important data on the extent of several new invasive species recently seen in the loch, such as Pacific pink salmon.\n\nTheir findings are expected to be presented in January 2019.\n\nReporting by Ana de Liz; editing by Stephen Addison"

But the final episode stands apart from Hannah’s narrative. It features one of the most horrifying and heartbreaking scenes I’ve ever seen on television.",
        "The scene occurs midway through Episode 13, dubbed “Bye.” Tyler (Devin Druid), who recently returned to school following a stint in behavioral rehab after he was caught vandalizing the baseball field, is confronted in a bathroom by Monty (Timothy Granaderos) and two other student-athletes. Monty, a close friend of villainous jock Bryce (Justin Prentice) ― who has somehow gotten away with raping both Hannah and Jessica (Alisha Boe) ― is still reeling over the fact that Tyler ruined Liberty’s baseball season. When Monty sees that Tyler’s back at school, he plans to make him suffer.",
        "So Monty and his friends initiate a sequence of male-on-male violence rarely seen on-screen. First, they smash Tyler’s head against a mirror and sink. Then they shove his head in a toilet, pinning him down. Monty proceeds to sodomize Tyler with a mop handle, aggressively pushing it deeper into Tyler’s rectum as the teen cries out in agony. When the heinous act is completed, the young men leave Tyler there, petrified, bleeding and bruised.",
        "It’s a stomach-churning two minutes worth of storyline, which Druid ― along with fellow cast members Boe, Dylan Minnette, Ross Butler and Christian Navarro ― discussed in an interview with HuffPost on Tuesday.",
        "“When it did come time to get to the final episode and [showrunner] Brian [Yorkey] was walking me through this idea of what would happen to Tyler, it was incredibly intimidating,” he told me during a Build Series segment in New York City. “Because you’re suddenly given this responsibility to portray this horrific thing that unfortunately happens to many people around the world, and to a lot of young people these days.”",
        "“But then you think about what you’re doing and the greater impact that it will hopefully have on people’s lives,” he added, “and it does kind of fill you with a sense of bringing justice to something and saying, hopefully, this is helping someone and that will make me feel much better about what we’re doing here.”",
        "The “horrific thing” Druid mentioned, “that unfortunately happens to many people,” is a reference to the sexual assault his character was forced to endure. But it could also refer to the violence Tyler almost enacts on his peers: Shortly after the assault scene, “13 Reasons Why” has Tyler attempting to seek revenge on his classmates by showing up to a school dance with an automatic weapon.",
        "This is how the season ends. With a panicked Clay (Minnette), rifle pointed at his chest, pleading with Tyler outside the school to reconsider his next move as sirens blare in the background. “I don’t want you to die,” Clay tells him, tears streaming down his face. Tyler appears to be questioning his motives as Clay lowers the gun. “We’ll figure it out, I swear,” he tells Tyler. That’s when Tony (Navarro) pulls up in his car and screams at Tyler to get in, leaving Clay, weapon in hand, alone as the cops approach.",
        "It’s a plot decision that ― like Hannah’s suicide scene from last season ― has caused a divisive rift in the show’s fandom.",
        "“I was aware that there were some warning precautions, but the [assault] scene was very vulgar and unnecessarily uncomfortable ― not for the sexuality part but for how much emotion and intensity it had,” Kendal Wiley, a 19-year-old fan of the show from Burleson, Texas, told HuffPost.",
        "Yorkey himself defended the scene to Vulture:",
        "We’re committed on this show to telling truthful stories about things that young people go through in as unflinching a way as we can ... the fact is that, as intense as that scene is, and as strong as our reactions to it may be, it doesn’t even come close to the pain experienced by the people who actually go through these things.",
        "“We all take this very seriously and I think it’s a big responsibility for each of us, but it’s a privilege, as well,” Navarro emphasized to HuffPost, noting that, as actors on “13 Reasons Why,” the cast is often expected to speak to the series’ controversial subject matter.",
        "“I don’t think any of us imagined we would be on a show with this level of importance,” he said. “The impact that it’s had here in the States and than globally took us for a surprise, so we’re still dealing with that every day.”",
        "The show, Navarro said, was written and produced before the various instances of violence on school properties in 2018. “But [school shootings are] prevalent and our show helps to spark a conversation,” he added, “as it did last year with suicide and bullying and sexual assault. Hopefully the same conversation will be sparked this year with gun violence.”",
        "“That’s our goal with the show,” Minnette said, “to speak to teens, to speak to people any age, really, and just start conversations. Important ones.”",
        "Of course, public debates about gun violence existed before the second season of “13 Reasons Why” premiered. They existed before 2018, too, but ramped up in the wake of the Parkland, Florida, shooting. Moreover, the conversation that the show has started is not limited to school shootings. It entwines a brutal instance of sexual assault with a disturbing brush with gun violence, making it seem as though the former caused the latter.",
        "The character of Tyler faced his fair share of mistreatment throughout the series, from Hannah’s rejection of his apology for photographing her through her bedroom window to Clay’s decision to share a private photo of him with the entire school. Those moments led bullies like Bryce and Monty to incessantly belittle Tyler, mooning and pantsing him in the hallways. By the end of Season 1, we watch as Tyler purchases guns; by the conclusion of Season 2, we see him ready to use them.",
        "To foreshadow his storyline is one thing. To cram Tyler’s tragic rape scene and school-shooter narrative into the last 30 minutes of a finale episode is another. The juxtaposition of these moments is unsettling, prompting viewers to question the motives of the storytellers they’re trusting to convey the lives of fictional teens. There was a sense that Tyler was happy and healthy after his time in treatment, a sensibility quickly muddled by Monty’s unimaginable cruelty, leading Tyler to retaliate against not only his perpetrators but the entire Liberty community. Was this all too much to take in? And was it fair to unravel his breakdown in just a few short minutes?",
        "Yes, “13 Reasons Why” does a fair job of presenting real-life teen issues to a loyal, interested audience. (According to Variety, the drama immediately took over the top spot among all U.S. digital original series following its release last Friday.) But it also fails to take full responsibility for those depictions, instead pointing viewers in the direction of a resource website, discussion guide and after-show with the cast. If more time had been spent on the emotional aftermath of Tyler’s rape, his storyline could have made a greater impact.",
        "Surely Netflix is using these new tools to try and make amends for the backlash that greeted the first season, but leaving their young fan base with even more unanswered questions about the correlation between extreme bullying and gun violence is not necessarily the way to go.",

        "date": "2018-05-23"
    },
    "articleContent": [
        "No matter how much time you spend watching Netflix every week, the streaming service wants you to watch more.",
        "One way the company is doing this is by spending billions on acquiring and creating the best shows and movies out there. That’s great and offers real cultural value.",
        "Another way Netflix does this is by using extremely complex algorithms and subtle marketing features to trick you into watching more... and more... and more. That’s not so great if you value your free time and don’t want to waste your precious hours on this planet watching subpar shows and movies.",
        "You’re almost definitely well aware that Netflix programs episodes to autostart when the previous episode finishes, thus increasing the chance you get locked into an unintentional binge. That’s the kind of obvious product choice that you can spot and avoid if you want to.",
        "Yet there are a few other tricks the company employs that you might not have noticed yet.",
        "Netflix is also very open about these “tricks.” The company documents product rollouts extensively on various company blogs you can read for yourself.",
        "The Streamline mission is to help you make better and more intentional choices of what to stream, rather than waste your time with mediocre content. Hopefully, becoming aware of these subtle tricks will help you.",
        "In any case, read about the tricks below. And if you want to stay informed about the best things that are joining Netflix on a weekly basis (because Streamline does, in fact, love Netflix), make sure to subscribe to the Streamline newsletter.",
        "This is part of Streamline, HuffPost’s weekly recommendation service for streaming shows and movies. Every Saturday, Streamline ranks the best shows to watch online, including a focus on Netflix.",
        "1. The customized images",
        "Back in the early days of the Netflix streaming platform, the service would show you the actual promotional posters for the various shows and movies it offered. Later, Netflix decided those recommendations would be better with custom pictures.",
        "This initial customization decision fixed a couple of problems: Netflix could start using horizontal photos that allow for bigger typeface and design variance. The images could also show character faces more clearly than just hoping the movie posters were good.",
        "There are a lot of bad movie posters out there or at least plenty that don’t look great as small images on a television, laptop or smartphone screen. So this move by Netflix made sense.",
        "In December 2017, Netflix announced that the customization would get fancier, by offering different promotional images to users based on that specific user’s tastes.",
        "As seen in the example photo above provided in Netflix’s announcement, the service will try to make you think a show or movie is just like the other shows and movies you like.",
        "The photo example focuses on variants of comedy fandom. If you’re a fan of classic comedies and there’s a famous comedian in a particular project, Netflix will show you a picture of that person. If you’re more a fan of romantic comedies, then Netflix will show you two characters from the project that might be in love.",
        "For an important Netflix Original rollout like the latest season of “Stranger Things,” Netflix made many different custom images to appeal to different users. You can see a few of them in the image at the very top of this article.",
        "On Feb. 7, Netflix announced that the company now uses an algorithm to comb through shows and movies to find the perfect promotional stills given different marketing requirements.",
        "Basically, this Netflix algorithm will find stills of character close-ups in some sort of emotional moment. And then eventually another Netflix algorithm decides which characters to market to you (such as the famous comedian or the couple from the example before).",
        "Presumably the algorithms will just get more and more powerful until every show and movie on your homepage looks like something you’d want to check out.",
        "2. The special attention to fonts",
        "This is far from a Netflix specific trick. Marketing designers have long used font choices to distinguish products from each other.",
        "But given Netflix’s extremely large catalogue of original shows and movies, it’s worth noting how the company uses font to make everything seem unique.",
        "Back in March, the data visualization website Venngage explored the connection between Netflix’s font choices and user psychology.",
        "The Venngage team essentially pulled a ton of data on Netflix font selections and then showed that Netflix is putting nuanced care into this design element.",
        "Pretty much every Netflix show has its own original font. Even a blockbuster like “Avatar” famously just used the maligned font “Papyrus.”",
        "Although the use of customized fonts might seem like a small thing, Netflix’s special attention here exemplifies that the company is trying to use every advantage it can to get you to click on more content.",
        "The decorative “Glow” font or the handwritten “Love” font or the mystical “Ozark” font might have been the final push you needed to click on those shows.",
        "3. The algorithms used to customize your rows",
        "Those rows of recommendations on your Netflix homepage are way, way, way more customized than you probably thought.",
        "And the company is constantly experimenting with what to recommend to you.",
        "Netflix explained the case for the “rows” concept in 2015. Understanding this technique is a good starting point for comprehending the homepage customization in general.",
        "The Netflix announcement from 2015 described it well, so here’s the relevant paragraph:",
        "By presenting coherent groups of videos in a row, providing a meaningful name for each row, and presenting rows in a useful order, members can quickly decide whether a whole set of videos in a row is likely to contain something that they are interested in watching. This allows members to either dive deeper and look for more videos in the theme or to skip them and look at another row. This would not be the case if, for example, the page contained a large, unorganized collection of relevant videos.",
        "So “rows” are Netflix’s organizing principal. And as you can guess, customization can easily be achieved by showing an “action” fan a row of action movies.",
        "As you’ve probably noticed, Netflix tends to offer genre rows that are far more specific than “action” though. So a user could get a “Cerebral TV Shows” row or “Irreverent Rant Stand-Up Comedy.”",
        "(There’s even secret codes you can use to find these lists, as pointed out by The Daily Dot.)",
        "But the Netflix customization gets far more nuanced than even that.",
        "One such way is a process Netflix explained in 2017 as “interleaving.”",
        "Basically this process allows for a more scalpel-esque approach to gathering data on what you want to watch. Instead of just gathering the data that you’re watching a “Cerebral TV Show,” Netflix is running multiple tests within that given row.",
        "This is definitely confusing, so here’s an attempt at a simplified example:",
        "While you see one row of content on the homepage with one label (such as “Top Picks” for you) the Netflix algorithm has actually hidden various, even more nuanced rows of options in the same row.",
        "Therefore, it seems that multiple subsets of, say, the “Cerebral TV Show” concept are actually in that row you perceive to be just one thing. And then if you consistently choose one particular secret subset, the whole row will shift to giving you more from that particular algorithmic recommendation.",
        "Long story short: The algorithm is very far past a simple “user likes action movies / show more action movies” setup.",
        "4. The “Trending Now” row is personalized too",
        "If you thought you could use this row to choose something that would be a part of the zeitgeist, you’ll likely be disappointed.",
        "Netflix rolled out a “Trending Now” row in 2015. At the time, the company explained that the name isn’t exactly true.",
        "Instead of just presenting the shows and movies that are actually trending the most at any given moment, Netflix is still customizing for you personally.",
        "This is just one more way to get you to keep watching things in your own rabbit hole of personal taste. And the “Trending Now” row only makes you think that you’re connecting to a larger community.",
        "Of course, there still is some truth to the “Trending” moniker.",
        "For example, as holiday-themed shows and movies gain steam around the respective holidays, these titles tend to appear in this row.",
        "The row is basically a snapshot of what you’re most likely to want to watch right now. The answer to that will be different from user to user. But occasionally when megahits like “Stranger Things” debut a new season, the tastes of many users will align.",
        "5. The autoplaying trailers",
        "This is perhaps the most hated feature about Netflix’s homepage.",
        "“Current favorite console game: navigating Netflix without triggering autoplay promos,” director Rian Johnson (“Star Wars: The Last Jedi”) tweeted back in March. That tweet got over 31,000 likes.",
        "But Netflix clearly has some data that autoplaying trailers are causing you to watch more shows and movies, and so this terrible feature persists.",
        "The autoplaying trailers on the homepage debuted back in 2016. These don’t tend to happen on a desktop and were originally designed for Netflix homepages on Roku, video game consoles and smart TVs.",
        "This distinction is important because, on these platforms, the cursor is always selected on some show or movie by default. And then after about a second, the trailer begins on the selected item. On a desktop with a mouse cursor, nothing in particular is ever selected and therefore the autoplaying would be all over the place.",
        "The rollout announcement explained that these videos were just one more way that Netflix could try and convince you to watch something new. (A video in the announcement (embedded above) had the promotional tagline, “So you can browse less... and watch more.”)",
        "The goal is to explicitly trick you to “watch more.” Don’t weigh your options. Don’t get off the couch and do something else. Keep watching Netflix.",
        "Bonus: Obvious, but the incredible marketing for bad movies",
        "I’m including this one as a bonus as it’s more just something I’ve noticed than a “trick” with hard evidence. But the marketing department at Netflix is phenomenal.",
        "And marketing that makes bad things seem like good things is arguably the most impressive trick of all.",
        "Netflix clearly spends considerable resources in the promotional phase to make sure the Netflix Originals all look like they could be amazing.",
        "It’s usually fairly easy to discern from a trailer or poster if a movie or show is going to be trash, but Netflix has a knack for making just about every single trailer and poster compelling.",
        "There have been countless posters for Netflix Originals that have been beautiful works of art and then the actual content has been bad. (See the “Mute” example above as that movie earned a 15% on Rotten Tomatoes.)",
        "You really can’t tell whether something is actually going to be worth your time from any Netflix promotional material. I, for one, keep getting excited about Netflix projects I shouldn’t be caring about at all.",
        "I just hope I can someday figure out how to stop getting tricked by Netflix. Until then, I’ll just keep streaming and hoping I’m getting Netflix’s best."

        "She’s since been linked to “Saturday Night Live” star Pete Davidson, and the two may or may not have matching tattoos."

        "Movies about talking animals are typically innocuous, if not entirely forgettable (except, of course, if your name is Paddington), but “Show Dogs,” which hit theaters on Friday, has sparked criticism from parents and advocacy groups.",
        "The film follows Max, a police dog (voiced by Ludacris) that infiltrates the world of elite dog shows alongside a human FBI agent (Will Arnett) to recover a kidnapped panda.",
        "Some viewers have taken issue with multiple moments in the film when the canine’s genitals are touched in preparation for the final show ― first by Arnett’s character and later by judges, even though he’s clearly uncomfortable.",
        "In these scenes, Max is told to go to a “zen place” while the inspection occurs, which, according to the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, sends “a troubling message that grooms children for sexual abuse.”",
        "The nonprofit group released a statement condemning the messaging of the film, which is rated PG, given the age group of its intended viewers.",
        "“Disturbingly, these are similar tactics child abusers use when grooming children — telling them to pretend they are somewhere else, and that they will get a reward for withstanding their discomfort,” Dawn Hawkins, the group’s executive director, said in a statement. “Children’s movies must be held to a higher standard, and must teach children bodily autonomy, the ability to say ‘no’ and safety, not confusing messages endorsing unwanted genital touching.”",
        "The NCOSE has called on the filmmakers and studio to halt the distribution of the film until it’s recut without the objectionable scenes.",
        "Concerned parents have also taken to social media to share their reactions to the film and warn others about the scenes in question. Some have called on the actors to speak up about the issue.",
        "In response, Global Road Entertainment, the studio behind the film, has defended the scenes as a commonplace practice in these kinds of competitions.",
        "“The dog show judging in this film is depicted completely accurately as done at shows around the world, and was performed by professional and highly respected dog show judges,” it said in a statement to CNN.",
        "“Global Roads Entertainment and the filmmakers are saddened and apologize to any parent who feels the scene sends a message other than a comedic moment in the film, with no hidden or ulterior meaning, but respect their right to react to any piece of content.”",
        "A writer for the film, Max Botkin, however, has since spoken out about the backlash, seemingly siding with concerned parties over the material.",
        "“I absolutely condemn any suggestion or act of non-consensual touching in any form, as well as disassociation as a coping mechanism for abuse of any kind,” he said in a statement. “I understand and empathize with the parents’ and groups’ concerns regarding the message the movie may impart.”",
        "UPDATE: In response to the backlash, Global Roads Entertainment has decided to recut the film without the controversial scenes for a nationwide release this weekend.",

We apologize to anybody who feels the original version of Show Dogs sent an inappropriate message. The revised version of the film will be available for viewing nationwide starting this weekend.”"

        "When The B-52s go on tour, they don’t go their separate ways after each night’s gig. Members of the group actually hang out together after the show, even after all these years.",
        "“We still raise a glass to each other,” singer/keyboardist Kate Pierson told HuffPost.",
        "The longtime act, often considered one of the best “party bands,” will get a chance for plenty more post-show toasts while on the road this summer. The current touring lineup features three of the band’s five founding members: Pierson, Fred Schneider and Cindy Wilson. Fellow founding member Keith Strickland, though still in the group, retired from touring in 2012, and Wilson’s brother, guitarist Ricky Wilson, died from complications related to AIDS in 1985.",
        "Despite those challenges and changes, Pierson is impressed that The B-52s have managed to stay together without ever officially breaking up. Next year will mark 40 years since the release of the band’s debut album, and 43 years since forming in Athens, Georgia.",
        "“Chrissie Hynde [from The Pretenders] once said to us that her band and our band never quit. We never quit and reformed. And she said we ought to get a medal for that,” Pierson said. ’It’s pretty great that we stayed together and we still love each other and we still have fun.”",
        "We caught up with Pierson about life on the road, what made “Love Shack” a hit nearly 30 years ago, and how it feels to turn 70.",
        "What has been the biggest change, touring today versus 30-some-odd years ago?",
        "Before, we’d tour behind whatever record. We’d just go out and do most of that record. ... Now we add a few songs, and our set list has certain songs we have to do. If we didn’t do “Rock Lobster,” there’d be a mini-revolution.",
        "There’s some sort of expectation, I’m sure, from the audience to play certain songs at this point of your career.",
        "Yes, we love doing those songs. Many people say, “I can’t bear to sing that again,” but there’s something about the beat and the fun in the music and the guitar part and the rhythm that propels us. And seeing the audience reaction gives us energy because we could see that they are dancing, and when we play “Rock Lobster” they just go a little bit nuts. No matter where we play it. And if we play in Europe people form a mosh pit on that song. It propels people to let their inner-freak fly. Something about that song gives people a license to let loose and do the craziest dances, and it’s very entertaining to us.",
        "Many groups break up. Was there ever a time when you guys were like, “It’s time, we’re going to throw in the towel”?",
        "Well, definitely after [guitarist] Ricky [Wilson] died in 1985. There was a big question mark. None of us said, “This is it,” but we certainly all thought that this might be it. We could not even dream of starting up and also we were expected, the record company thought we would tour and get another new guitar player and we were like no, that’s not going to happen. We are all in really deep grief. And Ricky is Cindy’s brother. Anyway it couldn’t happen ... We just didn’t have the energy, we were grieving. But then after a few years we realized like wow, we have something great here. ... Being together conjured up, “Ricky’s here,” really in a lot of ways, and a lot of [the 1989 album] “Cosmic Thing” was a tribute to him because there’s a lot of, I don’t want to say nostalgia, but there was a lot of looking back, that kind of thing. “Deadbeat Club” really just came out of a jam. That’s usually how we write ― by jamming, and then it just popped out ― “Deadbeat Club.” That’s something we used to call ourselves when we used to hang out. Didn’t have any money and we would just drink iced tea and get free refills and hang out at some place for three hours. We’d make plans, make big plans.",
        "“Cosmic Thing,” of course, featured the hit song “Love Shack.” What did it take to pull that song together?",
        "I remember when we were writing there was a point where Keith Strickland said, “This can’t go on the album, it’s not ready and it’s not going to make it.” He was right, it wasn’t ready. The chorus part, “The Love Shack is a little old place,” that was only happening once. I was lobbying to have it happen more. [Producer] Don Was said, “Well that’s the chorus. We have to have that.” He really made it come together and then once we put the chorus in, we had it. A lot of our old songs don’t have a typical song structure. They don’t have a verse-chorus, verse-chorus-bridge. With “Love Shack,” once we put that chorus in, it did have more of a song structure. Even though the verses are all kind of different, the chorus was there along with “The Love Shack” ― I think that really made it a hit. Once we heard it in the studio, we played it for R.E.M. and they were like, “Yes this is a hit.” We had something there. That kind of went through an evolution. It wasn’t immediate, like some songs we just pretty much wrote it and that was it. “Love Shack” went through several [iterations] and I’m curious to hear the first evolution of it, which I don’t really know where that is. Probably Keith Strickland has a version of it.",
        "I’m sure you’re really glad that one made it on the album because it still gets played today on radio, which I think that says a lot about the longevity of that song.",
        "Yes, it’s great for a band. We have longevity here. It’s great to have a song that’s a classic, really. It’s lasted and taken its place in front of the iconography of whatever you want to call it, it’s on the list.",
        "It is and the video, I feel like is on the list in pop culture too. With a pre-fame RuPaul in it as well.",
        "We won an MTV Video Award for that.",
        "What do you remember most about that video shoot in upstate New York?",
        "Our friends Phil Mayberry and Scott Walker had this house [in Highland, New York]. We didn’t know them yet, but our other friend Tom Rubin said, “You have to film this video there, it is the Love Shack.” I went to look at it, I was like, “This is a Love Shack.” It has a checkerboard roof and it had goats named Kate and Cindy, and they had a garden, and it just had everything. Inside it was just a riot of color ... We convinced the director, he didn’t want to leave, he wanted to film it in New York City in a soundstage, but once he saw this he was convinced. We dragged everybody up on a bus to the country and I remember really distinctly RuPaul getting this dance line going and just sort of directing in his most wonderful commanding way. He’s RuPaul. He was a total beauty drag and just had everybody do a line dance It really became a party. You could almost forget that it was a video shoot because it really was a party. We were dancing. We were outside, the goats were jumping around.",
        "Personally, for you, you just turned 70. How does it feel?",
        "It’s kind of weird. Before, any number below that ― even 69, it seemed like you’re climbing the top of the mountain. You’re looking down now. I don’t like that feeling [laughs]. ... I certainly don’t feel it. I just had a birthday party. We had a dance party. I found myself just dancing. I wanted a dance party. I was just jumping up and down. I have a lot of energy. I hope to maintain that. It’s definitely a different feeling. Even I have friends that are in their 20s. I keep thinking, “Oh, yeah. They’re my age.” I’ll make some reference, and they’re like, “What?” Age is just a number. Until you hit 70. Then it’s more than a number [laughs].",
        "You released a solo album a couple years ago. Do you think you will do another solo album? Are you working on any music?",
        "Yes, absolutely. I have the second one almost done. ... I’ve continued to write some songs with Chris Braide. I have three or four new songs. I just wrote a song with Aleks Syntek. He’s a really famous Mexican artist since. It’s about the wall. It’s the metaphor about [Donald Trump’s proposed] wall, and it’s political. He sang a part of it in Spanish. I want to release that as a benefit ― going toward the benefit of immigrants. I haven’t chosen what organization yet. ... I want to release the single in October, and get the solo album going as soon as we finish this tour. I have most of it written.",
        "I know with your last solo album, there was a lot of confusion over the song “Mister Sister,” and a lot of the transgender community was upset about it. Is that something that you regret?",
        "Well, it was, actually interestingly enough ― The Huffington Post. I had said that I hoped it would be a trans anthem. At the time, trans was used ― I even had looked it up, trans was used as a general term for anyone who was LGBTQ. Huffington Post, when they quoted me, it said, trans and they put in parentheses “gender,” and I never said that. That’s what really sparked this huge controversy because I never said that I hope it will become a transgender anthem. The song is about ― it was inspired by a friend of mine who was gay. When he was growing up, he used to wear his sister’s clothes and it’s just about that or anyone who feels betrayed by the mirror kind of thing. It’s meant to be empowering. I learned a lot though. I really got schooled. It’s also the height right then of transgender people fighting for recognition. … Anyway, there was a lot of misunderstanding. I think that through it, my wife Monica [Coleman] and I, we had some dialogues with different transgender people. I feel like we became more enlightened. I hope we came to some understanding, but I certainly meant no harm. It was really a misunderstanding. In the end of it, I felt good. It came out to be something that I grew ― in my understanding. …Things get really ugly on the internet. That’s the first time that ever happened to me.",
        "You’ve been married a couple of years now, congratulations. How’s married life treating you?",
        "Fantastic. Actually, our anniversary is Aug. 3. We were together since 2004. We were together a long time before we got married. It was really beautiful, we were married in Hawaii. We keep wanting to go back there. ... Actually, the first time The B-52s played in Hawaii on our very first tour, we played in this little club in Honolulu. We got there. The promoter met us, and put leis around us, and when we left, they had pulled guns on us. We played some little tiny club, and the microphones weren’t grounded. We got, as Cindy would say, the “electric kiss.” I was playing guitar and all of a sudden I was like, “Aaahhhh!” People thought it was part of the song but I was getting a shock. We all got shocked. We had to cut the set short but they continued to sell tickets through the night. So, people were really angry. Cindy and I literally took our wigs off, and we ran. They pulled a gun on the crew and said they were going to keep our equipment. Anyway, we had interesting experiences. … But Hawaii’s always been a place to me that’s magical. So, the wedding was beautiful. I think it really changes things when you’re able to get married. I mean the Marriage Equality Act was super important. I think you cannot believe it happened as fast as it did. For a lot of gay people ― it’s very surprising. You thought that this is going to be a struggle forever. I think that people really accept this. I think younger people accept it. Even when Ricky had AIDS, it was so much negativity, so much ignorance surrounding LGBT, the whole thing. There was a lot of negativity and laws still in place. Just fear. Things have come a long way ― that’s one positive thing in this crazy political world. Hopefully it won’t be rolled back.",
        "The B-52s’ legacy ― what do you want it to be?",
        "I feel like we want to be taken seriously. I know being a band that’s mostly gay and has women in it, I just think that there are the male icon bands, they are always, and they deserve it, but they are always touted as: “These guys are heavy-duty.” I think bands, because we have a sense of humor, we are not always taken as seriously. Not that I want people to be serious, but to be serious about us as a legitimate band. We were one of a kind. I think for that reason also, it’s kind of hard to understand us. We can’t really be put in a category. I hope our legacy will be enduring and that people think of us as an important band. But I think Ricky’s guitar playing, our style of writing, the fact that we had men and women in the band and gay and straight. I think it’s an important band and the way we wrote by jamming, we really had a different approach. And I think we really made a difference in the way, certainly Athens music, went and we were the first kind of band to come out of Athens, of that kind of era.",

        "McGrath’s primary opponent, Lexington Mayor Jim Gray, called McGrath to concede the race just two hours after polls closed, McGrath campaign manager Mark Nickolas told HuffPost. Gray’s campaign manager confirmed the concession call to the Lexington Herald-Leader.",
        "McGrath, who will face incumbent Republican Rep. Andy Barr in November, trailed Gray by as much as 40 points when he entered the race in December, according to her internal polling, but steadily gained ground in the ensuing months with a campaign that sought to paint her as an outsider running against Gray and the national Democratic establishment.",
        "McGrath and Gray hardly differed on the issues. They opposed Barr’s votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which provides health insurance to tens of thousands of the district’s residents, and both supported expanding the law instead. They were largely aligned on other issues, including support for minimum wage increases and opposition to the sweeping Republican tax cut package that Barr supported in 2017.",
        "But McGrath seems to have tapped into the same thirst for new political faces that has pushed newcomers ― especially women ― to victories in Democratic primaries across the country this year.",
        "Though she targeted rural voters outside Lexington, she also campaigned broadly as a progressive. She favors adding a public option to Obamacare, lowering the age of eligibility for Medicare and increasing federal funding for infrastructure and job programs in central Kentucky. She is in favor of abortion rights, is pro–LGBTQ equality and is vocally opposed to President Donald Trump’s efforts to ban transgender troops from the military and bar refugees from majority-Muslim nations from entering the country.",
        "Now she’ll face Barr, who first won the seat in 2012 and has cruised to re-election twice. Trump won the district by 15 points in 2016, but there have been positive signs for Democrats locally: Gray won a majority of the district’s votes in his unsuccessful 2016 bid to unseat Sen. Rand Paul (R), and this year Democrats flipped one state legislative seat in a special election in a Trump-supporting district. The DCCC added the 6th Congressional District to its list of targets in 2018 as it tries to flip at least 24 seats for Democrats to regain the House majority.",
        "McGrath plans to continue her against-the-grain pitch to voters in the general election, Nickolas told HuffPost before the primary vote.",

        "Slightly more than half of the public now calls gun violence a very serious problem, down from 60 percent in February. A 56-percent majority say it’s possible to pass new gun laws without violating the Second Amendment, down from a high of 65 percent. And, regardless of how they personally feel about the subject, just 40 percent now think passing new gun laws is politically possible, down from 50 percent.",
        "Concern about gun violence and a desire for Congress to take action are now several percentage points higher than they were in April, when most of the post-Parkland wave had already abated, but it’s difficult to say how much of that represents a genuine uptick, rather than the variability inherent in tracking polls. Either way, it’s clear that the energy around crafting new gun policies isn’t near the heights reached earlier this year.",
        "Similarly, tracking data from the progressive pollster Civiqs showed voters’ support for gun control spiking after Parkland, but then slowly declining. Santa Fe, it found, at most seemed to modestly stanch that decline.",
        "Google Trends, which tracks how often people query the search engine on varying topics, shows that comparatively little attention has been paid to gun issues following the lastest school shooting.",
        "The difference in public opinion following the two school shootings isn’t entirely surprising: It mirrors the difference in how each community responded. Although Americans were shocked by the Parkland massacre, the shift in public opinion it produced didn’t gain steam until the weeks that followed, when the surviving students spearheaded a gun control push. Their advocacy kept the debate over gun laws in the news, even after the immediate details of the shooting had faded.",
        "Although student activists nationwide led walkouts earlier this year in protest of gun violence, polling of teens finds that such attitudes aren’t universal among their generation. In largely rural Santa Fe, last week’s shooting didn’t spark the same kind of push for gun control. There were no local protests, and little talk of guns,the Los Angeles Times reported.",
        "“I don’t think guns are the problem — I think people are the problem,” a 16-year-old Santa Fe high school student told NBC. “Even if we did more gun laws, people who are sick enough to do something like this are still going to figure out a way to do it. So it doesn’t matter.”",
        "Gun restrictions proposed in the wake of the Parkland shooting, meanwhile, remain broadly popular, according to the HuffPost/YouGov poll.

    "articleContent": [
        "The American Civil Liberties Union is suing Ohio to strike down the state’s congressional map, saying it was intentionally drawn to so egregiously benefit Republicans that it violates the Constitution.",
        "Since 2012, Republicans have consistently won the same 12 of Ohio’s 16 congressional seats, while winning between 51 and 59 percent of the state’s popular vote. The suit alleges that Republicans maintain this remarkable advantage because they controlled the redistricting process in 2011 and worked in secret to draw a map to guarantee just that outcome each year.",
        "The suit was filed Wednesday in federal court on behalf of 16 voters in each of the state’s congressional districts, the Ohio chapter of the League of Women Voters and the A. Philip Randolph Institute, a labor and civil rights group.",
        "The lawsuit underscores a growing confidence among voting rights groups over the last few years in bringing challenges to congressional plans that Republicans have benefited from since 2012. The Supreme Court has never said whether an electoral map can be so partisan that it violates the Constitution, but it is expected to rule in two cases that make that argument in June. A ruling setting constitutional limits on partisan gerrymandering could profoundly affect American politics by requiring lawmakers to draw districts that are more competitive.",
        "Two more congressional elections are due to take place under Ohio’s current map before the next round of redistricting in 2021. Even though litigation can move very slowly, the ACLU hopes to have a new map in place for the 2020 congressional elections.",
        "Alora Thomas, an attorney with the ACLU, said her organization felt encouraged to bring the suit after multiple rulings in lower courts blocking electoral maps in Wisconsin and North Carolina on partisan grounds. (Those rulings are currently paused while the Supreme Court considers appeals.) In January, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court struck down the state’s congressional maps as too partisan for the state Constitution. A challenge to Michigan’s congressional map on partisan grounds is also before a federal court.",
        "“Because courts are really now open to taking a look at this issue, and it looks like they’re going the right way and finding partisan gerrymandering unconstitutional, the question becomes, ‘Well, where else is there a problem and is it something that needs to be addressed now?’” Thomas told HuffPost. “Ohio is one of the most gerrymandered states in the country.”",
        "An analysis by the Brennan Center for Justice found that Ohio’s congressional map has some of the most severe partisan bias in the country and accounts for between two and three additional GOP seats in the current Congress.",
        "Thomas said the ACLU didn’t want to wait until Ohio got a new congressional map in 2022, because Ohio residents have already spent nearly a decade voting under a map the group believes is unconstitutional. A fairer map in place before the next round of redistricting, Thomas said, could ensure that the map for the subsequent decade is also fairer. Ohio voters also recently approved a ballot initiative to change the way redistricting is done in the state, a move that advocates hope will rein in excessive partisan gerrymandering.",
        "The suit argues that the Ohio map violates the First and 14th Amendments, as well as Article I of the Constitution. The map violates the First Amendment, the suit says, because it amounts to an effort to “skew electoral outcomes to freeze their advantage and insulate their majority from changes in voter preferences.” It violates the 14th Amendment, the ACLU says, because lawmakers drew the map intentionally to disfavor Democratic voters in the state without a legitimate reason to do so. The ACLU also argues that in drawing such a severely gerrymandered map, Ohio lawmakers exceeded the power the Constitution gives them to regulate elections.",
        "The case will hinge significantly on what the Supreme Court decides by the end of June. During oral argument in two partisan gerrymandering cases this year, the court seemed willing to allow some amount of politics in redistricting, but appeared closely divided on whether it was possible to determine if partisan gerrymandering could go so far that it violates the Constitution. Justice Anthony Kennedy, who wrote in a 2004 case that such a standard might exist, is seen as the critical swing vote in the case, and advocates have offered a number of standards with the hope that he might find one he likes.",
        "Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R), who signed the state’s congressional map into law in 2011, is named as a defendant in the suit. But Kasich has recently been an outspoken opponent of partisan gerrymandering, and was one of a number of Republican elected officials who urged the Supreme Court in October to step in and do something about gerrymandering.",
        "In a brief filed with the Supreme Court, Kasich and other Republican officials took a position similar to what the ACLU is arguing in the Ohio case, saying that partisan gerrymanders are “repugnant to the Constitution” and violate the First and 14th Amendments.",
        "UPDATE: 2:50 p.m. ― Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted (R), one of the state officials named as a defendant in the suit, criticized the challenge.",
        "“If the way the congressional lines were drawn was such an issue for the ACLU, A. Philip Randolph Institute and League of Women Voters, why did they wait six years to file a lawsuit challenging the maps?” Husted said Wednesday in a statement. “These groups should respect the will of Ohio’s voters who overwhelmingly approved a constitutional amendment earlier this month that established a new, bipartisan process for drawing congressional districts starting in 2021.”"

        "WASHINGTON ― House Republicans say they’re making progress on a plan to do the long-impossible: unite a fractured GOP conference on the issue of immigration.",
        "With GOP moderates still pushing for a slate of votes on immigration, House Republicans generally are feeling the pressure to come up with a plan to finally address the precarious state of the Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals program.",
        "A small group of GOP moderates, conservatives and leaders emerged from a meeting Wednesday afternoon saying they were getting closer to an immigration bill that might be able to pass the House with almost exclusively Republican support.",
        "Rep. Jeff Denham (R-Calif.), one of those leading the effort to force a series of immigration votes through a discharge petition, told reporters he was hopeful that Republicans could come up with the outlines of an immigration deal to address DACA as soon as Thursday.",
        "“We’re getting pretty close,” he said.",
        "Other Republicans also sounded optimistic about the prospects of a deal. House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) said members have been having some “really good talks.” Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), the chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said there was “more than a reasonable chance” that Republicans would strike a deal by Thursday. And Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.), another moderate immigration advocate, said the roughly hour-and-a-half meeting in the Capitol was “not a waste of time.”",
        "But as bullish as Republicans were on Wednesday, there were still some key sticking points that could ultimately prevent an immigration agreement.",
        "For one, moderates and conservatives don’t have a shared concept of a “permanent solution” for undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children. Denham noted Wednesday that his preferred idea is to allow them to file for legal status for five-year periods, with the ultimate goal being legal permanent residence in 10 years, and Curbelo said a permanent solution for these types of childhood arrivals was “essential” to any deal.",
        "Meadows, however, said it was important that any deal has “no special pathway to citizenship,” although he did say he was open to allowing undocumented immigrants to “work toward citizenship.”",
        "These differences over the endpoint, which may seem like minor distinctions, are actually major policy disagreements that lawmakers have yet to sort out. And there are some Republicans who just don’t see a way to split the difference.",
        "Immigration hardliner Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) told HuffPost on Wednesday that he saw himself as “diametrically opposed” to Denham on immigration and that he felt there were many members who would vote the interests of their individual districts rather than just accepting a deal.",
        "Moderates believe that one solution could be to offer multiple votes on multiple bills during an immigration vote-a-rama. But conservatives see that proposal as hardly any different from what moderates want anyway, and Meadows was emphatic Wednesday that, if there were a deal, it had to consist of one bill.",
        "Another problem standing in the way of GOP consensus is that moderates and conservatives both believe they have the upper hand. Moderates note that they are getting dangerously close to having enough Republicans and Democrats signed on to a discharge petition to force a vote on a slate of different immigration proposals. That means they could pass a bill through the House with the help of roughly a few dozen Republicans and every Democrat.",
        "Meanwhile, conservatives believe any immigration deal that Republicans strike among themselves would skew more toward the conservatives’ ideology, considering the small number of moderates in the 235-person Republican House majority. They also note that any immigration deal would have to win Senate approval and secure President Donald Trump’s signature to become law.",
        "On that point, lawmakers are left to mostly guess where Trump would do.",
        "The Senate tried and failed to pass immigration legislation of its own earlier this year, sunk in part by hardline demands from the White House. Trump rejected bipartisan proposals to increase border security measures and grant legal status to Dreamers, and his administration lobbied senators to oppose those proposals in favor of a bill that included measures to restrict legal immigration and end protections for immigrants at the border.",
        "The Trump-backed bill ultimately received only 39 votes ― less than the bipartisan alternatives that received a vote. But the president has shown no indication that he’s willing to budge from his demands for a sweeping immigration bill. In the months since, he has only doubled down on calls to toughen policy against asylum-seekers and children at the border ― two items Democrats adamantly oppose.",
        "Still, Trump’s past vow to support any immigration bill that Congress sends him rings in the ears of moderates, and many of them believe the president is personally more open than his staff to a solution with a pathway to citizenship, particularly if it also includes money for a border wall.",
        "Lawmakers have been grasping for an immigration bill since last year, when Trump rescinded the DACA policy that allowed nearly 700,000 young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children, often called Dreamers, to stay and work. DACA recipients are currently able to renew their protections because of court injunctions, which helped quiet some of the calls for action from Congress. But GOP moderates from districts with large immigrant populations see a pressing need to resolve the issue.",
        "While those moderates believe they have the votes (with Democrats) to get a bill through the House utilizing a discharge petition, they are also open to a negotiation with their fellow conservative Republicans and GOP leaders in the hopes that it could result in a bill becoming a law.",
        "“We want an opportunity to pass a bill that can be signed by the president,” Curbelo said Wednesday.",
        "And even though it seems like moderates and conservatives are on mainly opposite sides of the issue, both factions at least want to exhaust all options within the Republican conference before they truly square off ― either to strengthen their case that there is no solution or to actually, somewhat miraculously, come to an agreement.",
        "As Meadows tried to explain the reasons for his optimism that an immigration deal could come together shortly, he said that even though Republicans have been arguing over this issue for decades, he thought that now they could finally write something that would win over almost everyone in the conference.",
        "“I’m used to accomplishing the impossible,” he said."

        "PREVIOUSLY:",
        "WASHINGTON ― Top Democrats on Wednesday urged the Justice Department to scrap a classified briefing with top House Republicans regarding sensitive documents that the GOP lawmakers had requested about the Russia investigation, but said if the meeting was to go forward on Thursday, it ought to include lawmakers of both parties.",
        "Justice Department officials invited Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), chairman of the House intelligence committee, and committee member Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) to review information about an FBI informant who reportedly attempted to make contact with Donald Trump’s campaign advisers prior to the 2016 election. The FBI had received evidence that the advisers had suspicious contacts linked to Russia.",
        "Last week President Trump accused the FBI of “spying” on his campaign for “political purposes” and demanded the Justice Department probe that investigation and alleged surveillance. On Wednesday, he dubbed the FBI probe “SPYGATE,” tweeting that it “could be one of the biggest political scandals in history!” These allegations are only the latest attempts from the president and his allies to discredit what is now special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election.",
        "In a Wednesday letter, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) blasted the planned meeting between Justice Department officials and GOP lawmakers as “completely improper” and warned that it “would set a damaging precedent for your institutions and the rule of law.”",
        "In the letter addressed to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and FBI Director Christopher Wray, the Democratic leaders argued that the meeting could create an opportunity for Trump and his allies on Capitol Hill to “prematurely access investigatory information and selectively leak national security secrets” in order to distort the facts about the Russia investigation, which has already yielded nearly two dozen indictments.",
        "“However,” they wrote, “if you have determined in your best judgment that Justice Department participation in the meeting is the only way to prevent this situation from devolving into an outright constitutional crisis, then we believe you must insist on the only appropriate mechanism for highly sensitive briefings that might implicate intelligence sources and methods ― a bipartisan Gang of Eight briefing that involves congressional leadership from both chambers.”",
        "The “Gang of Eight” consists of Schumer; Pelosi; Nunes; Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.); House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.); Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), chairman of the Senate intelligence committee; Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), ranking member of the Senate intelligence committee; and Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), ranking member of the House intelligence committee.",
        "Schiff on Wednesday called the Democrats’ exclusion from the classified briefing “a serious abuse of power.” Warner told a CNN reporter that he hoped the Justice Department “would not in any way be forced to reveal confidential information that would go against 75 years of practice.”",
        "Several Republicans are also requesting to be included in the Justice Department meeting, including Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas), Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). and Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.",
        "Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), a frequent Trump critic who is not seeking re-election this year, tweeted that excluding Democrats from the classified briefing “is not right.”"

        "Forrest works for Mighty AI, a crowd-working company that uses people to teach robotic systems how to drive. She is, effectively, the self in the self-driving car. She does this by interpreting pictures and videos, painstakingly outlining and labeling vehicles, people, cyclists, road signs and trees with her computer mouse, or on a smartphone with her finger.",
        "“I started with some hesitation. Because, really, it’s like 1 cent for that?” she says. “But I thought, when I’m taking a break from work and want to let my mind relax for a bit, I can do that. We’ll just see where this goes.”",
        "A year later, Forrest had earned a total of $307. “There are days when I’m like, hmm, I wonder how much money they’re making off of us,” she says. “And then there are days when I’m getting a little enjoyment out of it and some pocket money, no big deal.”",
        "Forrest is part of a new digital workforce eking out a living, or making extra cash working with and for AI. There are millions of people already busy on crowd-working platforms like Mighty AI, Amazon Mechanical Turk or Figure Eight, and many millions more whose jobs are now shaped by automation and AI. While the threat of robots stealing our jobs looms large, a much more immediate concern is that automation and AI are already massively changing the way we work. And not always for the better.",
        "A study commissioned by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development group of developed countries found that about half of all jobs are likely to be significantly affected by automation in terms of the tasks involved. But for every worker who loses a job to automation, two face changes in the way they work, according to the research.",

Think the Industrial Revolution decimating cottage industries but enabling factory work, or the internal combustion engine disrupting animal-based transportation, even as driving jobs emerged.",

Industry leader Waymo, a subsidiary of Google’s Alphabet, has been valued at $40 billion to $140 billion – more than the Ford Motor Co. But Ford employs over 200,000 workers, many in decent-paying, unionized blue-collar roles. Waymo has fewer than 1,000 full-time staffers.",
        "Self-driving car companies have plenty of highly paid AI and robotics experts, of course. But much of the data they rely on is coming from people around the world sitting at their computers, or from drivers in computerized cars criss-crossing cities, with little job security.",
        "Similarly, content platforms like Facebook and Instagram have AI systems that automatically scour uploads for hate speech or sexual imagery, but someone has to train those systems and adjudicate edge cases. Some of these people are individual crowd-workers. Others work for moderation companies that outsource the work to people in India and elsewhere.",
        "Because of the scale of the data that people are working with ― millions of roads and billions of social media posts ― many workers in the new digital economy have roles that put them at the mercy of an algorithmic regime, rather than a human boss, and they often have few rights of recourse should anything go wrong.",
        "“The workforce on Mechanical Turk is always turning over,” explains Michael Bernstein, an assistant professor in the Human-Computer Interaction Group at Stanford University. “There are always new people. Even if one subset of workers says we don’t like this employer, we’re going to stop working for them, everyone else will still work for them. The American workers don’t think it’s good, but the workers in India, they don’t mind.”",
        "Bernstein tried to set up a crowd-working guild called Dynamo in 2014 to enable collective action, but it was quashed by Amazon.",
        "There are similar issues in another growing area of work where AIs manage and oversee complex distributed systems ― ride-hailing. Every Uber driver depends on the company’s algorithms to present them with trips they might want. Drivers who turn down or cancel too many rides can be locked out of the app or have their account deactivated. Efforts by Uber and Lyft drivers in Seattle to unionize are facing legal challenges from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce (which includes Uber and Lyft). The group says allowing drivers to bargain over pay would violate federal antitrust rules.",
        "“Antitrust laws were put in place to protect the little guy from monopolistic practices from large corporations, not to shield a company like Uber – valued at over $70 billion – from negotiating with its workers over fair pay and working conditions,” says Don Creery, an Uber and Lyft driver.",
        "A common feature of gig work in the digital economy is that workers never have direct contact with human colleagues or managers. Instead, their priority is satisfying algorithms. “One frustrating piece is how the tasks get served up,” says Forrest, “It will show a task is available, you’ll click on it and it’ll say no more tasks available. There are just so many people on their site clicking at the same time.”",
        "Forrest is valued for her perception and dexterity, but machines must be able to easily work with what she produces. The digital systems of crowd-working leave little room for human creativity or ambiguity. As robots increasingly embody those digital systems, that way of working extends into the physical world. In January, Amazon was granted patents for wristbands that can pinpoint the location of human employees within the company’s vast warehouses, and buzzes if a worker is about to select an incorrect item for packing.",
        "But our automated future does not look like digital piecework for everyone. For some workers, having robots deal with mundane tasks could free them to focus on more challenging or enjoyable duties.",
        "Leo Tsurankou also works with highly automated cars ― but at the other end of the algorithmic pipeline. His job is to step in and take over when the software trained by workers like Forrest fails.",
        "However, Tsurankou is not sitting in the car itself, but in a comfy office chair in the offices of Phantom Auto, a Silicon Valley startup. Phantom has developed a remote control system that works over mobile networks, allowing drivers at its headquarters to operate a vehicle hundreds of miles away, using monitors, a simulated steering wheel, and a game controller.",
        "Tsurankou, who used to be a test driver for Uber’s self-driving vehicles, enjoys his job. “I prefer the comfort of an office, where I get more social interaction and can ask someone to step in if I need a break.”",
        "Although Tsurankou can only directly control one vehicle at a time, Phantom predicts a single human operator could one day oversee five or more automated vehicles, only taking over when they encounter tricky situations. Each remote operator like Tsurankou could mean four of today’s drivers losing their jobs.",
        "In fact, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development report predicts that robotics and artificial intelligence will put more low-skilled jobs at risk than previous waves of technological progress. With a few exceptions, such as care workers, the jobs most at risk from automation are those requiring the lowest levels of skill and education.",
        "In the near future, it seems that the very people who are least equipped to work with and for algorithms and robots are those who will be expected to do so first. Uber’s biggest impact on society could turn out to be not its sharing or gig economy, but the normalization of bosses sitting in a server farm rather than a corner office, and the eradication of anything approaching a career path.",

        "She said in a November briefing that diversity visa immigrants are not vetted (false). She said in an October briefing that Chicago, which has high rates of gun-related crimes, has the toughest gun laws in the country (pants on fire!). She claimed in July that President Donald Trump has “in no way, form or fashion has ever promoted or encouraged violence” (false), despite videos showing otherwise. In March 2017 she said “multiple news outlets” reported that when he was president, Barack Obama ordered wiretapping of Trump (false).",
        "Some of the things Sanders has said are laughably untrue.",
        "She insisted this month that the Trump administration is “committed to a free press” ― right after Trump hinted at stripping reporters of their credentials and claimed, once again, that mainstream news outlets critical of his presidency are “fake news.”",
        "In May 2017, she claimed there was not “ever an attempt” to blame Trump’s firing of FBI Director James Comey on Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, despite a statement that week from then–press secretary Sean Spicer putting the blame squarely on Rosenstein.",
        "In her defense, Sanders’ job sounds bananas. She has to provide accurate information given to her by a president who lies all the time. And in this White House, the level of chaos and turnover has been so high, it’s not hard to imagine that something that may be true in the morning is no longer true by that evening.",
        "“There’s a difference between misspeaking or not knowing something than maliciously lying,” Sanders said in the Times piece.",
        "But part of her dishonesty is in her unwillingness to acknowledge when the president has said something that just isn’t true.",
        "When a reporter asked Sanders in October why Trump kept falsely saying that the U.S. is the highest-taxed nation in the world, she gave a hilariously nonsensical answer. In July, when Trump randomly criticized Rosenstein for being from Baltimore, even though he is from Philadelphia, Sanders couldn’t even admit that was wrong. She said Trump was making a “general statement.”",
        "Reporters confronted Sanders earlier this month about why she falsely told them that Trump did not reimburse his lawyer, Michael Cohen, for $130,000 in hush money to adult-film star Stormy Daniels just before the November 2016 election.",
        "“You said, on March 7, ‘There was no knowledge of any payments from the president, and he’s denied all of these allegations,’” CNN’s Jim Acosta said during the May 3 press briefing. “Were you lying to us at the time, or were you in the dark?”",
        "Sanders said only that Trump still denies the allegations by Daniels.",
        "“I gave you the best information that I had, and I’m going to continue to do my best to do that every single day,” she said.",
        "As Sanders does her best to be truthful, there’s one group she has no problem calling out as liars: all 16 women who say Trump sexually assaulted them."

    "articleContent": [
        "WASHINGTON ― A mostly non-Christian militia linked to a brutal Iranian-backed paramilitary group secured two of the five seats in Iraq’s parliament reserved for Christians, according to official election results announced Saturday.",
        "The militia, known as the Babylon Brigade, doesn’t represent Christians at all, local leaders and international advocates for Iraqi Christians warn. They say the militia’s candidates, though Christian, won only because of help from Shiite Muslims. And Iraqi Christians are calling on President Donald Trump to live up to his statements of concern for Middle East Christians by pressuring Iraqi authorities to invalidate the results. But so far, the Trump administration has said nothing on the issue.",
        "Rayan al-Kildani, a Christian associated with various militias, founded the Babylon Brigade in 2014 when ISIS swept through Iraq and began hunting down religious minorities. Al-Kildani brought together 1,000 fighters and soon became the most prominent Christian in the popular mobilization, an umbrella group of Iraqi militias that fought ISIS with U.S. help. Along the way, he forged close ties with the Badr Organization, a historically brutal armed group that receives support from the Shiite leadership of Iran.",
        "Most of Al-Kildani’s fighters aren’t Christians, national security experts say, but members of the non-Christian Shabak ethnic minority or Iraq’s Shiite Muslim majority. Al-Kildani’s chief value to the mostly Shiite leaders of the popular mobilization forces was in propaganda. “He’s used like a quisling character to put a Christian face onto these militias,” said Michael Knights, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute, a think tank focused on Middle East policy.",
        "Al-Kildani has “nothing to do with the morality of Christ ... [and] does not represent Christians in any way,” the church of Louis Sako, a top Iraqi priest who’s now a cardinal-designate, said in a statement last year.",
        "Al-Kildani didn’t win the parliamentary seats because of support from the Christian community but because of his ties to groups like Badr, his opponents fear. His candidates received thousands of votes from heavily Shiite cities that have no known Christian communities, said Asaad Kalasho, the U.S. representative for the Christian town of Tel Keppe.",
        "“He did get votes from Christians … [but] there’s no way that he won based solely on those Christian votes,” said Yousif Kalian, a program assistant at the United States Institute for Peace who has written on Al-Kildani’s militia. “Many [Christians] feel he doesn’t represent their interests largely because of connections to Badr and to Iran.”",
        "One Christian party whose representatives had a post-election meeting at the State Department is formally challenging the seat allocation. And Sako said the results show Christians need to “learn a lesson” about securing political power.",
        "Activists believe that rather than advocate for the Christian minority, the Babylon Brigade’s representatives in parliament will be most concerned with tipping the scales in favor of the Badr Organization, which secured the second-largest seat total in parliament. Kalasho said he sees the situation as evidence that the entire election was flawed — echoing complaints of irregularities elsewhere that the U.S. has said should be investigated.",
        "Strong representation, the advocates argue, is crucial to help Iraq’s already struggling Christian community survive. Before the U.S. invasion unleashed waves of violence, Iraq had nearly 1.5 million Christians among its population of 38 million. Now only about 200,000 are left in the country, most of them in northern villages, the Kurdish region in the northeast and the capital, Baghdad.",
        "“We’ve been marginalized by both Kurds and the central Iraqi government over the years. Now it’s Iran,” said Steve Oshana, the executive director of the nonprofit group A Demand for Action, throwing in a reference to Trump’s favorite geopolitical bogeyman. “Our land has been stolen, our rights diminished, and if we lose legitimate representation in parliament, there’s no coming back for us ... We’ve been bamboozled, and it will take leadership from the administration to make sure it doesn’t lead to our complete marginalization in our ancestral homeland.”",
        "Activists said a strong response by the U.S. government is the only way to ensure that Christians still have their interests represented and prove that Washington will not tolerate attempts to suppress them. The White House and State Department met with Iraqi Christians worried about al-Kildani at least twice last year, Oshana said.",
        "Many in the Trump administration, particularly evangelical Christian darling Vice President Mike Pence, have said they want to help Iraq’s Christians.",
        "“Across the wider Middle East, we can now see a future in many areas without a Christian faith. But tonight, I came to tell you, help is on the way,” Pence proclaimed in October.",
        "But the president has repeatedly told aides he wants to wash his hands of the Middle East and avoid pulling the U.S. into its communities’ disputes.",
        "Asked to comment for this story, the White House, Pence and the State Department’s office for international religious freedom were all silent."

But in comments to the Honolulu Civil Beat, HSTA President Corey Rosenlee admitted when it came to the association’s core issue, its members didn’t really have a problem with Gabbard.",

        "Gabbard has attracted significant criticism for her positions on Syria, particularly on Assad. In January, she met with Assad without informing leaders in her party, and she dismissed his opposition ― including rebels backed by the United States ― as “terrorists.” She said she sat down with Assad in an attempt to end the civil war in Syria.",
        "More recently, she was one of the few public officials who refused to immediately blame the Syrian government for the horrific chemical attack that killed dozens of people, including children, in April. She said “whoever is found responsible” must be held accountable and talked about “if” Assad is indeed guilty.",
        "In its email to its members, HSTA lambasted Gabbard’s comments on Syria:",
        "She was one of just three representatives, and the only Democrat who refused to condemn Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad’s genocidal chemical attack on his own people. After the attack, Gabbard traveled to Syria to meet with the genocidal dictator al-Assad without permission from the White House or Congress. Her trip was funded by a group with ties to al-Assad supporters and she only covered the expenses herself after the news media reported who paid for her trip.\n\nThen, after al-Assad bombed his people again, Gabbard continued to refuse to admit the attack had occurred. At the same time, she voted to practically ban Syrian refugees from coming into the United States after the Paris terrorist attacks, even though Syrian refugees were not involved in the attacks.",
        "Gabbard’s office did not immediately return a request for comment from HuffPost, but her campaign told KITV in Hawaii that improving education remains one of her top priorities.",
        "“She is grateful for the support of so many teachers across our state, as they know that Tulsi will always have their back,” the campaign said. “She appreciates the hard work and sacrifices that all of our teachers make for our kids and Hawaii’s future every single day. While it’s unfortunate the leadership of HSTA is playing politics, Tulsi’s commitment to our teachers, keiki [children], and public education remains unchanged.”",
        "Gabbard has attracted a national following, in part because of her high-profile support for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary. She resigned as a vice chair of the Democratic National Committee to endorse Sanders. (DNC board members were supposed to remain neutral.)",
        "The national following is also reflected in her donations. According to the Civil Beat, more than 80 percent of her donations this cycle have come from outside of the state ― far more than other members of Congress from Hawaii.",

        "“The callousness that our country has for life is very disturbing,” Rogers said, according to audio captured by a tracker for Democratic opposition research firm American Bridge. “I have visited Auschwitz twice — maybe three times; three times. I have visited the killing fields in Cambodia. This is what happens to a country when the callousness for life erodes to that depth.”",

        "Rogers is one of four GOP candidates vying to challenge incumbent Rep. Tom O’Halleran (D-Ariz.) in November. This is her fourth run for Congress, falling short in the primary each time. The National Republican Campaign Committee this year added her to their ‘Young Guns’ program.",

    "articleContent": [
        "Lizzie Pannill Fletcher, a corporate attorney, won the Democratic nomination for Texas’ 7th Congressional District on Tuesday, reassuring national Democrats eager to flip the GOP-held seat.",
        "Fletcher’s win in a runoff reflects the preference of primary voters for a mainstream Democrat capable of appealing to enough of the affluent, suburban Houston district’s Republican voters.",
        "It also delivers a victory for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the official body charged with electing the party’s candidates to the House. The DCCC backed away from an active role in the campaign after provoking outrage among some progressives with a February opposition research memo against Fletcher’s more liberal opponent, Laura Moser.",
        "Fletcher finished first in a seven-candidate March primary, but the controversy over the DCCC helped propel Moser to a close second-place finish, setting up the runoff race.",
        "With Fletcher’s nomination, “Texas Democratic primary voters chose their heads over their hearts,” said Mark Jones, a Rice University political scientist who lives in the district. “Rather than opting for the aggressive progressive Laura Moser, they opted for the nearly equally liberal Lizzie Fletcher.”",
        "In November’s general election, Fletcher faces Rep. John Culberson, a nine-term Republican.",
        "Although Culberson has often easily won re-election, this year Democrats came out of the woodwork to challenge the deeply conservative congressman. Texas’ 7th is one of just three GOP-held districts in the state where voters narrowly opted for Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump in he 2016 presidential vote, making it a prime Democratic pickup opportunity in the midterm elections. The district went for Clinton 49 percent to 47 percent, a sharp swing from 2012 when it went for Mitt Romney over Barack Obama by 21 percentage points.",
        "The devastating effect of Hurricane Harvey last year has also made Culberson more vulnerable than normal. He promoted the expansion of an interstate highway that some of his constituents believe left their neighborhoods more vulnerable to flooding.",
        "For the most part, however, the district’s sizable majority of so-called country-club Republicans remains loyal to the GOP. Any Democrat hoping to unseat Culberson will need to convert at least some voters who traditionally support Republicans down the line, but might appreciate a member of Congress willing to hold Trump more accountable.",
        "Fletcher, who supports abortion rights and shoring up the Affordable Care Act, is more moderate than Moser, a proponent of Medicare-for-all and founder of the anti-Trump “Resistance” text-message app, Daily Action.",
        "Perhaps more important than policy distinctions, the two candidates differed in their styles.",
        "“Without question, Fletcher’s rhetoric and style were much more consensual and less anti-Republican and anti-Trump,” Jones said.",
        "While Fletcher had the endorsement of the establishment-linked group EMILY’s List, Moser drew support from less well-heeled progressive grassroots groups like Democracy for America and Our Revolution, the successor group to Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-Vt.) presidential campaign.",
        "Fletcher’s win is also a major setback for organized labor, which bitterly opposed her bid. She was anathema to regional labor unions because she is a partner at AZA Law, a firm that represented a Houston janitorial services company in a dispute with the Service Employees International Union, which was seeking to unionize the company’s workers.",
        "AZA successfully won a $5.3 million lawsuit against the state’s SEIU chapter, forcing it to declare bankruptcy.",
        "AZA Law also boasts on its website of successfully defending a Houston-based oil equipment supplier against a discrimination lawsuit filed by eight current and former African American employees.",
        "Fletcher did not work on either of the cases but as a partner, she profited from them indirectly."

        "date": "2018-05-23"
    },
    "articleContent": [
        "WASHINGTON ― After months of delays by Republicans, senators unveiled bipartisan legislation Wednesday that cracks down on sexual harassment in their ranks.",
        "The bill, hashed out by Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), makes badly needed updates to the Congressional Accountability Act, a decades-old law that set up the process for handling workplace complaints about harassment and discrimination on Capitol Hill. It eliminates rules forcing victims of sexual harassment to undergo counseling, mandatory arbitration and a 30-day “cooling off” period before taking a complaint to court.",
        "Here’s a section-by-section overview of their bill.",
        "The most contentious provision in the bill is its requirement that lawmakers pay out of pocket for sexual harassment and discrimination settlements.",
        "That language was part of similar legislation that easily passed the House in early February. But when the House bill arrived in the Senate, some anonymous male GOP senators opposed that provision and stopped the bill in its tracks.",
        "In the months that followed, senators who had been demanding action grew agitated. All 22 female senators from both parties ripped Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) for not making the bill a priority. Every male Democratic senator ― plus Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who co-sponsored a sexual harassment bill with Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) ― wrote to McConnell urging him to do something.",
        "The Senate’s delays looked particularly bad as the Me Too movement hit Capitol Hill last fall and triggered a series of sudden retirements by lawmakers accused of sexual misconduct. One of them, former Rep. Blake Farenthold (R-Texas), quit without repaying $84,000 in taxpayer money he spent on a sexual harassment settlement.",
        "But Wednesday’s breakthrough means the bill has a good chance of moving ― and moving quickly. Blunt and Klobuchar have support from their party leaders, and they presented their proposal to their respective caucuses on Tuesday afternoon. Barring any last-minute objections, Blunt suggested the Senate could vote on the bill by the end of the week.",
        "“With this agreement, both parties are coming together to update the laws governing how the Congress addresses workplace claims and protecting staff and others from harassment,” McConnell and Schumer said in a joint statement. “We’re optimistic that after our members review the legislation, this bill will pass the Senate in short order.”",
        "Congress clearly needs to deal with this. Four out of 10 female congressional aides say sexual harassment is a problem on Capitol Hill, according to a 2016 CQ Roll Call survey. The same survey found that 1 in 6 said they had been personally victimized.",
        "Notably, the Senate bill takes steps to prevent another Farenthold-type situation. It authorizes withholding compensation from a lawmaker if he or she doesn’t repay a harassment settlement initially paid out with taxpayer money. If the lawmaker hasn’t paid up within 180 days, the Treasury Department is authorized to take money out of that lawmaker’s compensation or annuity.",
        "The bill now heads to the House, where lawmakers may not like the changes made by the Senate. Both chambers will have to agree on its final language before it can go to President Donald Trump to become law.",
        "It’s not entirely clear how the Senate plan differs from the House bill, but Klobuchar said there are dozens of changes. One difference is that the House bill proposed a 45-day limit on when a staffer can bring a federal court case against a member of Congress allegedly harassing him or her. The Senate proposal doubles that time frame to 90 days.",
        "“There were many, many, many things we worked on,” Klobuchar said. “We were able to negotiate them one by one and get, what I think, is a very good bill.”",
        "It’s still a mystery which GOP senators opposed the provision requiring them to be personally liable for sexual harassment settlements. Under the current system, the U.S. government ― i.e., taxpayers ― is considered lawmakers’ employer and foots the bill for any settlement involving a lawmaker or an aide.",
        "Blunt, for one, got snippy Tuesday when asked if his bill would require staff and members of Congress to pay out of pocket for settlements. That is the case under the House bill. But Blunt said the Senate bill would only apply to lawmakers.",
        "“Non-members would still be covered by their employer ― like every other employee in America is for their actions,” he told reporters.",
        "This article has been updated to reflect that the bill has been introduced."

        "From charming towns to outdoor paradises, there’s no shortage of great getaway options. Here are 14 fun destinations worth a weekend trip, roughly in order of distance from the city. (Many of these also make for nice day trips).",
        "Beacon",
        "Located in the Hudson Valley, the town of Beacon, New York, has great options for art lovers ― from the Dia:Beacon museum to the Hudson Beach Glass studio and gallery. Storm King Art Center is also a short drive away.",
        "Beyond the art scene, Beacon is also home to a “Dr. Who”-themed restaurant and just across the river from a motorcycle museum. It’s less than two hours away by car or train from New York City.",
        "New Hope & Lambertville",
        "Sitting on opposite sides of the Delaware River, the “picturesque” towns of New Hope, Pennsylvania, and Lambertville, New Jersey, are a favorite of travel writer Tracy Kaler, who runs the blog Tracy’s New York Life. “You’ll find art galleries, fantastic restaurants, one-of-a-kind shops, and general prettiness all around.”",
        "New Hope and Lambertville are also full of cultural attractions like the historic New Hope & Ivyland Railroad, ghost tours and antique stores.",
        "New Paltz",
        "The town of New Paltz, New York, about two hours north of NYC, offers hiking, orchards, historic architecture and more.",
        "“Growing up, my family and I would take annual trips to Mohonk Mountain House, usually in October to enjoy the fall foliage,” New York-based blogger Erica Choi told HuffPost.",
        "“The grounds are beautiful and perfect for taking hikes, as well as taking boat rides out on the lake,” she said. “I recently visited and went ‘forest bathing,’ which is a form of meditation where you practice mindfulness in nature through your senses. The spa there is also a great way to treat yourself!”",
        "North Fork",
        "“My favorite place to escape New York is the North Fork of Long Island,” Kaler said. “Beaches, farms, wine, sunsets ― what more do you need on a weekend away from the city?”",

        "Shelter Island",
        "“For something beachy, I love Sunset Beach on Shelter Island,” travel expert and Passported founder Henley Vazquez told HuffPost. “It’s not new, but it’s always fun, and the laid-back pace of Shelter Island offers a nice alternative to the busy Hamptons scene.”",
        "The Shelter Island area features beaches, nature walks and waterfront restaurants.",
        "Litchfield County",
        "“On long weekends, I love traveling up to Litchfield County in Connecticut,” travel photographer Marie Frei told HuffPost. “That area of the state is only about a two-hour drive from New York City, but the quaint, rural towns and the winding, forested back roads instantly make you feel like you’re very far from the city.”",
        "“There are some great hikes near Bear Mountain and Mount Frissell, the highest point in the state. At Lake Waramaug State Park, you can rent canoes and kayaks from Memorial Day through Labor Day,” she added. “There are a number of farms in the area, so you can’t visit the region without stopping by Arethusa Farm Dairy in Litchfield for ice cream ― it’s the best.”",
        "Montauk",
        "Featured in “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,” Montauk is an increasingly popular spot for people fleeing the city for the Hamptons.",
        "Beyond the iconic lighthouse and classic beaches, Montauk is also home to the Surf Lodge restaurant and venue, Montauk Brewing Company and more.",
        "The Catskills",
        "A weekend in the Catskills is a classic New York getaway for nature lovers.",
        "Beyond the hikes and other outdoor fun, the area has attractions like the Thomas Cole House and the legendary Phoenicia Diner.",
        "Cape May",
        "New Yorkers like to poke fun at New Jersey, but the Garden State has plenty of places to visit, from the casinos of Atlantic City to the beaches of Sea Girt.",
        "On the beach side of things, Cape May is a beloved spot, with wineries, historic homes and beachfront resorts like Congress Hall.",
        "Cooperstown",
        "Fans of America’s pastime know Cooperstown, New York, as the home of the National Baseball Hall of Fame.",
        "But the upstate village, about 200 miles outside New York City, also boasts breweries, a distillery, an annual opera festival and museums like The Farmers’ Museum and Fenimore Art Museum.",
        "Lake George",
        "This mountain getaway, about a four-hour drive from the city, attracted prominent New York families in the 19th and early 20th centuries.",
        "On the southern end of the lake is Fort William Henry, a British fort from the French and Indian War that appeared in the movie “The Last of the Mohicans.”",
        "Lake Placid",
        "Tucked in the Adirondack Mountains, the village of Lake Placid is most famous for hosting the 1932 and 1980 Winter Olympic Games. Today, it is a popular destination for travelers looking for beautiful outdoor landscapes and, in the winter months, opportunities for sports like skiing and snowboarding.",
        "Visitors also have the chance to visit the site of the famous “Miracle on Ice” hockey game. The drive is about five hours from New York City, depending on traffic.",
        "Montreal",
        "“For a longer drive, I recommend Montreal,” Kaler said. “It’s about six hours, but a gorgeous trip through the Adirondacks.”",
        "“The food is some of the best you’ll eat anywhere and the people are incredibly welcoming and hospitable,” she added. “Plus, you’ll feel immersed in French culture. Montreal really is the Paris of North America.”"

        "There will be two major attractions. One is a Millennium Falcon ride in which guests will “pilot” Han Solo’s famed ship. The other is a ride in which the company said: “Visitors will find themselves in the middle of a tense battle between stormtroopers and Resistance fighters.”",

        "date": "2018-05-22"
    },
    "articleContent": [
        "Law enforcement agencies are using Rekognition, Amazon’s facial recognition system, to identify people and track them in real time. This isn’t a case of an outside party making opportunistic use of an emerging technology. The American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California recently obtained documents that show just how closely Amazon is working with cops around the country to implement its product.",
        "In one email, an account manager for Amazon Web Services eagerly offered up his or her services to a Washington County, Oregon, employee: “I am the Account Manager for AWS covering Oregon, and I noticed that you were leveraging our new Rekognition service. Because the service is so new, we are reaching out to customers to make sure they get all the support they need to succeed with their particular use case.”",
        "As the people “leveraging” the Rekognition technology may or may not realize, facial recognition software tends to be racist.",
        "The artificial intelligence-powered system can analyze faces and almost immediately run them through larger databases featuring tens of millions of faces to produce a similar result. Amazon sees police use of its tool as “common” and describes the technology as an “easy and accurate way” to monitor public spaces and identify “people of interest.” Law enforcement agencies in Orlando, Florida, and Washington County have praised the software.",
        "Orlando has the ability to identify faces in real-time via a network of cameras located across the city. Washington County has taken at least 300,000 mugshots and built a database to use with Rekognition.",
        "But the technology is fallible. It often does not properly identify darker-skinned people. The Rekogniton software can identify “all faces in group photos, crowded events, and public places such as airports.” It can also recognize up to 100 people in a single image. Such broad capabilities, when coupled with balky technology, could lead to the wrong people being targeted during investigations.",
        "Research from Joy Buolamwini of M.I.T. Media Lab found that three AI-powered facial recognition systems — Microsoft, IBM, and Face++ — identified men more accurately than women and performed better on lighter-skinned faces than those with dark skin despite having fairly high accuracy overall.",
        "A 2016 study from Georgetown Law’s Center on Privacy and Technology found that over 117 million American adults are included in facial recognition databases used by law enforcement agencies. The databases have a disproportionate effect on African-Americans, said Clare Garvie, one of the lead researchers, at the time. The software less accurately identifies black people even though they are overrepresented in the databases.",
        "“If police are looking for an African-American suspect, they may miss even if that person is in their database — it may not find that person,” she said. “But these systems are not designed to give no for an answer. They’re designed to give a list of possible matches. So if they don’t find the right person, they provide a list of the wrong people — and that will happen more with African-Americans.”",
        "Academic research has not been conducted on the accuracy of Amazon’s product, but history tells us what happens when black people are thrown into the panopticon. Local police and the federal government have a history of surveilling social movements ― most notably COINTELPRO, a civil rights era ploy on the part of the FBI to stifle progressive organizations and black social movements.",
        "In an August 2017 report, the FBI claimed that “black identity extremists” concerned with “alleged police brutality” were likely to take up arms against law enforcement. The Los Angeles Police already monitors the “suspicious activities” of civilians through the Nationwide Suspicious Activity Reporting Initiative. An inspector general’s audit of the program in January 2015 found that more than 30 percent of the reports involved black residents despite black people making up only 9.6 percent of the city’s population. Baltimore’s police department tracks the cell phone use of residents and films their movements using drones.",
        "Border Patrol has expressed a desire to build face-recognizing drones and have tested facial scans at airports to track undocumented immigrants who may have overstayed their visas. (Just over 1 percent of all travelers overstayed their visas in 2016.) And former Congressman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) also proposed using the software to track undocumented immigrants.",
        "“We already know that facial recognition algorithms discriminate against Black faces, and are being used to violate the human rights of immigrants,” said Malkia Cyril, executive director of the Center for Media Justice, in a press release.",
        "“We know that putting this technology into the hands of already brutal and unaccountable law enforcement agencies places both democracy and dissidence at great risk,” she added. “Amazon should never be in the business of aiding and abetting racial discrimination and xenophobia — but that’s exactly what Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is doing when he sells these loosely regulated facial recognition tools to local police departments.”"

In the skit, two former porn stars, played by Bayer and Cecily Strong, shill for Trump in their own unique way (available to watch via NBC here).",

        "A Kansas police department is facing allegations of racism after a black man used his cellphone to record two white officers yanking him out of a vehicle after seeing “vegetation” on his window.",
        "Rudy Samuel, 31, live-streamed the encounter on Facebook earlier this month after Winfield police stopped his car. Winfield is a small city situated along the Walnut River in Cowley County, Kansas.",
        "“If you want to see a video of racial profiling, this is the poster child right here,” Kansas City attorney Brian McCallister, who is not representing anyone in the case, told HuffPost on Monday. “It was an abuse of power because they had no reason to use that kind of force.”",
        "In the video, recorded May 13, Samuel says he’s been stopped by officers who claim he failed to signal within 100 feet of making a turn. Samuel narrates the first few minutes of the video and waits as the officers attempt to verify his driver’s license and vehicle registration. About two and a half minutes into the video, an officer can be seen approaching Samuel’s vehicle.",
        "“Hey, Mr. Samuel, what caught my attention was this vegetation stuff right here,” the officer said.",
        "After looking at what the officer is referring to ― which isn’t visible in the video but is apparently some sort of vegetation in the window seal ― Samuel can be heard saying, “That’s tree stuff, man … that’s gotta be from a tree.”",
        "He later adds: “I don’t even smoke.”",
        "The officer then tells Samuel he’s going to put the vegetation in an evidence bag, and he’s seen returning to his patrol car. He then returns with another officer.",
        "The first officer can be heard telling Samuel to step out of his vehicle. When Samuel asks why, the officer claims it’s because of the “vegetation in the window.” Asked by Samuel to test the vegetation, the officer replies, “I ain’t gotta test it right now. I need you to step out for me.”",
        "The officers then appear to reach into the vehicle and drag Samuel out. Samuel drops his cellphone at this point, but the phone continues to record, capturing the sound of officers detaining Samuel.",
        "“You’re being detained so I can search the vehicle,” an officer can be heard saying. Samuel replies, “I give no permission to search that vehicle.”",
        "Shortly thereafter, the video stops. Samuel later wrote on Facebook that one of the officers stopped the recording.",
        "Samuel, citing fears for his safety, directed HuffPost’s questions about the traffic stop to a man he identified as his spokesperson ― Peter Wright, of the Kansas-based Freedom 1 social justice group.",
        "Wright said the officers detained Samuel until they finished searching his vehicle, then released him without a citation.",
        "“This has happened to him before for no reason,” Wright said. “This young man has a good background. He’s a father, he’s engaged to be married and his grandfather is a minister. This was racially motivated.”",
        "McCallister said police had no right to search Samuel’s vehicle.",
        "“In order to search that car, they have to have reasonable suspicion that a crime is being committed or was committed,” the attorney explained. “That police officer is saying that the vegetation on the window is what gives him reasonable suspicion to search the car. In my opinion, that was pretext for searching the car.”",
        "Winfield Police Chief Brett Stone declined to discuss the traffic stop, but did tell HuffPost it is “under investigation.”",
        "Wright said Samuel is weighing his options and considering a lawsuit against the police department. “He has a biracial family and they’ve moved out of Winfield due to threats,” he said.",
        "“He wants people to know what happened,” Wright added. “He’s lucky to be alive, because so many guys in situations like this are not able to tell their story.”",

        "Earlier this month, local media first revealed the grocer’s $670,000 in donations over the last three years to Republican candidate Adam Putnam, Florida’s current agriculture commissioner.",
        "Putnam, who brands himself as a lifelong gun owner, opposed Gov. Rick Scott’s (R) gun control law signed in the wake of February’s deadly mass shooting at a Parkland, Florida, high school.",
        "Putnam had said Scott’s decision to raise the age to purchase a rifle or a shotgun from 18 to 21 “destroys the family tradition of possessing and practicing safe use of firearms.” The National Rifle Association, which immediately sued to block the gun law, applauded Putnam’s stance.",
        "Publix is Florida’s largest private employer, according to The Tampa Bay Times, and its political donations to Putnam are likely some of the largest since 1995, if not in the company’s history.",
        "Now the #BoycottPublix petition has spread across social media.",
        "Publix defended itself, saying it never made any direct donations to the NRA, which has called for more guns in the wake of what many are calling a gun violence epidemic. Including last week’s deadly shooting at a Santa Fe, Texas, high school, there have been 16 school shootings this year, according to a count by The Washington Post.",
        "Publix said in a statement to HuffPost Tuesday evening that the company has a “history of supporting candidates focused on job growth and a healthy Florida economy.”",
        "“We regret that some of our political contributions have led to an unintentional customer divide instead of our desire to support a growing economy in Florida,” the company said. “As a result of this situation, we are evaluating our processes to ensure that our giving better reflects our intended desire to support a strong economy and a healthy community.”",
        "Those vowing to boycott Publix have argued that supporting Putnam directly supports the NRA because of his promise to uphold the group’s beliefs.",
        "“I’m very sad I’ll never experience the joy of a [Publix sub] again but nothing tastes as good as being on the right side of the fight,” tweeted social media user Gabriella Juliet, who used the boycott hashtag.",
        "Whether the boycott will affect the company ― which has 1,183 stores in Florida, Georgia, Alabama, South Carolina, Tennessee, North Carolina and Virginia ― remains to be seen.",
        "According to personal finance website WalletHub, 60 percent of Americans plan to barbecue over the Memorial Day weekend, with $1.5 billion worth of meat and seafood being purchased for the event. Memorial Day is also the second most popular day for beer sales, just behind Independence Day.",
        "David Jenkins, a Tampa resident who said he is participating in the boycott, estimated to the Times that he spends $500 to $600 a month at Publix stores. He said he’s now taking his business to competitor Winn-Dixie.",
        "“I’m sure if you went through every corporate chain you could find something you disagree with, but there’s a certain point where you draw a line,” he told the paper. “This situation — where the amount of money is so substantial and the stakes so high — is the line.”",
        "Publix has financially supported Putnam as a political candidate since at least 1995, according to the Tampa Bay Times.",
        "Publix has explained its support for Putnam as him being a “hometown candidate” from Polk County, where the company was founded, and having “a long-standing relationship” with the grocer.",
        "The Times reported that in 2016, during his second term as commissioner of agriculture, Putnam once pulled the results of failed health inspections of seven Publix stores from the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services’s website. He then eliminated the pass/fail grading system and made it so the worst rating possible is “re-inspection required.”",
        "Florida’s primary elections are on Aug. 28. The state’s gubernatorial election is on Nov. 6.",
        "Putnam’s challengers include U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis (R), who has been endorsed by President Donald Trump. The Democratic candidates are former Miami Beach Mayor Philip Levine, former U.S. Rep. Gwen Graham, Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, and Central Florida businessman Chris King.",

        "Carlson, who previously hosted Fox News’ morning show “Fox & Friends,” settled her lawsuit for a reported $20 million. Ailes died one year ago at age 77, about nine months after his resignation.",
        "Kelly, one of the network’s biggest stars, left Fox News for NBC News in January 2017. In her memoir published in late 2016, she accused Ailes of sexually harassing her when she was at the network. After her departure, she blasted the network from her perch at NBC News, telling audiences that she complained to network executives about host Bill O’Reilly, who was fired from Fox News after an explosive New York Times report detailed claims by five women who said the host sexually harassed or acted improperly toward them.",
        "The film does not have a release date yet, but Deadline reported that it has been in the works since before Ailes’ death last year. While Theron is set to play Kelly, future audiences will be left to wonder who will take on Carlson’s role."

        "On a quest to fulfill his promise to end unnecessary arrests and racial disparity in marijuana enforcement, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has issued a new request to the city’s police: Stop arresting people for smoking marijuana in public.",
        "Over the weekend, De Blasio told the New York City Police Department to issue summonses to pot smokers who were caught lighting up in public spaces instead of arresting them, reported CNN.",
        "About 17,880 people were arrested in the city last year for low-level marijuana possession, including smoking in public. A startling 86 percent of those arrested were people of color.",
        "As The Guardian noted, De Blasio’s no-arrest recommendation won’t have an immediate impact on NYPD policy but is expected to influence a 30-day review of marijuana enforcement procedures currently underway at the NYPD. Phil Walzak, the department’s deputy commissioner of public information, told CNN that the issue is “certainly part of the review.”",
        "“The working group is reviewing possession and public smoking of marijuana to ensure enforcement is consistent with the values of fairness and trust, while also promoting public safety and addressing community concerns,” Walzak said.",
        "De Blasio’s request marks the latest milestone in what observers have described as a striking shift in marijuana enforcement policy in New York City ― one sparked by a growing acknowledgment of the troubling racial gap in weed-related arrests. City-wide, black people were arrested on low-level marijuana charges at eight times the rate of white people over the past three years, according to a New York Times analysis published last week. In Manhattan, the racial gap was even more striking; black people were arrested on marijuana charges at 15 times the rate of white people.",
        "Last week, Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. pledged to stop prosecuting marijuana possession or smoking cases.",
        "“The dual mission of the Manhattan D.A.’s Office is a safer New York and a more equal justice system,” Vance said in a press release announcing the policy change. “The ongoing arrest and criminal prosecution of predominantly black and brown New Yorkers for smoking marijuana serves neither of these goals.”",
        "A day later, Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez said his office planned to reduce prosecution of low-level marijuana cases as well.",
        "The policy shift also appears to be spurred by an expectation of impending legalization. De Blasio, one of the few New York politicians who has voiced opposition to legalizing weed, announced that he will put together a task force to prepare the city for when marijuana is legalized. De Blasio said Monday that it’s “likely inevitable” that New York state will legalize the drug."

        "Grande and Davidson have both recently split from their respective partners. Grande broke it off with rapper Mac Miller earlier this month, after two years together. Meanwhile, Davidson recently announced that he and comedian Cazzie David had gone their separate ways.",
        "It’s unclear how the two first met, but in 2016, Grande hosted the late-night sketch series for the first time ― to much acclaim ― with Davidson by her side. (She’d also been a musical guest in 2014.) Davidson appeared during Grande’s opening monologue, in which she joked about having a “real adult scandal.”",
        "“Do you want to smoke some pot or something?” he asked her on stage.",
        "Davidson reportedly came to support Grande at the Billboard Music Awards on Sunday night, where she slayed a performance of her new single, “No Tears Left To Cry.”",
        "“After Ariana’s performance, they were backstage and he had his arm around her,” an onlooker told People about the pair. “They seemed very lovey-dovey. He was hanging out with her and her friends with his arm around her. She seemed quite smitten.”",
        "Earlier this month, Grande made a rare comment on her relationship status amid reports that she and Miller had split. In an Instagram post, Grande called the rapper, with whom she collaborated on 2013’s “The Way,” “one of my best friends in the whole world.”",
        "“I respect and adore him endlessly and am grateful to have him in my life in any form, at all times regardless of how our relationship changes or what the universe holds for each of us,” she wrote, alongside a picture of the couple in happier times.",

        "Gay and transgender media advocacy group GLAAD said in its annual Studio Responsibility Index that of the 109 releases by the seven largest movie studios in 2017, just 14, or 12.8 percent, included LGBTQ characters.",
        "GLAAD called on Hollywood to have 20 percent of annual film releases include a gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender or gender fluid character by 2021, rising to 50 percent of output by 2024.",
        "Box office hits like “Wonder Woman” and “Black Panther” have smashed old Hollywood notions that movies that champion women and people of color do not have global appeal, GLAAD said.",
        "“It is time for LGBTQ stories to be included in this conversation,” GLAAD President Sarah Kate Ellis said in the report.",
        "GLAAD praised movies like tennis film “Battle of the Sexes,” Oscar best picture winner “The Shape of Water” and independent transgender tale “A Fantastic Woman” from Chile that won the best foreign language Oscar in March.",
        "But it gave the thumbs-down to “Thor: Ragnarok” for deleting references to two characters who are bisexual or queer in the original Marvel comic book source material, criticized “Baywatch” for its “many jokes relying on gay panic for cheap laughs,” and said “Pitch Perfect 3” sidelined a lesbian character.",
        "Despite the slide in LGBTQ characters in 2017, GLAAD said 2018 had already shown welcome progress, with movies like gay young adult film “Love, Simon” and the raunchy teen comedy “Blockers.”",
        "The report expressed hope for upcoming films, such as musical “Mamma Mia 2,” where GLAAD said it would like to see Colin Firth’s gay character further explored, and “The Girl in the Spider’s Web,” where lead character Lisbeth Salander is bisexual in the original Stieg Larsson novel.",
        "As for “Bohemian Rhapsody,” the upcoming biopic about Queen singer Freddie Mercury who died in 1991 of AIDS complications, GLAAD said it hoped the film would “make a powerful impact by fully exploring his queer identity.”",

    "articleContent": [
        "WASHINGTON ― The race for Georgia’s Republican gubernatorial nomination is all about the culture war.",
        "The three leading candidates have aired ads showing themselves wielding rifles and handguns. One declared he owned a “big truck” just in case he needed to round up criminal illegals and “take them home myself.” Not to be topped, another started a statewide tour with a “deportation bus.”",
        "The attention-grabbing ads and stunts have highlighted a seven-candidate race in which, should none get more than 50 percent of the vote in Tuesday’s primary, the top two finishers will advance to a late July runoff.",
        "The frontrunners are Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle and Secretary of State Brian Kemp.",
        "In one of Kemp’s ads, he holds a shotgun while “interviewing” a young man interested in dating one of his daughters. The requirements for wooing that daughter?",
        "“Respect and a healthy appreciation for the 2nd Amendment,” the suitor replies.",
        "The uproar generated by the ad could help Kemp stand out in a field that includes former state Sen. Hunter Hill, state Sen. Michael Williams and former Navy SEAL and businessman Clay Tippins.",
        "Cagle also holds a gun in one of his spots, as a narrator brags about his endorsement by the National Rifle Association. The NRA’s backing came after he pushed an amendment to kill a tax break benefiting Georgia-based Delta following the company’s decision ― in reaction to February’s mass school shooting in Parkland, Florida ― to end a discount program for NRA members flying to the group’s national convention. (Never mind that the discount program was rarely used.)",
        "In another ad, Cagle brags about his work to end so-called sanctuary cities for undocumented immigrants in the state.",
        "Hill, who has the endorsement of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), released an ad where he shoots a target and argues the age requirement to buy a handgun should be lowered to 18 from 21. “As governor, I won’t give an inch on our 2nd Amendment,” he says in the ad.",
        "But those ads were just a set-up for the biggest free media play in the race: Williams’ deportation bus, which he drove around the state, promising “to fill this bus with illegals and send them back to where they came from. He would do so by implementing a program that allows state and local police to enforce immigration law under a partnership with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.",
        "It worked. Williams received attention from local and national media, even landing an interview with Fox News ― a prize for any candidate in a competitive GOP primary. (Williams also received plenty of mockery when the bus briefly broke down.)",
        "The winner of the GOP primary will face one of the two Democrats, both former state representatives, in November: Stacey Abrams or Stacey Evans.",
        "The DCCC vs. Laura Moser",
        "The showdown between journalist and activist Laura Moser and lawyer Lizzie Fletcher has become much bigger than a normal race for a House district nomination.",
        "The decision by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee to attack Moser as unelectable turned the contest into a symbol of a broader battle between progressive candidates and the national party apparatus. That drove donations to Moser, helping to lift her over other candidates in the March primary and into a runoff against Fletcher, who has the backing of EMILY’s List.",
        "The runoff campaign between the two fizzled somewhat ― The Texas Tribune labeled the contest “boring,” and the progressive energy and money animating Moser’s insurgency appears to have dried up.",
        "The winner of the race will face Rep. John Culberson in a 7th Congressional District centered around west Houston. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton won the district by fewer than 2 percentage points in 2016. If Moser does pull off a win in the runoff, the race will become an instant test of whether progressives can win despite Democratic establishment doubts.",
        "The Club For Growth Takes Texas",
        "The Club for Growth, which views itself as the enforcer of GOP orthodoxy on free-market economics, has had an up-and-down few years. Its attacks on Donald Trump in the GOP presidential primaries were unable to stop his march to victory. Still, they ended up loving his tax cuts ― while hating his proposals to enact tariffs and restrict free trade.",
        "The group sees a slew of open House seats in heavily Republican territory in Texas as a chance to reassert its influence. Club for Growth Action, the group’s political arm, has aired TV ads in four different districts in the run-up to Tuesday’s GOP runoffs. The group backs Michael Cloud (who’s also been endorsed by former Texas GOP Rep. Ron Paul) in the 27th District, former Cruz chief of staff Chip Roy in the 21st, local official Ron Wright in the 6th, and GOP activist Bunni Pounds to replace Republican Rep. Jeb Hensarling in the 5th.",
        "Pounds, Cloud, Roy and Wright are all expected to join the House Freedom Caucus if elected to Congress.",
        "Remember Georgia’s 6th District?",
        "The special election last year to replace then-Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price in Congress turned into the most expensive House race in the nation’s history, with over $40 million spent on TV and radio advertising alone. In the end, Republican Karen Handel triumphed over Democrat Jon Ossoff in an early test of Democratic resistance to Trump.",
        "The Democratic primary to challenge Handel this year has been sleepier, to say the least.",
        "Former TV news anchor Bobby Kaple has raised the most money in the field, and earned the endorsement of former Gov. Roy Barnes and former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young. Kevin Abel, a businessman, also amassed a significant war chest.",
        "But the late entrance of Lucy McBath, a former Delta flight attendant who became a gun control activist following the shooting death of her son, could shake up the contest. McBath only entered the contest following the massacre in Parkland, but has the backing of EMILY’s List. Also supporting her is Everytown for Gun Safety, the Michael Bloomberg-backed group where McBath previously worked. The group has spent more than $500,000 on TV ads supporting her."

    "articleContent": [
        "Lawmakers in the California Assembly voted Monday to advance a bill that would authorize employers, co-workers and school personnel to request the temporary confiscation of guns from individuals determined to pose a danger to themselves or others.",
        "The legislation, AB 2888, would build on California’s existing “red flag” law, passed in 2014 following a deadly shooting spree in Isla Vista. The 22-year-old gunman in that case had reportedly exhibited a number of warning signs before killing six people, and then himself, in the rampage.",
        "The current red flag law gives family members, roommates and law enforcement officers the power to petition the court to remove firearms from individuals who have displayed dangerous behavior. Judges then hold a hearing to determine whether to order the gun owner to surrender their firearms and stay away from all guns, typically for a year, although the restraining orders can be extended beyond that based on additional evidence.",
        "The new bill would expand the list of people who can file for such restraining orders to include a subject’s employer and co-workers and the staff of a high school or college that the person has attended in the last six months.",
        "“We’re grappling with this issue of gun violence as a nation,” bill sponsor Assemblyman Phil Ting (D) told HuffPost. “I’ve never said this is a panacea, but it’s just one of many solutions we have to offer.”",
        "The state’s courts have issued around 200 restraining orders to prevent gun violence since the original law went into effect in 2016, according to Ting. He said his bill would provide additional opportunities to catch troubling behavior.",
        "“Once you move away from home and you’re an adult, you may not spend time with your family,” said Ting. “You may not have much interaction with law enforcement, but chances are if you’re working, you see your co-workers every day for eight-plus hours a day, and you’re with them not just in the work environment but socially.”",
        "Ting pointed to the February massacre in Parkland, Florida, as a case in which a red flag law ― and specifically this sort of broader statute ― might have been able to save lives. Although the suspect in that shooting, a 19-year-old former student at the high school, had attracted the attention of local authorities on numerous occasions before his attack, school staff had also reported concerning behavior as far back as 2016. Florida is among the nine states with a red flag law and one of the four to have ushered through legislation since the Parkland shooting.",
        "In 2016, Ting filed a similar bill to broaden California’s red flag law, following the mass shooting in San Bernardino, which began at an office holiday party. Gov. Jerry Brown (D) ultimately vetoed the legislation, calling it “premature to enact a further expansion” even as the initial law was just going into effect.",
        "A year later, Ting’s San Francisco area district faced its own mass shooting when a disgruntled UPS employee walked into his workplace and fatally shot three colleagues, before killing himself.",
        "When it comes to school safety specifically, restraining orders aimed at stopping gun violence are only part of the equation, said Amanda Wilcox, legislative chair of the California chapters of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. She noted a California law that holds parents criminally liable if they leave their gun where a child can access it and mentioned other resources, like the Brady campaign’s Speak Up hotline, that allow students to anonymously report violent threats made by their peers.",
        "“Practices and law and policies that make homes safer would also keep schools safer,” she told HuffPost.",
        "Wilcox said she supports Ting’s bill and suggested that the relatively few restraining orders issued in the past two years under the original law show that it isn’t being overused, as opponents argued it would be.",
        "“The standards of proof are high in the law,” she said. “It probably needs to be used more, but also under the law it’s supposed to be a last resort if there’s not another way to remove the guns.”",
        "With more time to educate Californians on how the red-flag process works, Wilcox said she’s hopeful these restraining orders will be able to keep more guns out of the hands of dangerous individuals.",
        "“What I don’t want is a case where it could have been used and should have been used and wasn’t, and someone is dead because of that,” she said.",
        "AB 2888 passed in a 48-25 vote largely along party lines. The state Senate is expected to consider the bill in the coming weeks."

        "PREVIOUSLY:",
        "A commemorative coin released by the White House is drawing ire over its depiction of President Donald Trump face-to-face with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un.",
        "The flashy coin, known as a challenge coin, shows the two men’s portly profiles with the words “Peace talks” above them. Both men’s names are printed along the coin’s border, with Kim referred to as “Supreme Leader” ― a title that the U.S. government is not known to use.",
        "The coin was released to memorialize the pair’s planned peace summit — which, as of this week, may not happen.",
        "White House press secretary Sarah Sanders waved off questions about the coin during a press briefing on Tuesday, saying the White House Communications Agency, a special military unit that provides support to the president and his staff, is the organization responsible for its design. The agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment from HuffPost.",
        "In addition to the status of the two leaders’ announced June 12 meeting in Singapore being up in the air as of this week, critics are expressing concern over Kim’s being given such a prestigious recognition while sharing a platform with the U.S. president.",
        "In addition to torturing and causing the death of American college student Otto Warmbier, North Korea is widely known for human rights abuses against its people and foreigners. It has threatened to wage a nuclear attack on the U.S. and South Korea. It most recently refused to dismantle its nuclear arsenal unless it first sees some benefits.",
        "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is among those urging Kim’s removal from the coin.",
        "“Challenge coins are a time honored tradition and certainly appropriate in this situation, but Kim Jong Un’s face has no place on this coin. He is a brutal dictator and something like the Peace House would be much more appropriate,” Schumer tweeted.",
        "The Peace House, on the border between North and South Korea, has been proposed by Trump as a meeting place for the men. It’s where Kim met with South Korean President Moon Jae-in last month.",
        "Robert E. Kelly, a political analyst on Korean international affairs and a professor at South Korea’s Pusan National University, also decried the design on Twitter, calling it “gross” and “un-American.”",
        "Others on social media raised eyebrows over both men’s physical depictions. Trump’s jawline appears much more defined than it typically appears, while Kim has noticeable rolls under his chin.",
        "As far as their relationship goes, placing the two men’s faces side by side appears to blanket over what has been a pretty volatile relationship.",
        "In January, the two men publicly feuded over who has a bigger nuclear button. Late last year, they turned to name calling, with Kim branding Trump a “mentally deranged dotard” and Trump calling Kim “Little Rocket Man.”"

    "articleContent": [
        "UPDATE: May 22 ― Retired fighter pilot Amy McGrath won Tuesday’s Democratic primary in Kentucky’s 6th Congressional District, defeating Lexington Mayor Jim Gray.",
        "PREVIOUSLY:",
        "LEXINGTON, Ky. ― Amy McGrath’s campaign for Congress hadn’t even officially started, and it was already broke.",
        "Last June, the former Marine fighter pilot retired from the military to move home to Kentucky and launch a political career. McGrath is everything a national Democratic campaign official would want in a new candidate ― she is a woman and a veteran, and while she isn’t a small business owner, her husband is. Still, she struggled to win over Democratic Party insiders in Kentucky and Washington, most of whom were waiting for Jim Gray, the popular mayor of Lexington, to decide whether he would pursue Kentucky’s 6th Congressional District seat instead.",
        "So in July, with a bit of money in the bank and desperation beginning to set in, McGrath’s campaign manager, Mark Nickolas, decided that he had to do something crazy. He told McGrath, who hadn’t yet unpacked from her move, to dig her bomber jacket out of a box. He took his fledgling candidate to Lexington’s Blue Grass Airport, stood her in front of a fighter jet, and told Mark Putnam, the ad man who has made Democratic candidates from Missouri to Wisconsin go viral, to start filming.",
        "The ad that resulted told a simple story: As a child, McGrath begged her congressman to help overturn the military’s ban on women in combat, to no avail. But the Pentagon reversed course when she was in high school. She enrolled in the U.S. Naval Academy, joined the Marines and became the first woman to ever fly an F-18 fighter jet in combat.",
        "McGrath relates this anecdote over b-roll of soaring jets, with a quick departure to point out that Republicans want to take away Kentuckians’ health care. You could discern the message of the commercial all the way from Paducah: McGrath is a woman and a fighter, and she won’t be deterred from achieving her goals.",
        "When Nickolas answered his cell phone on the morning of Aug. 1, 2017, the day he planned to launch the ad, the voice on the other end had bad news: McGrath had raised just $50,000 so far. The ad had cost $57,000. Her campaign was $7,000 in the red, and she’d barely said hello.",
        "“I thought to myself, ‘Did I just destroy her career?’” Nickolas said.",
        "On the contrary: Over the next three days, McGrath became a national political sensation, a symbol of the wave of Democratic women running for office in the age of Trump. Comedian Sarah Silverman called her a “badass” on Twitter. Chelsea Handler invited McGrath to appear on her show. More than 1 million people watched the video, and money ― lots of money ― began rolling in: McGrath raised more than $340,000 in the 72 hours after the commercial first aired.",
        "What the ad didn’t do, however, was win over national Democrats ― namely, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, or DCCC, which continued to recruit Gray. Neither did it push Gray out of the race: When he finally declared his candidacy in December, Gray held, according to McGrath’s own internal polling, a 40-point lead.",
        "But handshake by handshake, McGrath quickly narrowed the gap. Going into Tuesday’s primary, she was either fast on Gray’s heels or out in front, depending on whose polling you believe, and the DCCC has quietly taken the position that either Democratic hopeful will have a strong chance to beat Republican incumbent Rep. Andy Barr in November.",
        "Ideologically speaking, there is little daylight between McGrath and Gray. The distinction between them lies mainly in affect and strategy, with McGrath continuing to push an outsider vs. insider narrative of the primary even as she seemed to become at least some of the insiders’ preferred candidate.",
        "While she may well lose her primary, McGrath’s campaign contains some lessons for a party desperate to flip districts like this one. She unabashedly pandered to the sort of discontent that swept President Donald Trump into office, but she took care to hitch it to issues like jobs and health care — particularly to the efforts of her state’s senior senator, Republican Mitch McConnell, to “take health care away from over a quarter-million Kentuckians.”",
        "Grievance plus stuff. Stick that on your lawn sign.",
        "The challenge facing McGrath’s campaign was immediately evident for any visitor to her campaign office near the University of Kentucky’s campus in Lexington. Her opponent had headquartered his 2016 campaign for Rand Paul’s U.S. Senate seat out of the same office; across the drive, a small house still had a “Gray for U.S. Senate” campaign sticker plastered on the front door.",
        "And though McGrath’s initial ad had garnered her national attention, Gray still seemed like an obvious front-runner in the early months of the race: He is the mayor of the district’s biggest base of reliably Democratic votes and oversees a city with a 3 percent unemployment rate. He won the 19-county area by three points in the Senate race against Paul. And in a year when the DCCC is going for broke trying to gain the 24 seats it needs to regain the House majority, Gray is a bit of a luxury: a wealthy businessman in a marginally competitive district who has the ability to relieve financial pressure on the national party by self-financing at least part of his campaign.",
        "Gray also comes with progressive bona fides: A popular mayor who’s transformed Lexington, he supported removing the city’s Confederate statues; he’s a small-town Kentuckian who helped turn his family business into a construction giant; he’s viewed favorably by 77 percent of primary voters. He supports raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour and expanding Obamacare; he touts a record of targeting utility monopolies that would seem to fit neatly into the new Democratic antitrust agenda. A win in the primary and again in November would make him the first openly gay congressman in Kentucky’s history.",
        "But what would ordinarily be a compelling biography instead became something of a liability in an election year that has thus far favored political outsiders ― especially when they’re women. In Virginia, Pennsylvania, Nebraska and beyond, insurgent female candidates have knocked off more established opponents with stronger-on-paper political resumes, feeding off the sense that Americans (and especially Democrats) want a new generation of political leaders to emerge.",
        "So what Gray and national Democrats saw as strengths, McGrath and her team instantly pegged as weaknesses. Without much room to differentiate herself on the issues, McGrath instead chose to paint Gray as a favorite son of the national Democratic establishment, the hand-picked choice of Washington rather than of central Kentucky.",
        "“I think people are hungry for new leaders, and a new generation of leaders,” she said. “They’re tired of the old guard. They want folks who aren’t hand-picked.”",
        "The characterization isn’t exactly accurate: Aside from the Senate run, Gray’s entire political career has been spent on the Lexington city council or in the mayor’s office, and he’s hardly been a prominent voice in statewide or national Democratic politics. But by playing up her status as an outsider ― a veteran, a mother, a woman, three things she says there aren’t enough of in Congress ― McGrath’s narrative has taken hold nonetheless, and her calls to shake up Congress have resonated strongly against Gray’s safer, duller call to “send some adult supervision to Washington.”",
        "Yet as McGrath’s national profile grew after her first ad, she remained relatively unknown and perhaps even a little suspect to Kentucky voters. A native of Edgewood in northern Kentucky, she’d never lived in the central part of the state and had only relocated to the district in June, upon retiring from the U.S. Naval Academy.",
        "(Gray attempted to punch back on this point in the race’s closing days, releasing an ad that hit McGrath for only recently moving to Kentucky. But groups like VoteVets, a nonprofit that promotes veteran candidates and their issues, have slammed the ad as an attempt to “swift-boat” McGrath’s campaign.)",
        "Even before Gray entered the race, Nickolas, who had managed former Rep. Ben Chandler’s (D) successful 6th District campaign in 2004, outlined an aggressive retail politicking strategy to get McGrath in front of voters ― not just on TV, but in their homes, churches, billboards and mailboxes.",
        "Nickolas ― who thought he was out of politics for good until Chandler urged him to meet with McGrath ― said he was instantly swayed by her grasp of the issues and the realities of politics, which she had honed during stints working for Rep. Susan Davis (D-Calif.) in Congress during her time in the military. Most of all, he was impressed by her passion, and he banked on his belief that if they had to chance to meet her, Kentucky voters would feel the same.",
        "McGrath, meanwhile, purchased ad space in every local newspaper in the district and published an editorial detailing why she had chosen to run now, in 2018, and here, in central Kentucky. She piggybacked off the popularity of the initial ad, which gained her thousands of social media followers, to hold Q&A’s with voters in the district that were broadcast on Facebook. She hit all 19 counties in her first few months in the race, stumping across the region and spending hours, even days, in areas that had once been reliable Democratic strongholds but have trended red for more than a decade.",
        "In a district where Democrats still hold a registration advantage, she has pushed the message that the national party has abandoned its voters here. “The Democrats here feel left behind by the national party,” she said. “The national party, to them, is Washington D.C. They don’t have the same values. They’re led by San Francisco and New York. They don’t see leaders from here or the Midwest. And they’re focused on the wrong things.”",
        "Led by San Francisco and New York. You don’t need a decoder pin to understand what McGrath is getting at. But she goes no further. She doesn’t counterpose issues of identity — transgender access to bathrooms, women’s rights, race — against the economic concerns of white, working-class voters. McGrath is pro-choice. She’s a vocal critic of Trump’s efforts to ban transgender people from the military. She thinks his effort to ban refugees and immigrants from majority Muslim countries is discriminatory and misguided.",
        "McGrath doesn’t shy away from those issues when voters bring them up, and she believes her military service helps bridge the gap between the two sides when they do disagree. But she’s primarily focused on what she sees as the concerns that the district’s old-school Democrats who’ve been voting Republican still share with the national party: chiefly, health care and the economy.",
        "She has argued for not just protecting the Affordable Care Act but expanding it to include a public option and a lower age of eligibility for Medicare, against the Republican tax cut package for which incumbent Barr voted, and for raising the minimum wage. She describes herself as a “fiscal conservative,” but mostly to score points off of Barr for passing deficit-fattening tax cuts after years of fear-mongering on that very same issue.",
        "And in a direct appeal to the rural parts of the district, she’s advocated for an expansive role for the federal government, arguing that it should invest heavily in broadband, infrastructure, and job and economic development in areas left behind by the decline of manufacturing and the collapse of the coal industry.",
        "“We ought to have the federal government funding high-speed broadband in those areas. And we ought to do it for our country,” McGrath argued during an interview in her Lexington campaign office. “Eisenhower didn’t say, ‘Let’s let private industry build the highways.’ No, the government did that. And it powered our country. FDR brought electricity to Appalachia. The federal government did that.”",
        "McGrath speaks in a folksy, unpolished manner, with the occasional curse word slipping out, her voice rising and falling and sometimes cracking as she talks about the ugly direction the country she fought for has taken, or about Barr’s vote to repeal the health care law that gave thousands of local residents coverage for the first time. “The average household income here in Kentucky is about $50,000. That’s not a lot,” she said. “When you have Andy Barr coming in and saying, ‘I’m going to repeal Obamacare and give you health savings accounts’ ― dude, they don’t have the money for health savings accounts.”",
        "The more Kentuckians have gotten to see of McGrath, the more the message she’s aiming for has set in.",
        "“A lot of people say they want to shake things up. She’s believable in that regard, just because of her demeanor,” said Al Cross, a veteran Kentucky political journalist. “She comes across as somebody who wants to get things done and won’t take no for an answer.”",
        "That invocation of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, meanwhile, isn’t an accident ― it was the New Deal and the local economic populists who supported it, like former Kentucky Sen. (and Vice President) Alben Barkley, who painted the state blue a century ago. In a state where Democrats have continually lost ground over the last decade, McGrath is arguing that “we have to talk about the things that made these people Democrats in the first place,” Cross said. “FDR is the guy who confirmed people as Democrats. And Alben Barkley did too. And it’s been a long time since either of those guys were around.”",
        "Even before the polls began to shift, there were signs that the strategy was working. Last fall, McGrath traveled to Anderson County ― one of the district’s largest counties ― to meet with Ben Carlson, the conservative editor of the local daily newspaper, the Anderson News. Carlson was impressed, not just by McGrath, but by the enthusiasm people had about her.",
        "“I haven’t sensed, in a congressional race, this kind of enthusiasm for a candidate in the 12 years I’ve been running the paper. For either party,” Carlson said. “She’s brought that kind of excitement to it.”",
        "To Nickolas, that’s evidence that this sort of hyperlocal campaigning in districts where voters increasingly feel detached from both sides of the national debate can help Democrats win back seats.",
        "“I think it’s a reminder that sometimes we get away from the fundamentals,” Nickolas said. “We get seduced by the latest way of communicating. Too many campaigns put their money on TV and digital, and what suffers is the old school face-to-face communication with voters.”",
        "McGrath’s style of campaigning, Nickolas believes, is crucial for Democrats in purplish districts like Kentucky’s 6th. The grievance gets people’s attention; the stuff gets their votes.",
        "“They want to know: ‘Are you going to go to Congress and represent me? Are you going to care about me?’” Nickolas said. “She leads with that: ‘We may not agree on some of the issues. But you should believe that I’m going to have your back.’”",
        "He continued: “You can be a progressive and still do well in more conservative areas, as long as those rural voters get a sense that you’ll fight for them.”"

        "Should Democrats nominate a candidate based on their record of standing up for progressive values, or their vision for the future?",
        "And should the party court white moderates to implement that vision, or expand the electorate by exciting millennials and voters of color who don’t regularly show up to the polls?",
        "Those are the questions at the heart of Tuesday’s Democratic primary for governor of Georgia.",
        "Stacey Abrams, the former Georgia House minority leader and the odds-on favorite in the race, is running on a solidly progressive platform and the premise that Democrats do not need to cater to the largely white “swing” voters who have abandoned the party in droves.",
        "Stacey Evans, a former colleague of Abrams’ in the House, is running on ever-so-slightly more moderate policies aimed at capturing just enough Republicans and independents to win. At the same time, Evans has argued that on several key bills, Abrams was too willing to compromise with Republicans, especially in a high-profile 2011 vote to cut the state’s free public college program.",
        "If elected in November, either candidate would be the first woman to govern Georgia. But Abrams’ election would be more historic: She would be the first African-American female governor in the country.",
        "A host of national liberal groups, Democratic Party leaders and donors have placed their bets with Abrams, whose voting rights work put her on the national map years ago.",
        "If, as is likely, Abrams wins the primary, Democrats will have a rare opportunity to test the theory that a candidate of color at the top of the ballot and a turnout-the-base strategy can win in challenging territory. She would face an uphill climb, most likely against one of three deeply conservative Republicans: Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle, Secretary of State Brian Kemp or state Sen. Michael Williams.",
        "As a result of the unique nature of Abrams’ candidacy, the national party would likely draw outsize lessons from her performance in the general election, whether that’s fair or not, according to Jeff Hauser, a veteran Democratic strategist who runs the Center for Economic and Policy Research’s Revolving Door Project.",
        "“The stakes get a little magnified unfortunately when somebody is a historic candidate,” Hauser said. “People will be reading a little too much into the results one way or another, and that’s unfortunate, because white men don’t have to face that.”",
        "The policy differences between Abrams, 44, and Evans, 40, are hard to spot. They both support raising the minimum wage, using Affordable Care Act funding to expand Medicaid and eliminating the use of cash bail.",
        "However, the contrast becomes clearer in the two candidates’ framings of their respective bids.",
        "Abrams, who founded the nonprofit New Georgia Project to register voters of color in 2014, has focused intensely on strengthening voting rights and expanding the electorate.",
        "It’s a theme that Abrams drives home in a two-and-a-half-minute video advertisement that weaves together her parents’ struggles in Jim Crow Mississippi and her own career fighting for voting rights, starting as a 19-year-old speaker at the 1993 March on Washington.",
        "“Your ability to participate in government, to improve your life, is contingent on your access to the ballot box,” Abrams states in the ad.",
        "One of Abrams’ most vocal and generous supporters is Steve Phillips, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, and author of Brown Is the New White. Phillips argues that Democrats need no longer bother trying to win the votes of increasingly conservative white voters, when diverse candidates who embrace a civil rights agenda can successfully leverage the power of “the new American majority” ― progressive whites, Latinos, Asian Americans and black voters, especially black women.",
        "Phillips is married to Susan Sandler, the daughter of two fabulously wealthy liberal donors, providing him with powerful backing to apply his political research.",
        "PowerPAC Georgia, a PAC affiliated with Phillips’ nonprofit Democracy in Color, has spent $1.5 million on voter engagement to elect Abrams.",
        "The outside cash provides Abrams an edge, even though both candidates’ campaigns had brought in about $2.3 million each as of the end of March. (Evans, who is wealthy from her work winning one of the largest Medicare fraud cases in U.S. history, self-funded most of her haul.)",
        "And from his sizable perch on Twitter, Phillips has praised high-ranking Democrats for backing Abrams ― and lambasted others, including former Vice President Joe Biden, for failing to do so.",
        "Biden aside, Abrams has rallied a truly impressive array of support from national Democratic Party leaders for her bid ranging from Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) both of whom have stumped for her, to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Our Revolution, the progressive group that emerged out of his campaign. Abrams held a get-out-the-vote rally in Atlanta on Saturday where Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, and Valerie Jarrett, a former top adviser to then-President Barack Obama, both spoke.",
        "Abrams’ supporters tend to speak about their enthusiasm for her in terms of the historic nature of her candidacy and the power it has to reshape politics in an increasingly purple state that is about one-third black.",
        "“What is truly radical about Abrams’ campaign is that she is running to the left to grow the base,” said khalid kamau, a South Fulton city councilman who won his April 2017 race with the help of Our Revolution and the Democratic Socialists of America. (In accordance with the Yoruban African tradition, kamau spells his name with lowercase letters.)",
        "“It will transform the state,” he added. “I don’t understand how anybody who lived through Barack Obama could not see that.”",
        "For her part, Evans is wagering that the story of her rise from a childhood of rural poverty, and her subsequent fight to protect the HOPE scholarship have the power to both excite Democratic base voters as well as some moderates who don’t always back the party.",
        "It is a more traditional playbook embodied by former Gov. Roy Barnes, one of Evans’ most prominent backers and the last Democrat to occupy the governor’s mansion in Georgia.",
        "The watchword of Evans’ campaign is “hope,” which she employs liberally to describe both her overall mission for the state, and her commitment to HOPE, the free college program that secured her a place in the middle class.",
        "The program is also the greatest point of contention between Abrams and Evans ― a symbol of what Evans claims is Abrams’ shallow commitment to the policies she professes to champion. In 2011, with the program facing a shortfall, Abrams voted for a bill signed by Republican Gov. Nathan Deal that dramatically scaled back the program.",
        "Abrams argues that with a small minority in the legislature, her participation was essential to limiting the scope of the damage and ensuring that Deal held state pre-K funding harmless. But Evans and many state Senate Democrats thought that Democratic leaders could have held out for a better deal, and to some extent, that no deal at all was better than giving Republicans bipartisan cover for the legislation.",
        "In a 30-second ad narrated by a college-bound black woman, Evans highlighted the disproportionate impact of the HOPE cuts on the state’s African-American residents, citing a statistic that 97 percent of African-American residents lost access to full scholarships as a result of the 2011 law’s higher grade and SAT requirements.",
        "“As governor, I’ll fully restore HOPE scholarships ― for all our kids,” Evans concludes at the end of the ad.",
        "Abrams, by contrast, has proposed something she calls “HOPE 2.0” that would make the program more needs-based, rather than merit-based.",
        "Evans has also attacked Abrams for failing to disclose to her colleagues that her small business was the recipient of a state contract while she was negotiating with Deal. Abrams, who disclosed her ties to the company on official disclosure forms, maintains that her conduct has both legal and ethical, since she walled herself off from the company’s dealings with the state government.",
        "In addition, Abrams has elicited scrutiny for a host of other votes, from a Republican-led gerrymandering bill about which she claims to have been misled, to legislation scaling back early voting, which she says provided financial relief to rural communities without restricting access to the ballot box.",
        "The plausibility of Abrams’ explanations notwithstanding, her controversial record as a House Democratic leader has won her her fair share of critics, among whom are many of the state’s current and former African-American elected officials.",
        "Abrams critics who have endorsed Evans include former state Senate minority whip Vincent Fort, and current state Reps. Ronnie Mabra, Dar’Shun Kendrick and Keisha Waites.",
        "Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms (D) has not formally endorsed Evans, but she donated $1,000 through her campaign fund to the candidate.",
        "Evans has her own share of less-than-progressive votes, including support for a bill making it easier for the state to take over troubled schools, and legislation that would have eased regulations on debt settlement companies that serve low-income borrowers. (The former became law; the latter went nowhere.)",
        "But Evans does not portray herself as the most progressive candidate in the race, making her voting seem less out of step with her image. If she defies the odds and beats Abrams, it may be due to a sense among some voters that Abrams’ campaign-trail rhetoric simply doesn’t match her record.",
        "“Abrams wanted to work both sides of the aisle and on some issues you just cannot do that,” said Isaac Hayes III, an Atlanta-based songwriter backing Evans."

        "On Capitol Hill on Tuesday, party leaders joined teachers’ union officials to promote a slate of policies aimed at addressing the growing number of teacher walkouts that have shaken up statehouses across the country. The measure would steer $100 billion in federal funds toward schools and ensure that teachers could bargain collectively on salaries, benefits and working conditions.",
        "“We’re here because teachers are marching on state Capitols across the country,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). “Teachers of America, the Democrats hear you loud and clear.”",
        "Democrats said their plan would pay for those investments by paring back some of the tax cuts for the wealthy in the Republican tax package passed by Congress last year and signed by President Donald Trump. Parts of the plan were introduced last year as the Democratic Party’s new “Better Deal” agenda, which is heavy on antitrust and labor law reform.",
        "The leaders didn’t specify which parts of the Republican tax plan they would target for repeal, referring only to tax breaks for the rich and special-interest loopholes. At the heart of the Republican plan was a massive corporate tax cut. Although families in all income brackets are expected to have smaller tax bills next year, independent analysts say most of the benefits from the plan will go to the wealthy.",
        "“The very wealthiest should not have such a large tax cut,” Schumer said. “I think the odds of something like this [education proposal] passing are large in the next several years … Our day is going to come sooner than you think.”",
        "The Democrats’ plan isn’t going anywhere for now, as Republicans still hold a majority in both chambers and occupy the White House. But the education plan helps Democrats put down a marker before the midterm elections, just as the teacher walkouts have galvanized grassroots activists and spurred a backlash against Republican austerity.",
        "Most states pulled back on education funding when tax revenues fell during the Great Recession. Spending still hasn’t returned to 2008 levels in certain states, several of which went on to implement tax cuts that left even less money for schools and salaries. The teacher strikes have tended to hit states with the deepest cuts.",
        "“Republicans are fighting to slash teacher and school budgets. This is one of the dumbest things Republicans have done,” said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).",
        "The walkouts began in late February, when West Virginia teachers went on strike to protest low pay, rising health costs and poorly equipped classrooms. The successful work stoppage prompted similar walkouts and school closures in Oklahoma, Kentucky, Arizona and North Carolina, all with Republican-controlled statehouses that have cut taxes in recent years while school funding has dropped, when adjusted for inflation.",
        "The images of striking teachers and crumbling textbooks has prompted several states to increase school funding and teacher pay to varying degrees. Congressional Democrats said it still isn’t enough. Their plan would dedicate $50 billion to states to raise teacher pay and another $50 billion to states to spend on school infrastructure and curriculum.",
        "Another, less direct way the plan could boost teacher salaries is through more union contracts. The states that have seen teacher strikes and walkouts tend to have weak labor laws, in some cases even outlawing collective bargaining by public-sector workers. In West Virginia, for instance, the unions have no ability to bargain contracts and guaranteed raises with school districts, only to lobby lawmakers for higher salaries.",
        "The Democratic plan would change that by enshrining public-sector workers’ ability to bargain as a group, just like workers in the private sector, through a federal law. Such bills have been proposed in the past but never received enough votes. If Democrats succeed in passing it someday, it’s likely that conservative states would challenge it in court."

        "WASHINGTON ― The Hillary Clinton email controversy received an enormous amount of coverage during the 2016 presidential election, dogging the former secretary of state’s campaign for months amid allegations from Republicans that she broke laws and put national security at risk.",
        "The apparent lack of security concerning President Donald Trump’s communications, meanwhile, hardly got any attention on Capitol Hill this week.",
        "“I haven’t heard any discussion about it,” Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said Tuesday.",
        "Trump has been using a cellphone not equipped with top security features and has rejected repeated attempts by his staff to harden his devices against hackers, Politico reported Monday. The president reportedly uses two cellphones: one dedicated for his frequent Twitter use and another to make calls. The latter has a camera and microphone — features that security experts warn can be exploited by hackers.",
        "According to the report, the GPS location trackers on both of Trump’s devices have been deactivated. But he has reportedly gone for as long as five months without getting his Twitter phone checked by security experts, posing additional risks of hacking.",
        "The significance of compromised presidential communications could be enormous. Trump often uses his cellphone to speak with friends, advisers, former business partners and lawmakers about the Russia investigation and sensitive issues like negotiations with North Korea. His reluctance to secure his personal communications could have already exposed him to domestic or foreign surveillance efforts.",
        "Most Republicans who spoke to HuffPost about Trump’s phone use on Tuesday said they were not aware of or had not yet read a Politico report concerning his cellphones. Some, like Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), acknowledged that secure phone lines are “something you need to be concerned about.”",

        "He added that, as a rule, he doesn’t discuss matters over the phone “that I didn’t think I wanted people to hear.” But when asked by HuffPost if he was concerned about the possibility that the president discusses sensitive matters on an unsecured phone line, Manchin said, “I hope he doesn’t.”",
        "Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a member of the foreign relations committee, said he found the lack of security of Trump’s cellphones “incredibly concerning.” Murphy succinctly summed up, however, why it barely registered in Trump’s Washington, where a new scandal or feud seems to pop up every day ― developments that may have consumed weeks in past administrations.",
        "“It’s somewhere in the middle of a list of a hundred things I worry about on a daily basis,” Murphy said."

    "articleContent": [
        "WASHINGTON ― Congress sent a bill to President Donald Trump’s desk Tuesday intended to roll back regulations adopted after the 2008 financial crisis, weakening consumer protection and modestly increasing the risk of another banking collapse.",
        "The bill’s passage marks the second major legislative victory for both Trump and the financial sector, following last year’s tax cut. The package will benefit banks both large and small, limit consumer remedies against credit reporting agencies including the scandal-plagued Equifax, curb the government’s ability to collect data on racial discrimination in the housing market, and allow large regional banks to rely on more risky debt to finance their operations.",
        "Tuesday’s 258-159 House vote came as banks are posting record profits thanks to a stronger economy and lower tax rates. The U.S. banking industry posted a combined $56 billion profit in the first quarter of 2018, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, its best three-month stint in history. Community banks ― smaller institutions in rural parts of the country that proponents of the bill claimed were in need of particular aid ― also posted billions in net profits.",
        "Nevertheless, banks still need deregulation, Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) said.",
        "“Big banks keep getting bigger,” Cole told HuffPost on Tuesday. “Small banks are being regulated out of existence.”",
        "With Republicans in control of the House, the bill’s eventual approval was a fait accompli after 17 Senate Democrats voted for it in March.",
        "The 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law included a host of consumer protections and risk management rules that apply to all banks. But it applied tougher rules to the largest banks, since the failure of a large firm can have dire consequences for the broader economy. Banks with at least $50 billion in assets have to undergo frequent stress-testing by the Federal Reserve to determine whether they could withstand an unexpected financial shock. They must finance their operations with more capital and less borrowed money, and they have to keep more cash on hand.",
        "The bill approved Tuesday would change the definition of what constitutes the biggest banks, freeing banks with up to $250 billion in assets from these tougher rules. Huge regional players like BB&T and SunTrust would be exempted, as would foreign conglomerates with trillions of dollars in global assets ― like Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse and UBS ― that keep less than $250 billion of their assets in the United States.",
        "“Clearly the distress or failure of some of these banks could trigger reactions spreading broadly to the financial system,” former Federal Reserve Chair Paul Volcker wrote in a letter to Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), who voted against the legislation. Volcker in particular highlighted the risks posed by curtailing oversight of “several large foreign banks,” suggesting that a $100 billion threshold would be more appropriate.",
        "When the Congressional Budget Office analyzed the legislation in March, it concluded that while the risk of another banking crash in any specific year was small, the odds “would be slightly greater under the legislation.”",
        "The risk would be worth making it easier for small and intermediate-sized banks to provide credit, Rep. Frank Lucas (R-Okla.), a senior member of the House financial services committee, said Tuesday. “Everything in life is a balancing act.”",
        "Banking analysts also expect large regional banks to acquire more small community lenders as a result of the bill, since they will not be penalized with tougher regulations for growing past the $50 billion mark.",
        "The subprime mortgage crisis revealed that banks had systematically steered families of color into expensive, predatory loans. Dodd-Frank sought to address this in part by requiring lenders to report a host of data to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. In addition to basic facts about loan approval or denial, lenders had to report a borrower’s age and credit score, as well as the property value of the home being purchased, the interest rate, loan terms, and other pricing features of each mortgage. The CFPB could use all of this data to determine whether families of color were being improperly overcharged or pushed into bad loans.",
        "The bill approved Tuesday would exempt 85 percent of banks from those new anti-discrimination reporting requirements, in an effort to save paperwork costs. A host of civil rights organizations, including the NAACP, the National Fair Housing Alliance, the National Urban League and the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, have all assailed the provision.",
        "The bill also contains several provisions that are supposed to benefit consumers, such as by requiring credit monitoring firms to let people freeze their credit reports, which contain personal financial information that companies like Equifax, Experian and TransUnion collect without prior consent. Equifax proved a poor custodian of that information last year when the company announced hackers had stolen personal data relating to more than 140 million Americans.",
        "Consumer advocates say the supposed benefits are actually a mixed bag, because some provisions would preempt more generous state laws and others could prevent consumers from joining class-action lawsuits.",
        "One provision is a straightforward giveaway to Equifax and its ilk, since it would force government-backed mortgage companies to consider using their credit-scoring algorithm as part of the home lending process. Liberal and conservative groups alike, as well as other housing finance stakeholders, oppose the provision.",
        "Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.), another member of the House financial services committee, dismissed concerns about restricting consumers from being able to join class-action lawsuits, noting that they can still settle disputes by arbitration.",
        "“You’re choosing to focus on one of the credit rating agencies,” he told HuffPost when asked how the bill would affect Equifax. “I think that goes far beyond the very narrow focus that you’re taking on it. Consumers should always have remedies for bad actors, always.”"

        "A Virginia federal court on Tuesday denied a motion to dismiss the case of transgender teen Gavin Grimm, whose fight to use the school bathroom that aligned with his gender identity became a focal point in the trans rights movement.",
        "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia denied the Gloucester County School Board’s motion to dismiss Grimm’s case and maintained that transgender students are protected under Title IX and the Constitution from exclusionary bathroom policies based on their gender identity.",
        "“I feel an incredible sense of relief,” Grimm, 19, said in a statement. “After fighting this policy since I was 15 years old, I finally have a court decision saying that what the Gloucester County School Board did to me was wrong and it was against the law. I was determined not to give up because I didn’t want any other student to have to suffer the same experience that I had to go through.”",
        "Grimm’s fight began in 2014 when, as a sophomore at Gloucester High School, he was prohibited from using the boys’ bathroom and instructed to only use a unisex restroom.",
        "The American Civil Liberties Union filed a civil rights lawsuit against the school district on behalf of Grimm, thrusting the formerly shy teen into the spotlight as the new face of trans activism. On Tuesday, the court affirmed the teen’s fight by denying the school board’s motion to dismiss the case. It also directed the parties to schedule a settlement conference within 30 days.",
        "U.S. District Judge Arenda Wright Allen wrote that the board’s policy fails to acknowledge there are individuals who possess both male and female characteristics. “As Mr. Grimm contends, attempting to draw lines based on physiological and anatomical characteristics proves unmanageable: how would the Board’s policy apply to individuals who have had genital surgery, individuals whose genitals were injured in an accident, or those with intersex traits who have genital characteristics that are neither typically male nor female?”",
        "Wright Allen is a former prosecutor and federal public defender who previously overturned Virginia’s same-sex marriage ban and was nominated to the bench by former President Barack Obama.",
        "Wright Allen wrote that there was “no doubt” that transgender individuals had historically been subjected to discrimination, noting the high rates of violence and discrimination against members of the transgender community. She said that the board’s policy was a sex-based classification because it relied on sex-based stereotypes. “The Policy classified Mr. Grimm differently on the basis of his transgender status and, accordingly, subjected him to sex stereotyping.”",
        "HuffPost spoke with Grimm in the hours following the decision. At the time the court ruling was announced, Grimm was in bed with his cat. He received a text from someone on his legal team about the ruling.",
        "Grimm said he had “no expectations” of a favorable ruling, only “hope.”",
        "“It’s something we’ve all known for a very long time, that this is illegal and unacceptable, but to finally have the court make that in plain language is really fantastic,” said Grimm.",
        "Now that he’s graduated from high school, the ruling no longer directly impacts Grimm’s daily experience. But he does have a friend who still attends his alma mater who will be affected by the court decision.",
        "“I’m really over the moon,” said Grimm, who will be going out to dinner with friends Tuesday night to celebrate.",
        "Joshua Block, an ACLU senior staff attorney, said the district court’s ruling “vindicates” Grimm and other transgender students who have felt stigmatized by their schools’ bathroom policies.",
        "“These sorts of discriminatory policies do nothing to protect privacy and only serve to harm and humiliate transgender students,” Block said in a statement.",
        "This has been updated with comment from Grimm. Rebecca Klein contributed reporting.",
        "CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article misstated Grimm’s age as 18. He is 19 years old."

        "Just under one-third of Americans believe President Donald Trump has done even somewhat well at fulfilling his promise to “drain the swamp,” a new HuffPost/YouGov survey finds.",
        "Only 8 percent of those polled believe that Trump has done very well at eliminating government corruption, while 24 percent say he’s done somewhat well, 13 percent say he’s not done very well, and 39 percent sat he hasn’t done well at all.",
        "One-quarter of respondents say that Trump is more honest than most other politicians in Washington, with 45 percent saying he’s less honest, and 16 percent that he’s close to average.",
        "Opinions are, unsurprisingly, divided along political lines, although Trump’s opponents are both more unanimous and more emphatic in their distaste for his job performance. About three-quarters of Trump voters say the president has done at least somewhat well in draining the swamp, but just 22 percent saying he’s done very well. By contrast, 81 percent of Hillary Clinton voters give Trump the lowest possible rating for his performance.",
        "(The poll was taken before a sinkhole handed the Trump administration’s opponents an on-the-nose metaphor by opening up on the North Lawn of the White House.)",
        "Across the survey, the topline results are almost unchanged since spring 2017, when 30 percent thought Trump was doing well at draining the swamp. Since then, the polling suggests, he’s neither lost the faith of his core supporters nor done much to attract new support.",
        "These findings add to the body of evidence that views of the president’s personal characteristics may be largely ― though not entirely ― baked in, mirroring his remarkably stable approval numbers.",
        "And, considerably more than a year into Trump’s tenure in the White House, the poll finds he’s still not viewed as a Washington insider by his supporters or opponents. Just 16 percent of those polled describe him as a part of the political establishment, while 61 percent say he’s more of an outsider.",
        "The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted May 16-18 among U.S. adults using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.",
        "HuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls. You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov’s nationally representative opinion polling. More details on the polls’ methodology are available here.",
        "Most surveys report a margin of error that represents some, but not all, potential survey errors. YouGov’s reports include a model-based margin of error, which rests on a specific set of statistical assumptions about the selected sample rather than the standard methodology for random probability sampling. If these assumptions are wrong, the model-based margin of error may also be inaccurate. Click here for a more detailed explanation of the model-based margin of error."

        "HANOI, Vietnam ― There was a time, a little over two years ago, when Ted Osius could imagine the smog clearing over this sprawling capital city, with its jungle canopy of ancient banyan trees and electrical wires alive with coal-fired power and its throngs of exhaust-coughing motorbikes.",
        "Osius, who abruptly resigned late last year after three years as the U.S. ambassador to Vietnam, now warns that the Trump administration’s retreat on climate change is encouraging Vietnam to dig in on coal power. Doing so would undermine years of progress in a country that, with 2,026 miles of coastline on its mainland alone, risks becoming a poster child for the effects of rising sea levels.",
        "“The United States used to play a really useful role in influencing the Vietnamese to make good clean-energy decisions,” Osius told HuffPost this month in one of his first interviews since quitting in protest over a new White House policy to deport Vietnamese refugees.",
        "“Apparently the United States government no longer focuses on policy decision-making that’s influenced by sound science,” he added. “That makes it harder to make the case to other countries that they ought to make decisions based on sound science.”",
        "Nearly a year after President Donald Trump announced plans to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accords, Vietnam has effectively become a canary in the coal mine for how closely other nations will stick to the global agreement’s goals as the U.S. abandons them.",
        "Vietnam is under pressure, attempting to balance rapidly increasing energy demands with growing concerns over climate change ― and it’s finding a generous coal-friendly patron in China.",
        "The Southeast Asian country began rapidly building up its coal-fired power capacity in 2011 as it transformed itself into a manufacturing hub and outgrew its hydropower resources. Back in its first major national plan for energy development, the country had aimed to increase its coal power generation by 75,000 megawatts by 2030.",
        "During the final years of the Obama administration, however, the U.S. urged Vietnam to pursue renewable energy and cleaner-burning natural gas instead. Vietnam enthusiastically signed onto the Paris Agreement in April 2016 and since then has received roughly $40.5 million in aid from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change’s Green Climate Fund.",
        "In response, Vietnam reduced the planned construction of new coal-fired infrastructure by 20,000 megawatts and increased renewable energy projects by 14,000 megawatts. The country already operates more than 20 coal plants with a total capacity of 13,000 megawatts, accounting for one-third of the national power mix, according to a March report from Vietnam Investment Review.",
        "The U.S. wasn’t the only clean-energy influence. The government faced internal pressure to shift away from coal. Last month, Khanh Ngụy Thị, founder of the Vietnamese nonprofit Green Innovation and Development Centre, won the 2018 Goldman Environmental Prize, the so-called “green Oscar,” for her work convincing state agencies to increase use of renewable energy.",
        "But even after scaling back its plans, Vietnam was still set to triple the number of coal plants by 2030, increasing capacity to more than 55,000 megawatts. Coal power would comprise 42.6 percent of electrical production.",
        "Now, energy and environment experts worry that the country’s next national power development plan, which is being written this year, could hold to those figures or, worse, embrace a more aggressive coal strategy.",
        "The Trump administration has offered some positive language to those pushing for clean energy. In a joint statement issued with Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc last May, the White House “affirmed its assistance to Vietnam in combating climate change via concrete mitigation and adaptation measures.” The administration repeated a similar line in November, after a meeting with Vietnamese President Trần Đại Quang. The U.S. Agency for International Development is continuing to fund projects in the Mekong and Red River deltas.",
        "But perhaps more significantly, the White House has proposed slashing the USAID budget by 33 percent.",
        "“Apparently there have been some fluctuations in funding from one year to the next,” a USAID spokesman said in an email, noting that the delta projects have continued so far. He did not respond to questions about the funding for those individual programs, and they were not itemized on the State Department’s budget justification in February.",
        "President Trump has pushed to scale back regulations on coal in the U.S. and made pitching the fuel a top priority at the annual United Nations climate conference. In one of his first moves as president, he pulled the U.S. out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a multi-nation trade deal that, despite drawing criticism from environmental groups, was expected to drive down the costs of renewable energy in developing countries. Last June, he announced plans to withdraw from the Paris accord and curtailed all U.S. payments to the Green Climate Fund. This year, he named a new secretary of state: Mike Pompeo, a vigorous climate change denier who, as a congressman, made repeated attempts to cripple funding for renewable energy projects.",
        "In short, the Trump administration seems unlikely to apply any real pressure on other countries to pursue clean energy or combat climate change.",
        "“When we stopped leading on climate change, that made it a heck of a lot easier for people to proceed with business-as-usual policies,” Osius said.",
        "For Vietnam, that means modeling itself on China, the world’s biggest source of climate-altering pollution. Vietnam’s ruling Communist Party transformed the country into one of the continent’s fastest-growing economies by following in China’s footsteps, becoming a magnet for textile, chemical and electronics manufacturing as its giant neighbor increased wages and environmental regulations.",
        "Mechanisms like the Green Climate Fund were meant to help countries such as Vietnam leapfrog the most pollution-prone stage of economic development by building up wind, solar and energy efficient infrastructure instead of coal-fired power plants ― something China did not do.",
        "“We are supposed to be the big counterweight to China,” said Virginia B. Foote, chief executive of Bay Global Strategies, an energy-focused government relations consultancy based in Hanoi. Now Vietnam is “just going to listen to the big bully to the north, and there’s no counter-bully to listen to at all.”",
        "Vietnam’s energy needs are growing. The country’s industrial south suffers frequent power outages, relying on a grid so fragile that a crane operator’s accident plunged 22 of 63 provinces into darkness for 10 hours in May 2013. Vietnam’s state-owned utility, EVN, began burning more diesel to meet the country’s energy needs last year and said it would likely increase use of the fuel from 2018 to 2019.",
        "Despite this, the Vietnamese enjoy low energy costs, particularly in the north, where most of the country’s coal mining takes place. The average price of electricity comes to about 7.5 cents per kilowatt-hour ― far below even that in Louisiana, the cheapest state in the U.S., where residents pay nearly 9 cents per kilowatt-hour, according to the latest Energy Information Administration figures.",
        "“Politically, it’s understandable,” Foote said. “Everybody loves having cheap power, though it leads to waste and lack of incorporating clean technology.”",
        "The prices in Vietnam fail to factor in the steep societal costs of increased coal burning. A 2015 Harvard University study found that 4,300 Vietnamese die prematurely each year as a result of coal pollution ― a figure that could increase to as much as 25,000 per year under a more aggressive coal buildup.",
        "The state-owned utility operates as a nationwide monopoly, forcing proposals on electricity development to navigate a labyrinthine bureaucracy. The current low rates make any tweaks to the existing model a difficult sell. The template that EVN released last year for power purchase agreements on renewable energy was panned by investors as “unbankable,” meaning it posed too much risk to private companies.",
        "“[F]ew reputable financiers would be likely to sign up,” Giles Cooper, co-general director of the Ho Chi Minh City-based law office Duane Morris Vietnam, wrote in a blog post in October, concluding that the “final text does little to inspire confidence.”",
        "Officials at the Vietnamese Embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment.",
        "Vietnam has, however, found a steady stream of suitors to finance its coal infrastructure. As of last December, foreign investors funded new Vietnamese coal projects to the tune of more than $16 billion. Of that, Chinese investments, funneled through that country’s biggest state-owned commercial banks, made up 50 percent, followed by Japan’s 23 percent and South Korea’s 18 percent. Vnesheconombank, a Russian financial entity, is backing the controversial Long Phu 1 power plant under construction in Soc Trang Province.",
        "In February, PetroVietnam, the state-owned Vietnamese company building the Long Phu 1 plant, withdrew its application for U.S. financial support, ending what was widely seen as the first major test of whether the Trump administration would use the Export-Import Bank of the United States to support a project that exacerbated climate change.",
        "Hanoi enjoyed just 38 days of clean air last year as air pollution surged to levels four times higher than those deemed acceptable under World Health Association guidelines, according to a January report from the Green Innovation and Development Centre. That makes Hanoi’s pollution worse than that of the Indonesian capital of Jakarta and puts it close to notoriously smog-choked Beijing.",
        "“Now, when it comes to climate, our government’s head is in the sand,” Osius said. “That means countries are going to have to fend for themselves a lot more.”"

        "A star was born at the royal wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.",
        "Bishop Michael Curry, who presides over the Episcopal Church, preached a lively, powerful sermon about love at the ceremony in England on Saturday that resonated with people around the world. Since then, the preacher has been parodied on “Saturday Night Live.” He’s been stopped for selfies, invited to chat on morning news shows, and his sermon has been reprinted in its entirety on the websites of secular news media.",
        "Aside from all the publicity, the bishop claims the gravitas of the historic moment was not lost on him ― the fact that a black American preacher, a descendant of slaves, was chosen to preach to British royalty, descendants of a monarchy that left a bitter legacy of colonialism, segregation and disenfranchisement for people of color throughout much of the globe.",
        "Appearing on ABC’s “Good Morning America” on Tuesday, Curry suggested that only love could have accomplished such a feat.",
        "“The reality is, the love between those two people, between that royal couple, was so powerful, not only did we all show up, but it brought all these different worlds together,” he said. “It brought different nationalities, different ethnicities, different religious traditions, people of all stripes and types, people of different political persuasions. ... For a moment we were actually together, organized around love.”",
        "“Their love was a sign of God’s love and what that love can do in our lives,” he continued. “It brought together our African heritage, our British heritage, our American heritage.”",
        "Curry made a splash during the royal wedding, quoting Martin Luther King Jr., gesturing enthusiastically to his listerners and referring to hymns sung by black slaves in captivity.",
        "Curry on Tuesday also was on NBC’s “Today” show, and host Craig Melvin asked him if he was concerned whether his fiery, energetic preaching style would not be well received at the royal wedding. Some members of the royal family could be seen on camera smiling and chuckling while listening to the bishop’s sermon.",
        "“I didn’t know [if it would play well],” Curry said. “But I knew they had asked me to come, and that’s me. So I showed up. ”",
        "Curry, a Chicago native, is the first black leader of the Episcopal Church, an American denomination that is part of the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Queen of England is the supreme governor of another member denomination, the Church of England ― making Curry a logical, if unconventional, choice to deliver a sermon at the wedding of an American actress and the British prince.",
        "The selection of Curry was particularly significant because it came during a time when the American church is at loggerheads with the wider Anglican Communion over LGBTQ Christians. The Episcopal Church embraced same-sex marriage in 2015, departing from the conservative stance taken by other Anglican churches.",
        "The 65-year-old bishop said that the royal couple, now known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, were the ones who chose him to preach at their wedding. They reportedly consulted with the symbolic head of the Anglican Communion, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby.",
        "When an Episcopal Church staff member first told Curry about the news, he said during his “Good Morning America” interview that he genuinely couldn’t believe it.",
        "“I said, ‘Get out of here, it’s April Fools. You got to be kidding me.’”",
        "Curry said he had to keep the honor a secret ― even from his wife ― for almost two months.",
        "The bishop admitted he was nervous on the day of the wedding. But once he started preaching, he said it felt like the historic St. George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle had turned into a regular church ― and that he was just speaking to a young couple in love.",
        "“They are so passionately in love with each other you could see it,” he said on “Today.” “You could actually see when they looked at each other that their love was in that moment reorienting the world.”",
        "Rev. Jon White, the director of the news and commentary site Episcopal Café, told HuffPost he was thrilled when he learned Curry was going to be part of the service. He said reactions to the sermon have been overwhelmingly positive in his own church and among Episcopalians online.",
        "“He is an impassioned and inspiring preacher and I was gleeful awaiting his sermon at what many expected to be a stuffy and formal ritual,” White wrote in an email. “He did not disappoint.”",
        "White said that in much of the developed world, Christianity is often portrayed as being filled with “mean-spiritedness,” “exclusion, abuse, and corruption.” But in the middle of the pageantry of the royal wedding, Curry portrayed a faith that was simple, authentic, and real, he said.",
        "“I think what has captured people’s attention is the authenticity of Bishop Curry and the earnestness with which he delivered the message of the power of God’s love,” White said."

        "His cousin, 22-year-old Aaron Salazar, is hospitalized in Reno, Nevada, where he’s in a coma.",
        "“He has brain injuries, a broken pelvis and a mysterious burn on his crotch,” Sailas said. “It all depends on him now. He’s young, he’s strong and he’s been fighting to wake up, so there’s hope.”",
        "Salazar, an economics major at Portland State University, was on an Amtrak train on May 15, traveling from Colorado to Portland. His last known communication, according to his cousin, was a text message to his great-grandmother at about 11 a.m.",
        "“He told her, ‘I have another layover in Sacramento, but right now I’m going to go get some food and explore with this friend I met on the train,’” Sailas said. “That was the last anyone heard from him.”",
        "Less than an hour later, railroad workers found an incapacitated Salazar lying beside the Union Pacific Railroad tracks in Truckee, California. His injuries were so severe that responding paramedics had him airlifted to Renown Regional Medical & Trauma Center in Nevada.",
        "Sailas said doctors at the hospital told the family his cousin’s injuries are consistent with a beating.",
        "“We believe that he was attacked by this person that he’d met on the train,” Sailas said.",
        "Because Salazar was found on property belonging to Amtrak, the investigation is being spearheaded by the Amtrak Police Department. Calls for comment to the investigative agency were not returned on Tuesday. However, a spokesperson for the department sent an email to HuffPost indicating that they are in touch with the family and that investigators have found “nothing to suggest criminal intent.”",
        "Sailas said investigators haven’t been forthcoming with information and have yet to examine Salazar’s cellphone or laptop for potential clues.",
        "“They’ve been shady about the whole investigative process,” Sailas said. “They won’t even tell us where he was found, other than it is private property. They’re just saying that they’re looking into the idea that he jumped from a moving train.”",

        "Caitlyn Jenner may have been an outspoken supporter of President Donald Trump since the early days of the 2016 election, but that doesn’t mean she’s thrilled with the way things have been going since then.",
        "In a Broadly profile published Tuesday, the transgender icon and former Olympian discussed her conservative politics and said Trump “has been, for all LGBT issues, the worst president we have ever had.” She also suggested she may not support his 2020 re-election campaign.",
        "“I want him to know politically I am disappointed, obviously,” Jenner said, pointing specifically to Trump’s rolling back of trans rights. “I don’t want our community to go backwards. Just leave us alone, that’s all we want.”",
        "Jenner’s Republican views have, of course, put her at odds with other LGBTQ people for some time. She’s met with U.S. Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, and says she believes the LGBTQ community stands to benefit from her decision to maintain a strong relationship with members of Trump’s Cabinet.",
        "“I think it’s good that I’m on the Republican side because the Republicans know that, and I have an immediate in with them to change their minds,” Jenner said.",
        "“The Republicans need the most work when it comes to our issues, I get that,” she added. “I would rather work from the inside. I’m not the type of person who is going to stand on a street corner with a sign and jump up and down. No, I’m going to go have dinner with these people.”",
        "Jenner said she’s also had “a great conversation” with Vice President Mike Pence, who has an established history of supporting anti-LGBTQ legislation.",
        "“He’s kinda like, from our standpoint, the real enemy. But that’s OK, I can handle that,” Jenner said. The vice president told her he “would love” to have a lengthier discussion down the line, she said.",
        "In the nearly year and a half since Trump’s inauguration, Jenner has appeared critical of the administration’s policies in interviews and on social media.",
        "She told Newsweek in March that she’d “built some very nice and good relationships with the Republican Party” but had not spoken with Trump himself.",

        "A cake celebrating a South Carolina teen’s high school graduation turned into a not-so-sweet surprise when a Publix supermarket censored the inscription “summa cum laude.”",
        "The grad’s mom, Cara Koscinski, said she ordered a cake online from her local Publix for a graduation party for her 18-year-old son, Jacob. The store allows customers to customize cake orders with a personalized inscription.",
        "Koscinski said she ordered a cake the the words: “Congrats Jacob! Summa Cum Laude Class of 2018.”",
        "Instead, supermarket bakers wrote: “Congrats Jacob! Summa - - - Laude Class of 2018.”",
        "Incredulous, Koscinski shared pictures of the censored cake on Facebook. “I seriously couldn’t make this crap up!!!!” she wrote. “Funny ― not funny.”",
        "The Washington Post, which did a deeper dive on the Publix website, reported that the online box where customers enter cake inscriptions is extremely temperamental, and filters “profane/special characters.” “Cum,” despite its use as a preposition meaning “with” in the Latin phrase summa cum laude ― “with the highest distinction” ― was rendered profane.",
        "Koscinski told the newspaper that she “explained that Summa Cum Laude was a Latin term for high academic honor and was not profane” in the “special instructions” box on the Publix website, and included a link that defined the phrase.",
        "She said she was busy with party preparations and didn’t notice the cake’s messed up message until it was time for dessert. The dashed-out message, she said, was humiliating for her teenage son.",
        "“It was unbelievable. I ordered the special graduation edition cake. I can’t believe I’m the first one to ever write ‘Summa Cum Laude’ on a cake,” Koscinski told the Post.",
        "Publix offered to make another cake, but Koscinski said she declined because Jacob would “only graduate once.” She said the store refunded $70 for the cake and gave her a store gift card.",
        "Koscinski told HuffPost that she and her son “think it’s overwhelming and crazy.”",
        "“But we are laughing about it,” she said, adding that she’ll “probably avoid” Publix “for now.”",
        "Publix told HuffPost in a statement that satisfying customers is the “top priority” of the chain, which has locations in the Southeast.",
        "“You can feel confident that this situation has been addressed, and the appropriate business areas and leaders are involved,” the statement said.",
        "HuffPost spoke to Jeanne Neumann, a professor in the classics department at Davidson College, who shared this saucy tidbit about cakes and Latin over email: “A cake celebrating the end of a war of a simpler time might have proclaimed Gladii Omnes in vaginas recondantur! (May all swords be sheathed! (or) All swords should be put in their sheaths).” Neumann noted that “vagina” in Latin means “sheath for a sword.”",
        "That might have passed the Publix censors, but what about words that might not have?",
        "“The commands ‘tell me’ (dic) and ‘do it’ (fac) sound a bit like ‘dick’ and ‘fuck’ when pronounced. Just a bit, but enough to get students laughing,” said Neumann.",
        "This article has been updated to include a statement from Publix and comment from Neumann."

        "A federal judge gave Texas 45 days to implement a new process for taking voter registrations and changing registration information when residents use a state online information portal, after ruling the state’s current practice was illegal.",
        "U.S. District Judge Orlando Garcia on Friday ordered Texas to change its online process by July 2 so that people can simply check a box online indicating that they wish to register or update their voter registration when they use the Texas Department of Public Safety’s online portal to renew their driver’s license or change their address. The order came as part of a lawsuit brought on behalf of four Texas voters whose voter registration information was not updated when they went online to update the address on their driver’s licenses.",
        "If someone wanted to register or update their voter registration, the state required they print out, sign and mail in a separate form. Texas officials argued that state law required any voter application to be signed, but the challengers said that the state’s practice violated the 1993 National Voter Registration Act, which requires state motor vehicle agencies to offer people the opportunity to register to vote and to use the information in a driver’s license application simultaneously as a voter registration document if they want to register.",
        "From 2013 to 2015, over 1,800 people complained they were unable to register to vote when updating their information online. There are over 15 million registered voters in the state.",
        "Garcia sided with the challengers and permanently blocked Texas from continuing its current practice for online driver’s license renewals or changes of address. Lawyers for Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) said in a court filing Monday they were appealing Garcia’s order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit. They asked Garcia to pause his order while the appeals court considered their request.",
        "Beth Stevens, the voting rights director at the Texas Civil Rights Project, which brought the suit on behalf of the plaintiffs, praised Garcia’s decision.",
        "“It’s long past time for the State to stop wasting time and resources defending its unlawful violation of this pivotal voting rights law,” Stevens said in a statement. “We urge State officials to come to the table and work with us to implement the court’s plan which will ensure that not one single voter loses their opportunity to vote.”",
        "Garcia also gave the state two weeks to submit a proposed educational campaign using three forms of media to inform the public about the changes to the online process. He also ordered the state to provide annual updates to the Texas Civil Rights Project, including information on the number of voter registrations that resulted from online driver’s license renewals and change of address applications and the number of complaints it received about the process. He ordered the state to conduct monthly quality control tests until 2019 to ensure continued compliance with his order.",
        "Garcia first ruled in favor of the plaintiffs in April and asked the plaintiffs and Texas officials to propose remedies. State officials largely declined to offer a solution last week and objected to what the Texas Civil Rights Project proposed. In a court filing, they said it would be impossible to implement a new system in 45 days because a new vendor was taking over managing the state’s website on Sept. 1 and it would take at least 90 days to change the system. They also argued that if it intervened, the court would infringe on the authority that the U.S. Constitution gives states to regulate their elections."

The program is geared toward children and young adults and provides positivity, companionship, resources and education for those who are struggling with mental illness or are in need of a support system.",
        "Mental illness affects tens of millions of people in the United States each year, yet only half receive treatment, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. Buddy Project’s website says the service is not a substitute for therapy or other types of mental health care, and it directs people to resources for further help.",
        "Since founding the organization as a high school student, Frost has helped more than 200,000 participants find a new friend. On the day Buddy Project launched, she used her robust social media presence to attract nearly 3,000 participants. “This was around the time when teens really began talking about mental health and found a supportive community online to talk about it,” she said.",
        "Now a student at Drexel University in Philadelphia, she is still balancing homework with her work on Buddy Project.",

        "This interview has been edited for length and clarity.",
        "How did you come up with the idea for Buddy Project? What made you think of pairing up people online?",
        "I created Buddy Project when I was 15. At the time, my best friend had been diagnosed with a mental health condition, and that was the first time I was made aware of what mental illness was. I wanted to learn more and be a good support system for her.",
        "Back then, I was also on Twitter because I had trouble making friends in school. I found a lot of people I related to online, and I found a community of friends based on my interests. I combined those two experiences and wanted to make a way for people to find a safe and loving community online. I wanted people to have a peer support system available to them and to feel accepted.",
        "How do you match up the buddies, and are there any guidelines or restrictions that you follow?",
        "Buddies are paired based on one of five interests that they choose on a sign-up form. I take their age into account and try to keep it so that there’s not more than a three-to-four-year age difference between buddies. Our main demographic is those ages 13 to 21. In the past couple of years, our 21-plus demographic has grown quite a bit.",
        "Buddies can communicate through Twitter or Instagram. Some buddies have then exchanged numbers, met in person or used video chat. It’s really up to the discretion of the buddies as to how far they want to take their friendship. We don’t really tell people how often they have to talk to their buddies. It’s really whatever their own comfort zone is.",
        "A lot of our pairings have been very successful, and some buddies have met in person, gone to events together or spent a few days together.\n",
        "When you started Buddy Project, did you ever anticipate that it would become what it is now?",
        "When I launched Buddy Project, I was in the ninth grade and only had free time after school. I intended it to be something I did on the side. I didn’t really think that many people would be interested in it. On the first day, 3,000 people signed up. I realized then that this was not something I was just going to do on the side.",
        "How has Buddy Project changed since you started? Are you still focused solely on making these online connections?",
        "Buddy Project started out by just raising awareness for mental health on social media. Then we became a nonprofit, and since 2015 we’ve been trying to fundraise to help pay for others’ mental health treatments too. We’ve mainly focused on raising money for residents in our hometown of southeastern Pennsylvania, but we want to expand and offer help throughout the United States.",
        "Mental health care is not always accessible or affordable, and that needs to be talked about. Even if the stigma surrounding mental illness becomes decreased, the cost of treatment is still a problem. Without help, there are some people who won’t be able to receive the proper care.",
        "You started Buddy Project when you were still relatively young. Have you learned anything along the way or experienced any unexpected hardships?",
        "One of the biggest social barriers I had to jump over was that people didn’t view me seriously because I was a 15-year-old girl, and even now, I’m still a young woman. Sometimes it’s frustrating because people don’t think what I do is needed or that I’m not professional because of my age. Most people are blown away that a 20-year-old girl is running this and are pleasantly surprised that it’s one person doing this and not a whole team. I’m just lucky that I’ve found a support system that has been able to help my mom and me with the project.",

        "Researchers postulate that a peculiar asteroid spotted near Jupiter is a permanent guest from a completely different solar system.",
        "In an article published Monday in the U.K.’s Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, the researchers say their studies indicate that asteroid 2015 BZ509 (nicknamed BZ) is actually an “interstellar immigrant” that has been circling the sun ever since our solar system formed about 4.5 billion years ago.",
        "One of the researchers, Fathi Namouni of France’s Côte d’Azur Observatory, told HuffPost that would make the discovery the first of its kind.",
        "“There is no other asteroid in the solar system that moves around the sun and is known to have been born outside the solar system,” he wrote in an email.",
        "BZ was discovered in 2014, according to The New York Times. The asteroid, a little less than two miles wide, is located near Jupiter and circles the sun every 11.6 years.",
        "Scientists noticed that BZ has an unusual orbit. Instead of circling around the sun in the same direction as Jupiter, BZ has a retrograde orbit, meaning it circles the sun in the opposite direction.",
        "Namouni and the co-author of Monday’s article, Helena Morais of Brazil’s Universidade Estadual Paulista, were curious about why the asteroid moved in this unusual way. Using a time machine-like simulation, they recreated BZ’s possible movements over the past 4.5 billion years using their knowledge of the asteroid’s current orbit.",
        "“Surprisingly we found going back 4.5 billion years in the past, that the asteroid was moving exactly where it is now,” Namouni wrote. “But at 4.5 billion years in the past, all solar system objects, planets, asteroids and comets moved exactly in the same direction around the sun. This tells us that the asteroid was not born in the solar system but captured from outside it.”",
        "Other astrophysicists have come up with alternate explanations for BZ’s retrograde orbit and suggested, for example, that the object could have come from the Oort Cloud, an icy mass of debris that some astronomers propose exists near the outer reaches of the solar system. Others say BZ could have come from Planet Nine, a hypothetical, hidden planet that some claim could lie beyond the dwarf planet Pluto.",
        "Regardless, Namouni believes BZ holds a wealth of information for scientists. Its relative proximity to Earth means scientists could analyze an object potentially from an alien solar system without needing to leave our own. Namouni said a robotic mission to BZ is “perfectly possible” with current technology.",
        "Analyzing the asteroid’s chemical composition could help scientists understand how our own solar system formed ― and even provide insights into the origin of life. For example, if scientists discover that BZ contains water, it could signal that interstellar asteroids can deliver water to Earth and “hence indirectly contribute to the appearance of life,” Namouni wrote."

        "In what’s been characterized as the most progressive remarks ever uttered by a modern pontiff about homosexuality, Pope Francis reportedly told a gay man during a recent conversation at the Vatican that “God made you like that and he loves you like that.”",
        "Juan Carlos Cruz, a survivor of clerical sexual abuse, said Francis made the comments to him when they met for a private discussion last month to discuss the sex abuse and cover-up scandal involving Catholic priests in Cruz’s native Chile.",
        "“He told me, ‘Juan Carlos, the fact that you’re gay doesn’t matter. God made you like that, and he loves you like that, and I don’t care,’” Cruz told Spanish newspaper El Pais, recalling his two-and-half-hour conversation with the pontiff.",
        "Cruz, who was abused as a child by the Rev. Fernando Karadima, Chile’s most notorious pedophile priest, told the paper that his sexual orientation came up during the discussion because he has been targeted for being gay after speaking out about his abuse.",
        "“They had told [Francis] that I was practically a pervert. I explained that I’m not the reincarnation of San Luis Gonzaga, but I am not a bad person, I try to not harm anyone,” Cruz told El Pais.",
        "Francis responded, Cruz said, by telling him, “The pope loves you [as you are], you have to be happy with who you are.”",
        "A representative at the Vatican declined to confirm or deny the pontiff’s remarks, telling The Los Angeles Times, “We don’t normally comment on the pope’s private conversations.”",
        "Francis has spoken with compassion about homosexuality, though his comments have not led to any real change in the church’s longstanding position on homosexuality.",
        "“If someone is gay and is searching for the Lord and has good will, then who am I to judge him?” Francis famously said in 2013. Later that year, he suggested in an interview that God does not “reject and condemn” gay people.",
        "The LA Times described Francis’ reported comments to Cruz as expressing a possibly “new level of acceptance of homosexuality” for the Catholic Church.",
        "“This is a big deal, I cannot remember the pope making a comment about gay people being born that way,” the Rev. James Martin, an American priest who has advocated for bridging the divide between the church and the LGBTQ community, told the Times this week.",
        "“Pope Francis has repeated what all reputable biologists and psychologists say — you don’t choose your sexual orientation. And that is a great comfort to many gay and lesbian Catholics who have been told by priests that they have chosen their orientation and are therefore guilty,” Martin continued.",
        "Observers have warned against hyping the pontiff’s comments, however, as they were uttered in private and don’t represent a shift in church teaching.",
        "The Catholic Church’s catechism, which summarizes the church’s doctrinal positions, states that homosexuality’s “psychological genesis remains largely unexplained.” Homosexual acts are described as depraved and “contrary to natural law.”",
        "“Under no circumstances can they be approved,” the catechism reads.",
        "Still, experts said Francis’ reported comments suggested that church attitudes toward the LGBTQ community are shifting.",
        "“It goes beyond ‘who am I to judge?’ to ‘you are loved by God,’” Christopher Lamb, the Vatican correspondent for the Catholic newspaper Tablet, told The Guardian. “I don’t think he has changed church teaching but he’s demonstrating an affirmation of gay Catholics, something that has been missing over the years in Rome.”",

        "WASHINGTON ― Disgraced former Rep. Blake Farenthold (R-Texas) may have been hired illegally at his new job at a Texas port authority, and a local newspaper on Monday filed a lawsuit that could result in his being ejected.",
        "Farenthold, who abruptly resigned from Congress last month while under investigation for sexual harassment, announced last week that he landed a gig as a lobbyist for the Calhoun Port Authority in Port Lavaca, Texas.",
        "The problem is that the local government entity did not give public notice that it was hiring Farenthold or that it was creating a job for him that pays $160,000 a year. Under the Texas Open Meetings Act, public entities must give notice of actions being taken at upcoming meetings and allow for public comment. The port did give notice of its May 9 meeting, after which Farenthold was hired, but it used vague language about personnel matters.",
        "“They didn’t even talk about the fact that they were hiring a lobbyist, much less that it was Blake Farenthold,” said Joe Larsen, a Houston-based attorney who serves on the board of directors for the Freedom of Information Foundation of Texas. “Specificity has to match the level of public interest.”",
        "The Victoria Advocate, a local Texas newspaper, filed a lawsuit with the Calhoun County district court on Monday arguing that the port violated state law and demanding that the law be upheld.",
        "If the newspaper prevails, Farenthold will be out of a job. The port could always rehire him, but it would first have to hold a public meeting letting anyone in the community weigh in.",
        "“He is an ex-congressman, with the history he has, and his position is unprecedented,” said John Griffin, a lawyer representing the newspaper. “Those details are of high public importance.”",
        "Here is a copy of the complaint:",
        "Farenthold did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
        "A request for comment from the port authority’s attorneys was not returned. They have asked the Texas attorney general for an opinion on whether Farenthold’s hiring was illegal, though that process could take up to a year, and the attorney general’s opinion won’t matter if the court rules in favor of the paper.",
        "Chris Cobler, the editor of the Victoria Advocate, wrote an editorial on Sunday laying out the paper’s reasoning for taking legal action. He emphasized that the lawsuit isn’t about whether the port should or shouldn’t have hired Farenthold, but about open government.",
        "“This is about reminding our elected officials that they work for the public,” Cobler told HuffPost.",
        "But it is a mystery why the port authority brought on Farenthold. His job is to lobby Congress, where he has burned bridges with his former colleagues. Not only did he get sued for sexual harassment by a former aide, but he never paid back $84,000 in taxpayer money he used to settle that lawsuit ― even after publicly vowing in December to repay it immediately. Lawmakers in both parties have been badgering him for months to pay it back, including House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), to no avail.",
        "The port authority’s board of directors is meeting Thursday to decide what to do about Farenthold’s job, according to a public notice issued Monday.",
        "Griffin, who said he personally knows all the board members, couldn’t say why they hired him in the first place. But he proposed a relatively easy way for the port authority to move past the mess that has come with Farenthold.",
        "“They could discharge him,” Griffin said. “If they decide he reneged on his commitment to repay taxpayers for a settlement in a case against him and that his brand name clearly has been tarnished, that would give the port good grounds to let him go.”",
        "He added, “But that’s a question of wisdom, not legality.”"

Due out in January 2019, the book follows two teenage boys, Max and Jordan, in suburban Arizona. The sporty, confident Max may seem like an odd match for the poetic, introverted Jordan, but together, they prove chemistry can be found between total opposites.",
        "The Arizona-based Konigsberg has repeatedly incorporated LGBTQ themes into his work, including 2013′s Openly Straight and its 2017 follow-up, Honestly Ben. The Music of What Happens, he said, ups the ante considerably as a love story between two fully formed queer characters.",
        "“The first thing that comes to mind is that this book is utterly NOT about coming out. This is the story of two characters who happen to be gay, living in the suburbs of Phoenix,” he told HuffPost. “To me, that’s what we need more of now ― stories where LGBTQ characters are already out and living their lives.”",
        "That isn’t to diminish the power of coming-out stories, of course. “It’s just been done,” the 47-year-old author explains, “a lot.”",
        "The Stonewall-, GLAAD Media- and Lambda Literary Award-winning scribe said The Music of What Happens fits into a lot of forward-thinking discourse about LGBTQ people in that it “makes readers think about masculinity and femininity and balance.”",
        "“As I wrote this book, I became very aware of my own biases and beliefs in terms of masculinity and femininity, and it really helped heal some of my own internal conflicts. In the end, we’re all both,” Konigsberg said. “We all contain multitudes, and it was so cool to watch my more feminine character ― Jordan ― find his inner warrior, and my more masculine character ― Max ― lean into a vulnerability he’d never experienced before.”",

        "The parents posted our first look their new arrival on Instagram over the weekend, writing that the family is “overwhelmed with love” and “drowning in his little peeps and nuzzles.”",
        "After giving birth to Luna, Teigen jump-started a national conversation about postpartum depression by sharing her own experience with months of living in pain. At the time, she was one of few high-profile women to speak openly about the topic. Since then, others like Bryce Dallas Howard and Drew Barrymore have followed suit.",
        "“I also just didn’t think it could happen to me,” Teigen wrote then. “I have a great life. I have all the help I could need: John, my mother (who lives with us), a nanny. But postpartum does not discriminate. I couldn’t control it.”",

        "WASHINGTON ― One of Donald Trump’s lawyers said Monday that the president can’t agree to an interview with special counsel Robert Mueller’s team without first learning more about the secret FBI informant who spoke with members of the Trump campaign during the 2016 race.",
        "“We can’t let our guy go in and be questioned without knowing this,” Rudy Giuliani said in an interview with HuffPost on Monday afternoon.",
        "Giuliani, who is on Trump’s private legal team, spoke with HuffPost after Trump met with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, FBI Director Christopher Wray and Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, about congressional requests for information on the secret FBI source. The decision to set up the meeting, Giuliani said, was made by Trump and his White House lawyers without Giuliani’s involvement, although he said he supported it.",
        "“I didn’t advise against it,” Giuliani said. “He has a right as president to say to the Justice Department you have to comply with a congressional subpoena or request.”",
        "Although Giuliani said the meeting was held in Trump’s capacity as president rather than as a potential criminal target, he acknowledged that the FBI releasing information about the source would benefit Trump’s defense.",
        "“I don’t care so much about the name as I do about the content,” he said. “What prompted them to do it? What did they learn from it?”",
        "Monday’s unusual meeting with Rosenstein and Wray ― both Republicans appointed by the president ― was set up to discuss what Trump has described as the infiltration or surveillance of his 2016 campaign team. Before the election, a confidential FBI source reportedly met with associates of the campaign who were suspected of working with Russia. Trump allies on Capitol Hill have demanded information about the FBI source, a Cambridge University professor whose name was widely published over the weekend.",
        "In a statement after the meeting, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the Justice Department had asked its inspector general to look into “any irregularities ... concerning the Trump Campaign” and agreed to a meeting with congressional leaders to “review highly classified and other information they have requested.” Although Sanders said the Justice Department had requested the inspector general probe “[b]ased on the meeting with the President,” the department had actually decided to make that request after the president tweeted about the matter on Sunday. The Justice Department declined to comment.",
        "Trump has sided with his defenders on Capitol Hill who have used their oversight powers to try to undermine the Mueller investigation.",
        "It remains to be seen whether Monday’s meeting will diffuse the tensions between Trump and the Justice Department. It’s unclear what documents the department agreed to turn over to Congress.",
        "Rosenstein, a lifelong Republican whom Trump nominated to the No. 2 position in the Justice Department, has come under fire from the president’s defenders upset over the appointment of a special counsel. Trump defenders on Capitol Hill have recently been requesting more information about the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.",
        "Rosenstein, speaking earlier this month in response to a question about calls for his impeachment, said the Justice Department “will not be extorted” by threats. But when the president tweeted on Sunday that he wanted an investigation into allegations that the FBI had “infiltrated or surveilled” his campaign, Rosenstein said the department would ask its own watchdog to look into it.",
        "“If anyone did infiltrate or surveil participants in a presidential campaign for inappropriate purposes, we need to know about it and take appropriate action,” Rosenstein said in the statement.",
        "Giuliani acknowledged on Monday that he wanted to keep the names of confidential informants a secret when he was a federal prosecutor. “I always wanted to withhold their names,” he said.",
        "But in this case, he said, he cannot understand the Justice Department’s opposition to releasing the name. “First of all, the name is out there. So I don’t know what they’re fighting about,” he said.",
        "Giuliani agreed that critics who worried about GOP Rep. Devin Nunes’ ability to act as an honest broker had a valid point. Nunes, chairman of the House intelligence committee, has recently been fundraising off his defense of Trump.",
        "“Sure he’s a partisan. He’s probably outraged that the president was put in this position,” Giuliani said, but he added that Nunes’ loyalty to Trump does not give the Justice Department the right to withhold information from him.",
        "“You don’t get to choose who the members of Congress are. The people do. So you’ve got to take that risk,” Giuliani said. “Congress is certainly entitled to see this.”",

The newest part is “A Better Deal for Our Democracy,” which puts forward proposals to increase access to the ballot box, fight special interests and combat big money through campaign finance reform.",
        "The new initiative will center on both President Donald Trump’s administration and the culture in Congress that gives access to lobbyists and corporations. Trump’s Cabinet officials, including Environmental Protection Agency leader Scott Pruitt and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, have drawn a torrent of negative headlines over allegations of unethical behavior, travel practices and ties to special interests. The president’s hotel in downtown D.C., in particular, has been the subject of several lawsuits.",
        "Congress has to rein in the excesses of the executive branch, Democrats argue, and the current crop of Republican leaders aren’t going to do it.",
        "Democrats unveiled their agenda Monday during a press conference on Capitol Hill. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) were joined by other lawmakers who have been working on these issues, including Rep. John Sarbanes (D-Md.) and Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.).",
        "“President Trump has become the swamp and Americans are paying the price. The American people deserve better,” Pelosi said at the press conference, citing the Trump administration’s failure to reduce the price of prescription drugs and its repeal of numerous Obama-era regulations concerning air and water.",
        "Schumer similarly lamented that Trump had failed to take on the powerful pharmaceutical industry, which is something he promised to do while on the campaign trail.",
        "The Senate minority leader also pointed to the president’s personal attorney, Michael Cohen, as an example of how influence peddling and special interests had consumed the Trump administration. Following the 2016 election, Cohen leveraged his relationship with Trump to receive millions of dollars from companies eager for insight into his administration.",
        "“The swamp has never been more foul than under this president,” Schumer said.",
        "Democrats said they would bring accountability and transparency back to Washington by providing aggressive oversight of the Trump administration and by toughening the nation’s campaign finance laws in order to stem the flow of anonymous political spending known as dark money.",
        "This focus on corruption is a revival of the party’s successful messaging from the 2006 elections, when Democrats took control of the House and Senate from Republicans. They hammered away at the GOP’s “culture of corruption, cronyism and incompetence.”",
        "In that election cycle, the GOP was besieged by scandals amongst House members. The most famous was the Mark Foley scandal, which involved Republican congressman from Florida sending sexually explicit text messages to teenage boys.",
        "When that news broke in September 2006, Republicans knew they were doomed. But other scandals had been dripping out bit by bit in the prior months.",
        "“Choking your mistress. Touching little boys. Taking money from the Russians. Questionable business dealings,” said a GOP strategist who worked at the National Republican Congressional Committee in 2006 and requested anonymity to speak candidly. “You name it, we had it. On and on, never ended.”",
        "Pelosi has been testing out the anti-corruption message since at least April; for example, she went after Pruitt for being “a part of the Trump Administration’s culture of corruption, cronyism and incompetence.”",
        "But it remains to be seen how much of this push will actually trickle down to the districts. While Democratic candidates have been talking about the tax law and its benefits for big corporations and lobbyists, they so far have not been focusing on Trump and the problems in his administration. It’s rare to hear candidates talk about Trump in swing districts, with much more of the focus there resting on policy issues such as health care and gun control.",

        "“I brought a hat too ... a Russian hat,” she told the students on Sunday as they whooped and cheered. “If you can’t beat ’em, join ’em.”",

        "She congratulated all of the students in the room, saying, “Even the three of you who live in Michigan and didn’t request your absentee ballots in time.”",
        "Clinton also made several mentions of her searing election loss. “No, I’m still not over it,” she said. “I still think about the 2016 election, I still regret the mistakes I made.”",
        "As a human being, she added, she is coping with what happened. But as an American, she’s concerned. “We’re living through a time when fundamental rights, civic virtue, freedom of the press, even facts and reason are under assault like never before.”",
        "Yet she did highlight the unprecedented levels of political and civic mobilization that have been kicked into gear since Trump’s victory, efforts she believes will help to defend democracy. “We are also witnessing an era of new moral conviction, civic engagement, and a sense of devotion to our democracy and country.”",
        "She urged students to demonstrate resilience even in simple ways, like in calling out fake news or subscribing to a newspaper to support quality journalism. And “as obvious as it seems, it means voting,” she added. “At this moment in our history, our country depends on every citizen believing in the power of their actions even when that power is invisible and their efforts feel like an uphill battle.”"

    "articleContent": [
        "Me Too just got dealt a major blow by the Supreme Court.",
        "On Monday, in an opinion written by Trump appointee Neil Gorsuch, the court ruled 5-4 that it is legal for employers to require workers to sign away their right to file class-action lawsuits against the employer ― and instead be forced to take their disputes to individual arbitration, a private court system in which companies typically have the upper hand.",
        "For many women, the ruling means they will no longer be able to band together to fight systemic sexual discrimination or harassment in court. Women’s rights advocates were quick to decry the decision in Epic Systems Corp. v. Lewis.",
        "“It is a real blow to women in the workplace. We have seen from the Me Too movement the power that comes from women’s voices coming together,” said Emily Martin, a vice president at the National Women’s Law Center. “This decision makes it so much harder for employees to challenge harassment or other forms of discrimination, which means those workplace abuses are more likely to continue.”",
        "Class-action lawsuits have been effective in forcing companies to change policies or practices that reinforce various forms of discrimination, including sex discrimination and gender pay disparities, said Nantiya Ruan, a professor at the University of Denver’s Sturm College of Law.",
        "“An individual cannot change the way a corporation does business,” said Ruan, who is also of counsel at Outten & Golden, a law firm that represents employees in discrimination cases ― including one she is working on now against Goldman Sachs.",
        "Going it alone, the most a woman can generally hope for is a monetary judgment. But banding together, women who file class actions can do far more to ensure that a company stops discriminatory behavior.",
        "In the past, Ruan said, class actions have forced companies to change their ways. She pointed to a case that Home Depot settled in 1997, agreeing not only to pay the women suing the company millions of dollars but also to change its policies.",
        "There’s also a class-action arbitration right now in which hundreds of women who worked at Sterling Jewelers are collectively pursuing the company over sex discrimination and harassment. If those women had been forced to go it alone, as individuals, it’s doubtful whether many of them would have bothered to sue.",
        "The Supreme Court ruling comes at a time when women are increasingly speaking up about discrimination and harassment ― and when more companies are being put on notice that such mistreatment will no longer be tolerated. The decision is also a painful reminder that Me Too is facing a major hurdle in the top federal court, thanks in no small part to President Donald Trump.",
        "“The fact that Neil Gorsuch is the author of this opinion and he and the majority are exhibiting an incredible lack of understanding of what’s going on in today’s workplaces ― it brings it back to Trump,” said Catherine Ruckelshaus, general counsel at the National Employment Law Project. “He nominated Gorsuch and brought him in. Trump’s not for the worker and he’s not a women’s rights president.”",
        "Writing for the majority, Gorsuch held that agreements requiring employees to arbitrate must be enforced and that these agreements do not violate federal labor laws that guarantee workers the right to join forces in “mutual aid and protection.”",
        "“The policy may be debatable but the law is clear: Congress has instructed that arbitration agreements like those before us must be enforced as written,” Gorsuch wrote.",
        "The Monday ruling, which covered three cases against three different companies, involved situations in which employees were allegedly not paid for work. But the decision has far-reaching consequences for many types of cases, including those raising racial and sexual discrimination and harassment claims.",
        "The decision will disproportionately impact low-income workers, who often lack the financial incentive or wherewithal to file complaints on their own. The costs of going to court, for example, would typically far outstrip the amount of back pay to which a woman experiencing pay discrimination in an hourly job would be entitled.",
        "Even for better-paid women, the expense of filing a case individually is often overwhelming. In a blistering dissent in the Epic Systems ruling, Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg noted that it would have cost one employee of Ernst & Young $200,000 to recover $1,867.02 in overtime pay. The consulting firm was one of the companies sued.",
        "“Those most vulnerable to workplace violations are going to be harmed the most,” said Martin.",
        "That point was echoed by Ginsburg, who called the majority’s ruling “egregiously wrong.” The 85-year-old justice, whose dissent was joined by the two other female justices, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, and by Stephen Breyer, said that joining together in litigation is beneficial for workers because it reduces the risk of retaliation. It’s harder for a company to fire hundreds of women than to get rid of one.",
        "“The inevitable result of today’s decision will be the underenforcement of federal and state statutes designed to advance the well-being of vulnerable workers,” Ginsburg wrote.",
        "She also noted that forcing many individual cases into arbitration will result in a lot of conflicting opinions ― which means those individual cases, typically settled in secrecy, won’t produce any meaningful clarity on the treatment of women at work.",
        "Right now, about 60 million workers have already signed away their right to go to court by agreeing to arbitrate disputes with their employers, according to an Economic Policy Institute analysis released last year. About 30 percent of those workers have also signed the kind of class-action waivers that were at issue in this decision.",
        "Expect that number to rise, said Ruckelshaus. She told HuffPost that she recently sat on a panel with an in-house lawyer who said companies were watching this case and if it came down in their favor, more would require employees to sign these agreements.",
        "Under massive public pressure, a few companies had recently said they would no longer require women who’d been harassed on their watch to go to arbitration. Most recently, Uber made such a pledge.",
        "However, the ride-hailing company also said it would still force class actions into arbitration."

        "The Trump administration on Monday proposed rolling back a 2015 rule that bans aggressive predator control tactics in national preserves in Alaska, including shooting bear cubs and wolf pups in their dens ― a move immediately blasted by environmental groups.",
        "The proposal, slated to be published Tuesday in the Federal Register, would amend the National Park Service’s current regulations to again allow for controversial sport hunting and trapping techniques on roughly 20 million acres of federal lands in Alaska. The park service, part of the Department of the Interior, said lifting the prohibitions would increase hunting opportunities on national preserve land, as Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke called for in a pair of secretarial orders last year.",
        "The proposed rule would allow hunters to lure brown and black bears with bait, hunt black bears and their cubs using artificial lights, shoot bear cubs and wolf and coyote pups in their dens, and use dogs to hunt black bears. It would also allow hunters to shoot swimming caribou from motorboats.",
        "Environmental groups voiced disgust at the attempt to strip away protections.",
        "“I’m outraged that [President Donald] Trump and his trophy-hunting cronies are promoting the senseless slaughter of Alaska’s most iconic wildlife,” said Collette Adkins, a lawyer and biologist at the Center for Biological Diversity. “Cruel and harmful hunting methods like killing bear cubs and their mothers near dens have no place on our national preserves.”",
        "Defenders of Wildlife said the 2015 park service rule prevented “extreme methods of killing predators.”",
        "“The Trump administration has somehow reached a new low in protecting wildlife,” said Jamie Rappaport Clark, the nonprofit’s president and CEO. “Allowing the killing of bear cubs and wolf pups in their dens is barbaric and inhumane. The proposed regulations cast aside the very purpose of national parks to protect wildlife and wild places.”",
        "The park service said in an emailed statement the proposed rule would “establish consistency” with state regulations.",
        "“The conservation of wildlife and habitat for future generations is a goal we share with Alaska,” agency regional director Bert Frost said.",
        "A 60-day public comment period begins Tuesday.",
        "The proposal comes a little more than a year after Congress approved a measure to repeal an Obama-era rule that largely banned hunting of Alaska’s most iconic predators in Alaska’s national wildlife refuges. The Republican-sponsored legislation opened the door for the state to resume aggressive predator control tactics, including shooting bears and wolves from airplanes, on more than 76 million acres of refuge land.",
        "Trump signed that bill into law in April 2017.",

        "WASHINGTON ― Fox News viewers aren’t too keen on Robert Mueller, the longtime Republican law enforcement official now heading the special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.",
        "Of those Americans who say at least some of their information on the FBI’s investigation came from Fox News, 65 percent strongly disapproved of Mueller, while another 9 percent somewhat disapproved, a newly released HuffPost/YouGov survey finds.",
        "Mueller got higher approval from those watching other networks, with 60 percent of those following the investigation on CNN saying they strongly approved and 70 percent of those getting news from MSNBC giving the special counsel strong approval. Some people followed the story on multiple networks.",
        "Most Fox News viewers ― 68 percent ― also thought that the FBI was biased against President Donald Trump, while 61 percent either had little or no trust in the FBI. (The kind of people who turn to Fox News, of course, are also probably likely to be the most suspicious of the probe to begin with: About half of the Trump voters who’ve been following the story say they’ve tuned into Fox.) More than three-quarters of Americans say they’ve heard at least something in the news lately about Mueller and the FBI’s Russia investigation ― and among that group, nearly half said at least some of their news came from cable TV.",
        "Fox News hosts like Sean Hannity have been heavily criticizing the special counsel investigation along with Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who named Mueller as special counsel and is also a Republican. Mueller is a decorated veteran who joined the Justice Department under George H.W. Bush and was nominated as FBI director by George W. Bush.",
        "Overall, the HuffPost/YouGov survey found that Americans are largely split on the FBI’s handling of the Russia investigation, with 37 percent approving, 36 percent disapproving, and the rest unsure. Mueller gets only modestly more positive marks: 38 percent approve of his performance as special counsel, while 32 percent disapprove. Just under half of respondents say they have at least a fair amount of trust in the FBI, down significantly from 2015, although relatively unchanged from polls taken earlier this year.",
        "As in previous surveys, views are deeply polarized. About three-quarters of Hillary Clinton voters, but only a third of Trump voters, say they have even a fair amount of trust in the FBI. A 73 percent majority of Trump voters, but just 7 percent of Clinton voters, think the agency is biased against the president.",
        "A previous HuffPost/YouGov poll showed that Trump had successfully convinced most of his voters that the FBI was biased against him.",
        "On Sunday, Trump called for an investigation into whether the FBI infiltrated his campaign by having an informant interview three associates of the campaign. Over the weekend, he also called on “real Americans” to “start getting tough” on the investigation he called a “scam.”",

    "articleContent": [
        "Warning! Spoilers for “Black Panther,” “Infinity War” and whatever else below.",
        "Just a couple of months ago (yeah, it was that recently), “Black Panther” was obliterating the box office. News of a sequel hit the internet, to a chorus of “Wakanda Forever.”",
        "Then “Avengers: Infinity War” happened, and forever wasn’t what it used to be.",
        "In perhaps the most unexpected of many expectation-destroying moments in the new film, the king himself, T’Challa (Chadwick Boseman), crumbles to ashes as a result of Thanos (Josh Brolin) and his widely analyzed finger snap. We were all like, “Wakanda movie is this?”",
        "Nate Moore, a development and production executive at Marvel Studios, as well as a producer on “Black Panther,” recently told HuffPost that he learned a while ago that “Infinity War” directors Anthony and Joe Russo planned to kill off T’Challa. In fact, he knew T’Challa would turn to dust way back when “Black Panther” director Ryan Coogler was still working on his 2015 film “Creed.”",
        "Even then, the decision was perplexing. Moore said he initially asked the Russo brothers to hold off on murdering the Black Panther.",
        "“I knew pretty well what they were talking about and personally urged them to reconsider,” Moore said over the phone earlier this month. “But the storytelling made sense, so I love that we got to see a little bit more of Wakanda in that film, and I hope to see how they’re going to resolve that.”",
        "Moore added that it was difficult to argue with the Russos’ reasoning, though he didn’t elaborate on the specifics of their stance.",
        "“Touching on all the different ideas you can have, you talk about the pros and cons of each, and they had some really compelling arguments as to why what happened happened,” Moore said. “I think ultimately it made for a really interesting, almost more complicated ending to that film because of how well ‘Black Panther’ was embraced by audiences. Again, personally painful, but I understand the reasoning.”",
        "The Russo brothers have said the decision to kill ― or not kill ― particular “Infinity War” characters was story-driven, but that wasn’t enough of an explanation for me. I recently got the chance to ask them: Why T’Challa? Did they ever consider changing their position after seeing how successful “Black Panther” had become?",
        "Well, let’s just say they were resolute.",
        "“We were very cued into the storyline of Panther from his origins in ‘Captain America: Civil War,’” Anthony Russo said. “The role that Panther and Wakanda played in this movie was sort of a bedrock of the movie, a bedrock of the [Marvel cinematic universe]. I think ‘Black Panther’ could’ve done half the business that it did and it still would’ve been a valid creative choice.”",
        "Of course, there’s a strong likelihood the superhero isn’t gone for good, given the “Black Panther” sequel that’s in the works. Will a Quantum Realm reality bring T’Challa back? Or will Shuri (Letitia Wright), T’Challa’s sister, become the next Black Panther, as some fans are already speculating?",
        "During the rest of our interview, Moore talked about the various possibilities ― and answered some of my most pressing questions: Was Beyoncé secretly on the “Black Panther” soundtrack? Could Kendrick Lamar be in the “Black Panther” sequel? What should we make of Chadwick Boseman’s supposed “Wakanda Forever” fatigue?",
        "Where did that “Wakanda Forever” sign come from?",
        "It was something that Chadwick and Ryan came up with in rehearsal, and there weren’t a ton of variations. It sort of just seems to make intuitive sense. I have to say, initially, I think the first time they did it was in tribal council, and part of me was like, “Is that going to look cool?” [Laughs] “Is that going to be cool or are people going to reject it?” But the more that it was used, the more it sort of almost felt like it had always been.",
        "It’s one of those decisions you always forget when it happened, and it just felt so natural and so a part of the fabric of the movie. Chadwick ― I think, because he developed it with Ryan ― owns it. Everything Chadwick does just feels real, so by the end of [the film shoot], extras were doing it, crew members were doing it to each other. Everyone was doing and that’s when you know, OK, this is something that’s going to resonate.",
        "The cast gets asked to do it a lot. Have you seen the memes of Chadwick doing Wakanda Forever and not looking as enthusiastic?",
        "Yeah, I’m not surprised, because you have to do it quite a bit. But also my friends will send me, like, soccer players doing it now. It’s made its way into pop culture, which I think is amazing.",
        "What part of “Black Panther” changed the most from the script to what we saw?",
        "The adventure outside of Wakanda used to be much longer. After they went to Korea, they went a couple of other places. T’Challa, Nakia and Okoye [went] and sort of explored the theme of what it means to be African and African-American in the world a bit more. We just had to pare back honestly because of the amount of time we knew the film would take even with just what you saw on screen.",
        "There were definitely some great story ideas that we had to leave on the table and hopefully we get to revisit someday, just to keep the story as focused as possible on T’Challa and Killmonger. I think there are even sequences we boarded that were super cool that we didn’t have time for, and that’s a good sign on my end when you have too much story.",
        "Kendrick Lamar said he wanted to be a villain in the sequel. I mean, what do you think?",
        "[Laughs] That would be amazing. I love Kendrick Lamar, and his music is such a big part of the film. Yeah, I think if it’s right, it’s right. We can do a lot worse than Kendrick Lamar in one of our films.",
        "There was a rumor Beyoncé was secretly on one of Kendrick Lamar’s tracks. Can we finally put that to rest?",
        "You can finally put that to rest. That is not true.",
        "Why do you go to that wide shot at the end when Killmonger dies?",
        "One thing we talked a lot about was the notion of legacy and what it means to be African-American and be so disconnected to the place you are from. That wide shot and that scene with T’Challa and Killmonger at the end was really about Killmonger appreciating this place that he almost felt like he was never going to go to and seeing the sunset that his father promised him years before and passing on almost peacefully, as violent as that final act was. Sort of being reunited with his ancestry in that final moment and pulling back that wide to get the peace of that, the restfulness of that, even though it is him saying goodbye.",
        "We thought that was really interesting. Wakanda is a beautiful place and for him to be at rest there was sort of fitting, even though he is the villain. Even though his message was wrong, it is time for him to be at rest.",
        "I was kind of pulling for Killmonger to make it through.",
        "A lot of people were, which I think is the sign of a great villain ― someone you can identify with, who has a real point of view that is not “I want to take over the world” or “I want all the money in the world,” but is about something thematic.",
        "Again, that is something that Ryan Coogler pitched. That is something he should get full credit for, and I think is partially why the film resonates so much. You can see both sides. For the first time, what I thought was interesting is the notion that Killmonger actually changes T’Challa. The notion that the hero learns from the villain and changes because of the interaction with him is really powerful, and I don’t think something that we have done.",
        "With T’Challa gone, everyone’s already speculating about Shuri taking over as Black Panther. What do you think?",
        "That’s what I think is so great about comics and the Marvel cinematic universe. As you know, the notion of Black Panther is a mantle almost as much as the character, so there’s a lot of ways to explore great ideas for a “Panther” sequel that won’t invalidate what happened in “Infinity War,” and that gets us excited, just the breadth of stories you can tell, which is great.",
        "This interview was lightly edited for length and clarity.",
        "“Black Panther” is out now on DVD and digital."

    },
    "articleContent": [
        "“Doesn’t Look Like Anything To Leigh... And Bill” is HuffPost’s weekly “Westworld” recap in which we break down the craziest thing you might have missed. This week: Season 2, Episode 5, “Akane No Mai.”\n\nWelcome to Robobaby Watch: 2018.\n\nEver since Season 1 of “Westworld,” we’ve been on the lookout for hints about the possibility of robot babies (aka robotots, aka the natural offspring a nonhuman), and the latest episode, “Akane No Mai,” might have given us another clue.\n\nIn the midst of all the exciting action in Westworld’s samurai-themed park Shogun World ― and the fact that Maeve (Thandie Newton) tapped into the code of Westworld, gaining the ability to make other hosts kill themselves at will ― there was a little hanky-panky.\n\nPerhaps for the first time, Teddy (James Marsden) and Dolores (Evan Rachel Wood) ― a pair of androids ― made sweet, sweet love.",
        "Teddy and Dolores have always shared a special connection, almost like they were made for each other ― yes, literally made for each other. In the Season 2 premiere, Dolores even tells him, “I know how this story ends. With us, Teddy. It ends with you and me.”\n\nYet, Season 2, Episode 5, seemed to mark the first time they’ve ever had sex. Sure, they’ve kissed. But pre-consciousness, Dolores was just a damsel in distress for guests to save or torture. Her plotted love story with Teddy had never seemed to progress to consummation.",
        "We’ve been predicting the introduction of robotots since Season 1. The second season has done nothing but hint that wee little droids could be on the way. The biggest clue occurs in the show’s opening credit sequence, which now features a robot and its infant child.",
        "The sequence’s creator, Patrick Clair, told HuffPost that the moment will have “real rewards” as the season continues. Viewers “will start to really be able to realize what that means and its place within the titles,” he said.",
        "Overall, the connection between parent and child has been a focal point this season: Maeve’s on a primal quest to find her daughter. The Man in Black has been forced to address his relationship with his own daughter, Grace (Katja Herbers), who showed up in the park this season. Even Dolores was finally able to reunite with her father, Peter Abernathy (Louis Herthum), in Episode 3.",
        "Herthum, for his part, is into the idea of robotots.",
        "Though he says he doesn’t know if they’re coming to Westworld, the actor recently reiterated to HuffPost how important parent-child relationships are on the show.",
        "“If you go back to that pilot, you have Peter and he’s completely devoted to Dolores when he’s talking to Ford [Anthony Hopkins], who asks, ‘What are your drives?’ He said, ‘To take care of my cattle, take care of my wife, and to protect Dolores.’ ... Peter is the first host to show that undying love for his child.”",
        "Maeve might be another first. Theories have been circulating this season that she might have given birth to the first natural-born robot baby, a living child who grew up to become Charlotte Hale (Tessa Thompson). If true, this theory could explain Maeve’s uncontrollable need to reach her daughter, previously assumed to be just another programmed host.",
        "Considering that Dolores is now messing with Teddy’s settings to make him more of a killer, which is what happens at the end of the latest episode, we’re not sure what’s to come for these ill-fated lovers. Dolores clearly has a plan for Teddy underway. Whether it involves robotots remains to be seen.",
        "So, Robobaby Watch aside, here are a few other theories to pay attention to as the season continues:",
        "Maeve is more powerful than we think.",
        "At the end of “Akane No Mai,” Maeve uses some sort of psychic ability to reprogram the hostile hosts in Shogun world to kill each other rather than her and her new friend Akane (Rinko Kikuchi). Maeve seems to possess a power no other droid holds, telling story creator Lee Sizemore (Simon Quarterman), “I found a new voice.”\n\nBut what is actually going on here? Is the thought-to-be-dead Ford still in control of Maeve, allowing her to lead the android revolution? Or has Maeve simply found a way to bypass her own programming? She can speak Japanese, for goodness’ sake!\n\nBernard is not who he appears to be.",
        "Many have been speculating that the Bernard (Jeffrey Wright) we catch up with on the beach is not Bernard at all, but another host’s consciousness contained within the shell of Bernard. Viewers have watched as brain capsules were placed inside and taken out of droids’ heads all season long, so there’s reason to believe, say, Teddy’s code is running through Bernard’s body.",
        "“That’s quite a story you gave them,” Karl Strand (Gustaf Skarsgård), the head of Delos operations, says in the latest episode, as he looks at Bernard in the lab after discovering one-third of the bots’ brains were wiped due to the flood. Strangely enough, the camera pans over Teddy’s lifeless body as Karl adds, “and one hell of an ending.” (Foreshadow much?!)\n\nAccording to Reddit user BigbigPlibt, Dolores, not Teddy, could be the one inhabiting Bernard’s form. “Delores [sic] might have noticed that it’ll be impossible to breach outside of westworld with a small army and instead need[ed] to take a more stealth approach.”\n\nWe saw multiple Bernards (or Arnolds?) in the Season 2 trailer, so there’s a big chance some of our favorite robots are taking over, Bernarnold-style.\n\nDoppelbots, unite.",
        "The narrative of Shogun World is almost identical to that of Westworld, with the Samurai park’s characters strongly resembling those from their Western counterpart. As Sizemore himself tells Maeve, “Who knows how seeing your own doppelbot is going to fuck with your cognition?”\n\nSizemore pretty much admits the theme parks’ storylines are plagiarized, you know, due to “supply and demand.” So if there is a Japanese Maeve (Akane), there could be a Medieval Maeve, or a Roman Maeve etc., etc. There’s no doubt these doppelbots, like we saw with Maeve and Akane, could forge a strong bond. Could we see multiple versions of characters unite to take down the human race?\n\nAnd if Maeve or Dolores copies do have the ability to have babies, that means only one thing: doppletots.\n\n“Westworld” airs Sundays at 9 p.m. on HBO.",

    "articleContent": [
        "In a signature scene from “Grey Gardens,” Edith “Little Edie” Bouvier Beale parades down a staircase in the decaying East Hampton, New York, mansion she shares with her eccentric mother, “Big Edie,” aunt to former first lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. It’s the fall of 1973, and Little Edie hoists a small American flag in her outstretched hand. As her upper body enters the frame, clad in a black leotard and red-trimmed headscarf, she waltzes straight toward the camera crew stationed across the room.",
        "At last, an audience!",
        "Grinning, Edie twirls the flag like a dance partner, spinning it to and fro, filled with a joie de vivre unlikely for someone who has fallen from high-society beneficiary to highly scrutinized recluse.",
        "Little Edie’s performance is the sort of display that’s inescapable today. Our televisions and social media feeds are crawling with people eager to find the nearest camera, desperate to cash in on the proverbial 15 minutes they thought might never come. The Beale women were America’s reality stars before the term “reality star” existed. They satisfied the same archetypes ― catty, attention-starved, delusional, staunch ― that have come to define that genre of contemporary entertainment.",
        "As the ultimate mark of a reality pro, Little Edie loved “Grey Gardens,” the 1975 documentary that portrayed her and her mother as curiosities in the capitalist treasure chest that is American pop culture. Instead of seeing it as a woeful slice of opportunism, she presumably viewed the film as we do: a delicious tribute to a woman who remained unflinching despite her troubled existence ― an unfiltered product belonging to an era that never was the Camelot it sought to be.",
        "“That Summer,” a new documentary that acts as a de facto prequel to “Grey Gardens,” has a scene that’s equally evocative. It’s June 1972, and Little Edie points to a shed in her overgrown yard, telling cousin Lee Radziwill (Onassis’ sister) that she claims the building as her own. “There’s a song called ‘My Adobe Hacienda,’ and this is it,” Edie says in her posh lilt. And then, as if suddenly remembering there’s a camera observing her, she whips around and launches into the opening verse, scurrying toward the lens as if it’s her stage.",
        "The same proud grin that accompanied that American flag spreads across her face.",
        "Little Edie’s routine encapsulates how divine it is to spend another precious 80 minutes with the Beale duo, who became a societal fixation in the 1970s after a New York magazine cover story and the Maysles brothers’ immortal “Grey Gardens” brought their tale of squandered wealth out of the tabloids and into the national limelight.",
        "In the intervening years, their saga has been mythologized and dramatized umpteen times over: a Beale-themed photo spread captured for Italian Vogue in 1999, a Broadway musical in 2006, an HBO film starring Jessica Lange and Drew Barrymore in 2009, multiple impersonations on “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” a “Documentary Now!” parody featuring Bill Hader and Fred Armisen in 2015, various quips on “Gilmore Girls,” “Modern Family” and Joan Rivers’ Comedy Central roast.",
        "Little Edie and Big Edie are caricatured enough for “That Summer” to serve as both correction and confirmation. Yes, as pop-culture emblems, they really were that kooky and fascinating; just look at Little Edie’s makeshift wardrobe or the way Big Edie hollers at Little Edie from across their unkempt manor. But as humans, they were, of course, far more complex. Their backstory includes familial acrimony and misguided decisions ― fodder that captivated the public in the days before mass-media oddities were a dime a dozen. But if their interactions in “Grey Gardens” were sometimes careless and stormy, “That Summer” is downright tender by comparison.",
        "“Oddly enough, I think the Beales’ situation is much about how it is to be a woman, the limits of how you could behave and be eccentric as a woman,” Göran Hugo Olsson, the Swedish director of “That Summer,” said by phone last week. “They are protected by their cloths and their privilege, up to a certain extent. And then when they cross that limit and be too eccentric for the community or the society, society hits back at them.”",
        "Olsson’s theory holds up. In the 1920s, having married a well-heeled lawyer named Phelan Beale and become the matron of the home known as Grey Gardens, Big Edie mounted amateur singing pursuits and formed opinions that her image-obsessed Bouvier clan considered subversive. She was steadily ostracized from the family and written out of her rich father’s will. Post-divorce, she retreated into the mansion she retained, more or less trapping her daughter inside ― a decision that would alter the younger Edie’s life forever. By the time the Maysles came knocking, the $65,000 trust fund they’d subsisted on since 1948 had dwindled.",
        "Without writing off their extreme peculiarities ― Big Edie and Little Edie stopped cleaning, rarely left their property and faced constant threats from authorities ― it’s fair to suspect their bloodline prevented the Edies from becoming their own women. Both had beautiful voices that could have yielded fruitful music careers, had they been encouraged to pursue such paths. But Big Edie, an artist? The Bouviers, forever chasing straight-and-narrow affluence, wouldn’t hear of it. As she became more and more of a spectacle, her daughter’s potential became less and less abundant. You’d go mad too, stuck inside that sprawling home with a mother who insists you stay within shouting distance.",
        "“I’ve never had privacy in my whole life,” Little Edie gripes in “That Summer” after her mother tells her she lacks the cojones to leave Grey Gardens, as she has long threatened. (“It’s boring, boring, boring here! I’ll go anywhere to be free!” she declared in the New York profile, published in 1972.)",
        "Consider, too, a scene in which Little Edie recounts a phone conversation with Onassis. City officials had hosed down the house’s rotting walls, and Little Edie brags about ringing up her famous cousin to complain. It’s the perfect snapshot of the “Grey Gardens” lore: the oversimplified image of the upscale White House alumna who left her relatives in squalor (Onassis actually saved them from eviction), pitted against the oversimplified image of the onetime country-club patrician now too hapless to help herself (after her mother’s death in ’77, Little Edie moved to New York City and later to California and Florida).",
        "Would we be as fascinated with the Beale pair today? Presidential ties aside, I’m not so sure.",
        "You see, “Grey Gardens” is a relic of an age before reality television, when hoarders and doomsday obsessives and Vanilla Ice going Amish weren’t primetime fodder. Vérité documentary ― a fly-on-the-wall treatment that catalogs reality without talking heads, directorial flourishes or a score ― was still a relatively new concept. We were two decades away from “The Real World,” O.J. Simpson, Lorena Bobbitt and Tonya Harding creating the perfect storm that accelerated the 24-hour news cycle. The “Survivor”–“Big Brother”–“Fear Factor” boom of the early 2000s, which gave way to tasteless curios like “Here Comes Honey Boo Boo” and “Best Funeral Ever,” makes “Grey Gardens” look like more of a human-interest oddity than a sliver of bona fide cultural intrigue.",
        "Big Edie and Little Edie unwittingly helped to shape the reality TV model that proceeded from them. They represent the same paradigms that define today’s programming. They’re loudmouths with a tenuous claim to fame who clearly thrive on attention, even if they don’t ask for it. In 1976, The New York Times called “Grey Gardens” a “circus sideshow,” a description that also befits “The Bachelor,” “Teen Mom,” the “Real Housewives” and Kardashian franchises, “The Apprentice,” “Catfish” and so much more.",
        "But, like “Grey Gardens,” those programs aren’t sideshows because they have nothing to offer the world; they’re sideshows because they mold their characters into one-dimensional exhibitions, delighting us with an inherent familiarity that lends itself to armchair gossip. The Edies were the original one-dimensional exhibition. When Little Edie speaks directly to the camera, it’s as if she is recording the confessionals that are now obligatory for reality series. What then seemed off-kilter can now be considered prescient.",
        "Fast-forward a few decades, and Lee Radziwill’s daughter-in-law, the former TV journalist Carole Radziwill, is a cast member on “The Real Housewives of New York City,” a show on which another cast member, socialite Sonja Morgan, once said, “There’s nothing grey about my gardens.” The evolution comes full circle.",
        "“That Summer” is compiled using footage from Lee Radziwill and then-boyfriend Peter Beard’s 1972 trip to visit her aunt and cousin in an attempt to have them narrate her childhood memories. According to the movie’s prologue, the footage has been “lost” for 40 years. What a joy to have it today, both as an archival exploration of Americana and a counterpart to the complexities often omitted in the sparseness of “Grey Gardens.”",
        "“I never thought of the Beales as unfortunate or sad or anything except very excellent at feeling what it was like to hold on to the past,” Beard says in “That Summer.”",
        "The film is rife with cameos from the Studio 54 staples with whom Beard and Radziwill caroused — Andy Warhol, Bianca Jagger, Mick Jagger, Truman Capote, Paul Morrissey. Amid these famous faces, another American contradiction emerges: All those artists who spent their lives courting fame are considered normal, but as for the two who chose to carry out theirs in seclusion? Well, that’s just positively insane.",

        "“Homophobia is an ill that eats away at society, invades schools, and poisons families and lost friends,” Mahjoubi said in his post.",
        "The son of Moroccan immigrants who became a successful tech entrepreneur before joining Macron’s campaign, Mahjoubi is not the first French politician to come out, but he said his personal experience could inspire those facing prejudice.",

        "HAVANA (Reuters) ― Cuban authorities said the fiery crash of an aging Boeing passenger jet on Friday shortly after takeoff from Havana had killed 110 of the 113 on board, making it the Caribbean island’s deadliest air disaster in nearly 30 years.",
        "Flags flew at half-mast in Cuba on Saturday, marking the start of two days of national mourning while authorities worked to recover evidence from the site of the crash and to identify the crash victims.",
        "Fifteen have been identified so far and one black box retrieved, officials said.",
        "Allegations of previous safety complaints against the little-known Mexican company called Damojh that leased the nearly 40-year-old Boeing 737 to Cuban flagship carrier Cubana also began to surface.",
        "Damojh declined to comment while Mexico’s Directorate General of Civil Aeronautics said a new audit of the company would be undertaken to ensure it was still “fulfilling norms.”",
        "Meanwhile, Cuban authorities told a news conference on Saturday at Havana airport that 99 of the passengers killed on the domestic flight to the eastern city of Holguin were Cuban, while three were foreign tourists ― two Argentines and a Mexican ― and two were Sahrawi residents in Cuba.",

        "Cuban officials identified the women as Mailen Diaz, 19, of Holguin; Grettel Landrove, 23, of Havana; and Emiley Sanchez, 39, of Holguin. Sanchez was conscious and communicating, Diaz was conscious and sedated, and Landrove was in a coma, reported the Washington Post.",
        "“My daughter is a fighter, she’s strong, she’ll save herself,” said Amparo Font, Landrove’s mother, with a trembling voice and tears welling.",
        "Outside the morgue, distressed relatives cried and hugged one another, as they gave authorities information on loved ones to aid in the identification process.",

        "“The plane was on fire, it flipped and then nosedived,” said farmer Marino Perez Alvaredo.",
        "RECORD OF SAFETY COMPLAINTS?",
        "Cubana leased the jet less than a month ago, Transport Minister Adel Yzquierdo said on Saturday. The carrier was struggling to meet demand for flights and was serving many domestic routes by bus instead.",
        "Cuba often resorts to leasing due to the decades-old U.S. trade embargo which makes it difficult to acquire newer aircraft, Yzquierdo said. Damojh operates three planes, according to the Mexican government.",
        "Ovidio Martinez Lopez, a retired Cubana pilot, wrote in a widely-shared post on Facebook thatCuban airlines had leased planes from Damojh in 2010 and 2011, but one of its aircraft dropped off the radar while over the city of Santa Clara.",
        "Cuban officials suspended the captain and co-pilot of that flight for “problems and serious lack of technical knowledge,” he said, and Cuba’s aviation security authority had recommended Cubana no longer lease from them.",
        "Separately, a pilot who used to work for Damojh was quoted on Saturday by Mexican newspaper Milenio criticizing the company for lack of adequate maintenance of planes.",
        "“I experienced several incidents at this company, like engine failure or the electrical system went when we took off from Mexico on one occasion,” Marco Aurelio Hernandez was quoted as saying.",
        "Cuban investigators have so far recovered the cockpit voice recorder in “good condition,” Yzquierdo said, and are still looking for the flight data recorder.",
        "The crash was the worst in Cuba since a Soviet-built Ilyushin-62M passenger plane crashed near Havana in 1989 killing all 126 people on board and another 14 on the ground.",

        "Florence and Paris are beautiful and all, but it’s not like we’re the only ones who think so. If you’re dreaming about a romantic European getaway that doesn’t involve a gazillion tourists, then consider these beautiful isles. (Just don’t tell us anyone else, OK?)",
        "PONZA, ITALY",
        "Vacation like the Romans do and check out this beautiful, volcanic isle in the Tyrrhenian Sea (accessible by a one-hour hydrofoil journey from the mainland). Don’t let the mega yachts gliding into the harbor fool you — the vibe here is relaxed and unpretentious. But the turquoise waters, hidden grottos, and fabulous local seafood and wine will definitely make you feel like a million bucks.",
        "BELLE-ÎLE-EN-MER, FRANCE",
        "The island’s name (“Beautiful Island in the Sea”) definitely doesn’t disappoint. Located just off the coast of Brittany in northwest France, this destination is known for its unspoilt beaches, pastel-painted houses and mouthwatering seafood. And while there’s plenty to do (surfing, sailing and sightseeing, to name a few), give yourself time to just relax and soak up the picturesque views — so beautiful that they inspired many of Monet’s greatest works.",
        "GRINDA, SWEDEN",
        "No trip to the Scandinavian capital is complete without a boat trip around Stockholm’s archipelago. And while there are thousands of islands to see, peaceful Grinda is one of the easiest to reach (it’s about an hour and a half from the city) and offers a variety of accommodation options (hotels, cabins, a hostel and a campground). There are no cars allowed on the island, but plenty of sandy beaches, walking paths and rustic charm.",
        "HYDRA, GREECE",
        "Cars and scooters are banned on this laid-back island that’s located about two hours from Athens, which means that you’ll have to rely on donkeys to carry your luggage up to your hotel. Poet-musician Leonard Cohen fell in love with the pebble beaches, winding cobblestone streets, whitewashed houses and quaint cafés and bars, which might explain how this relaxed isle got its boho reputation.",
        "TEXEL, NETHERLANDS",
        "Pronounced “Tesse,” this northern island boasts multiple cycle routes that will take you by quaint villages, colorful tulip fields, a national park and an iconic lighthouse. Get your culture fix at one of the many museums (there’s a strong nautical history here) and then reward yourself after with a tour around Texel’s only craft brewery.",
        "STROMBOLI, ITALY",
        "Just north of Sicily lies this fiery spot — best for intrepid travelers only (the sputtering volcano that towers above the island is still active). Spend the day relaxing on black sand beaches and swimming in shimmering waters, then enjoy nature’s fireworks show in the evenings (from a safe distance, of course).",
        "COLONSAY, SCOTLAND",
        "If peace and quiet is what you’re after (with a side of adventure) then this remote northern isle is just the ticket. Small enough to be completely accessible by foot or bicycle, get back in tune with nature by exploring the rolling hills, grazing goats, basking seals and beautiful flora. Ah, so relaxing.",
        "THE AZORES, PORTUGAL",
        "It’s hard to pick a favorite out of this string of volcanic islands in the Atlantic, but we’re partial to São Miguel. Its remote location means that you’ll see relatively few tourists here and have all the geothermal pools, stargazing and rugged inlets largely to yourself. Don’t miss whale watching and dolphin watching, too.",
