Now the veteran journalist says she is eager to tell “the story behind the story.”","In her new National Geographic documentary series, “America Inside Out,” she does deep reporting on hot-button topics tearing the country apart.","“I wanted people to hear multiple points of view, and I also think because the new cycle is so fast and furious … we just see the headline. It whizzes by us,” Couric said. “The news cycle gives us very little room to step back and consider things.”","In the May 9 episode, titled “The Revolt,” she tackles gender and equality by speaking with gender specialists, talking with experts about bias and interviewing James Damore, a former Google employee who questioned the company’s diversity initiatives. She also sits down with actresses Viola Davis, Geena Davis and Elisabeth Moss to discuss inclusion in Hollywood.","Through it all, Couric explores how gender inequality, unconscious bias and sexual harassment are linked. What she learned surprised her.","“Women leave tech, for example, at a rate twice as high as men. Not because of work-life issues but because of toxic cultures,” she said.","Asked whether she’s hopeful for a future filled with advances in equality for women and people of color, she said, “I am, and I’m not.”","“I think one of the media’s responsibilities is to continue to put pressure on organizations to understand cultures and how you change cultures because the people who are in positions — the power — are invested in maintaining the status quo,” Couric continued. “And I think, unfortunately, the moves that are made are almost lip service and not systemic changes. You’ll see more organizations putting more women in leadership positions, but are they really, truly in leadership positions? Are they window dressing? I would love to see more transparency by companies and more accountability. I’d love to see some leaders put in place with tangible changes ― and track them. I just don’t know how much of that is really going on.”","Although there’s momentum with the Time’s Up and Me Too movements, she thinks more fundammental changes need to be made within organizations.","“As much the conversation has happened, I think there hasn’t been enough focus on how do we change things and move forward in the work environment and in terms of public policy?” she said. “That’s what I was hoping to do — how can we actually make real progress and change things not only for women but for all minorities to make workplaces more representative?”","In the six-episode series, Couric reports on other polarizing issues, including race, politics, technology and censorship ― all while trying to provide a deeper understanding for the audience.","“I had to look at a lot of information, big topics, and figure out how do I make this subject engaging, how do I illustrate it accurately and fairly and how do I make people feel?” Couric said. “And how do I make them care? And how do I make them walk away and say, ‘I never really thought about that.’ And then get them to think about it some more. It’s a big challenge. But otherwise, what’s the point?”","“America Inside Out” airs Wednesdays at 10 p.m. ET on National Geographic."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ae88a042000002e00b9026c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Ashley Judd Sues Film Producer Harvey Weinstein For Defamation And Sexual Harassment","authors":"Jill Serjeant, Reuters","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ashley-judd-harvey-weinstein-lawsuit_us_5ae7f91ee4b02baed1bd7e94","short_description":"The actress claims Weinstein damaged her movie career after she refused his sexual advances.","date":"2018-05-01"},"articleContent":["LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Hollywood actress Ashley Judd on Monday filed a defamation and sexual harassment lawsuit against film producer Harvey Weinstein, alleging that he damaged her movie career after she refused his sexual advances.","The civil lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court in Santa Monica, accuses Weinstein of causing Judd to lose a part in 1998 in the film “The Lord of the Rings” by making “baseless smears” against her.","The lawsuit, reviewed by Reuters, alleges that Weinstein “was retaliating against Ms. Judd for rejecting his sexual demands approximately one year earlier, when he cornered her in a hotel room under the guise of discussing business.”","“Weinstein used his power in the entertainment industry to damage Ms. Judd’s reputation and limit her ability to find work,” the lawsuit added.","A representative for Weinstein issued a statement hours later saying the onetime film studio chieftain had “neither defamed Ms. Judd nor ever interfered with Ms. Judd’s career.”","Instead, the statement said, Weinstein “championed” Judd’s work and “repeatedly approved her casting for two of his movies” - “Frida” in 2002 starring Salma Hayek, and “Crossing Over” with Harrison Ford in 2009. It also said he had “fought for Ms. Judd as his first choice for a lead role in “Good Will Hunting.”","The statement did not address Judd’s allegations that she was sexually harassed by Weinstein.","Judd was one of the first women in October 2017 to make an on-the-record allegation of sexual misconduct against Weinstein, which soon afterward evolved into the social media #MeToo movement against sexual harassment and assault. The Oscar-winning producer has since been accused of sexual impropriety by more than 70 women.","He has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone.","Judd, a leading member of the “Time’s Up” movement against sexual harassment in the workplace, is seeking unspecified damages and a jury trial.","Judd’s representative did not immediately return a call for comment.","The actress said in a statement to the New York Times that any financial recuperation from the lawsuit would be donated to Time’s Up “so that women and men in all professions may have legal redress for sexual harassment, economic retaliation and damage to their careers.”","Click here to read the lawsuit (PDF)."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ae7fa002000004100b9018d.jpeg?cache=M2AkjcNp7d&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Texas Sues Trump Administration To End DACA","authors":"Lawrence Hurley, Reuters","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/texas-sues-government-daca_us_5ae8dface4b022f71a02ca5d","short_description":"Six other Republican-governed states joined Texas in the suit.","date":"2018-05-01"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Roseanne Barr Dreams Of Being Prime Minister Of Israel","authors":"Mary Papenfuss","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/roseanne-barr-israeli-prime-minister_us_5ae7d47ae4b02baed1bd70c7","short_description":"\"If God calls me, I'll go.\"","date":"2018-05-01"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"COMEDY","headline":"Trump Savaged Online After John Kelly Reportedly Called Him An ‘Idiot’","authors":"Ed Mazza","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-idiot-john-kelly-reaction-twitter_us_5ae7edbfe4b055fd7fcf0951","short_description":"The alleged insult has taken on a life of its own.","date":"2018-05-01"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"California Sues Trump's EPA Over Weakened Clean Car Rules","authors":"Lydia O'Connor","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/california-suing-epa-clean-car-rules_us_5ae89fc9e4b02baed1be8756","short_description":"California is leading the 18-state effort challenging the Trump government's claim that Obama-era emission rules are too stringent.","date":"2018-05-01"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Louisiana Secretary Of State Resigns After Staffer Accuses Him Of Sexual Harassment","authors":"Sam Levine","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/louisiana-secretary-of-state-tom-schedler-resigns-sexual-harassment_us_5ae8d586e4b00f70f0ecd616","short_description":"His former executive secretary accused him of making repeated advances and then banishing her to a do-nothing job when she refused.","date":"2018-05-01"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"'Avengers' Stars Laugh In The Face Of Twitter Trolls' 'Mean Tweets'","authors":"Lee Moran","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mean-tweets-avengers-jimmy-kimmel_us_5ae81176e4b02baed1bd8f5c","short_description":"\"Benedict Cumberbatch always looks like he's had an allergic reaction to bad shrimp.\"","date":"2018-05-01"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Former Trump Doctor Accuses President's Lawyer, Bodyguard Of Raiding His Office","authors":"David Moye","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/harold-bornstein-trump-doc-accuses-presidents-lawyer-bodyguard-of-raiding-his-offic_us_5ae89395e4b02baed1be7585","short_description":"Harold Bornstein said \"the raid\" made him feel “raped, frightened and sad.”","date":"2018-05-01"},"articleContent":["A New York doctor who served as President Donald Trump’s personal physician is alleging that Trump’s lawyer, bodyguard and an unidentified “large man” raided his office for medical records.","Dr. Harold Bornstein tells NBC News that the alleged raid took place in February 2017, just two days after Bornstein told The New York Times he had been prescribing the hair growth medicine Propecia for Trump for years.","Bornstein, a Manhattan-based doctor, told NBC that White House aide Keith Schiller, Trump’s longtime personal bodyguard; Alan Garten, Trump Organization chief legal officer and a third unidentified man raided his home. The trio showed up at Bornstein’s office without notice and took all the president’s medical records.","Bornstein said the incident left him feeling “raped, frightened and sad,” according to NBC News.","“They must have been here for 25 or 30 minutes. It created a lot of chaos,” Bornstein added.","Bornstein said he was never given a HIPAA release form signed by Trump. The confiscation of medical documents without a signed form is a violation of patient privacy law.","A source familiar with the incident told NBC News that then-White House doctor Ronny Jackson wrote a letter to Bornstein requesting the records, but it was unclear if there was a release form attached.","Bornstein said they took the original and only copy of Trump’s charts, including lab reports under the president’s name, as well as those under the pseudonyms the office used for Trump.","Adding insult to injury, the men told Bornstein to take a framed photo of him and Trump off the waiting room wall. It now lies under a stack of papers on Bornstein’s bookshelf.","At least one legal expert thinks the raid was “sort of a burglary” because medical records were taken without proper authorization.","Michael Zeldin, a former special assistant to Robert Mueller, told CNN on Tuesday that Trump should have informed Bornstein that he was changing doctors and needed copies of the medical records sent to the new doctor.","“He may have, under HIPAA or other things, an obligation to retain those files himself,” Zeldin said. “So, in a sense, it’s sort of a burglary. They just sort of took out this stuff without any sort of legal process that authorized them to do that. And it’s a little bit frightening.”","HuffPost reached out to the White House, which did not immediately respond.","But press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said removal of the medical records was “standard procedure” for a newly elected president, according to a tweet from Boston Globe reporter Matt Viser.","Meanwhile, Bornstein still doesn’t understand why Trump was so angry about the Propecia revelations. He added that he told the Times that Trump was also taking drugs for rosacea and cholesterol as well.","“I couldn’t believe anybody was making a big deal out of a drug to grow his hair that seemed to be so important,” Bornstein told NBC News. “And it certainly was not a breach of medical trust to tell somebody they take Propecia to grow their hair. What’s the matter with that?”","Bornstein made the news in 2015 after he issued a four-paragraph letter describing Trump’s health as “astonishingly excellent,” claiming he would be “the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ae894701a00002700cdd59c.jpeg?cache=K7C9FkadxF&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Internet's Newest Mystery Involves Justin Timberlake Hooking Up With A Spice Girl","authors":"Lee Moran","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/justin-timberlake-nsync-spice-girl-ellen_us_5ae84f7ae4b055fd7fcf8851","short_description":"We really, really, really wanna know which one it was.","date":"2018-05-01"},"articleContent":["No longer is “Who bit Beyoncé?” the biggest mystery on the internet.","Former members of boy band *NSYNC reunited for a game of “Never Have I Ever” on Tuesday’s episode of “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” — and Justin Timberlake pretty much revealed that he once hooked up with a Spice Girl.","But now everyone wants to know: Was it Melanie Brown (Scary), Melanie Chisholm (Sporty), Geri Halliwell (Ginger), Emma Bunton (Baby) or Victoria Beckham (Posh)?","For the segment, host Ellen DeGeneres asked the five former bandmates (who split in 2002) a series of questions — and told them to answer by holding up a paddle which had “I Have Never” written on one side and “I Have” on the other.","DeGeneres kicked off with a softball question about who’d hooked up with someone twice their age, before quizzing them on who had been romantically involved with a Spice Girl.","Timberlake deliberated about how to answer as his former bandmates — Lance Bass, Joey Fatone, JC Chasez and Chris Kirkpatrick — held up the “I Have Never” side of their paddles.","The “Man of the Woods” singer then reluctantly began to hold up the “I Have Never” side before DeGeneres firmly placed an “I Have” sign on his thigh, and he briefly flipped his own paddle to the “I Have” side too — to the delight of the audience.","DeGeneres sadly didn’t press Timberlake — who dated Britney Spears and Cameron Diaz prior to tying the knot with Jessica Biel in 2012 ― on his answer, however."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ae86b341e000044008e418d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Tracy Morgan Says He Was A 'Crack Dealer With A Heart Of Gold'","authors":"Ron Dicker","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tracy-morgan-crack-dealer-conan_us_5ae84dc6e4b055fd7fcf855f","short_description":"\"I always kept my heart in it,\" he said on \"Conan.\"","date":"2018-05-01"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"TECH","headline":"Facebook Gets Into The Online Dating Business","authors":"Daniel Howley, Yahoo Finance","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/facebook-gets-into-the-online-dating-business_us_5ae8d176e4b06748dc8d2bbb","short_description":"Facebook (FB) wants to help get you … into a long-term relationship.

The CEO explained that the app was designed with privacy and safety in mind from the beginning. That’s incredibly important, especially when it comes to dating apps.","To get to the dating feature, you’ll simply tap the heart icon in the top right corner of your Facebook profile.

I didn’t think it would happen to people our age today’, but it did,” she told HuffPost.","One of her friends, in her late 20s, had lost her job at a university. Questioning the legality of the move, Whalley — who has worked for activism groups 38 Degrees and Avaaz — used her campaigning knowhow to try to reverse the decision. She turned to online crowdfunding to help, pleading for donations to mount a court challenge.","“It was the threat of that alone that was enough for the university to offer my friend a new job, with all the benefits,” Whalley said. “The power of the crowd is something that I experienced then, and I knew there was something there.”","As employment issues at companies like Deliveroo and Uber increasingly hit the headlines, her startup, Organise, hopes to help workers take concerns from the office, shop floor or workshop all the way to the boardroom. It has 20,000 users on its online platform and has managed to make big companies like fashion chain River Island clarify their policies for staff.","“I don’t think there’s ever a right time to step out and do it,” the 28-year-old said of giving up a salaried job to start her company in the hope of revolutionizing the fight for workers’ rights.","Organise wants workers to “team up” with others in their company, or sympathetic supporters, and make their workplace better. Anyone can become a member of the website and start a campaign.","Users sign up and can find others in their company and in similar industries, and start petitions, open letters and surveys. Whalley monitors fledgling campaigns and can quickly spot those that begin to resonate. “If there’s energy behind it, it will grow on its own,” she said. Organise will also help successful campaigns to reach more people affected by the same issue, primarily through Facebook ads.","Whalley notes that despite concerns around workers’ rights blowing up, union membership in the U.K. is at an all-time low. She hopes Organise offers a digitally savvy alternative. “We’re giving people the tools to represent themselves,” she tells HuffPost. “The idea is, simply, that wherever people are at work, whatever the problem, there is something they can do.”","The startup now has a two-person staff. Lead campaigner Usman Mohammed, 27, joined Whalley to speak to HuffPost in their shared office space at a trendy tech incubator in Shoreditch, east London. “You look at union membership going off a cliff, workers’ rights being screwed, Brexit on the horizon,” Mohammed said. “This is the perfect moment for something like this.”","A selection of Organise’s membership also receive an email survey each week which constantly provides the startup with anonymous insights into different workplaces. Engagement, the pair say, is surprisingly high. And tips from the surveys can turn into campaigns affecting thousands of workers.","They’ve already heard from aggrieved workers at big names like Amazon, U.K. television channel ITV and River Island, where they found that workers claimed they were forced to lie that they were sick to swap shifts to go to essential appointments.","“It was funerals, picking up kids and hospital appointments that were the top three things people couldn’t attend because they weren’t allowed to swap shifts,” Mohammed said.","After initially hearing from two workers at the chain, they asked one to set up a petition and sent it out to workers through targeted Facebook ads. “Within a week, we had 400 workers sign it,” Whalley said. While users sign the petition with their name and email, the organization does not share personal information with companies.","The pair also used the survey data and personal accounts to compile the sort of report you might expect to see in a corporate boardroom, and sent it to family-owned River Island, which employs around 12,000 people in Britain.","“This was then on their radar,” Mohammed said. It turned out that workers were allowed to swap one shift a month — but managers were not telling employees.","River Island told Organise that it would reiterate its policy to all shop managers. The company declined to comment when contacted by HuffPost.","“Now we’ll go back to our 400 River Islanders and see if things have changed,” Mohammed added, saying that both he and Whalley have been frustrated at the slow pace of change in big companies.","Whalley thinks traditional unions need to better adapt to digital technology. “I think unions are going to have to start shifting their communications and be open about working in a slightly different way,” Whalley said, pointing to McDonald’s and the Bakers, Food and Allied Workers Union that represents some of its workers as an example. “The Bakers Union got two branches out on strike for the first time in history [over issues of pay and contracts which gave no guarantee of work], incredible — but there were so many workers across the country wanting to do the same, yet [the union] had no method of capturing them.”","“Which is how we ended up with such a big petition,” she said of an Organise campaign which includes over 2,000 McDonald’s workers from across the U.K. pushing the company on the same issues. “We are struggling to find a way of getting these workers into a union — for that particular union, you have to join on paper.”","“You have to print off two sheets and send them in ... who owns a printer?” Mohammed said.","“It is stuff you wouldn’t expect in the ’90s, potentially, let alone now,” Whalley said. “So for us, we think the unions will catch up with some of the tech and we can work in parallel with them too.”","While the startup invites comparisons with unions, Organise is not an official representative body and doesn’t pretend to be. Whalley says the focus is on providing the tools and direction to workers who can then represent themselves.","“We are a startup and there’s only two of us so we can be very nimble,” she says. “We use a set of tools that might be completely different in a year’s time. We’re both under 30 and come from digital backgrounds.”","This flexibility means they can support workers who don’t necessarily spend time with their peers in person, she added. “Our tools work if you don’t have an office, if you’re out riding on Deliveroo, or if you work from home because it’s cheaper for your firm to do that, I think it’s a lot more agile to run.”","Chris Benson, head of employment at U.K. law firm Leigh Day, said that in the fragmented modern workplace where employees are often vulnerable, platforms like Organise can be an effective tool. “While an online platform cannot replace the bargaining power and protection that can be offered by a well-resourced trade union,” he added, “they do have a place supporting the rights of those currently beyond the reach of traditional trade unions.”","New ideas being tested include a Facebook Messenger bot which guides people through a series of questions to identify legal problems around workplace safety or sexual harassment. It allows people to upload pictures and other proof of the problems they have faced, and presents questions in simple language rather than jargon.","The idea has yet to be tested live, but it has Whalley and Mohammed excited.","“We can find out if there’s a legal basis for claims relatively easily,” Whalley said. “But it’s all in non-intimidating language. There are emojis. You can upload photos. It’s just easier.”","Ultimately, they hope that campaigning in a fluid and personalized way will suit the fragmented, digitally focused nature of work today.","“We’re building a progressive force for change and we want to be across the private sector and the public sector,” Whalley said. “People don’t speak in the coffee room because there isn’t a coffee room anymore. Workplaces, how people work, the nature of work, is completely changing. So this is about building a community that reflects modern working.”","For more content and to be part of the “This New World” community, follow our Facebook Page.","HuffPost’s “This New World” series is funded by Partners for a New Economy and the Kendeda Fund.

But I do today, and so let me say loud and proud to all my LGBT brothers and sisters, who embrace me and show me the way to be who I am, thank you so much.”","Bass also talked to HuffPost about his struggle to come out.","“The ’90s were a different time,” he said in an interview published Monday. “If you came out, if anyone knew you were gay, it was a disaster and people really flipped out. I felt like if anyone found out that I was gay, the record label would immediately drop us and the fans would hate us ― these were all the crazy things that went through my head as a teenager. So, I just trained myself into being a certain person and became that person.”","“I just thought if I even told just one single person it would get out, which it would have,” he said. “So that secret stayed with me and me only.”","Bass, now 38, first publicly came out in a 2006 interview with People magazine. The pop star has since become a staunch LGBTQ rights advocate.

The president reportedly considered firing Rosenstein last summer.","But an impeachment proceeding is unlikely to progress far. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), the Speaker of the House, and other GOP leaders in the House have largely remained silent amid calls for Rosenstein’s impeachment or firing.","USA Today also noted that the last time a member of the executive branch other than a president was impeached by the House was in 1876, when Ulysses S.

Black, University of South Carolina/The Conversation","Teacher strikes are generating a healthy focus on how far public education funding has fallen over the past decade. The full explanation, however, goes beyond basic funding cuts. It involves systematic advantages in terms of funding, students and teachers for charter schools and voucher programs as compared to traditional public schools. Increasing public teacher salaries may end the current protests, but speaking as an expert in education law and policy, I believe it won’t touch the new normal in which public education is no longer many states’ first priority.","My forthcoming research shows that, from funding and management practices to teacher and student policies, states are giving charter schools and private schools a better deal than public schools. These better deals have fueled enormous growth in charter schools and voucher programsthat is now nearly impossible to unwind.","The most basic shift occurred between 2008 and 2012. Florida and North Carolina illustrate the nationwide trend. Each cut public education funding by 20 percent or more in three years. During the same period, North Carolina lifted its cap on new charter schools and quickly doubled its charter school spending. Florida similarly changed the rules for its voucher program and quadrupled its size.","Favorable funding practices","States also passed laws to offer charters and private schools more money for each student they took. Florida increased the value of each voucher by roughly US $2,000. Nevada went even further, passing legislation that would convert every single public education dollar into a voucher dollar. While the state Supreme Court later declared the program unconstitutional, it has not stopped other states like Arizona from pursuing similar programs.","Several states also began lifting income eligibility limits. Previously, states had provided vouchers only for low-income students. But new voucher programs made them available to wealthy students as well, even those who already had access to excellent public schools.","Charter schools benefited from similar advantages in some states. Ohio and New Jersey funneled charter school funding through school districts, but the states’ antiquated funding formulas and charter reimbursement rates force districts to send charter schools more per pupil than they receive from the state.","Pennsylvania has a similar scheme, but it has proven so lopsided that it expanded deficits in Philadelphia and nearly bankrupted the Chester School District. Chester was paying the local charter school roughly $40,000 per special education student, including for those students with relatively low-cost needs. Arizona took a simpler route. It shielded charter schools from the budget cuts it was imposing on traditional public schools.","Less oversight","Once they receive the money, charter schools and private schools receiving vouchers can spend it almost any way they want. Private schools operate just as they had before. And charter schools – though technically public schools – are exempt from typical financial oversight.","Laws require public schools to award contracts through a transparent process and prohibit public schools from entering contracts that pose conflicts of interest. Charters can award contracts to almost anyone they like – and on any terms they like. This includes awarding contracts to companies that have close financial ties with the charter. A person can start a purportedly nonprofit charter school and then have that charter purchase all of its services and supplies from a company owned by that same person. As a result, the person can turn a profit on staffing, facilities, technology and supplies. National Heritage Academies runs this exact type of business model in North Carolina and continues to grow its campuses.","The same activity could constitute fraud or criminality in a public school. Yet, state law permits it for charters. As Thomas Kelley’s analysisreveals, many of the charter schools that state law calls nonprofits would not qualify for that same label under federal law.","No checks on profiteering","Even well-meaning charter schools have been unable to stop this profit-taking. The Ohio Supreme Court, for instance, found that state law dictates that everything a private charter school company purchases with public dollars – from desks to computers – belongs to the private company, not the public. The same is true of buildings that charter schools lease. Charter school operators reap their largest profits through unreasonably high lease payments on buildings that the public will never own.","States also allow private schools and charters to treat students differently. While public schools must provide disadvantaged students with a host of special services, private schools take vouchers with almost no strings attached. And they are increasingly taking high-achieving middle-income and nondisabled students who cost less to educate and typically do not demand specialized services.","Charter schools’ advantages come in their ability to recruit students and cap enrollment. Public schools must serve everyone in their community. The clearest proof that charters don’t is in the data. For instance, Newark charter schools enroll less than half the percentage of special education students and English language learners as the Newark public schools. Newark charters also enroll significantly fewer low-income students. In North Carolina, charter schools are increasingly enrolling white students, while public schools increasingly enroll students of color. In Minneapolis, 80 percent of charters are racially isolated by race, socioeconomic status or both.","The most obvious advantage, however, is with teachers. Most states exempt charter schools from teacher certification requirements. Half exempt charters from complying with high-stakes teacher evaluation systems. More than three-quarters exempt charters from the teacher salary and collective bargaining rules. In short, states permit charters to hire teachers that would be deemed unqualified in a public school and pay them less.","The need for a structural shift","The current debate over school funding must move beyond teacher salaries and whether the books in public schools are tattered. Those conversations ignore the systematic policies that disadvantage public schools. Increasing public school teachers’ salaries alone won’t fix the problem. The public school teaching force has already shrunk. Class sizes have already risen. And the rules that advantage charter and private schools remain firmly in place.","Long-term solutions require a reexamination of these preferences. As a state constitutional matter, the law requires that states make public education their first priority. It is not enough to make education one of several competing priorities. And as a practical matter, states cannot continue to ask public schools to work with whatever is left over and then criticize them for doing a poor job. This cycle creates a circular justification for dismantling public education when states should be repairing it.","Derek W. Black is Professor of Law at the University of South Carolina.

The survey of approximately 40,000 people in all 50 states, published on Tuesday, also found that Americans are increasingly supportive of LGBTQ rights almost three years since same-sex marriage was legalized across the United States.","Notably, most religious groups agreed that gay and lesbian people should not be discriminated against in the form of service-based refusals ― including black Protestants (65 percent), white mainline Protestants (60 percent), and white Catholics (59 percent). That objection was also strong among non-Christian groups, including Jews (70 percent) and Muslims (59 percent). Religiously-unaffiliated Americans, a growing demographic, strongly opposed the policy (72 percent).","The only groups that did believe that business owners should be allowed to refuse to serve gay or lesbian people on religious grounds were white evangelical Protestants and Mormons. Fifty-three percent of both groups sided with the religious business owners.","PRRI CEO Robert P. Jones said the survey results illustrate that most Americans think small businesses that are open to the public should serve all customers, regardless of the religious objections of the owners.","“White evangelical Protestants and Mormons — the only major religious groups who support these measures — are a clear minority, even among religious Americans,” Jones said in a statement. “While they may hold outsized political influence, combined they represent less than one in five Americans today.”","The Supreme Court is currently reviewing the case of a Colorado cake baker who refused to make a wedding cake for a gay couple in 2012. Masterpiece Cakeshop owner Jack Phillips, an evangelical Christian, believes it is within his First Amendment rights to refuse to make a cake for a same-sex wedding. The couple, Charlie Craig and David Mullins, claim the baker is discriminating against them because of their sexual orientation.","President Donald Trump’s administration, which has formed close alliances with evangelical Christians, has issued an amicus brief in support of the baker.","The Supreme Court is expected to rule on the case in late spring.","The Trump administration has also attempted to undercut federal protections for LGBTQ people. In October, Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a directive telling executive branch agencies to accommodate religious liberty to the “greatest extent practicable and permitted by law.” Civil rights groups were alarmed by the move, saying that the language about religious liberty merely gave people with religious objections to same-sex relationships the “license to discriminate.”","According to the PRRI study, 70 percent of Americans were supportive of laws that would protect LGBTQ people from discrimination in jobs, public accommodations and housing. This support was robust among both Christian and non-Christian religious groups, including Jews (80 percent), religiously-unaffiliated Americans (79 percent), white Catholics (74 percent), white mainline Protestants (71 percent), Mormons (69 percent), black Protestants (65 percent), and white evangelical Protestants (54 percent).","After the Supreme Court’s 2015 landmark decision legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide, popular support increased dramatically, according to the PRRI study. In fact, the organization found that for the first time, a majority of all racial and ethnic groups now support same-sex marriage. Researchers documented double-digit increases in support among white (53 percent vs. 63 percent), black (41 percent vs. 52 percent), and Hispanic (51 percent vs. 61 percent) Americans between 2013 and 2017. Majorities of Asian-Pacific Islander Americans (72 percent) and Native Americans (56 percent) also expressed support for marriage equality.","Robyn Henderson-Espinoza, a queer, Latinx theologian based in Nashville, Tennessee, told HuffPost they believe that communities of color have become more comfortable talking about sexuality and same-sex desire.","“I think our communities of color are beginning to untangle the compulsory heteronormativity that has shaped our communities,” Henderson-Espinoza told HuffPost by email.","Most religious groups also support marriage equality, including white mainline Protestants (67 percent) and white Catholics (66 percent). Among non-Christian groups, the religiously unaffiliated (80 percent), Jews (77 percent), and a slim majority of Muslims (51 percent) supported same-sex marriage.","Support for marriage equality was lowest among white evangelical Protestants, with 34 percent supporting and 58 percent opposed. Mormons were also opposed to same-sex marriage, with 40 percent supporting it and 53 percent opposed.","However, change is apparent even among these groups. PRRI found that opposition to same-sex marriage dropped 13 percentage points among white evangelicals since 2013, and 15 percentage points among Mormons since 2014. Moreover, the study found that the younger generations within these conservative religious groups are becoming more supportive of same-sex marriage: Majorities of both young white evangelical Protestants and young Mormons now favor legalizing same-sex marriage (53 percent and 52 percent).","Leaders at Affirmation, an advocacy group for LGBTQ Mormons and their allies, said it was encouraged by the increasing acceptance shown by young Mormons.","“This trend of visibility among LGBT Mormons will only increase,” the group’s executive committee said in a statement.","Brandan Robertson, a queer Christian activist and senior pastor of California’s Missiongathering Christian Church, told HuffPost that younger evangelicals have grown up in a world where most of them know or know of LGBTQ people.","“Whether at work or school or seeing Adam Rippon on ‘Dancing With The Stars,’ it’s impossible to not see LGBT+ people and also see us as dignified, equal human beings,” Robertson wrote in an email.","“The power of proximity and the power of empathy are what change hearts and minds, and it’s clear that as the older evangelical establishment fades, there will be a much more grounded and inclusive wave of leaders coming behind them,” he added."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ae86f561a00004400cdd545.jpeg?cache=jNtHaf7SMi&ops=crop_0_1021_3700_2659%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"CRIME","headline":"Janice Dickinson Says She Won't Feel 'Vindicated' Until Cosby Is Jailed","authors":"Alanna Vagianos","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/janice-dickinson-says-she-wont-feel-vindicated-until-cosby-is-in-jail_us_5ae8641be4b02baed1be0f1f","short_description":"Cosby was found guilty of sexual assault last week, but sentencing has not been set.","date":"2018-05-01"},"articleContent":["Former model Janice Dickinson said she’s still “walking on eggshells” even after the guilty verdict handed down against comedian Bill Cosby last week on charges of sexually assaulting another woman.","“I don’t feel vindicated yet,” Dickinson, who accused Cosby of drugging and raping her in Lake Tahoe in 1982, told People magazine. “I want to know what the sentencing is.”","Dickinson, 63, was one of five women who testified during the sexual assault trial in Pennsylvania to offer evidence of Cosby’s prior bad acts.

Instead, after a woman who asked to remain anonymous and a former NBC anchor, Linda Vester, accused him of inappropriate behavior last week, Brokaw fired off a late-night, hyperbole-laced email to colleagues calling the allegations “a drive by shooting” and “a torrent of unsubstantiated criticism and attacks.”","But more surprising than the longtime anchor’s fervent denial of harassment is that at least 115 current and former colleagues have signed a letter of support, attesting to how Brokaw has treated them with “fairness and respect” and is “a man of tremendous decency and integrity” who helped many of them advance their careers.","This type of missive, which network heavyweights such as Rachel Maddow and Mika Brzezinski signed, derails a much-needed conversation about sexual harassment and assault that’s finally happening because of the Me Too movement. And it sets a harmful example for the many workplaces figuring out how to deal with predatory behavior.","Me Too has been an important corrective to the many false assumptions society holds about sexual assault. The cascade of famous men accused of sexual harassment or violence has exposed the fact that predators are multifaceted human beings. They can tout progressive politics on a national platform, act supportively toward colleagues and dote on their children, friends and partners and still be capable of masturbating in front of or groping women.","When a group of women who had worked with Al Franken during his run on “Saturday Night Live” and eight of his former female staffers came out with statements about how Franken, who resigned from the Senate in January after being accused of sexual misconduct, had always treated them with the “utmost respect,” media outlets quickly pointed out the faulty logic: “The number of women a man didn’t assault does not matter if there are others he did,” wrote Molly Roberts in The Washington Post. “There are plenty of people the Zodiac Killer did not murder.”","Franken had at least admitted to and apologized for his predatory actions by the time his former colleagues rose to his defense. But Brokaw’s vehement denial of the allegations, which include groping and forcible kissing, means the letter supporting him sends a dangerous message: that his accusers are liars. The clear subtext of those three short paragraphs is that a man who has treated more than 100 people with fairness and respect in the workplace could not have sexually harassed a few women and that the accused’s reputation is more important than these women’s word. (Variety corroborated Vester’s account of sexual harassment with her journal entries from the 1990s and in conversations with two of her friends.) The majority of sexual harassment and assault victims don’t report their crimes for this very reason — fear that friends, family members, colleagues, HR departments or the legal system won’t believe them.","Paula Brantner, who runs a consulting company that offers sexual harassment workshops to nonprofits and businesses, said these kinds of written defenses replicate the exact power dynamic that prevents employees from coming forward with complaints. “The pressure to go along and not say anything about harassment is similar to the pressure to go along and sign a letter of support of someone powerful in a particular workplace,” she said. “People are going to think they have to pick sides.”","An unnamed NBC News staffer told Page Six that employees felt they had to add their names to a document defending a man who has worked at the network for more than 50 years and who co-anchored its flagship news program for 22 years. “We felt forced to sign the letter supporting Brokaw. We had no choice, particularly the lower level staffers,” the employee said, according to the Page Six. Variety reported that in a memo, the company instructed its on-air reporters to refer to the letter in any segments about Brokaw.","When influential players in a workplace openly side with the accused, it becomes difficult for other employees with relevant information or other harassment allegations to come forward.","“’You think, ‘Wow, 65 of my peers are going to hold that against me or think I’m lying,’” said Brantner. “It really sends a strong message about the futility of speaking out.”","At this point NBC has said it does not plan to internally investigate Brokaw’s behavior anyway, according to network sources who spoke to Page Six.","“Letters of support for employees accused of sexual harassment contribute to the legitimate fear individuals have of coming forward,” Rory Gerberg, a workplace consultant who specializes in sexual harassment training, told HuffPost via email. “If we want to be able to change #metoo, it’s essential employees avoid questioning or shaming the individual coming forward.”","A letter of support can also come back to haunt its signers, especially if it is issued before the allegations are properly investigated. Since Brokaw’s colleagues penned their written defense, a third woman has come forward, accusing him of forcibly kissing her in 1968. After the letter in support of Franken, six more women came forward to describe instances of groping and forcible kissing.","NBC morning show host Megyn Kelly, not usually known for her feminist views, recently warned Brokaw’s champions, “You don’t know what you don’t know.” After she and nine other women accused then–Fox News CEO Roger Ailes of sexual harassment in 2016, a few people who initially defended him later expressed their regret in interviews and on social media.","It’s understandably difficult for people to grapple with the fact that someone they trust ― whether it’s a celebrity they watch on TV or a friend ― is facing allegations of predatory behavior. But mounting a premature defense of the accused is not the solution. As the Me Too movement is encouraging more women to come forward and forcing workplaces to take their complaints seriously, a letter supporting an alleged sexual predator enforces their silence."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ae8ca6e2000004100b902c9.jpeg?cache=LNtB9ZfDKM&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Tom Hanks, Rita Wilson 'Keep Love Alive' With Charming Throwback Anniversary Pic","authors":"Ed Mazza","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tom-hanks-rita-wilson-anniversary-throwback_us_5ae81d66e4b02baed1bd98bf","short_description":"The couple just celebrated 30 years of marriage.","date":"2018-05-01"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"What Robert Mueller Reportedly Wants To Ask Donald Trump","authors":"Nick Visser","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/robert-mueller-questions-for-trump_us_5ae7bc27e4b04aa23f264b21","short_description":"The New York Times obtained a list of possible questions for the president.","date":"2018-05-01"},"articleContent":["Special counsel Robert Mueller hopes to ask President Donald Trump dozens of open-ended questions as part of his inquiry into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.","Many of those questions, which were published by The New York Times on Monday, focus on determining if Trump obstructed justice through his firings of FBI Director James Comey and national security adviser Michael Flynn, or his attempts to fire Mueller himself, among other events.","“What efforts were made to reach out to Mr. Flynn about seeking immunity or possible pardon?” reads one of the queries supplied to the Times by an unnamed official separate from the president’s legal team. “What consideration and discussions did you have regarding terminating the special counsel in June of 2017?” another asks.","Read the full list here.","The questions shed light on what’s been a tight-lipped investigation and show Mueller is homing in on the president’s behavior in office. Some of the inquiries hope to shed light on Trump’s interactions, if there are any, with Russian officials or those connected to the Kremlin during the campaign.","Trump himself has publicly said he’d be willing to talk with Mueller and has vehemently denied there was any collusion with the Russians during the campaign. He said in January he was “looking forward” to speaking with the special counsel.","In response to the Times report, Trump on Tuesday lashed out at the investigation.","The president’s lawyers have cautioned against the interview and have sought to strictly limit the terms of any sit-down, worried that Trump could go off-script and end up making false statements. The Times noted that four people in the president’s orbit have already pleaded guilty to lying to federal investigators.","The questions obtained by the Times are said to be the result of months of negotiations between the special counsel and Trump’s squadron of lawyers. The Times noted that the back and forth led to Mueller providing his ideal list to Trump’s former lead lawyer in the Russia inquiry, John Dowd, in March.","Dowd, who had urged Trump to reject any request for an interview in the investigation, was reportedly even more wary about a meeting after seeing the list.

Though his controversial ideas make his candidacy a longshot, Yang, a 43-year-old father of two, hopes at least to draw attention to what he says is a looming employment crisis.","A successful tech entrepreneur himself, Yang expects that the proliferation of industrial robotics and artificial intelligence will put millions — even tens of millions — of people out of a job. Worse, he says, America is completely unprepared to cope with this shift in the employment landscape.","So he’s running for the Democratic nomination for president in 2020 on a platform of universal basic income (UBI) with the tagline “let’s put humanity first.” He hopes that a $1,000-a-month stipend for all U.S. citizens can ease the pain of a future where much less human labor will be needed.","“I think we’re going through the greatest transition in human history and we’re dealing with it terribly,” Yang said. “We’re dealing with it by pretending it’s not happening.”","With average monthly rents easily topping $1,000 in big U.S. cities, Yang’s proposed UBI wouldn’t be enough for most people to live on, or at least not enough for the kind of life most Americans prefer. Instead, he believes it would supplement people’s current income and help ease financial anxiety for the underemployed. In April, the presidential hopeful announced he would put his UBI proposal into action and provide a New Hampshire resident with $12,000 throughout 2019.","Endorsements for Yang poured in after he announced his candidacy in February — especially from the tech industry, which has been having a love affair with the concept of UBI. Yang received high-profile media attention from outlets such as Vanity Fair and The New York Times.","Preparing For An Automated Future","Growing up, Yang wasn’t the most popular kid in school. In his book The War on Normal People, he describes his childhood in self-deprecating fashion: “I grew up a skinny Asian kid in upstate New York who was often ignored or picked on — like one of the kids from ‘Stranger Things’ but nerdier and with fewer friends.”","After graduating from Brown University and Columbia Law School, Yang brought his talents to startups, eventually helming a test-prep company that was later acquired by Kaplan in 2009. Yet he couldn’t shake the feeling that things were getting worse for the average American.","Yang took the money he earned from the sale and used it to set up a nonprofit, Venture for America, to create jobs in cities hit hardest by the financial crisis. But along the way, he became convinced that new job creation could no longer keep pace with automation.","UBI enthusiasts often point to studies predicting that the pace of automation is about to hit warp speed. One widely cited Oxford University study, for example, estimates 47 percent of jobs in the U.S. are at risk of being automated in the next 20 years.","President Donald Trump was elected in part, Yang said, because Americans were becoming impatient with the steady loss of secure middle-class jobs.","“Donald Trump diagnosed the problem very powerfully, and he’s president because of it,” Yang said. “The issue is that the solutions are nonsense: Hating immigrants, trying to freeze time or turn the clock backwards. We have to do the exact opposite. We have to accelerate our society and economy forward.”","That acceleration, he believes, means saying goodbye to the era of dependence on stable, full-time employment. The country’s low 4.1 percent unemployment rate, Yang said, is masking a much more ominous trend: underemployment. Definitions of underemployment vary, but in general, it means those who are working part time because they can’t find full-time work.","A March 2018 Bureau of Labor Statistics report puts the number of “involuntary part-time workers” at 5 million. Furthermore, there are a lot of people “marginally attached” to the workforce — meaning they’ve been searching for a job in the past 12 months but haven’t found one — and they don’t show up in the unemployment rate either. And the situation, Yang believes, is about to get much worse.","“We have to start facing facts,” Yang said. “Self-driving cars and trucks are real and are going to eliminate millions of jobs. Artificial intelligence is real, and it’s going to eliminate millions of jobs. Even before we get there, 30 percent of malls are going to close, and one out of 10 Americans works in retail.”","Some think a UBI is unnecessary because there will always be jobs — even if we haven’t invented them yet. People in the ’60s had the same fears around automation and technology, but no one could have foreseen jobs of the 21st century such as social media or app development.","“Throughout history we’ve heard that this or that technological advancement would mean the end of jobs,” says Michael D. Tanner, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute who researches social welfare policy, health care reform and Social Security. “The large-scale movement of workers from agriculture to manufacturing, as well as the advent of the industrial revolution and its substitution of machine labor for individual hand labor, were greeted with complaints that there would soon be no more jobs.”","Tanner pointed to the time President Franklin Roosevelt actually slowed down government research and development during the Great Depression, out of fear that new inventions would further limit already-scarce jobs.","“Yet, somehow, the creative destruction of capitalism has always resulted in new jobs,” Tanner said. “The burden lies with UBI supporters to explain why this time is different.”","How future industries will affect job availability remains up for debate. Last year, research firm Gartner said that artificial intelligence will create more human jobs than automation eliminates. But the most ardent UBI proponents believe that, even if additional jobs are created, most people will be unable to upgrade their skills fast enough to keep up with the fickle and chaotic job market of the future.","An Argument For Free Money","Universal basic income is not a modern invention. In the 1960s, both civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. and conservative economist Milton Friedman argued for the idea. Within the last decade, tech titans such as Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk have thrown their support behind it, with the former arguing during a 2017 Harvard Commencement speech that it would promote innovation, giving “everyone a cushion to try new things.”","The idea tends to get more support from Democrats than Republicans, but has yet to break into mainstream political discourse. Americans are split over the idea, according to a recent Gallup/Northwestern poll that showed 48 percent in support of UBI and 52 percent who said they oppose it.","For Yang, no argument for UBI was more persuasive than that of Andy Stern, the former president of the Service Employees International Union, which, with 2 million members, is one of the largest unions in the country. Stern’s 2016 book, Raising the Floor: How a Universal Basic Income Can Renew Our Economy and Rebuild the American Dream, illustrates how even labor leaders themselves are giving up on the idea of preserving full-time jobs in the era of automation and artificial intelligence.","The idea of guaranteed money from the government might feel at odds with traditional “American values” of self-reliance. Yet Alaska, which voted for Trump in 2016, already gives its residents a guaranteed payment every year from its Alaska Permanent Fund, a $60 billion state fund generated by oil revenues. Since 1982, every man, woman, and child who meets certain state residency requirements has received a yearly stipend, which can be as high as $2,000.","Paying For It","When it comes to the idea of a UBI, objections abound. Instead of viewing the proposal as a cushion that a majority of the population will need in an increasingly chaotic world, some see it as a license to be lazy.","Perhaps no objection is greater than affordability. UBI proposals differ, but Yang gives his plan a price tag of $2 trillion, which he says would be paid for in four ways. To harvest the gains from automation, the U.S. would need to pass a value-added tax on production and consumption, which would fall on most of the consumer economy — essentially adding a tax to everything we buy. Money currently spent on income support would be redirected to the UBI. Public spending on incarceration, homelessness, health care and other services would be lower, he posits, because the problems they address would be much less acute with a UBI in place. And additional tax revenue would be created by economic growth generated by a UBI: One recent study indicates that a UBI would put a greater amount of cash into circulation.","Some libertarians, such as political scientist and author Charles Murray, believe a UBI would be a better use of money than continuing to fund our current safety net, which tops $1 trillion per year according to some estimates. Murray sees UBI as “the least damaging way for the government to transfer wealth from some citizens to others,” but warns that it must replace the current welfare bureaucracy.","“If the guaranteed income is an add-on to the existing system, it will be as destructive as its critics fear,” Murray wrote in an article for The Wall Street Journal promoting UBI.","Another objection: Won’t handing out cash simply increase inflation? Not according to a July 2017 study by researchers at the Naval Postgraduate School, the University of Geneva, and Northwestern University. If there’s any effect on inflation, it would be extremely mild, the report suggests. Such studies, though, have not stopped some UBI detractors from calling the idea “inflation on a stick.”","Moving Forward","One of the biggest obstacles facing UBI proponents is the fact that most high-profile Democrats are lukewarm — if not implacably opposed — to the idea.","Take Hillary Clinton: “I was fascinated by this idea, as was my husband, and we spent weeks working with our policy team to see if it could be viable enough to include in my campaign. We would call it ‘Alaska for America,’” Clinton wrote in her 2017 book What Happened. “Unfortunately, we couldn’t make the numbers work.”","Joe Biden calls UBI proponents “class clueless,” fearing that it would de-emphasize work. And Bernie Sanders, while admitting he’s “sympathetic” to the idea, is much more animated by a $15 minimum wage.","Yang knows the odds of capturing the Democratic nomination, and then the White House, are unlikely. But he’s already scored endorsements from the aforementioned Andy Stern; Albert Wenger, managing partner at Union Square Ventures; and Tony Hsieh, CEO of Zappos, as well as executives and alumni from Google, LinkedIn, and Facebook.","In a campaign like his, there are multiple ways to measure success, Yang said. “If I run for president, and I succeed in elevating universal basic income to become mainstream political wisdom, then that would be a mammoth victory.”","For more content and to be part of the “This New World” community, join our Facebook Group.","HuffPost’s “This New World” series is funded by Partners for a New Economy and The Kendeda Fund.

Any Medicaid expansion bill that makes it out of the General Assembly will carry with it new work requirements for Medicaid enrollees, a priority for the GOP at large and for President Donald Trump’s administration.","Democrats in the Virginia legislature have tried in vain for six years to persuade their GOP counterparts that accepting federal dollars to extend Medicaid coverage to poor adults is the right thing to do. Accepting a work-requirements policy that would create bureaucratic obstacles to eligible Virginians appears to be the compromise needed to win the bigger fight.","“Most of the Democrats in the Senate are prepared to accept the work requirement in order to get expansion passed,” said state Sen. Janet Howell (D), who represents parts of Fairfax and Arlington counties in Northern Virginia. “We have hundreds of thousands of Virginians who have no health insurance, largely because we in Virginia have a very stingy Medicaid program,” she said.","“My preference would be not to have a work requirement, but I don’t see any way to get expansion passed unless we have one,” Howell said.","Gov. Ralph Northam (D) has neither endorsed the work requirement nor rejected it, but he has said he won’t accept a budget from the General Assembly that doesn’t include Medicaid expansion.","The Medicaid expansion debate in Virginia spans back to 2013, when former Gov. Robert McDonnell (R) rejected Medicaid expansion. Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D), who served from 2014 until January, was unable to bring the GOP-led legislature around on the issue.","Then Northam won the gubernatorial election and Democrats gained 15 seats in the 100-member House of Delegates last November, altering the course of the debate and setting Medicaid expansion on a path to becoming a reality. The GOP now has a one-vote majority in both chambers of the legislature, and Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax (D) can cast tie-breaking votes in the 40-member Senate.","Thirty-one states and the District of Columbia have implemented Medicaid expansions. Louisiana was the most recent state to do so via legislation when Gov. John Bel Edwards (D) signed a bill in 2016. Maine voters also approved an expansion via a ballot initiative last year, although Gov. Paul LePage (R) thus far has refused to implement it.","Virginia lawmakers are still working out the final form of the work requirement. The latest version, based on the policy enacted in Arkansas last month, would make a person’s Medicaid coverage contingent on them working at least 20 hours a month for the first three months. The minimum number of hours gradually increases, eventually reaching 80 hours a month after a year on the program. There are other means of meeting this requirement, including being enrolled in school or a job-training training program, or volunteering.","Anyone who fails to meet one of these standards for more than three months during a year losses their health coverage and has to wait until the following year to reapply.","There are numerous exceptions in the most recent version of the legislation, including for children, people over 55 years old, people with disabilities, people with “serious mental illness,” women who or are pregnant or have just given birth, those determined to be “medically frail” and people who are the primary caregivers for children or adults with disabilities.","The Virginia House passed two budgets this year that included a Medicaid expansion, with every House Democrat and 19 Republicans voting for the version that passed this month. While most GOP legislators still oppose Medicaid expansion, two Senate Republicans have broken ranks with their leadership and expressed support for it, giving the legislation enough votes to pass the upper chamber.","Sen. Emmett Hanger Jr., who represents portions of the Shenandoah Valley and has expressed support for Medicaid expansion in the past, last month became the first Republican in the upper chamber this year to come out in favor of the policy. Weeks later, Sen. Frank Wagner (R) of Virginia Beach joined him. Both senators cited a work requirement as a prerequisite for their support. House Republicans who voted for expansion with a work requirement pitch it as reforming Medicaid, not simply enlarging it.","The deal is all but done except for some of the details, said Sen. George Barker (D), whose Northern Virginia district covers parts of Fairfax and Prince WIlliam counties and part of Alexandria.","“I don’t think there are any obstacles that are presenting a problem,” said Barker. “I think that once we all sit down together ― and I’ve already talked to some of my Republican colleagues who are on board as well as some others who are on the fence right now ― I feel confident that we can reach agreement.”","The impasse over Medicaid expansion remains the primary reason the General Assembly hasn’t agreed on the state’s two-year budget.","Shifting Politics In The Old Dominion","The work requirement provides Republicans with political cover for changing their position on Medicaid expansion, said John McGlennon, a government professor at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg.","This newfound support for Medicaid expansion among some Republicans is the result of a mix of other factors, including the party’s poor showing during the House elections last year and specific regional issues, McGlennon said.","“Republicans were really stunned that they lost the 15 seats in the House of Delegates, and they recognize they had to probably do something,” he said. “They were getting a lot of pressure from the medical professionals in Southwest Virginia, where they’re closing hospitals and there’s no funding for clinics and doctors aren’t getting paid.”","As for the minority party in the House, McGlennon said, “The Democrats were willing to pass what the Republican Speaker was willing to swallow.”","And given the growing strength of the Democratic Party in Virginia, Democrats have reason to believe they can simply repeal the work requirement when they eventually take control of the legislature, McGlennon said.","The fact that Trump and Congress failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act last year also is a factor, said Del. David Toscano, who represents the Charlottesville area and is the Democratic Leader in the House of Delegates. “Given that, you have to make the best of it,” he said.","In addition, those Republicans who now support Medicaid expansion also have come around to the Democratic arguments that expanding coverage, coupled with the infusion of federal money that comes with it, will be a boon for Virginia, Toscano said.","“People like the notion of Medicaid expansion because it’s going to help a lot of people get access to health care they wouldn’t otherwise have. So, for them, it is a moral imperative,” Toscano said. “But when you start looking at the numbers, it becomes an economic imperative for the budget because it allows us to do things with federal dollars that we could not previously do.”","Under the Affordable Care Act, the federal government pays at least 90 percent of the cost of those newly eligible for Medicaid. The House-passed bill includes an assessment on Virginia hospitals that would cover the state’s share.","In addition, expanding Medicaid would enable Virginia to reduce spending on other programs that finance health care for uninsured people, freeing up more than $370 million the state can use for other priorities.","“That’s not chicken feed, and it gets used to pay for things like teacher raises,” Toscano said.","And if Virginia’s experience with Medicaid expansion matches that of other states, the incoming federal money would provide a boost to the economy. It could create about 30,000 jobs in the state, according to the Commonwealth Institute for Fiscal Analysis, a Richmond-based think tank.","More Coverage, More Care","The Affordable Care Act calls for Medicaid to be expanded to anyone who earns up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, which is about $16,000 for a single person. But in 2012, the Supreme Court ruled that states could refuse the Medicaid expansion, leaving uninsured millions the ACA would have covered.","Currently, childless adults who don’t have a disability can’t qualify for Medicaid in Virginia, no matter how poor they are.","Low-income parents are eligible if they make up to 38 percent of the poverty level, which is less than $4,600 a year. Pregnant women earning up to 205 percent of poverty ― about $25,000 ― can sign up for Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program. Adults with disabilities are eligible for Medicaid if their incomes don’t exceed 80 percent of poverty, or about $9,700, and if their assets are worth less than $2,000.","In Virginia, the proposed expansion would provide coverage to almost 400,000 people, according to the state’s Department of Medical Assistance Services.","“We’re really excited for people to get insurance so that they can get to the specialists they need to get the care that they need for their chronic disease,” said Paula Tomko, executive director of New Canton-based Central Virginia Health Services, which served about 43,000 patients at 16 locations last year.","Tomko said 32 percent of its patients, or 13,000 people, would be eligible for Medicaid under the expansion.","“We see how much difference access to coverage can make in caring for a patient,” Tomko said.","A Bitter Pill","Adding a work requirement to the program, however, likely means fewer people will get help. Kentucky, which this year became the first state to impose such a requirement, estimates that its new work requirement, along with other policies, will reduce the Medicaid rolls by as many as 95,000 people, for example.","“The potential for loss of coverage is going to be significant,” said Cindy Mann, a partner at the consulting firm Manatt Health in Washington D.C., who oversaw the Medicaid program under President Barack Obama. The Obama administration refused to grant states’ requests for work requirements, arguing that limiting benefits to people who are working was illegal under Medicaid’s statutory mandate to provide health care.","The Trump administration opened the door to including a work requirement in January when the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services notified states it would consider approving such policies.","Arkansas, Indiana and Kentucky have already received approval for work requirements. Utah, Arizona, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, New Hampshire and Wisconsin have also applied for them, and other states are sure to follow.","While Trump administration officials and Republicans at the state level tout work requirements as a means to lift low-income people out of poverty and improve their health, there is scant evidence to support these claims. The vast majority of Medicaid enrollees and people who’d be eligible in non-expansion states are working or in families with at least one worker.","“There’s really no indication that the problem is people not having sufficient motivation,” said Mann. “People may lack skill training, people may lack day care, they may lack transportation ― and there is no additional support available.”","The policy also unjustly tars low-income people as “slackers” who refuse to help themselves, said Kay Crane, CEO of Danville-based Piedmont Access to Health Services, which operates community health centers in Southside Virginia, near the North Carolina border.","“Unless you’re in their shoes and you understand their struggle, it’s real easy to sit back and say, ‘Oh, they ought to get a job,’” Crane said. “Many of our patients that we’re talking about work one, if not two, jobs just to put food on the table.” Forcing them to prove they’re working could merely tie them up in red tape, making it difficult even for people who qualify for Medicaid to get and keep it, she said.","Implementing and enforcing work requirements also is expensive for states.

DoctHERs, a telemedicine platform in Pakistan, connects unemployed or underemployed female doctors like Sultan to patients in remote areas. Despite having one of the lowest doctor-to-patient ratios in the world, pressure to prioritize families over careers means that around half of female medical school graduates never enter the workforce.","For those who do overcome myriad obstacles to practice medicine, many drop out of the labor force when they are married or have children. DoctHERs is “about them being able to participate in the workforce and feel a sense of autonomy,” says Asher Hasan, the organization’s co-founder.","Pakistan has one of the world’s lowest rates of female participation in the labor market — it is estimated only 25 percent of women over the age of 15 work. However, there are signs that technology is gradually transforming women’s participation in some areas of the labor force.","Pakistan accounts for 8 percent of the worldwide digital gig economy, trailing only India, Bangladesh and the United States. The rise of gig work (flexible, piecemeal jobs), say some experts, has provided many Pakistani women a foothold in the new digital economy, in some cases shifting women into the primary breadwinner role.","“The gig economy is a unique economic opportunity for women in Pakistan... allowing women to earn a living or access a service from the home when cultural constraints may not allow them to work outside the home,” says Saadia Zahidi, author of Fifty Million Rising: The New Generation of Working Women Transforming the Muslim World.","Sultan normally works in the evenings, when her husband can take over childcare. She selects the number of days and hours she works, and gets paid per video consultation. “They can switch their availability on and off,” adds DoctHERs’ Hasan. “They get to decide their own hours.”","DoctHERs has also been a boon for patients. “People love the idea of having a doctor a message away,” Sultan says. “They don’t have to go to the clinics and wait two hours for an appointment.” Some also feel more comfortable divulging health problems to a woman over a screen. Recently, a female patient disclosed to Sultan that she had been suffering from urinary incontinence for over a decade. In rural Pakistan, it was difficult to find a female doctor to speak to about what the patient saw as an embarrassing ailment.","The digitization of the gig economy hasn’t provided opportunities to everyone, however. Pakistan’s Internet penetration rate is only 22 percent, so most can’t take advantage of technology-based work platforms that favor the urban, English-speaking elite.","And while some digital platforms can afford women greater opportunities, they can also reinforce industry biases and patterns of gender segregation in hiring.","“There is evidence that women are more likely to be hired for “female” jobs (secretarial, writing/translation), but less likely to be hired for “male” jobs (IT and programming),” says University of Southern California professor Hernan Galperin, the lead researcher behind the Future of Work in the Global South initiative. “This type of gender discrimination tends to reinforce sorting mechanisms that lead women to lower-paying jobs and careers,” says Galperin. A 2017 report from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development highlighted that women in the gig economy might experience reduced job quality while benefiting from more flexibility.","Moreover, the problems that bedevil the gig economy worldwide do not vanish in emerging economies — most positions lack insurance plans, regular sick days or vacation time. However, the absence of these safety nets is felt less acutely in economies that rarely provide them in the first place. “In Pakistan, we don’t have a trend of health insurance,” says 31-year-old Faiza Yousuf, a freelance app tester and business analyst in Karachi.","For workers who have never benefited from traditional economic protections, the upsides of the gig economy may outweigh the drawbacks. Yousuf finds jobs through freelance marketplaces like Upwork, a global platform for independent contractors.","For her part, she hasn’t experienced any disadvantage from being a woman in the gig economy. Part of the appeal of freelancing online is that international clients “don’t care about your gender,” Yousuf says. “It helps women, especially the ones who are swamped with care work.” Yousuf and her brother are their parents’ primary caretakers, tending to health issues while working full time. Yousuf says the gig economy offers her economic independence and the flexibility to pursue the kind of work she wants.","In a leafy Lahore neighborhood, 28-year-old Farzana Asif is wearing a crisp, gray uniform. In 2013, her husband paid approximately $1,300 to find a job in a Dubai hotel. When he arrived in Dubai, he discovered he had been conned and the job did not exist. The couple had scrounged together the recruitment fee by selling Asif’s jewelry, taking out loans and exhausting their savings.","“It was very difficult for me,” Asif said, whose baby was just 13 days old then. “I had to take care of my child and pay for the household.”","Before marriage, Asif worked at a beauty salon, earning $127 a month. At times, upper-class women would ask Asif to drop by their homes for a pedicure or waxing. The job was inconsistent and the pay highly variable. Since it operated informally, Asif often accepted whatever paltry sum the women doled out.","At-home beauticians have long contended with a lack of standardized rates and exclusion from the formal labor force, says Shameelah Ismail, one of four co-founders of GharPar, an online social enterprise that allows women to work as independent beauticians, delivering at-home services to women across Lahore. By connecting women to the GharPar platform, Ismail says, “the informal market is converted to the formal.”","Asif is now the household’s breadwinner, sometimes bringing home up to $500 a month as a freelance beautician for GharPar. “I’m the only one working in my family,” Asif says.","GharPar has echoes of the Uber model: A beautician receives a request on her phone, which she can either accept or decline. She gets paid on commission, and absorbs the hard costs of running a business, including paying for her own uniform, beauty toolkit and transportation. At the end of a service, the user rates the beautician.","Most salons only pay a fixed salary of around $150 a month, Ismail says, regardless of the number of customers. “In my salon job, even if I put more work into the job, my salary was the same at the end of the month,” Asif says. “Here, if I put in more work, I get paid more; if I put in less, I get less. It’s fair.”","Still, while GharPar has enabled women to become breadwinners, not all men have approved of women in their household taking the lead economic role. “Male members of the family think: ‘If my wife or daughter becomes financially independent, I won’t be able to control her,’” Ismail says.","For this reason, many of the freelance beauticians GharPar contracts have their husband or a brother drive them to a client’s house. “The men see it as a family business where they’re also stakeholders,” says GharPar co-founder Arooj Ismail.","Ultimately, according to women like Asif, the gig economy’s flexible, part-time work model — long derided as precarious and exploitative in West — may prove beneficial, accommodating dual mother/worker roles and allowing women to join the labor force at times when they would usually drop out to concentrate on their families.","“After getting married, I wasn’t working at all because I had a child,” says Asif. Today, she typically sees two to three clients a day and juggles parenting and work. “I don’t need to ask anyone for money because I earn my own money.”","“The entire purpose was to give economic independence,” Shameelah Ismail says. “If we want the economy to boom, we need to tap the women. When they see their mothers are the ones earning and the main breadwinners, their mindsets change. They are more open to women working, and the entire society changes.”","For more content and to be part of the ‘This New World’ community, follow our Facebook Page.\n\nHuffPost’s ‘This New World’ series is funded by Partners for a New Economy and the Kendeda Fund.

I just think that if in fact this conversion to love is genuine on your part ... then it’s inappropriate to drag the negativity of the past with it.”","In 2007, Adams had performed Donda West’s breast reduction surgery and other procedures. She died the day after the procedures were performed of “coronary artery disease and multiple post-operative factors due to or as a consequence of liposuction and mammoplasty,” according to the Los Angeles County Coroner’s report. She was 58 years old. The coroner had found no evidence of issues with the surgery the doctor performed.","In his letter to the artist, Adams suggested that Kanye West should put a picture of his cousin Stephan Scoggins on his next album instead. The doctor also went into detail about Donda West’s surgery and recovery.","Scoggins, a registered nurse, was designated as her primary caregiver after the surgery. Scoggins left Donda West alone because she “had appeared to be better,” Adams wrote, quoting the coroner’s report. The nurse was later investigated for his role in her post-surgery care.\n\nAdams’ letter further reads:\n\nMs. West went to bed and at that time she said her chest was tight and her throat sore. The decedent got out of bed, but was not described as being anxious or confused. When she went back to bed, pillows were beneath her legs and a single pillow was beneath her head.

Other weapons lean against the wall in Kemp’s “study” in the ad.","Some viewers took Kemp’s “aw shucks” attitude in the ad as an attempt at down-home humor (or an “audition” for “Saturday Night Live”) and found it hilarious. But most people responding on Facebook and YouTube were horrified that Kemp appeared to be threatening a minor with a gun.","“After young children have lost their life to gunfire you set there flopping around a gun with a minor. Wow,” wrote one viewer on Facebook.","Another called it “all sorts of stupid.” Others were furious that Kemp seemed to fortify negative stereotypes about Georgia.","Kemp hadn’t yet defended the ad by late Monday. He directed a supporter on Facebook to his campaign website.","Atlanta TV-11 issued a statement Monday saying that, despite an onslaught of complaints about the ad, it can’t be removed or altered because the Federal Communications Commission’s “political broadcast rules prohibit television stations from refusing or altering political advertising from any legally qualified candidate.”","Kemp is one of seven GOP candidates hoping to replace Republican Gov. Nathan Deal. The battle among them for Georgia’s gun-toting voters is intense. Earlier in April, former Republican state Sen.

That does underscore the power of the media and political rhetoric that day in and day out paints a narrative of Muslims in a certain way, that Muslims themselves are not immune to adopting that idea,” said Dalia Mogahed, the ISPU’s director of research.","The ISPU’s third annual American Muslim poll surveyed Muslims, Jews, Catholics, Protestants, white evangelicals and those who are nonaffiliated and compared attitudes across the groups. The report includes the ISPU’s first Islamophobia index, created in partnership with Georgetown’s Bridge Initiative, which measures different faith and nonfaith groups’ endorsement of anti-Muslim rhetoric.","Internalizing racism involves “ingesting, often subconsciously, acceptance of the dominant society’s stereotype of one’s ethnic group,” according to a similar study conducted by the Yaqeen Institute for Islamic Research in 2016, “Exploring the Faith and Identity Crisis of American Muslim Youth.” The report corroborates the ISPU’s findings and documents the effects of Islamophobic rhetoric on the religious identity and perceptions of Muslim youths. The study found that 1 in 3 children surveyed wanted to tell others that they are Muslim and that 1 in 2 did not know whether they could be both Muslim and American.","Measuring internalized racism dates back to an infamous doll test conducted in 1947 to study the psychological effects of segregation on African-American children using black and white dolls. There have been few formal studies conducted since then, but the phenomenon has been well documented with other minority groups, including Latinos and Jews.","In fact, the new ISPU study found that Muslims and Jews were among the most likely — at 62 and 59 percent, respectively — to feel ashamed of violence committed by fellow members of their faith.","Muslims’ internalization of negative stereotypes about their community can be traced to disproportionate negative coverage of Muslims in mainstream media, according to the ISPU, a nonprofit with offices in Dearborn, Michigan, and Washington, D.C.","A separate study conducted by the ISPU last month found that Muslims accused of plotting violence get seven times as much media attention and sentences four times as long as non-Muslim plotters.","“It’s the combination of disproportionate media coverage and Muslims being much more focused on that kind of media coverage that explains the fact that Muslims themselves have internalized this very stereotype [of being prone to violence,]” Mogahed said.","The report also found that those who scored higher on the Islamophobia index were associated with greater support for President Donald Trump’s travel bans and increased surveillance of American mosques. Those groups were also more likely to accept targeting of civilians by military and violent groups.","On a scale from 0 to 100, with 0 the lowest level of prejudice, the report found that on average Muslims scored 17 on the Islamophobia index. By comparison, nonaffiliated respondents came in at 14; Jews and Catholics, 22; the general public, 24; Protestants, 31; and white evangelicals, 40.","Founded in 2002, the ISPU, according to its website, conducts “objective, solution-seeking research that empowers American Muslims to develop their community and fully contribute to democracy and pluralism in the United States.” You can read the report in full here."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ae731ff1a00004300cdd403.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"WOMEN","headline":"In New Accusations, Netflix Producer Says Harvey Weinstein Raped, Threatened Her","authors":"Sara Boboltz","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/harvey-weinstein-alexandra-canosa_us_5ae8be5de4b04aa23f27a502","short_description":"Alexandra Canosa, who worked on \"Marco Polo,\" says Weinstein abused her and told her not to talk.","date":"2018-05-01"},"articleContent":["A producer on the canceled Netflix show “Marco Polo” has accused disgraced film mogul Harvey Weinstein of repeated sexual assault and abuse over a period of years, according to documents filed with the New York Supreme Court on Monday.","Alexandra Canosa describes at least 11 alleged incidents in the filing, including rape, other unspecified sexual assault, physical assault, verbal threats, forced sex acts and other abuses between 2010 and 2017.

The series debuted in December of that year.","In August 2017, weeks before The New York Times and The New Yorker would publish a series of damning accusations against the former studio head, Weinstein “verbally threatened” Canosa “not to speak to anyone about his abuse,” the filing alleges.","Echoing the accounts of dozens of other accusers, Canosa says Weinstein ensured that she met with him alone under the pretense of doing work. He allegedly made inappropriate demands, “forcing himself on [her] despite repeated requests to stop,” the filing says.","In a statement provided to Variety, Phyllis Kupferstein, an attorney for Weinstein, said the relationship between Weinstein and Canosa was consensual.","“Ali Canosa was a friend who had worked for The Weinstein Company for 10 years, traveled the world for the company and held several influential roles; overseeing many projects throughout the years,” Kupferstein said in the statement. “From someone who has been thought of as a good friend, involved only in a consensual relationship, these claims are not only mystifying to Mr. Weinstein, but deeply upsetting, and they are not supported by the facts.”","Canosa claims that other defendants named in her suit ― including Harvey Weinstein’s brother, Robert, and several Weinstein Company board members ― were aware of Weinstein’s behavior and did nothing to stop him.","By USA Today’s count, more than 80 women have come forward to accuse Weinstein of sexual misconduct, a blanket term for a range of abuses.

The discussion, titled “Reclaiming The Narrative,” focused on diverse storytelling and the “impact of portraying powerful female characters,” according to Tribeca Film Festival’s website.","“I know my story best, and I want to be able to tell my story and tell it with people like me who also feel this gaping hole of representation,” Nyong’o said, according to The Hollywood Reporter.","The “Black Panther” actress told the crowd she wants to focus on African stories in TV and film, referencing her experience as a child born in Mexico and raised in Kenya.","“I think for me, as an actress who grew up watching everyone but myself, I think part of changing the narrative is changing the perspective of the narrative that’s being told,” she said, Glamour reported. “For me, the work that I feel convicted to do is to tell to African stories, and to kind of re-examine or reinvigorate or reintroduce Africa to the world and African identity and how global it can be.”","She added that the lack of representation she saw on television as a kid affected her greatly.","“When I switched on my television when I was younger living in Kenya, there was never anybody that looked like me on there, you know? So seldom ... And even when they were black, they weren’t that dark,” Nyong’o said.","Nyong’o added that diversity is imperative, and television’s failure to show it can perpetuate internalized racism.","“It wasn’t until I was much older that I started to realize what was missing on that screen and how not seeing myself was causing a subconscious self-hate that I only grew aware of when I was a teenager,” she said. “I started to recognize my insecurities and started to absorb the language around me that said I was not right, that I was not enough, and stuff like that.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ae72c5e1a00002700cdd3eb.jpeg?cache=3DBpTlpYHf&ops=crop_0_113_4500_2648%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"In Rural Areas Hit Hard By Opioids, A New Source Of Hope","authors":"Stateline, Editorial Partner","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/in-rural-areas-hit-hard-by-opioids-a-new-source-of_us_5ae70e85e4b0d538c22dfc35","short_description":"The U.S. Department of Agriculture says it wants to be a strong partner for rural communities in the grip of the opioid epidemic.","date":"2018-04-30"},"articleContent":["By Jen Fifield","For people addicted to opioids, the first time in detox isn’t necessarily the last. For Brian Taylor, the second time wasn’t the last, either — nor was the third, fourth or fifth.","The sixth time, though, was different. It has been nearly 17 months since Taylor, 33, walked out of his last treatment at the Withdrawal Management Center in Harrington, Delaware, and he hasn’t used drugs since. If the detox center hadn’t been so accessible — just 20 miles from where he was living, in the small town of Seaford — he said he may have lost his children, his family and even his life.","“I had a whole lot to lose,” he said in a recent interview with Stateline. “My back was against the wall.”","Like many rural areas in the United States, central and southern Delaware had no place for people to get withdrawal management services before the Harrington clinic opened in 2015. It quickly saw there was high demand. When the center looked for money to expand, it found an unexpected partner: the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Using a $1 million low-interest loan from the agency, the center is adding space for counseling, family therapy and primary care.","Six months after President Donald Trump declared the opioid epidemic a national emergency, some health officials say the federal government has not provided enough new money to combat it. But the U.S. Department of Agriculture this month announced it will offer help to some communities using the resources it already has.","The agency this year says it will dedicate at least $20 million of a $49 million rural telehealth and distance learning fund for projects related to opioid addiction. It also has committed to spending $5 million of a $30 million grant program that pays for buildings and equipment in rural areas for projects related to opioids.","The Harrington project, which came before the announcement, is an example of the type of work the USDA wants to support. A provision in the House version of the 2018 farm bill would allow the secretary of agriculture to declare a rural health emergency, allowing the agency to move more quickly than usual and requiring it to reserve money to address the problem.","Congress typically renews the farm bill, which sets agriculture and food policy, about every five years. It’s unclear whether the House version of this year’s bill will pass, and the Senate has yet to release its own version.","The USDA plans to be “a strong partner” in rural communities’ battle against addiction, Anne Hazlett, assistant to the secretary for rural development, told local health officials in a conference call earlier this month.","“This is more than just health care,” she said. “This is a matter of rural prosperity.”","The new focus comes as the rate of drug overdoses in rural areas, which surpassed the urban rate in 2006, continues to increase rapidly. The rural rate stands at about 17 per 100,000 residents, compared with the urban rate of 16.2 per 100,000, according to the most recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.","Farmers are especially vulnerable. About 3 in 4 farmers and farmworkers have misused opioids or know someone who has, according to a 2017 study by the National Farmers Union and the American Farm Bureau Federation. Farming and ranching are among the most dangerous jobs in the country, and with the high risk of injury comes the potential for misusing prescription drugs.","Combating the opioid epidemic in rural areas using USDA grants and loans is an idea that was proposed last year by U.S. Rep Cheri Bustos, an Illinois Democrat, and U.S. Sen. Joe Donnelly, an Indiana Democrat. Their bill, the Addiction Recovery for Rural Communities Act, outlined a strategy similar to what the USDA has adopted.","“There’s no doubt that we need to do more to help provide accessible treatment options for men and women struggling with addiction in small towns and rural communities across the heartland,” Bustos said in a statement to Stateline.","Rural Hospitals as Economic Backbone","It makes sense for the USDA to support rural health systems, since hospitals are often the economic backbone of rural communities, said Maggie Elehwany, government affairs and policy vice president for the National Rural Health Association, based in Kansas and Washington, D.C. “If you don’t have those, you don’t have a community.”","While Elehwany and other rural health advocates say the grants and loans will be helpful, they say it won’t solve the most dire health care challenges in rural areas, such as doctor shortages and low reimbursement rates.","Rural hospitals have money problems when their patients cannot afford to pay for services and reimbursement rates are low. Since 2010, 83 rural hospitals have closed, according to the Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Elehwany wants the farm bill to directly support struggling rural hospitals.","Meanwhile, the shortages and the low reimbursement rates are putting a strain on community health centers, which are seeing an increase in demand for substance abuse disorder services, according to officials at the National Association of Community Health Centers.","Patients receiving treatment for opioid misuse and other substance abuse disorders at U.S. health centers more than tripled from 2010 to 2016, from about 98,000 to about 421,000, according to data collected by the National Association of Community Health Centers.","One-time grants are helpful, said Jennifer Taylor, a deputy director at the association, “but we are really thinking about this in a really long-term, sustainable way.”","A USDA grant that pays for telehealth technology would allow a clinic to start offering the service, Taylor said, but it wouldn’t provide the funding to keep the service going.","The Middle of the Night","Brian Taylor, who now works at the detox center, said his addiction started with alcohol and marijuana, then Percocet, then heroin. From age 13 to 31, he was in and out of detention centers as he committed various crimes: assaults, robberies, shoplifting and probation violations. The motivation behind all those crimes, he said, was the need to get high.","“It was a hopeless desperation, you know?” he said. “I was desperate to get help, but I felt there was no help.”","In Delaware, overdose deaths are up more than 50 percent in a few years, from 229 in 2015 to 345 in 2017. The state has added new funding almost every year since 2014 for substance abuse or mental health, and has added residential treatment, sober living beds, outpatient treatment and recovery response centers. Democratic Gov. John Carney is requesting $1.3 million in new funding for the upcoming budget year for 20 additional sober living beds and emergency room consultations.","Making sure that services are available in areas of need will save lives, said Cathy McKay, CEO of Connections Community Support Programs, which runs the Harrington detox center under a state contract. The treatment center is open at all hours for a reason, McKay said.","“A lot of people, when they want treatment, it’s in the middle of the night,” McKay said. “A lot of times people think about that when they are in pain. If you don’t have a way to hop on that right away, a lot of times you lose them.”","CORRECTION: An earlier version of the story incorrectly named Delaware’s governor Jay Carney.

Reclaim Idaho had to collect more than 56,000 signatures by Monday to put the issue on the ballot this November, and they’ve exceeded that amount by nearly 4,000, according to the group’s press release.","“This initiative would bring health care coverage to those who need it the most, and it will allow Idahoans to decide what we want in our health care system, no matter what politicians in Boise or Washington, D.C. do,” Emily Strizich, a co-founder of Reclaim Idaho, said in a statement. “These are moms and dads who work hard in jobs that don’t provide health coverage, and people who are nearing retirement who have lost their jobs.”","Reclaim Idaho achieved this result with an almost all-volunteer force of local activists working in the state’s 44 counties to knock on doors, set up tables in public places and stake out polling locations during a county Election Day last month.

A similar effort is ongoing in Nebraska. Maine became the first state to adopt Medicaid expansion via direct voter action last November, although Gov. Paul LePage (R) thus far has refused to implement it.","Medicaid expansion would provide coverage to as many as 62,000 people in Idaho, according to the state Department of Health and Welfare. Nine percent of Idahoans lack health coverage, the same as the national uninsured rate.","Idaho voters overwhelmingly support Medicaid expansion, according to a survey conducted by Boise State University in December: 71 percent favor it while 22 percent oppose.","The Affordable Care Act calls for all states to expand Medicaid eligibility to anyone earning up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, which is about $16,000 for a single person and $33,000 for a family of four.

Kaiser Family Foundation.","County officials still have to certify the legitimacy of the last batches of signatures that Reclaim Idaho activists expect to submit on Tuesday.

Nearly 4,000 people were still in the pipeline when the program ended and did not receive interviews, a Department of Homeland Security official confirmed.","There’s no guarantee that the people whose applications were scrapped would have eventually been granted protections, but it was highly unusual to not even continue considering them, said Jen Smyers, who leads policy and advocacy on immigration and refugees at Church World Service, a faith-based organization involved in refugee resettlement. In the past when the U.S. has closed refugee and parole programs, they have been phased out and those who started the process went through it to completion, she said.","“Usually the U.S. likes to keep our word,” Smyers said. “Usually we like to have a program that people can have faith in, especially when that program is to provide protection to children and individuals who are vulnerable.”","Osmaro, who requested anonymity for his family’s safety and will be referred to by a relative’s middle name, tried to use the program to bring his three children and wife to the U.S. from El Salvador. He’d left the country after receiving death threats, planning to find a way for his family to join him. He spent about $900 on the applications in February 2016 and had completed the process up until the final steps, including submitting DNA swabs to prove the children were his own.","Then Trump ended the program. Osmaro’s family wasn’t interviewed in time, and they’re stuck in El Salvador.","“It was a huge disappointment,” he said in an interview conducted in Spanish. “For me, my way of looking at this country — this is a country that offers its hand, that protects. I admire that. It offered its hand to me.”","Osmaro has considered bringing his family here illegally because he isn’t hopeful about other options for them. The journey would be dangerous, but he worries that his kids face greater threats to their lives if they stay in El Salvador. It would cost more than $15,000, however, which he can’t afford. Now he wishes he hadn’t applied in the first place, and spent the $900 he used to seek CAM protections for his family on other things for his children.","The CAM program, which former President Barack Obama created in 2014, was limited. People living in the U.S. legally — often under temporary protected status — could apply to bring their children who were under 21 and unmarried from Central America to the U.S. The child’s other parent and any children the child had could also be included on the application.","The program allowed Central Americans to come to the U.S. as refugees if they faced persecution in their native country, or as parolees if they were determined eligible for relief because of danger at home but did not meet the definition to qualify as a refugee. The program was relatively small — 3,378 people have come to the U.S. under CAM as of April 20; 1,914 of them as refugees and about 1,464 as parolees, according to the State Department.","The purpose was to create an alternative to children making a dangerous trip to seek asylum in the U.S. or crossing the border illegally, said Jennifer Sime, senior vice president of U.S. programs at International Rescue Committee, which helped many parents with their applications.","“It is no exaggeration that the consequences for those seeking safety, and in the case of CAM — children — is life and death,” Sime said in an email.","CAM program applicants still in their native countries could be under increased danger, experts said. Gangs notice when children go away for days for screenings, and their status as someone with family in the U.S., as someone who spilled information on persecution or just someone who tried to get out can make them a target.","Erika Lopez, a case worker at International Institute of Los Angeles who helped parents apply for the program for their children, said some of them told her their children had been threatened and extorted since their cases were closed.","She doesn’t know what to tell them. The Trump administration said it would send further instructions to individuals with pending applications who had not been interviewed, but they only received notices that their cases had been closed, Lopez said.","Many people don’t fully seem to understand or accept that the program is shut down, said Lisa Frydman of Kids in Need of Defense, or KIND, a nonprofit that largely works with children who come to the U.S. as unaccompanied minors.","Now they’re stuck, and the government is threatening those who seek help through other means, such as Central Americans who traveled to the U.S.-Mexico border in a caravan to request asylum.","“They’re shutting all of the doors,” Michelle Brané, director of migrant rights at the Women’s Refugee Commission, said, using a metaphor of a house on fire. “They’re taking away the ladder and then punishing people for jumping out the window.”","This article has been updated with comment from Sime."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ae752f91a00004300cdd43d.jpeg?cache=4HiwOglNki&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"'Simpsons' Creator On Apu Debate: 'People Love To Pretend They're Offended'","authors":"Kimberly Yam","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-simpsons-creator-on-apu-debate-people-love-to-pretend-theyre-offended_us_5ae7261ce4b055fd7fce3235","short_description":"Matt Groening's comments come as Hank Azaria, who voices Apu, said he'd be happy to \"step aside\" from the role.","date":"2018-04-30"},"articleContent":["The creator of “The Simpsons” seems unapologetic over controversial Indian character Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, despite criticisms from many in the South Asian-American community that Apu perpetuates several racial stereotypes.","Matt Groening recently responded to the debate about Apu in an interview with USA Today published on Friday. Outrage over the character was ignited by Indian-American comedian Hari Kondabolu’s 2017 documentary “The Problem With Apu,” which highlighted the negative effects and painful stereotypes attached to the South Asian community stemming in part from the fictional Kwik-E-Mart owner.","Groening dismissed the critiques. I’m proud of what we do on the show,” he told the outlet. “I think it’s a time in our culture where people love to pretend they’re offended.”","An episode that aired earlier this month also appeared to rally to the defense of the characterization of Apu. Referring to a sanitized version of a bedtime story, Lisa laments to Marge that “something that started decades ago and was applauded and inoffensive, is now politically incorrect,” before looking at a photo of Apu.","“This is sad,” Kondabolu wrote on Twitter after the episode. “The Simpsons response tonight is not a jab at me, but at what many of us consider progress.”","It appears actor Hank Azaria, who has voiced Apu since “The Simpsons” first season in 1989, sides more these days with Kondabolu than Groening.","During an appearance last week on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,” Azaria said his eyes “have been opened” to the controversy surrounding Apu. He also said he is “perfectly willing and happy to step aside” from voicing the character and that it’s crucial to acknowledge the perspective of the South Asian community on the character.","“I think the most important thing is we have to listen to South Asian people, Indian people ... about what they feel and how they think about this character and what their American experience of it has been.”","Kondabolu previously told HuffPost that while Apu is problematic, the character can serve as a vehicle for tackling the larger issue of proper representation of minorities in media. To ensure that characters of color who are multidimensional rather than stereotypical make it on screen, writers’ staffs ― which he said are “generally white-male-dominated” ― need to be more inclusive.","“It’s cool that you’re my white ally, but how about instead of speaking for me, get some of us hired on,” he said of those staffs. “Because I feel like that’s the bigger problem. The actors are the people who get the scraps at the end.

Though the White House nominated Homan to the position in November, he informed the Department of Homeland Security early this year that he intended to step down because of family considerations, according to the official.","Homan told HuffPost earlier this month that his family had received threats since he took charge of the agency.","But Homan had also recoiled at the notion of passing through a politically contentious Senate confirmation hearing, according to the The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the news.","Despite receiving the nomination to head ICE six months ago, Homan’s confirmation hearing had yet to be scheduled. A group of 17 mostly Democratic senators penned a letter Friday pressing DHS to cough up documents it had given to the Senate’s Homeland Security Committee and questioned whether he should continue to head the agency after 14 months without confirmation.","“The absence of a Senate-confirmed head of ICE for more than a year hinders Congressional oversight and the efficient operation of the agency and is troubling in any circumstance,” the letter said. “We understand that the Trump Administration may be concerned about Mr. Homan answering questions under oath about his leadership of ICE, as well as the possibility that Mr. Homan’s nomination could be defeated in the Senate.”","The Senators went on to accuse Homan of carrying out “radical – and in some cases possibly illegal – changes in immigration enforcement policies and practices.” The cited the separation of hundreds of undocumented children from asylum-seeking parents after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border, reversing the presumptive release of pregnant women from immigrant detention, and discarding a decades-long policy of halting deportations for individuals at the request of Congress.","Those changes were “accompanied by inflammatory and inaccurate statements,” the letter said, noting Homan’s alleged use of the derogatory epithet “tonk” to refer to unauthorized immigrants, which HuffPost first reported in a lengthy profile earlier this month. The term is a Border Patrol slang that derives from the sound of bashing an immigrant over the head with a metal flashlight. (Homan denied using the term.)","In an administration bogged down by infighting and high turnover, Homan had appeared to easily win Trump’s confidence, pressing ahead with the White House’s deportation agenda enthusiastically, despite the political blowback.","But Homan’s abrupt departure leaves the signature agency charged with Trump’s deportation efforts leaderless and without a clear successor.","“Everyone is surprised,” a former DHS official told HuffPost. “ICE has never had a deep bench and over the last year and a half it’s become increasingly weak. I would hope they’re looking outside the agency for someone with fresh ideas.”","Homan had also recently complained to co-workers that he’d been increasingly marginalized by DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, who left him out of negotiations with lawmakers on immigration reform earlier this year, according to The Washington Post.","But as recently as Jan. 24 of this year, Homan told the radio show John and Ken on Demand that he planned to move forward with confirmation.","“There’s a lot of paperwork involved,” Homan said at the time. “We’re on the finishing touches.”","Monday’s announcement brings to a close a three-decade career in law enforcement that began when Homan joined the police department of the 2,000-person village of West Carthage in upstate New York. After serving four years as a Border Patrol agent in the 1980s, Homan steadily rose through the ranks of immigration enforcement, first as an investigator with the now defunct Immigration and Naturalization Service, and later as an administrator with ICE, which was created in 2003.","Homan’s background in the rank-and-file brought with it an uniquely detailed understanding of all aspects of immigration enforcement and his tenure was characterized by a glorification of the deportation officers whom he views as unfairly vilified by legal groups and the national news media. Even among critics of Trump’s immigration crackdown, Homan himself has remained widely respected among current and former DHS officials.","But he also brought a uniquely combative attitude to a position that has traditionally been filled by lawyers who shy away from making contentious statements about immigration enforcement ― one of the country’s most divisive political issues. Homan earned the ire of both immigrant rights groups and Democratic politicians by asserting that, under his watch, unauthorized immigrants “should look over your shoulder, and you need to be worried.”","In perhaps his most bombastic statement, Homan in an appearance on Fox News urged the Justice Department to consider prosecuting local officials who embrace “sanctuary” policies that limit local cooperation with ICE.","Even as he prepared to exit government service, Homan remained a booster of his deportation officers and took a jab at the national press.","“I am humbled and inspired by the 20,000 American patriots who serve this agency and protect our nation, increasingly in the face of unfair and false criticism from politicians and the media,” Homan said in Monday’s statement. “Because of their tremendous dedication and hard work, we have made significant progress this past year in enforcing our nation’s immigration and customs laws, and in protecting public safety and national security. I will continue to be a strong advocate for the workforce and for the ICE mission.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ae764e41e000044008e40bd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Trump Calls For The White House Correspondents' Dinner To Be Put To 'Rest'","authors":"Nick Visser","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-whca-dinner_us_5ae67493e4b04aa23f2440e9","short_description":"\"This year was an embarrassment to everyone associated with it.\"","date":"2018-04-30"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"TECH","headline":"WhatsApp Co-Founder To Leave Company Amid Disagreements With Facebook","authors":"Ryan Grenoble","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jan-koum-whats-app-facebook_us_5ae787f9e4b055fd7fced7d5","short_description":"Jan Koum reportedly differed with WhatsApp's corporate parent over encryption and user privacy.","date":"2018-04-30"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"BLACK VOICES","headline":"Time's Up Demands Investigation Into R.

This man is a predator and 100% of his victims have been Black and Brown girls. At times it felt like screaming into a well, but thank God for this reckoning coming.”","Kelly’s stardom has been marked by dozens of sexual misconduct allegations dating back to 1994, when he allegedly married R&B singer Aaliyah when she was 15 and he was 27. In 2008, Kelly was acquitted of child pornography charges after a video showed him allegedly having sex with and urinating on a 14-year-old girl. He has agreed to multiple out-of-court settlements with women who accused him of sexual assault, including one who said Kelly had sex with her when she was 15.","Last year, a BuzzFeed report alleged the singer holds multiple young women against their will in an abusive sex cult.

Blankenship launched his bid to become West Virginia’s next Republican senator late last year and started buying advertisements on local TV stations. They all began with a line that nauseated Davis: “I’m Don Blankenship, candidate for U.S. Senate, and I approve this message.”","Davis stopped watching the local news to avoid the ads, retreating to the reliably Blankenship-free zones of hunting shows and Netflix. But then Blankenship’s voice was there in Davis’ pickup truck, via Pandora radio advertising. Davis had to limit his use of that, too, lest driving around town become its own form of torment.","“It seems no matter where I go or what I do, it’s Don Blankenship,” Davis, 50, said recently, driving along the Kanawha River in his Toyota Tacoma.","Blankenship is the former Massey Energy chief executive who presided over the Upper Big Branch mining disaster, in Montcoal, West Virginia, in 2010. Davis was a miner at Upper Big Branch with his eldest son, Cory Davis; his only brother, Timmy Davis; and a nephew, Joshua Napper. Davis was making his way out of the mine during a shift change when the explosion happened. He bolted to the exit, wind and rocks tumbling around him, and made it out alive.","Twenty-nine men did not, including his three loved ones. The bodies of his son, brother and nephew were recovered together days after the blast, once it was safe to do so. Cory was the youngest of the dead at 20 years old.","Various investigations faulted Massey officials for systematically cutting corners on safety and putting profits before their workers’ lives. They found that Massey, under Blankenship’s helm, had fostered a culture of fear and intimidation inside the mine and hidden safety lapses from regulators. Blankenship served one year in prison on a misdemeanor conviction for conspiring to violate mine safety laws. He has continued to deny responsibility for the worst mining catastrophe in four decades.","The particular void left by Cory Boy, as Davis still refers to his son ― “my hunting partner, my fishing partner, my all-around go-to buddy” ― has made the Blankenship redemption tour an unbearable spectacle for Davis, just as it has for other Upper Big Branch families.","“I actually thought he would stay the hell out of West Virginia,” Davis said of Blankenship. “He just won’t leave it alone.”","“He’s trying to put it back in our face. I call it harassment,” he continued. “That’s what it is: It’s straight-up harassment.”","Blankenship has spent $2 million of his own money on the campaign and has savaged his main Republican primary opponents, Congressman Evan Jenkins and West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, in hopes of facing off in a general election against incumbent Sen. Joe Manchin (D), whom he personally blames for his prison sentence. Blankenship’s campaign did not respond to several interview requests for this story.","Although Blankenship has slipped behind Jenkins and Morrisey in recent polls, buried in attack ads the GOP establishment is funding to keep him off the ticket, his candidacy is not a joke. For all his infamy, plenty of voters still associate him with good-paying blue-collar jobs in hollows without a whole lot of them. As Davis put it, “There are still people around here who worship the ground he walks on.”","The prospect of Sen. Don Blankenship, however unlikely, has polluted even the most solemn customs for Davis.","On April 5, he and other Upper Big Branch families made the drive up to the mine to observe the eighth anniversary of the disaster. Davis carries out the same ritual each year. He picks up 29 balloons ― 26 black and three orange, the latter signifying his family members ― then heads to Cory’s grave with his ex-wife, Cindy; their two sons, Seth and Nathan; and their grandson, Cory Tripp. There they release the balloons and talk.","Then it’s on to the mine site, where each of the dead has a cross. Davis hangs a wreath for all the miners and lays out three white roses for his family members. He ties a white bandana to Cory’s cross. He looks up to the spot on the mountain where he and the other miners would punch out at the end of their shifts. Then they drive down Coal River Road to the 48-foot granite memorial that was erected in 2012, showing 29 miners’ silhouettes.","It was at the memorial where things got unpleasant at this year’s anniversary gathering. Among the families, politicians and news crews was Gwen Thomas, the sister of Grover Skeens, one of the miners who was killed. Thomas has taken an unusual position among Upper Big Branch family members: She has called the disaster an act of God and praised Blankenship, who in turn has featured Thomas in a television ad and on the campaign trail.","The presence of an outspoken Blankenship supporter at the memorial was too much for Davis and other mourners. She defended the former CEO; they gave her a piece of their minds. A state trooper intervened.","Davis has tried to curb his Facebook time during the Senate race. The night before the anniversary, he visited Blankenship’s campaign page, where the candidate posts videos and says he’ll bring jobs back to West Virginia. Davis uploaded a photo of Cory’s gravesite onto Blankenship’s page. “Here look at my Cory boy 20 years young,” Davis wrote. “Tell him why you chose production over safety.”","The next time Davis visited the page, his post was gone.","***","On a recent Friday morning, Davis steered his ATV up a gravel road to a former strip-mining site, the back of his vehicle loaded with turkey decoys, spare camo clothes and a 12-gauge shotgun. What had once been a mountaintop now felt more like prairie, with long, flat stretches of grass and brush lying between hills. Davis used to work on sites like this one as a surface miner as they were stripped. Now he comes here to run his dogs, call for turkeys, or climb a treestand and wait for a buck.","The time in the woods is bittersweet. It was his brother, Timmy, who taught him how to hunt, and Davis passed everything he knew on to Cory, who shot his first whitetail when he was 9. Now he mostly hunts alone, but he appreciates the quiet of the woods more than ever. Besides, any time spent in a treestand is time spent not drinking.","“If I sit at home and dwell on things,” he said with a turkey call in his mouth, “it’ll just fuck me up.”","A few months after the disaster, Davis went back to work at a mine run by Alpha Natural Resources, the coal giant that would go on to acquire Massey. He still had a ringing in his ears from the blast and what would turn out to be post-traumatic stress disorder. He struggled with loud sounds. He had panic attacks.","“I just couldn’t sleep,” he said. “I couldn’t think. I couldn’t function. I was getting lost. I was having problems.”","He accepted a settlement for his son’s death and stopped working. Some families used their money to leave the state and start new lives. Davis stayed in West Virginia but as a slightly different person. He covered his body in tattoos, including 29 crosses along his back and the words “Cory Boy” across his shoulders. He customized a Harley as a rolling memorial to Upper Big Branch.","A couple of years ago, he sold the house where Cory grew up because the memories were too painful. He bought a small ranch house at the end of a street of trailers that backs up on the Kanawha, far enough from the highway that all he hears at night is the river.","He started an annual scholarship at Cory’s high school in his name. The unofficial mission is to give kids better options than hoping for a coal resurgence. The lack of good-paying work is why people cling to someone like Blankenship, Davis said.","“Just look around you. There ain’t a hellacious lot to do here if you didn’t go to college,” he said. “The guys who support [Blankenship] ― they don’t have other options as far as jobs go.”","Moving on has not been easy. He ends up at Cory’s grave every other night or so, drinking a beer and turning one upside down for his son. Cory’s friends are at the stage where they’ve started families, and Davis finds himself wondering if Cory would have had a son, too: “Would he have been tall or short, fat or skinny, would he have looked more like him or more like her, and other questions we’ll never know the answer to.”","Blankenship’s visibility and lack of contrition have made it all the harder. He has maintained, contrary to official investigations, that the root cause of the blast at Upper Big Branch was a sudden influx of natural gas in the mine, rather than an excessive amount of coal dust, which is highly explosive. The distinction is crucial. Coal operators have an obligation to keep coal dust levels in check, through sufficient ventilation and rock-dusting, a process that neutralizes coal dust with pulverized limestone.","What happened at Upper Big Branch was investigated by federal regulators, state regulators, the United Mine Workers of America union, and an independent panel established by Manchin, who was West Virginia’s governor at the time. To varying degrees, they all faulted Massey for poor ventilation and inadequate rock-dusting practices in the mine.","The explosion likely started when the shearer on a mining machine ignited a methane fireball, thanks in part to poorly maintained equipment. But it would have been the high levels of coal dust that sent it ripping through more than 2 miles of the mine shaft, so that even men far from the blast couldn’t escape. (The UMWA went so far as to title its report “Industrial Homicide.”)","Davis remembers the dust being so thick that day he could see it. Other miners recalled the air belowground flowing in odd directions before the explosion.","Blankenship’s natural gas theory conveniently absolves him of the chronic failures investigators found.","“It’s just not substantiated,” said Celeste Monforton, a safety expert who was part of the independent panel, which also faulted federal and state regulators for not adequately policing Massey.","“It was a coal dust explosion. The fingerprint mapping that was done to find a cause ― all of that evidence indicated that,” she said. “All of the analytical work that was done, taking all the dust samples, an extraordinary amount of evidence showed that.”","Blankenship has also claimed that the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration forced Massey to change its ventilation plans before the explosion, suggesting MSHA may be to blame for the disaster. The independent panel found no evidence of that. However, it did find regulators failed at Upper Big Branch ― by not cracking down hard enough on Massey.","As Blankenship has blamed natural gas and MSHA for the disaster while on the campaign trail, Robert Atkins has been there to fact-check him. Atkins lost his son Jason at Upper Big Branch. He has made a point of showing up at Blankenship’s town hall meetings to speak directly to undecided voters and rebut Blankenship’s telling of events. He estimates he’s gone to five campaign events and has spoken one-on-one with 50 voters, urging them to vote for anyone but Blankenship. His wife joined him for the first event, but couldn’t do any more.","“She just couldn’t take it,” Atkins said. “I’ve got in my head, and I feel I’m right, that that man killed my son. And when he killed my son, it took the life out of me, out of his mom, and out of his brother. ... The man has no remorse.”","According to the independent panel, the deeper cause of the disaster was what they called “the Massey Way.” Under Massey’s corporate culture, miners were to run coal at all costs. The mine continued operating even when airflow was dangerously low. Workers lacked basic safety equipment while having to file regular production reports. Methane detectors were disabled to avoid having to shut down the mine if levels got too high. And workers were instructed to tip off colleagues belowground when federal safety inspectors showed up.","Massey enforced this system through intimidation, investigators found. Workers testified after the explosion that they did what they were told because they feared for their jobs. Managers belittled miners who couldn’t get with the program. The company had a slogan: “S1 P2,” for safety first and production second. According to Davis, the joke among miners was that it was really “P1 S2.”","As his ATV lurched up and down the ravines, Davis tried to explain the grip Blankenship had on his mines. He had worked at other Massey properties before Upper Big Branch. He remembers eating lunch out of his pocket as he worked, reluctant to slow production with a proper break. He didn’t speak up about hazards, either, fearful of losing the job that he desperately needed.","He recalled the pressure workers felt whenever Blankenship showed up in his car or helicopter. Someone would shout to him as he cut coal with the highwall miner machine: “Tommy, whatever it is you’re cutting, keep it rolling. Do not stop. Do. Not. Stop.”","“That money was feeding their kids and paying for their trucks. They were proud of that and didn’t want to lose that,” Davis said. “Don Blankenship scared those people to death.”","***","Three Upper Big Branch managers went to prison before Blankenship, all found to have deceived regulators or investigators in covering up safety problems. Blankenship was charged with three counts: securities fraud, making false statements to officials, and conspiring to violate mine safety regulations. A jury found him guilty only of the latter charge.","Davis attended every day of the two-month trial that he could, making a point to sit near Blankenship’s supporters. He wore the same outfit each day so Blankenship could better recognize him: a plaid shirt with a green jacket and an Under Armour hat. The one-year sentence handed down ― the maximum the judge could impose under the misdemeanor conviction ― infuriated Davis, considering Blankenship had been facing up to 30 years under the original charges. (The conspiracy charge was not directly linked to the disaster itself.)","Outside the courthouse, a television reporter asked Davis why he was so frustrated. His raw and eloquent response, delivered with a quaking voice, would be viewed over a million times online: “If you was where I was that day, and you seen my son after laying in there for five days, and seen what he looked like ― if you worked on them men like we did when they come outside, if you smelled them, and you looked at them, then you’d know where I come from.”","The 12-month sentence didn’t make Blankenship any more penitent. He declared himself a political prisoner. He published a 67-page booklet from his low-security prison in California, proclaiming his innocence and propagating conspiracy theories about a government cover-up. He promoted a 2014 “documentary” he’d funded, called “Upper Big Branch ― Never Again,” faulting the feds for the disaster. He blamed Manchin personally for his prosecution, taking his feud to Twitter.","As West Virginia’s governor, Manchin was at Upper Big Branch in the days following the explosion. He and Davis have since become friends. Davis said he often gets a call from a number he keeps in his cell as “Senator Joe,” and it’s Manchin asking how he’s doing. They talk about motorcycles, Blankenship and whatever else Davis has on his mind. (Manchin’s uncle died in the Farmington Mine Disaster, along with 77 others, in 1968.)","Davis said Manchin’s campaign has never asked anything of him, though he would happily oblige if it did, particularly if Blankenship wins the Republican nomination on May 8. “He’s the only politician who’s been there the whole time,” Davis said of Manchin. “He won’t say it, but I will.”","On a Thursday in mid-April, Davis learned that Blankenship would be attending a meet-the-candidates forum that night in Chelyan, just across the river from Davis’ home. He was surprised the Senate hopeful would have the nerve to show up to a public event so close to Upper Big Branch, an area where Blankenship campaign signs appear to be sparse. Davis had told himself that he wouldn’t attend town hall-style events, knowing he might lose control in an encounter with Blankenship. He decided to bend his rule.","He removed the gun from his truck and told his buddy Gary Price to meet him down at the community center, where Blankenship would be. When Davis got there, a handful of police officers who already knew him came outside to greet him. They told Davis he could say whatever he wanted to Blankenship, so long as he kept some distance and didn’t threaten him.","Davis took a sign from his truck and laid it across his windshield. It said: “Cory Davis 5/22/89 - 4/5/10. Don Blankenship murdered him over coal and money.” Price parked his truck in front of the building’s main exit, dragging a custom trailer that has a dedication to Cory on one side and the names of every miner killed at Upper Big Branch on the other. Davis waited outside to confront the candidate as he left the event.","He saw Blankenship walk to the glass doors and stop, the memorial display laid out in front of him. Then he watched Blankenship turn and head toward another exit, accompanied by what appeared to be an aide. They hopped in a car and left, before any words could be exchanged with Davis.","Another Republican candidate, Jack Newbrough, came out the doors to take a break. “I’m sorry for your loss, Tommy,” he said, shaking Davis’ hand. “I sure would love to have your support.”","Davis let the invitation hang in the air. He thanked his friend Price for coming out, then headed to his truck and off to the bar to have a beer. Although there was no confrontation, he considered his trip to the forum a success. He felt he’d shamed Blankenship for coming into his end of the valley. He noted that Blankenship never looked him in the eye. He believes the man feels guilt, despite everything he’s said to the contrary.","“That boy of mine, he can’t speak out no more, so I speak out for him,” Davis said. “That’s why I do it ― to make sure Blankenship doesn’t forget it. Just like I’m sitting here thinking about him, now he’s driving home thinking about Cory and those men.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ae475e82000004200b8fefa.jpeg?cache=qqZHcs3UA2&ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"RELIGION","headline":"Chilean Clergy Abuse Victims Took Their Stories Of Survival To Pope Francis","authors":"Carol Kuruvilla","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chilean-clergy-abuse-victims-took-their-stories-of-survival-to-pope-francis_us_5ae7712ce4b04aa23f260528","short_description":"“Today I have more hope in the future of our church,\" said Juan Carlos Cruz. \"Even though the task is enormous.”","date":"2018-04-30"},"articleContent":["Three Chilean survivors of clergy sex abuse said they are encouraged after private meetings with Pope Francis at the Vatican.","The conversations, which took place over the weekend at the pope’s Casa Santa Marta residence, were arranged by the Vatican after Francis received harsh criticism for his handling of the sex abuse crisis in Chile.","On Twitter, José Andrés Murillo said he tried to emphasize to the pope that the abuse he had suffered as a teenager at the hands of a pedophile priest was specifically an “abuse of power.” He wrote that he had spoken to Francis for two hours. Another victim, James Hamilton, tweeted that his conversation with Francis was “enormously constructive” and that he left it “very happy and satisfied.”","Juan Carlos Cruz, the third victim, wrote on Twitter that he had spoken privately with Francis for more than 2½ hours on Sunday.","“He listened to me with great respect, affection and closeness, like a father. We talked about many subjects,” Cruz wrote. “Today I have more hope in the future of our church... even though the task is enormous.”","Before the meetings, Vatican spokesman Greg Burke announced that the Holy See will not be releasing official press statements about the conversations, since Francis’ primary intention was to “listen to the victims, ask them for forgiveness and respect the confidentiality of these meetings.”","Francis had previously received sharp rebuke from clergy sex abuse victims and their advocates after he was caught on tape in January accusing the men of slander against Chile’s Bishop Juan Barros. Murillo, Hamilton and Cruz claim Barros witnessed abuse carried out by the Rev. Fernando Karadima but did nothing to stop it. The three men testified against Karadima during a Vatican trial that eventually led to the priest’s conviction in 2011. Barros continues to deny knowing about the abuse.","Francis appointed Barros to lead the diocese of Osorno in 2015 despite protestations from Chilean politicians and local Catholic clergy.","Earlier this month, Francis admitted that he had made “serious errors” in handling Chile’s sex abuse scandal due to a “lack of truthful and balanced information.” In a rare move, he also summoned all 32 of Chile’s bishops to Rome during the third week of May to discuss the allegations against Barros.","Anne Barrett Doyle, co-director of BishopAccountability, an organization that tracks clergy sex abuse worldwide, said that she was moved by the “graciousness” of the three men after their meetings with Francis.","“Given the years of silence and disrespect they’ve endured from church officials, including Pope Francis, they could have refused the pope’s invitation,” she told HuffPost in an email. “But always, Juan Carlos Cruz, Jimmy Hamilton and José Andrés Murillo focus on the bigger picture ― in this case, the plight of the many Chilean victims who have no voice, and the ongoing safety crisis in Chilean parishes and Catholic schools.”","Barrett Doyle cautioned that speaking with survivors is a start, but it doesn’t constitute change. She hopes that, along with removing Barros and other Chilean clergy who were aware of Karadima’s crimes, Francis will also create an efficient system for investigating and disciplining bishops who have enabled child abuse.","“Meeting with survivors is a time-tested, winning public relations tactic for popes and bishops,” Barrett Doyle said. “Time will tell whether these meetings were mere damage control or a precursor of desperately needed systemic change in the global Catholic church.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ae793741a00004300cdd490.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"WEIRD NEWS","headline":"Library Shut Down After Stinky Fruit Mistaken For Gas Leak","authors":"David Moye","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/durian-smell-melbourne-australia-library_us_5ae73830e4b04aa23f25a762","short_description":"The odor of the durian fruit has been compared to “turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock.”","date":"2018-04-30"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Aidy Bryant Of ‘SNL’ Got Married, Surprises Fans With Announcement","authors":"Elyse Wanshel","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/aidy-bryant-of-snl-got-married-and-surprises-fans-with-announcement_us_5ae77606e4b055fd7fcebdac","short_description":"💕","date":"2018-04-30"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"CRIME","headline":"Wealthy Texas Couple Accused Of Enslaving Young Woman For 16 Years","authors":"David Lohr","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/wealthy-texas-couple-accused-of-enslaving-young-woman-for-16-years_us_5ae7868fe4b055fd7fced624","short_description":"One of the suspects is the son of Guinea's first president, CNN reports.","date":"2018-04-30"},"articleContent":["A Texas couple has been accused of holding a Guinean girl against her will for more than a decade, all the while subjecting her to abuse and forcing her to perform household chores.","Mohamed Toure and his wife, Denise Cros-Toure, both 57, allegedly forced the girl to sleep on the floor in their Southlake home and subjected her to beatings with belts and electrical cords, federal investigators said.","According to the Justice Department, the girl, who is not named in court documents, does not even know her birthdate. She told authorities the Toure family brought her to the United States from Guinea in 2000, when she was about 5 years old. She said the family never celebrated her birthday or enrolled her in school.","“Throughout the years ... the defendants forced the victim to labor in their home for long hours without pay,” the Justice Department said in an April 26 press release. “The defendants required her to cook, clean, do the laundry, perform yard work, and paint, as well as care for their five children.”","The criminal complaint filed by prosecutors further alleges the girl was regularly referred to as “a little nothing,” a slave, and on at least one occasion, a whore. She also allegedly told investigators Cros-Toure once assaulted her by grabbing one of her earrings and yanking it with such force that it tore her earlobe. The investigative documents indicate the girl has a visible scar on one of her ears.","Toure and his wife are natives of Guinea, and he is the son of Guinea’s first president, Ahmed Sekou Toure, according to CNN.

The results show a burst of support for gun reform in the two weeks after the shooting, followed by a gradual reversion to the mean. Once-heightened concerns about gun violence have tapered back to previous levels, as has a desire for stricter gun laws and a belief that gun restrictions can be passed without violating Second Amendment rights.","A few changes in thought, however, seem to have stuck.","The percentage of Americans who believe it’s politically possible to pass gun laws has dropped several points since its high in late February, but it’s still higher than it was in the aftermath of last year’s massacres in Las Vegas and Sutherland Springs, Texas.","In the most recent survey, one-fifth of Americans also chose gun policies as one of the two issues they found most important. That remains a noticeable, if modest, uptick from the 13 percent who chose it as a priority following the shooting in Sutherland Springs. Other polling since the Parkland shooting also suggested gun control was carrying greater-than-usual prominence on the campaign trail, although it’s unclear how much of that energy will remain until November.","That public opinion shifted at all in the wake of the shooting was striking. It’s even more striking that it lasted as long as it did. Last year’s shootings, by contrast, appeared to have little effect on Americans’ views about guns.","One illustration of the uncommon nature of this year’s debate comes from Google Trends, which tracks the level interest in various search terms. According to that data, searches for “mass shooting” usually dwarf searches for “gun control” in the aftermath of an incident, and both disappear soon after. After the Parkland shooting, though, interest in gun control significantly outpaced attention to the shooting itself.","Even now, specific gun reform proposals remain broadly popular.","In the most recent survey, conducted in mid-April, three-quarters of Americans favored strengthening background checks, while just 13 percent opposed the proposal. A 63 percent majority favored raising the age for gun purchases to 21, with only about one-quarter in opposition. And a 42 percent plurality of those polled said President Donald Trump was not doing enough to pass new gun laws, while about one-quarter said he’s doing the right amount. Just 9 percent that he’s doing too much. (At the end of February, 37 percent said Trump wasn’t doing enough.)","Data from other pollsters, meanwhile, suggests that the national focus on guns is waning. But some find that the decline has stopped short of entirely erasing the changes post-Parkland.","Some of the most granular information comes from the progressive pollster Civiqs, which has been tracking data on gun control for several years. According to its data, voters’ backing for such restrictions spiked from the low 50s prior to the Parkland shooting to a high of 60 percent ― a bigger reaction than in the wake of mass shootings in Charleston, South Carolina; San Bernardino, California; Orlando, Florida; Las Vegas and Sutherland Springs. Some of that change wore off in the weeks after, stabilizing around the 55 percent mark.","Civiqs’ data only goes back through 2015. But support for enacting new gun laws in April was higher than it was after the shooting at a Newtown, Connecticut, elementary school in 2012, according to a Washington Post/ABC News survey, thanks largely to a movement among Democratic-leaning groups. A 53 percent majority of Americans told pollsters they believed student activism on guns were part of a lasting movement, while 43 percent said the rallies were “more of a one-time thing.”","Another poll from Gallup found that the share of Americans mentioning guns or gun control as the nation’s most important problem dropped from 13 percent in March to 6 percent in April ― a downtick that nevertheless leaves it as one of the highest-ranked national issues. In a recent NPR/PBS NewsHour Marist poll, a slim 53 percent majority of Democratic voters said guns will be a major factor for them in November, down 21 points since February.","“This finding raises a cautionary flag for voters who want gun policy to be front and center this election cycle,” Marist polling director Lee Miringoff told NPR.","Use the widget below to further explore the results of the most recent HuffPost/YouGov survey, using the menu at the top to select survey questions and the buttons at the bottom to filter the data by subgroups:"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ae78de91a00004300cdd48a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Ryan Reynolds Perfectly Trolls 'Avengers' By Revealing Why He's Not In The Film","authors":"Ed Mazza","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ryan-reynolds-deadpool-avengers-rejection_us_5ae6a700e4b04aa23f245769","short_description":"\"The Merc With A Mouth\" lets his Twitter do the talking.","date":"2018-04-30"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Bernardo Bertolucci Says Ridley Scott Should Be Ashamed For Replacing Kevin Spacey","authors":"Ron Dicker","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernardo-bertolucci-ridley-scott-kevin-spacey_us_5ae72ecbe4b04aa23f25940e","short_description":"\"I immediately wanted to make a film with Spacey,\" the Italian director said.","date":"2018-04-30"},"articleContent":["Italian filmmaker Bernardo Bertolucci said over the weekend that fellow director Ridley Scott “should be ashamed” for replacing Kevin Spacey in “All the Money in the World,” according to The Hollywood Reporter.

Just look at the seminal “9 to 5,” “Office Space,” “The Office” and “Corporate,” all pop cultural depictions that draw on the inescapable ennui of zombielike number-crunchers and buttoned-up executive assistants who subsist on burnt coffee and keyboard cleaner, waiting for the day their crappy co-workers and abusive bosses get their due.","Netflix and Sanrio’s new anime series “Aggretsuko,” which debuted on the streaming service on Friday, takes the mundane workplace frustration many of us have come to know and cranks the dial to 11. The series follows Retsuko, an endearing red panda who wants nothing more than to get through her work days without incident. And when real life doesn’t measure up to her hopes, she turns to the only thing that temporarily soothes her discontent: death metal.","There’s a lot for Retsuko to get angry about. She works in accounting for some vague corporate entity, one of several lackeys made to tidy the desk of her rage-inducing boss, a literal chauvinist pig. She heads to the office in an overstuffed commuter train, only to have to face a rumor-spreading hippopotamus and a Komodo dragon who loves to dump extra work on her. She faces small, relatable dilemmas outside her job, too: feeling conflicted over how much to give for a wedding present, or simply wanting to shop without constant check-ins from a store clerk.","She gets by thanks to her work buddies — a chill fennec fox with unmatched social-media stalking skills and a hyena in slacks (who, based on Twitter’s consensus, seems to be the most crush-worthy character). She’s in awe of two more experienced colleagues, women who strut down the hallways with an air of #girlboss assuredness, but who actually share many of our titular hero’s insecurities.","Retusko channels all of this insecurity and rage into a death-metal hobby that lets her express exactly how she feels. She tries to hide it first from her more intimidating female co-workers and then from a love interest, but realizes her truest self lies within these moments. It’s in these small vignettes where Retsuko is able to be fully unvarnished: “You’re a shitty boss!” she scream-sings during a work happy hour. “Death metal is my soul!!!” she confesses in another episode.","The sharp contrast between Retsuko’s adorable outward appearance and her unbridled rage-singing is played for laughs in each of the series’ 10 episodes, yet doesn’t become tiresome. Perhaps because it’s rare to see a female character, animated or not, succumb fully to her anger, especially in a way that’s seen as a net positive. Retsuko’s metal habit provides a private, nondestructive space to contend with the pitfalls of an early-career slog.","Requiring a standing appointment at a karaoke bar might be self-care taken to its most extreme, but Retsuko isn’t a role model. She’s just trying to make it through her 20s.","The lyrics of Retsuko’s throat-murdering screams are the cherry atop her rage sundae, adapting to fit her crisis du jour. In one episode, she determines that all she needs is a wealthy partner to escape her current drudgery. Cue the metal guitars, and the passionate cry of future financial security: “MATRIMONIAL FREEDOM!” It’s good.","American audiences might not immediately associate the show with Sanrio, the Japanese company best known for Hello Kitty. Retsuko, along with Sanrio’s listless egg character Gudetama, stand out from the company’s other happily uncomplicated creations by virtue of their issues. Even Retsuko’s resting “cute” face lacks a smile.","The full-length series, inspired by shorts that aired on Japan’s Tokyo Broadcasting System network, hits on an interesting spot. It feels intended for an audience older than do kid-adult crossovers like “Adventure Time” or “Steven Universe.” Yet its lightness — despite all its rage — doesn’t feel quite in line with the darker adult-cartoon stalwart (and fellow Netflix original) “BoJack Horseman.” Still, it’s pointed enough to feel true to life, even if heavy metal isn’t your genre.","The series is generally self-aware, of the moment and endearingly weird: Retsuko’s fennec fox friend, for example, details a pattern in their co-worker’s Instagram feed, nailing down her routine of food, selfie and occasional “thigh shot” pictures. But the office caricatures aren’t always charitable. That same ’gram-friendly co-worker, a starry-eyed doe who talks in a baby voice, also allows the gross boss to flirt with her to her benefit. She’s clearly set up as a contrast to Retsuko and company — surely they’d never stoop so low — but her overly ditzy depiction feels a little one-note at first.","Each episode is a short 15 minutes, putting “Aggretsuko” in the ranks of Netflix’s other feel-good original fare that requires minimal time commitment (looking at you, “Nailed It”). The effect of catching a handful in one sitting is like having read several culturally savvy comic strips: bright colors, enough for a laugh, but not a lot of narrative depth. Fortunately, “Aggretsuko” isn’t trying for prestige television; it succeeds as a cathartic mirror to contemporary office life — and the activities that sustain us once we’ve punched out.","Looking for more streaming recommendations?

The Archdiocese of Los Angeles sold the hilltop mansion to Perry, while the nuns tried to sell their former home to a local California businesswoman. A judge invalidated the nuns’ sale in March 2017 since they did not receive permission from the Vatican, a step that is required by canon law.","The last surviving nun involved in the property dispute, 80-year-old Sister Rita Callanan, told Fox News earlier this month that she is appealing for a meeting with Francis.

In the show’s fictional universe, the photo is a shot of Juliet, sister to parkgoer Logan (Ben Barnes) and the eventual wife of William (Jimmi Simpson and Ed Harris), aka the Man in Black. A mere glimpse of the real world beyond Peter’s robotic realm seemingly caused him to malfunction.","Mr. Abernathy’s frazzled moment was a pivotal “Westworld” plot point, so of course the internet went nuts when fans realized the show had apparently used a Getty stock image of a random woman, rather than hire an actress to play the role of Juliet.","The photographer credited for the photo is Erik von Weber, a name that sounds curiously like Arnold Weber (Jeffrey Wright), one of the characters on the show who helped create Westworld.","Von Weber’s stock images have been used by a variety of websites, including HuffPost, so his involvement in the show didn’t immediately raise red flags. But when fans looked closer at von Weber’s Getty photos, they noticed some other notable pictures: images of horses, cowboys and, most interestingly, samurai, which are all subjects that have a connection to Westworld.","Hmmm. Could von Weber have some secret ties to HBO?","Well, something fascinating just happened: In Season 2, Episode 2, titled “Reunion,” the woman from the Times Square stock photo made an appearance on the show.","HuffPost reached out to the actress, Claire Unabia, to ask her about the experience of evolving from stock photo subject to “Westworld” actress, and she revealed an interesting detail: According to Unabia, the picture she posed for wasn’t originally meant to be a stock photo.","“I’ll be honest with you, I don’t know if they got that photo that way, because that picture, as far as I know, wasn’t for a stock photo,” she said. “I don’t know if that’s actually the way that they got it. I’m not sure. I’ll just put it out there that maybe it wasn’t actually a stock photo.”","Though she doesn’t remember all the specifics of the shoot in question, Unabia recalled it was for a job involving some sort of “technology company.”","“It was for a particular job. What I recall was for technology, [an] internal technology picture, so that’s what I recall taking it for.”","Uh, “technology”? Claire, are you talking about Delos, the company running Westworld?","The actress didn’t think the shoot, which she previously told HuffPost happened about four years before Season 1, was some big HBO conspiracy to take photos of potential “Westworld” stars, but she believes the showrunners “might have had other reasons when they chose the picture.”","She is also suspicious about “Erik von Weber.”","“I don’t recall that name at all,” said Unabia, adding, “Maybe the name is not the actual name.”","When reached for comment on von Weber’s possible connection to the show, HBO reps said they didn’t know if there was any information to share on the topic. We also contacted representatives at Getty Images, who said von Weber has refused all media requests.","But if there is a connection between the photographer and the show, this opens up a wormhole of possibilities. Are the samurai photos on his account associated with the Delos park Shogun World? Do some of von Weber’s other photos hint at future show reveals, too?","Most notably, von Weber’s photos include images of knights and people dressed up like barbarians. Maybe these are peeks into a medieval park world, which was in the original 1973 movie and is rumored to be appearing on the show.","In addition to the conspiracy theory, Unabia talked to us about what it was like when HBO tracked her down and put her in the episode.","So when did you really find out your picture was in the show?","It was when [HuffPost’s Carly Ledbetter] reached out asking to talk to me about that and confirm it was me in the picture, and that’s when I found out.","What was your reaction?","I was very surprised. But it’s a kind of a thing where you feel like when you’re putting yourself out there in a way that somehow it will get picked up by the world, so in some way I wasn’t surprised.","When did HBO contact you?","It was after Season 1 finished.\n\nThey had actually a slightly hard time getting in touch with me as well, and then it was a bit of back and forth with them. They asked me to do a scene and send it to them, and I didn’t hear anything for a while. Then they had some troubles with their shooting and script. They went through a lot of things, so their timeline was put off from what they thought it would’ve been previously. Then, they finally called me in to shoot as if I had known I was coming the whole time. Like, “OK, can you come two days from now or tomorrow?”","What? So were you able to change your schedule?","I did. I was working on some other job, but it was just going to be the last two days of it or something, so I just canceled the last two days and went out.","What’s it like arriving in “Westworld”?","It was a bit magical. You definitely feel like you’re stepping into another world when you arrive at the ranch. It looks a bit just like how it looks on the show, so you feel like you’ve stepped into that world, and I saw some of the set design. It’s crazy how some of it doesn’t feel like these psychotic crazy scary places, but then when I realize what it was, then I had that feeling like, “Oh my gosh. This is that place, and it looks like that place, and it looks like nothing right now, but it’s very scary.”","Was anybody like, “Oh, you’re the person from the photo”?","Yeah, somebody — another director — he came up to me, and he thought he knew me and was talking to me. “Oh, how are you?” and everything. And then it was minutes later that he said, “Oh, my gosh! You’re from the picture!” And he just realized it.","So what was your character, Juliet, thinking when she saw Dolores?","Oh, a world of terrible and suspicious things.","[Laugh] That’s what it looked like.","As a married person, you know, it’s when you have that look and understanding and kind of seeing your whole marriage or life in a way on the edge. It’s very upsetting. Especially in my house? This woman. She comes into my house?","So do you have any theories about the show?","My husband has a theory that I’m going to come back as a robot and kill the Dolores character and have a face off with her. But no, I don’t know anything. I’m not holding fast to any one theory or idea.","So is it weird that Logan is carrying around a picture of his sister in the park?","Yes, I do try to find reasons for that myself. I don’t know.

The cache of material was worth more than $5 million; Clinton’s campaign made an in-kind donation of resources worth $3.5 million, and the DNC paid for the rest.","Now a number of Democratic Party officials, including some state party chairs and DNC members, want Clinton to retroactively donate the campaign materials to the DNC and return the money that the party organ gave Onward Together.","“She should return the money for the ‘love of the Democratic Party’ to the DNC for its use,” said Alabama Democratic Party chairwoman Nancy Worley, who supported Clinton during the 2016 primary.","Wisconsin Democratic Party chairwoman Martha Laning and Missouri Democratic National Committeeman Curtis Wylde likewise called on her to retroactively donate it and return the payment.","And Nebraska Democratic Party chairwoman Jane Kleeb, who supported Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in the 2016 primary, argued that Clinton could also contribute the equivalent money to state Democratic parties.","Other DNC officials, including at-large member Brian Wahby and Kansas Democratic National Committeeman Chris Reeves, welcomed an in-kind donation but stopped short of asking for it.","“It would be a Christian thing to do,” Wahby said.","Sanders’ office did not return a request for comment on whether the senator agrees.","Nick Merrill, a Clinton spokesman, defended the price tag on Thursday on the grounds that the DNC has already reaped far more than it paid for the email list in fundraising so far.","“Paying a rental fee for use of an email list is common practice, and in this case the DNC has raised over $30 million with it, an 1,800 [percent] return on their investment,” Merrill wrote in an email to Fox News. (The DNC purchased the email list to own, rather than renting its information.)","Merrill did not respond to a HuffPost request for comment on calls to retroactively make the resources an in-kind contribution and return the money already received.","Xochitl Hinojosa, a DNC spokeswoman, agreed that the DNC had gotten “a return on our investment and more since obtaining all of the lists and data.”","Donna Brazile forged the agreement between the Clinton campaign and the DNC in February 2017, while she was serving as interim DNC chairwoman. Brazile, who has been critical of how the Clinton campaign treated the DNC, said she believed the deal would help her successor as DNC chair “inherit a party in good shape.”","“I felt that it was a fair bargain at the time,” she said.","The current DNC chairman, Tom Perez, has amended the payment schedule, but the core of the accord ― how much the DNC would pay and what it would get in return ― remains in place, according to Hinojosa.","The DNC paid Onward Together $300,000 in January and $135,000 in every subsequent month, according to Federal Election Commission filings and information provided by the DNC. Thus far, it has transferred $705,000 to Clinton’s group; as of the end of this month, that sum will have increased to $840,000.","The revelation of the sale of Clinton campaign resources to the DNC has struck a nerve with some Democratic officials because it exemplifies practices that they have criticized for years.","These Democrats lament the transactional relationship of Democratic standard-bearers with the DNC and state parties, which often have a harder time fundraising. Former President Barack Obama withheld his campaign email list entirely from the DNC during his first term, using it instead to build his political group, Organizing for America (later renamed Organizing for Action). After Obama’s re-election in 2012, he initially allowed the DNC to use the list free of charge before formally donating it to the party body in 2015.","Officials from state parties who joined the Clinton campaign’s joint fundraising agreement during the 2016 election also complained that the campaign left state parties little funding to maintain their operations.","Onward Together, which as a 501(c)(4) political nonprofit is not required to disclose its financial data, says it has distributed grants to 11 progressive groups, including Indivisible, Swing Left, Run for Something and Color of Change.","However, there are many forms of political organizing that state parties, unlike those groups, are uniquely equipped to do. For example, state parties have historically played important roles in recruiting candidates for state and local office; advising and funding those candidates; and registering and turning out voters in down-ballot races.","Another source of tension is what Sanders allies see as a double standard being applied to the Vermont senator’s famously successful campaign email list. Although Sanders was not the Democratic presidential nominee, after the campaign, many Democrats called on Sanders to turn over his list to the DNC. (Sanders has declined to do so.)","“They weren’t saying Bernie, ‘Rent your list.’ They wanted the list,” said Jim Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute and a Sanders appointee to the DNC’s Unity and Reform Commission. “They said, ‘All candidates do this ― they turn it over to the party.’ Well, now I find out that they don’t.”","Zogby, who refused to comment on the conduct of the Clinton campaign, was one of several reformers who pressed the Unity Commission to recommend the creation of a financial oversight committee at the DNC with full access to the party’s budget data.","He hopes that the latest revelation will increase support among the DNC’s membership to approve the oversight committee and other financial transparency measures. The entire DNC membership is due to vote on the proposals in August.","“It is critical to the ultimate survival of the party as a viable institution,” Zogby said."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ae787ff1a00002700cdd487.jpeg?cache=DyyusWFdGc&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Seth Rogen Breaks His Silence On James Franco Sexual Misconduct Accusations","authors":"Alanna Vagianos","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/seth-rogen-james-franco-accusations_us_5ae75f70e4b055fd7fce9970","short_description":"Five women accused Franco of coercing them into unwanted sexual encounters or on-set nudity.","date":"2018-04-30"},"articleContent":["Seth Rogen is finally weighing in on those sexual misconduct allegations against his longtime friend James Franco.","Rogen recently sat down with Vulture to discuss his upcoming Netflix special “Hilarity For Charity,” his likable stoner persona and his work on “The Disaster Artist,” which Franco directed.","When Vulture’s David Marchese asked Rogen about five women’s accusations of sexual misconduct against Franco, the actor responded somewhat hesitantly.","“The truth is that my perspective on this is the least relevant perspective. I’m friends with these people and I’m a dude,” Rogen said. “All that combined makes me the last person who should be talking about this.”","Rogen added that the allegations do not change his willingness to work with Franco in the future.","In an explosive Los Angeles Times article in January, four actresses and one filmmaker said Franco asked them to perform sexually inappropriate and coercive scenes during a class he taught. According to the report, the women described Franco “storming off” a movie set when they refused his demands to appear naked.","Franco said the allegations were “not accurate,” but that he supports “people coming out and being able to have a voice.” His film “The Disaster Artist” won best actor awards at both the Golden Globes and the Critics Choice Awards, and was nominated for an Oscar.","Rogen said he’s very aware of being a white man in an industry that lacks diversity and has a real issue with sexism and sexual harassment. That awareness, he said, definitely influences his work.","“This is not in any way about pandering, but I think ‘Neighbors 2’ had an incredibly progressive message. I think ‘Blockers’ has an incredibly progressive message. We hired Kay Cannon to direct it and she did an amazing job,” Rogen said. “We’re hyperaware of trying to be as representative as possible in the directors and writers and actors we work with.

Lance Bass, JC Chasez, Joey Fatone, Chris Kirkpatrick and Justin Timberlake were stretched a little too thin and in need of some R&R, fans were led to believe.","But as the months rolled on and Timberlake released his first solo album, “Justified,” the situation proved to be a little more murky.","“There’s no reason my solo career and *NSYNC can’t coexist in the same universe. *NSYNC is in no danger. The break we’re on was a conscious move. We all wanted to do it, and we were ready to do it. Performing at stadiums every night for 50,000 fans takes a little out of you ... The time was right; we were all in the same zone,” Timberlake told The New York Post in November 2002, before cryptically adding of his new record “Justified”: “This album is what I wanted to do.”","What Timberlake wanted to do, yes, and perhaps Chasez, who also headed into the studio to work on a solo project.","“For us, it happened organically,” Chasez told me over the phone last month, a few weeks before he was set to reunite with his former bandmates for a Hollywood Walk of Fame ceremony in Los Angeles. “After you do something for a certain amount of time, you get into a rhythm of it and then new things spark your curiosity; you need new brain food. At that time, we just felt like we had exhausted every kind of idea for what we were doing and we just felt like ‘OK, let’s do something different.’ So, that’s what we did.”","All these “we’s” suggest that the break was a unanimous decision, a Kumbaya conclusion that served to benefit everyone. And maybe it was. But an actual breakup? Not so much.","“We thought we were getting back together,” Fatone told me. “It was, ’OK, after [Justin] does his thing, blah, blah, blah, we’ll get back together and move forward and do what we got to do. And then it was like, nope. The record company wanted to push Justin, I guess, is what it was. He got bigger and bigger, which is honestly great for him and I’m totally happy for him in that sense, but it was more or less weird that there wasn’t an explanation to say we’re not going to do it, period. I was a little bit on hold for a moment and it was like, ‘OK, we got to shit or get off the pot.’”","In fact, the band never officially announced the end of *NSYNC. Yet, in his 2007 book Out of Sync ― released five years after their initial rest period ― Bass wrote, “We’re definitely broken up. It’s not a hiatus. Justin made it clear that he wouldn’t be interested in discussing another album any time soon.”","When I asked Bass about the hiatus-turned-breakup, he said he always saw *NSYNC “evolving and maturing,” despite its origins as a boy band. “We all decided, ‘OK, six months. We need it. We need the vacation time, we need the downtime,’” he said. “But when we came back, it just … everything changed.”","“It took us a while to naturally say, ‘You know what? I think ... we might be done,’” Bass recalled, laughing. “And that’s how it was. It wasn’t anything crazy – no big, crazy fight to break us up. We’re all still close and we talk daily, but I guess it just had run its time, which was sad because I was really excited for the next album.”","Fatone and Kirkpatrick felt the same way.","“I was upset at first about the ‘why.’ Then you understand the logistics of everything,” Fatone said.","“I don’t know if I was ready for it to end,” Kirkpatrick added. “In my 20s and into my early 30s, I was in a band touring the world every day. You wake up and there’s a schedule on your floor saying you have a photo shoot this time, a meet-and-greet this time, a radio interview this time, a TV appearance this time and a show this time. Then, suddenly, you wake up and there’s nothing. You’re like, ‘Oh man, where do I go now?’”","To fans and music critics alike, it was a strange choice for *NSYNC to throw in the towel after only a few very successful years and three chart-topping albums. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter last year, Timberlake further explained his leaving. “It started as a fun snowball fight that was becoming an avalanche,” he said. “And, also, I was growing out of it. I felt like I cared more about the music than some of the other people in the group.”","Whether he did or didn’t is up for debate. Chasez produced and wrote multiple *NSYNC songs, and admitted the studio is still his safe haven. And Bass said he spent a good portion of his time off in Nashville writing lyrics for what he thought would be the band’s next album.","“I had several songs that I wrote that I was going to present, so that was definitely sad that I didn’t get to experience that part of making the next album,” Bass said. “I thought our sound just kept evolving ― from ‘*NSYNC’ to ‘No Strings Attached’ to ‘Celebrity,’ you could see the growth there. It would’ve been very interesting to see what our sound would be like today.”","After years apart, the five members of *NSYNC will be back together on Hollywood Boulevard to receive a star on the Walk of Fame. They won’t be performing, though. Instead, the group will be joined by family members and former collaborators, including speakers Ellen DeGeneres and Carson Daly, recruited to commemorate their legacy in the presence of the Chamber of Commerce and fans. There’s even an “immersive experience” (read: a memorabilia mecca) for former followers called The Dirty Pop-Up. It’s a nostalgic affair, laced with an air of anticlimax: *NSYNC is reuniting without really reuniting.","Ahead of the ceremony, I reached out to the former members to see if I could compile an investigation of *NSYNC’s demise. Bass, Chasez, Fatone and Kirkpatrick obliged, mostly eager to reminisce about the good ole days of wide-legged cargo pants, frosted-tip hair and smooth a cappella. But Timberlake, who’s already had a few shots at explaining his side of the story, was too busy to hop on the phone. (He’s currently on the U.S. leg of his Man of the Woods tour.) Perhaps it was for the best, because the other guys got très deep about the beginnings of the group, fame in the early aughts, their unfortunate dissolution and their unlikely-but-high hopes for a legitimate reunion.","Behold: A history of *NSYNC’s breakup (and everything that led to it), according to bandmates not named Justin Timberlake.","It’s Gonna Be Me: The Rise Of Chris Kirkpatrick’s Boy Band","As most histories will tell you, *NSYNC was formed by the now-late and disgraced record producer Lou Pearlman in Orlando, Florida, in the mid-1990s, after he found huge success with their future rivals, The Backstreet Boys. Chris Kirkpatrick was the one who met with Pearlman to discuss starting another boy band, thanks to a connection to Backstreet Boy Howie Dorough.","“I went to school [Valencia College in Orlando] with Howie ― we had chorus together,” Kirkpatrick said. “And there was another kid, Charlie Edwards, who went and became a Backstreet Boy, and I guess he had a falling out with a producer and quit. He’s the one who came to me saying that this guy Lou Pearlman was looking for another band.”","After Pearlman and Kirkpatrick met, Kirkpatrick began helping him audition potential band members, bringing “quartets I was in from school.” They landed on a few potential singers who eventually dropped out before Mickey Mouse Club alum and Tennessean Justin Timberlake walked into the picture, bringing along fellow Mouseketeer and Maryland native JC Chasez. During a bonding night out at Disney World’s Pleasure Island, the newly formed trio happened to run into a mutual friend who seemed like a natural addition: Brooklyn-born Orlando transplant Joey Fatone. And just like that, there were four.","“I was like, ‘Hey, this is my buddy Joey! We both worked at Universal!’ And JC was like, ‘Yeah, we know him. He used to come to the Mickey Mouse Club,’” Kirkpatrick explained. “So we all knew each other and we were like, ‘Hey man, we’re putting together a group!’”","At the time, Fatone was in another group, Big Guys, with Luis Fonsi, but he left to join Kirkpatrick’s budding ensemble, deciding his then-bandmate Jason Galasso would round out the quintet. That’s when the concept for the name “In Sync,” aka *NSYNC, was formed, using the last letters of the guys’ first names: JustiN, ChriS, JoeY, JasoN, and JC. Of course, Galasso didn’t last long. He was soon replaced by Mississippi teen Lance Bass, who allegedly earned the nickname Lansten so the remaining “N” in the group’s name would still make sense.","“Bob Westbrook was Justin’s and my vocal coach, so when they got the group together, Justin called him to see if he knew of any bass singers that would work and he immediately thought of me,” Bass said. “I didn’t think my mom would ever let me do it!”","At 14, Timberlake was the youngest member of the group, followed by Bass, 16; Fatone, 18; Chasez, 19; and Kirkpatrick, 23. Timberlake’s and Bass’ moms stayed with the band as they traveled and rehearsed, since the pair was too young to go without chaperones.","“We’d have my mom and Justin’s mom washing the clothes in hotel sinks every night because we’d wear the same outfit for like six months,” Bass said with a laugh. “We didn’t really have a choice of what we wore at the beginning because it was just whatever we could afford.”","By 1996, *NSYNC signed with BMG Ariola Munich and were carted off to Europe to work with Swedish music producer and songwriter Denniz PoP and producer Max Martin in PoP’s Cheiron Studios. There, they perfected their “boy-band” image ― an image they weren’t quite sure would work with their musical background.","“The only time that we felt like we were kind of pushed with new stuff and new styles was when we were in Europe, because everything was so new to us. We thought we were kind of getting cultured,” Chasez laughed. “We were experimenting and trying to be as excited and open as possible.”","“We basically had label and management people looking down on us saying, ‘Hey, now you have to do this,’ especially the late Lou Pearlman. He was always like [imitating his husky voice], ‘Now I want to see you guys like this,’” Kirkpatrick said. “I think we could’ve been a lot better right out of the gate if he wasn’t there trying to push us into this mold. The word boy band wasn’t even out then, and it was almost like Lou knew what that was.”","In the beginning, a cappella music was *NSYNC’s passion. Kirkpatrick recalled how, during those days abroad, the guys would find a hallway with great acoustics and harmonize ― conjuring an image we always hoped existed, of five beatific friends who just can’t stop singing.","“So to be in this band where it was like, ‘OK, we want you to dress as clowns. OK, now we want you to be in the swimming pool with your shirts off.’ There were so many times where we thought why are we doing this? This is stupid,” Kirkpatrick said.","Although each bandmate emphasized that they weren’t aggressively slotted into personas, they did tick a certain box, respectively, when it came to fitting the five-person boy band mold Pearlman originally envisioned. The boxes weren’t as “cut and dry as the Spice Girls,” Kirkpatrick noted, but they contained certain fan niches.","“We were never like, ‘You have to be the funny one, you have to be the cool one, you got to be the sexy one,’” Fatone said. “Like Chris is always the prankster and the jokester. Justin has a great voice and everyone wants to marry him. And the moms wanted to take me home and cook me dinner. That’s the one I always got.”","“We always thought that the most important thing was to be good at what we were doing, and then the rest we’d let the chips fall where they may,” Chasez said.","That was the mantra when determining who would get the lead solos, too. Kirkpatrick explained that, in the beginning, the guys would take turns singing verses when practicing a cappella, and when it came time to record in studio, it was clear two voices stood out.","“Justin and JC had already been doing this, they were professionals, they knew what they were doing. But they also proved themselves to be the best lead vocals for the songs. I had a really high falsetto, so I would do the backgrounds, octaves and harmonies,” as would Joey and Lance, Kirkpatrick said.","After exploding in Germany with their hit “I Want You Back,” they released their self-titled album under BMG, Ariola Records and Trans Continental in May 1997. It peaked at No. 1 in its second week on the charts. *NSYNC became an overnight success abroad, touring across Europe and garnering the attention of RCA Records, which signed them to an American deal. The label switched out a few tracks on ”*NSYNC” and released the album in the U.S. on March 24, 1998.","But American audiences didn’t automatically swarm. “I Want You Back” wasn’t receiving the attention it had garnered overseas, and the album debuted at only No. 82 on the Billboard 200. So Disney, a bastion of media aimed at tweens and beyond, swooped in and saved the day by offering the band a chance to headline a special, “*NSYNC: In Concert,” which first aired in July 1998.","“We were a little discouraged, thinking, ‘Well, I guess we’ll never be able to create that craziness we had in Europe. We’ll just have a normal career here.’ But that Disney special started to air five times a day for months and we went from zero to 100 overnight,” Bass said.","By October, their debut album reached No. 2 on the Billboard 200 and, well, pandemonium ensued.","The ‘No Strings’ Years: How ‘Clockwork Orange’ Inspired *NSYNC","Justin, JC, Joey, Chris and Lance quickly became household names, their faces peering down from posters in teenage bedrooms. “Tearin’ Up My Heart” ― or their equally successful holiday album “Home For Christmas” ― rang through adolescent boom boxes everywhere. They toured the U.S., appeared on “Total Request Live,” and showed up at events alongside the reigning princess of pop, Britney Spears, Timberlake’s longtime girlfriend. (That’s a whole other story.)","“It was almost like going to college in a way, growing up with these different artists who were pretty much the same age and all starting at the same time: Destiny’s Child, Mandy Moore, Britney, Christina [Aguilera], Backstreet – it was like a pop college,” Bass said. “We all worked together, toured together and became kind of family.”","Friends, perhaps, but foes nonetheless. Anyone who consumed entertainment news 20 years ago knows of the relentless fan rivalry between *NSYNC and The Backstreet Boys, which the bandmates claim was entirely perpetuated by the press.","“Everybody, mostly the fans, were trying to pit us against each other, but for a while there we had the same management. So everywhere we turned it was like we were doing our thing, they were doing their thing, but it was always ‘Backstreet, Backstreet, Backstreet’ to us and ‘*NSYNC, *NSYNC, *NSYNC’ to them,” Kirkpatrick said. “After a while, that kind of rubs off on you and you feed into it a little bit. I think people just wanted to pick something up and know there’s some kind of huge animosity between us. All the gossip.”","Actually, *NSYNC was focused less on the BSB drama and more on a legal battle with Pearlman, Trans Continental and BMG Entertainment over business practices. The group left mid-contract and signed with Jive Records after claiming Pearlman and the labels misled and exploited them, taking most of the profit from American album sales. A few months after Pearlman and BMG filed a $150 million lawsuit against the band for prematurely breaking a contract, both parties settled out of court. *NSYNC eventually released their third album, “No Strings Attached,” under Jive in the spring of 2000. The concept for the album, which dominated the Billboard 200 for eight consecutive weeks, was slightly inspired by the management snafu.","We thought “nobody is controlling us anymore. This is us, this is who we are, we’re not going to just appease the management and label,” Kirkpatrick said.","That album gave fans earworms like “Bye, Bye, Bye,” “It’s Gonna Be Me” and “This I Promise You.” It also provided some of the most iconic *NSYNC fashion moments: acid-washed denim jackets, leather cargo pants, spiky colored hair.","″‘No Strings Attached’ was like the Pinocchio ‘I Got No Strings’ song. We came up with this whole weird idea of patchwork orange ― a ‘Clockwork Orange’-ish sense,” Fatone said. “This guy Steven, who was on our wardrobe team, came to us with these drawings and we loved them. That’s was how the style of it went down.”","For the “It’s Gonna Be Me” video, the group ― as they did with “Bye, Bye, Bye” ― gravitated toward an on-the-nose marionette concept, portraying themselves as dolls at a toy store. Fatone said it’s one of his favorite *NSYNC music videos.","“It’s a staple, you know? Like ‘Bye, Bye, Bye.’ All our videos kind of stick out because they’re all moments in time.”","The fandom was intense in the “No Strings” era. Young followers weren’t hiding behind iPhone screens or computers tweeting about why *NSYNC was the greatest boy band of all time. They were physically present at meet-and-greets, red carpet events and concert dates.","“You’re like, ‘What the hell is going on?’ Some were die-hard fans and know my birthday or ask about my brother. They talked to you like they actually knew you, even though you’ve never met these people before in your life,” Fatone said. “They’ve followed everything you’ve done and love everything you do and everything about you. It’s a weird, surreal feeling. Even to this day, I’ve never gotten used to it.”","But the chaos was different than what the likes of Justin Bieber face today ― constant praise and scrutiny in public and on the web from admirers and critics alike.","“We were so lucky that we got to have a way more innocent time in this industry than a lot of people do today. We could be stupid teenagers, we could be seen with a beer in our hand at a club and not think someone was going to take a picture of that and send it to someone,” Bass said.","Bass, perhaps, had the toughest task in terms of dealing with wild female fans. During the days of *NSYNC, he had not yet come out as gay, and was facing the “torture” of hiding his identity behind a diluted pop culture persona.","“Being onstage and singing those songs that you don’t really relate to since you’re talking about girls, it all, to me, wasn’t real,” Bass recalled. “Onstage, I just felt like I was playing a character the whole time, but offstage, unfortunately, I didn’t get to have my real life, because I felt like I just had to hide this secret.”","After enduring what he’s described as excruciating guilt during his formative years, the singer came out in a People magazine story in 2006, shocking friends and fans. He said he kept his sexuality under wraps as not to diminish the success of his bandmates.","“The ’90s were a different time,” he said. “If you came out, if anyone knew you were gay, it was a disaster and people really flipped out. I felt like if anyone found out that I was gay, the record label would immediately drop us and the fans would hate us ― these were all the crazy things that went through my head as a teenager. So, I just trained myself into being a certain person and became that person.”","Bass said “it would’ve changed everything” if he had been open about his sexuality during his days with *NSYNC, knowing his bandmates would’ve been completely supportive.","“As long as I’ve known the guys, I’ve known that there’s not one bigoted bone in their bodies, so I knew they would be fine with it, but I also knew that they wouldn’t be able to keep their mouths shut,” he said, laughing. “That’s why I just told no one. I just thought if I even told just one single person it would get out, which it would have. So that secret stayed with me and me only.”","They Were On A Break: The Rise Of Justin And The Fall Of Everyone Else","A few months after the release of their fourth album “Celebrity,” which featured the catchy, Grammy-nominated songs “Gone” and “Girlfriend,” things started to take a turn for *NSYNC. The album sold nearly 1.9 million copies in its first week, but after touring stadiums for months on end, first with the PopOdyssey Tour in 2001 and then the Celebrity Tour in 2002, the boy band was out of fresh ideas. They decided to announce their hiatus.","“You’re thinking, ‘OK, we’ve done this, we’ve done this, we’ve done this. I don’t know what else we can do. I think I have an idea, but it’s not for this, so I’m going to change gears,’” Chasez said. “At that point, everybody had been messing with different things. Chris was messing with clothing line ideas, Lance was working on being an astronaut,” he laughed. “Joey was interested in making movies, Justin was interested in having a solo career, and I was interested in being in the studio. All of us were more interested in what was on our minds.”","In the interim, Timberlake went solo with “Justified” in November 2002, as did Chasez with his single “Blowin’ Me Up (With Her Love)” the next month and his album “Schizophrenic” in 2004. Bass set a goal of going to space (yes, really). Fatone dabbled in acting with “My Big Fat Greek Wedding,” and Kirkpatrick launched his own clothing line, FuMan Skeeto (the clothes were as bad as the name). But, again, despite personal ventures, most of the members assumed that the break wasn’t permanent ― that they would reunite, record another album and tour anew.","That never happened.","The slide out of celebrity was difficult for some. “I made the mistake of being too complacent and realizing that, man, I got this celebrity-ism and all these things going for me, so I’m going to spend the next few years of my life just partying my ass off,” Kirkpatrick said. “I was young enough where I thought that was the right thing to do. And looking back, I had so many opportunities and there was so much I could have done.”","Kirkpatrick, Bass and Fatone said they didn’t feel pressure to launch their own solo careers, but they were frustrated to see Chasez, whose debut didn’t perform anywhere near Timberlake’s effort, flounder.","“No matter what happened with Justin, he was going to end up being Justin anyway, whether or not he started in *NSYNC. But it surprises me that JC isn’t just as big, because JC is as talented,” Kirkpatrick said. “They’re both through that Mickey Mouse Club upbringing with Christina and Britney and all them, and they got their chops all together and they’re amazing talents. I really wish JC was out there doing a little more. He still has so much to offer.”","Even Timberlake praised Chasez, telling MTV in 2006, ”In my opinion, he had the best voice out of all of us. Out of all the boy bands, call ’em what you will, he was the one that could out-sing all of us.”","“It’s flattering coming from someone such as Justin, such a great musician himself. He’s one of my favorite artists,” Chasez said when I reminded him of the compliment. “The feeling is mutual. I think he’s done some of the coolest stuff that’s come out in the last 20 years. At the same time, it’s like, well, yeah, of course your friends are going to say nice things!”","Overall, the four members of *NSYNC who aren’t Justin Timberlake had nothing but nice things to say about him, calling him their super-talented “little brother.” Their admiration could ring as surprising, considering the ultimate cause of the split and the conceivably unfair toll his decision took on their individual trajectories in the industry. But now, as grown men, they seem to understand he had to be selfish to become the global superstar he is today.","“I say the name Justin Timberlake and it’s almost like saying the name Madonna ― a name where everybody’s like, ‘Yeah, of course,’” Kirkpatrick said. “I’m sitting there at the Super Bowl watching him do the halftime show like, ‘Man, this is a big deal.’ He’s really done amazing, and I’m not a jealous person, so it’s awesome to watch because I feel like that’s part of me out there.”","Speaking of the Super Bowl, how did the guys feel about being left off Timberlake’s lineup?","“Everybody wanted it, everybody was waiting for it, but it’s his show and his thing, so whatever he wants to do,” Fatone said. “The guy was doing his job. You do you. If you’re in a position, go for it! People ask if I’m upset and I’m like, ‘Nah, I can’t be. No way.’”","“We already did the MTV VMAs, so what are we going to do ― the same thing again?” Chasez insisted, with Kirkpatrick adding, “Every show’s different, every circumstance is different.”","I Want You Back: ‘If The Stars Align, Then We Get Back Together’","When it comes to *NSYNC, reunion is still the word.","Although the guys regularly keep up with each other over group text ― “Sometimes I’ll be drunk and be like, ‘Oh my god, I love you guys, you’re so great. Merry Chrismas,’” Fatone said ― they are one of the only boy bands who have not yet reunited for a tour or new album. Their only joint performance since “the break” was that MTV Video Music Awards bit for Timberlake’s Vanguard award in 2013. Now, the guys will all be together at the Walk of Fame ceremony on Monday. (Yes, Justin, too.)","“It’s a chance for us, even though we’re not singing or dancing, to still look at it as a bit of a performance, because whenever we’re together in public, people seem to want to comment on it, so it will be fun,” Chasez said, with Fatone adding, “You always wish you had something like that or some sort of legacy. It’s going to be exciting when we’re there to see all our fans again if they come out or watch it live, and see people we worked with, wrote with ― I think a lot of them are coming out, as well. It’s going to be a great reunion.”","When asked if some iconic *NSYNC looks would be making their way to Los Angeles for the event, the guys laughed the plan down.","“I don’t know if we’re going to crack out any of the old outfits. Although, Joey’s pretty great at hanging onto stuff, so he could probably put an outfit or two together,” Chasez said.","“I have some of them, but I don’t think they would fit me. That’s the problem,” Fatone joked. “What I had back then was probably a little smaller!”","“Those looks are long gone,” Kirkpatrick said, “like the hairstyles!”","And if you’re still one of those fans hoping Justin, JC, Joey, Chris and Lance get back together for a celebratory tour, we have some hopeful news: Never say never. Keep in mind, though, that it’s doubtful Timberlake, who’s selling out venues 15 years after the release of his debut single “Like I Love You,” would go back in time to appease us *NSYNC fanatics. There’s truly no incentive for the triple threat, and Oscar nominee, to reunite with his former bandmates, even if the four of them could benefit ― professionally and financially ― from a Las Vegas residency or summer tour schedule. Dedicated fans will continue living in this bygone time, a perfectly preserved era that’s yet to be sullied by the sight of aging members singing and dancing together onstage once again.","“You never know what’s going to happen,” Bass said. “But maybe it is good that we ended early,” he continued. “It’s almost kind of like when a big celebrity dies early, like Marilyn Monroe. Once you end young, you last forever.”","“For me, it’s just a matter of time,” Fatone said. “If the stars align, then we get back together.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ade1c471800002800384597.jpeg?cache=swdDGHlPvm&ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"BLACK VOICES","headline":"Waffle House Doubles Down On Chikesia Clemons Arrest As Activists Call For Boycott","authors":"Jenna Amatulli","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/waffle-house-doubles-down-on-chikesia-clemons-arrest-as-activists-call-for-boycott_us_5ae73398e4b02baed1bcbab2","short_description":"The chain continued to defend employees and police in a violent arrest that has sparked outrage.","date":"2018-04-30"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Sasha Obama Hangs Out With Cardi B And Offset At A Festival","authors":"Jenna Amatulli","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sasha-obama-hanging-out-with-cardi-b-and-offset-at-a-festival-is-a-vibe_us_5ae71966e4b055fd7fce0bc7","short_description":"\"Officially have a new fave Obama.\"","date":"2018-04-30"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Kanye West Tweets Admiration For Emma Gonzalez, But She Isn't Having It","authors":"Ron Dicker","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kanye-west-emma-gonzalez_us_5ae7181be4b055fd7fce0789","short_description":"The response from the Parkland school shooting survivor, who has become an anti-violence activist, was perfect.","date":"2018-04-30"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"WORLD NEWS","headline":"Seoul: North Korea Promises Transparency In Dismantling Of Nuclear Site","authors":"Hyonhee Shin, Reuters","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/north-korea-transparency-nuclear-site-closure_us_5ae54338e4b055fd7fcc5e85","short_description":"Kim Jong Un has pledged to close the country’s nuclear test site in May in full view of the outside world","date":"2018-04-29"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Marvel Lied To Us About 'Avengers: Infinity War'","authors":"Bill Bradley","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/marvel-lied-to-us-about-avengers-infinity-war_us_5ae1d45be4b02baed1b7696f","short_description":"The \"Infinity War\" creators promised a \"final chapter\" and \"permanent\" deaths.

Happened?","For fans of the Marvel universe, death has never really meant death. We’ve seen Loki “die” and come back plenty of times. Bucky Barnes and Nick Fury have been assumed dead at various points, only to spring back into existence in the Marvel Cinematic Universe as well.","But this time, it was supposed to be different.","Leading up to the release of “Avengers: Infinity War,” the directors of the film spoke about the movie as a “final chapter.” Marvel boss Kevin Feige talked about the deaths in the movie being “real” this time. In an interview on April 22, one day before the premiere, I asked writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely to define what death means in their recent project.","“Death is death,” McFeely said. “I mean, we’re sensitive to that, and certainly the Marvel universe played with taking characters away and then giving them back to you in some other form. If we say goodbye to some characters, we will say it permanently.”","He continued: “The idea is that this movie’s going to be different and has a potential to be really good is because the stakes are real and choices are real and we know that we’ve cried wolf a little bit on that, so I suppose some audience members might look at that skeptically, but trust us.”","Did you get all that? “Permanent,” he said. “Trust us,” he said.","So I audibly gasped in the theater when certain characters bit the dust. Loki in the film’s first minutes. (Are you kidding me?) Gamora just halfway through the movie. (Holy what?) That is, until the very end, when Spider-Man, most of the Guardians of the Galaxy and Black Panther ― yes, even T’Challa ― crumbled to ash at the snap of Thanos’ fingers, thus rendering everything Marvel said to be pretty much baloney.","As my colleague Matt Jacobs pointed out, these characters are coming back.","New movies are already in the works for “Spider-Man,” “Guardians of the Galaxy” and “Black Panther.” Is the third “Guardians” going to be about Rocket living life as a raccoon on Earth? Is “Spider-Man 2″ going to just focus on Ned putting that Lego Death Star he broke back together?","It all sounds riveting, but I doubt it. These characters will be resurrected one way or another. The creators played up their deaths, insinuating that they would mean something when they, well, won’t. Or can’t. The newly deceased are contractually obligated to come back.","I reached out to a rep for Markus and McFeely to clarify their previous quote, but didn’t hear back as of Monday afternoon.","I could see the studio putting out a press release explaining the sequels have been put on hold ... or something. But it’s not going to change anything.","“Infinity War” was billed as the movie that the previous 18 MCU entires had been building toward. On that count it did not disappoint, but let’s face it: Marvel lied to us.","Maybe we should’ve seen this coming. After all, the “Infinity Gauntlet” comic, upon which the movie is largely based, is about Thanos killing a bunch of people before the characters eventually just ... reverse everything. But with all the talk of “permanent death” and “real stakes,” it was easy to get caught up in the potential tragedy.","Now we’re left wondering: Were the writers truthful about anything in the run-up to the premiere? Well, maybe. Even before I knew the outcome of “Infinity War,” I asked them, “Wherever Captain America ends up, what was the reasoning for it?”","Markus told me it was a matter of “fulfilling the destiny” of that Brooklyn kid we met back in the 1940s.","“I mean, just continuing to put that guy, Steve Rogers, the asthmatic whatever-other-disease-he-had-at-that-point into the most unbelievable situation ... and taking that to the farthest point,” he said.","This is what “Infinity War” achieves: setting up Captain America (and the other Avengers left standing at the film’s end, aka the actors with soon-to-be-expiring contracts), for one final conflict against Thanos to reverse everything and save the universe at the end of the next movie.","What that involves is anyone’s guess. HuffPost’s Andy McDonald suggested Cap could end up wielding the Infinity Gauntlet in the follow-up movie. I’d be down with that.","It’s just, after being promised real stakes, I’d rather not be treated to more fake deaths and last-minute saves, ultimately left wondering once again, “What just happened?”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ae2afcc1e000043008e3c45.jpeg?cache=fctUHyofaF&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"WORLD NEWS","headline":"Thousands Protest Across Spain After 5 Men Are Cleared Of Gang Rape","authors":"Carla Herreria","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/spain-protests-wolfpack-rape-charges_us_5ae520bee4b04aa23f23a2af","short_description":"The group is known as the \"wolf pack,\" named after a WhatsApp chat where they bragged about the assault.","date":"2018-04-29"},"articleContent":["Thousands of protesters flooded the streets in cities across Spain after a court failed to convict a group of men for the gang rape of an 18-year-old girl during the Running of the Bulls festival in 2016.","Instead of convicting the five men of rape on Thursday, a three-judge panel in Pamplona in northern Spain found the men guilty of the lesser crime of “continuous sexual abuse,” according to CNN.

As For Diversity In Hollywood? It 'Snags' Him.","authors":"Matthew Jacobs","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/william-friedkin-the-devil-and-father-amorth_us_5ae0cbfbe4b04aa23f1eae2e","short_description":"The Oscar-winning director of \"The French Connection\" and \"The Exorcist\" discusses his new documentary, the Trumpian zeitgeist and the \"evil\" in the world.","date":"2018-04-29"},"articleContent":["In 1973, William Friedkin released “The Exorcist,” one of the highest-grossing and most applauded horror movies in history. In 2018, William Friedkin released “The Devil and Father Amorth,” a documentary about exorcisms. The movie landscape has drastically changed in the intervening years, but William Friedkin hasn’t.","He is still a dazzling raconteur. His most recent fiction features, “Bug” (2006) and “Killer Joe” (2011), boast the same moody panache seen in the movies that launched his career, including “The Boys in the Band” (1970), “The French Connection” (1971), “The Exorcist,” “Sorcerer” (1977) and “To Live and Die in L.A.” (1985). And, at 82, he has aged into your overly nostalgic and slightly regressive great-uncle. He rails against the changes in American popular culture ― sometimes with good reason ― and carps about the whole “diversity” thing that’s hit Hollywood in recent years.","For an hour on a recent Thursday afternoon, I sat with Friedkin in his room at Manhattan’s swanky Carlyle Hotel, where the Oscar-winning director wore slippers, green pajama pants and a T-shirt with a dog on it. In “The Devil and Father Amorth” (now in theaters and available on select streaming platforms), Friedkin travels to Italy to profile one of the world’s leading exorcists as he treats a woman apparently possessed by demonic forces. The movie presents footage of this woman’s exorcism as fact, which led to a conversation about the reliability of documentary filmmaking, the role evil plays in the world, Friedkin’s views on the state of movies today, and the more socially conscious culture we now live in.","You’re hardly prolific these days.","I have a very active travel and social life. And I’m writing a script now that I hope to finish in a couple of months that I worked on for a long time that I hope to film next. But I can’t talk about the subject, because if it gets into print it will give other people ideas, which I hope not to do.","You aren’t bit by as much of a moviemaking bug as you once were, perhaps?","Well, when I started out, it was a different kind of zeitgeist. And the stuff that’s being done today is not of strong interest to me: superhero movies, which is what the studios have put most of their resources behind. It is the new zeitgeist. I wouldn’t even begin to know how to begin to make one of those films.","There are also some very good films that are independent that come out occasionally, but it’s very tough for them. It wasn’t when I started. You had people like John Cassavetes and other great filmmakers who would mortgage their house to make a film. They made interesting, unusual and very personal films. I don’t know if they would publish “The Great Gatsby” today, or William Faulkner. I just don’t know. It’s a different zeitgeist. The paintings aren’t the same, the music is not the same, certainly not the popular music of my day.","When did you first notice that zeitgeist change?","It changes constantly. It changed with “Star Wars” in the ’70s. The zeitgeist changed when the silent movies were replaced by sound. [Charlie] Chaplin and [D.W.] Griffith were largely the inspiration for American films. Then I think the next big change was probably “Citizen Kane,” where a story like that, really utilizing sound on film, changed everything. The complexity and yet the simplicity. And then the next change was in 1960 with the French film “Breathless” by Jean-Luc Godard. They’re still shooting films somewhat like that: hand-held cameras, jump cuts. Now it’s changed in American cinema to superhero films, for the most part. That’s what they’re interested in: the next blockbuster. Everyone is trying to replicate “Star Wars,” its success. I don’t know that these same people would have been comfortable in the early days making films, because they were not about superheroes. They were more complex, deeper and darker films.","The difference with “Star Wars,” though, is that it was fundamentally an original story when it first opened. It took inspiration from Flash Gordon and whatnot, but nobody had seen anything like “Star Wars” before.","We used to see it every Saturday afternoon as kids going to eight little pictures at a time for a quarter. There were Buck Rogers and that whole school of dumb science fiction.","OK, but it wasn’t “Avengers 12” or “Transformers 16.”","No, but they were making sequels and serials to that stuff all the time. They just didn’t have the tools. And George Lucas didn’t have the tools that they have now, but he did very well with that he had.","That’s why the car chase in “The French Connection” is so famous. It looks handmade.","Well, there was no other way to do it. There were no computer-generated images then. We had to do everything that you saw.","Do you think filmmakers are drunk on the power of visual effects?","I don’t know that I would go that far. I would use it if I had to. It’s a tool. It can take you to places where you could never before even think about putting a camera. It can take you inside the Taj Mahal or the Louvre or the Vatican, and convincingly. There have been a lot of really good chase scenes that have used it. The “Bourne” films used computer imagery, and they’re good chase scenes.","What do you like right now? Whom do you respect as a filmmaker?","I just did a podcast with Guillermo del Toro.","He’s someone who uses effects in a purposeful and profound way.","I agree. He’s a very serious filmmaker. He studied with Dick Smith, who did the makeup for “The Exorcist,” “The Godfather” and a lot of other great films. He is a really interesting filmmaker. I like Damien Chazelle, the two films I’ve seen of his. I like Wes Anderson’s films. I enjoy them a lot. And Tarantino, who has really created a niche for himself.","You and del Toro talked on that podcast about how much you both love old MGM musicals. I’m sort of extrapolating here, but you implied a few years ago that the birth of rock ’n’ roll and the changes popular music went through as a result contributed to the downfall of the classical musical.","I think that’s close enough because rock music was a revolution. Elvis was a revolution. And he made some movies, but they’re not really musicals. They’re shots of Elvis performing. The popular music that gave birth to the MGM musicals were written by people like Cole Porter, George Gershwin, Sammy Cahn, Rodgers and Hammerstein. They were influenced by the popular music of the day, which was largely love songs. The popular music gradually evolved into rap and hip-hop, which is not about that, generally. And they’re not necessarily singable or danceable, certainly not by people like Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse.","But hip-hop has yielded its own genre of dance, and it’s powerful too.","I haven’t seen any films about hip-hop that are as exciting as “The Band Wagon” or “Singin’ in the Rain” or “Seven Brides for Seven Brothers.” Those and many other films drew on the popular music of the day.","So you liked “La La Land”?","I thought it was well-done. [Chazelle] did a very decent homage to the old musical. He’s such a wonderful filmmaker. And I loved the other film of his I saw, “Whiplash.” It’s terrific.","Have you tried to get more movies off the ground in recent years?","Not really. I haven’t found anything since “Killer Joe” that has really compelled me.","Are people sending you scripts?","Yes, but it’s not about scripts. It’s about what you really want to give your life to. You know, I had no script for “The French Connection,” but I loved the story. I thought the story was great. We made it up as we went along, but the guy who was the last writer on it won the Academy Award for best screenplay.","How’d you make sense of that?","When they fall in love with a film at the Academy, they generally fall in love with all of its parts. But I’m telling you we improvised that film every day on the set. Not one word of the chase was ever written. It’s not in any script. I went to those locations and I was inspired by them to do something that I had not seen.","Who did you consider your contemporaries?","Francis Coppola and Peter Bogdanovich.","Bogdanovich is someone who’s made a few movies lately that no one has paid attention to.","Well, that’s for a variety of reasons. The distribution platforms aren’t the same anymore. Most films are not made for a theater. They’re made for Netflix and for video on demand. The films that are made for theaters are the superhero films for large audiences, and some of the horror films recently, which I think are very good. “Get Out” and “A Quiet Place.” I like them a lot.","Horror seems to be the one genre that can can remain original and still succeed both commercially and artistically.","You’re right.","Even comedies have suffered.","I don’t know what’s funny to people anymore. Guys acting stupid. I can’t think of any that have moved me recently. And a lot of that is due to series television, where people got used to laugh tracks and everything that somebody says while sitting on the couch and eating a chicken egg gets uproarious laughter. I don’t know what people make of this stuff at home, staring at these people who are supposedly representative of American marriages in all of their various forms today. But they’re cracking jokes at each other. Is that how people go through life? Is that how you do?","No, certainly not.","You have friends. Are you married?","No, but I have a partner.","Do you guys sit around telling jokes to each other?","I wish. But I think many sitcoms are more nuanced than you’re giving them credit for. And anyway, there’s a lot to be said for the value of escapism, which is what sitcoms offer.","I couldn’t escape that way. That’s not an escape for me.","What’s an escape for you?","Reading a good book, fiction or nonfiction. Reading about something I wasn’t aware of before. Or listening to music. Miles Davis. Elvis. John Coltrane. Gil Evans. It’s hard for me to find somebody in today’s world, but there are many recording artists that I still listen to, especially in re-release. Sinatra. There’s nobody better with a lyric than Frank Sinatra. I like David Bowie a lot.","Did you feel that way about television in the ’70s, like “All in the Family”?","Well, not in the ’60s when you had really good humorists on TV. Jack Benny, Red Skelton, Burns and Allen.","What changed?","The zeitgeist changed. First of all, there are no performers like that anymore. They’re mostly people that read somebody else’s jokes and they’re not naturally funny to me.","Moving on to “The Devil and Father Amorth,” it’s pretty shocking to see footage of a supposed exorcism. What got left on the cutting-room floor?","Almost nothing. I had planned to go back and do what we call b-roll with Cristina [the possessed woman in the movie], but she had freaked out by then. Father Amorth was in the hospital with pneumonia, and he never came out. I went back to do her 10th exorcism, and he couldn’t do it. Now she is out there seeking other help but has not been successful as of yet.","[Amorth] was in a class by himself. He was totally original. He was the founder of the International Association of Exorcists. His work was supported and respected by the last three popes. He had been the Vatican exorcist for 31 years. So I fully expected to do her 10th or more, but he passed.","There have been so many “Exorcist” knockoffs over the years.","I’ve never seen them. I’ve never seen the sequels.","Did you ever consider making one?","No, no. [“Exorcist” screenwriter William Peter] Blatty did “Exorcist III,” which was not called that. It was from his novel called Legion, and then the film company got him to call it “Exorcist III” for obvious reasons. They threw an exorcism in, which he didn’t have.","With all those knockoffs, the image of an exorcism has become mythologized and hyperbolized, partly because “The Exorcist” is so evocative. Understandably, demonic possession has a lot of skeptics. People could easily look at the footage in this movie and still cast doubts on the veracity of what actually happened. How do you feel about that?","I filmed what I saw and experienced. That’s all. I didn’t make a film to convert skeptics. I’m not a skeptic. As a journalist, you should not be a skeptic. You shouldn’t be writing things and thinking people are out there to fool everyone. We’ve got to be open to what you may or may not get from what you’ve done, but you can’t approach life as a skeptic. First of all, you’re not old enough to be skeptical.","I’m not saying I personally am skeptical.","No, but there are skeptics who just don’t care enough to examine the unexamined life, so they have an attitude about it. You want to know something? Nobody knows anything.","Sure, we can agree on that.","The greatest philosophers and scholars in the world do not know if there’s a heaven or a hell or an afterlife or anything about Jesus. We don’t know about the eternal verities, but I’m curious about all of them. I know I’ll never know, but that doesn’t stop me from being curious about things that happen that change the world. You have to be curious, for example, about why Trump became president.","I am curious about that, yes.","You have to be. He won 30 states. Now, Mrs. Clinton can blame Comey. She can blame this, that and the other, Russian collusion. But 30 states voted for Donald Trump, who was not a politician. And that tells you something about this country at this time. It could change, it could evolve. There was a time that people had faith in politicians and continued to vote for them. They voted against politicians when they voted for Trump. They’d had it. You know the politicians have all just lied to us as long as we can remember.","Yes, but now we have somebody in office who has openly lied since being elected.","Well, I don’t know that. The people who voted for him don’t know that. They wanted something else, and I think, by the way, that he was pretty straightforward with people. He said that he loved to have sex with who he considered beautiful women. We all knew that. He wasn’t denying it. He wasn’t saying that he was Jimmy Carter, a religious man married to the same woman forever.","He’s no Jimmy Carter, that’s for sure.","He was a reality-TV host, and they voted for him over a woman who’d been around politics most of her adult life. So I’m curious.","Right, and maybe “skeptic” is the wrong word to get wrapped up in. Storytelling-wise, what we see in this documentary is fairly straightforward in its presentation, but ―","Totally straightforward. It’s hardly edited. I shot these people talking, doing an exorcism, these doctors talking about it, and this is what they said.","But I think anybody who watches documentaries with a critical mind should always question what’s being presented onscreen.","Why?","Because whether a movie is edited heavily or not, a documentary filmmaker captures and assembles the footage however he or she chooses. She chooses who is featured and how the story unfolds and what information is included.","That’s true.","So, what is fundamentally objective becomes subjective because it’s filtered through the lens of one filmmaker. It’s similar with journalism and newsgathering. So that’s why people might be skeptical of footage that claims to show a real exorcism. We don’t know what happened before and after the events we see in the film.","Yeah, there’s no subjectivity in what I did with this documentary. This may not be as I feel at all. This is what I heard and saw. That’s it, and here it is.","When I filmed the exorcism, I had no idea what I was going to do with it. And then it occurred to me to take it to neurosurgeons and psychiatrists and let them debunk it if that’s what they were going to do. And they didn’t. But it was up to them. I put not one word in their mouth. I asked them questions. I asked the neurosurgeon from Israel who’s done thousands of surgeries, “Do you have any religious beliefs?” He said something to the effect of, “Beyond what I can see and feel in the reasonable world, I do accept the existence of an entity called God.” Which doesn’t say he’s a religious man at all. He’s certainly not a Catholic. He tried to explain, from his perspective, what was going on with that woman. It was a religious-based disease in which everyone in the room, including the woman and her priest and her family and other priests who were there, were participating in something that they accepted to be her demonic possession and exorcism.","If you have no religion, or if you’re a Jewish guy or a Muslim or of another faith entirely, you probably would not see an exorcist. It’s religious-based. The only treatment she or any of the other thousands of people who went to [Amorth] received was exorcism, but they had to see a medical doctor and psychiatrist in Italy first and be told that those skills were not going to help them. Then, if he had the time, he would do an exorcism.","What do you make of Father Amorth’s more outlandish beliefs? He’s said that Stalin and Hitler were possessed by the devil, and that the devil had a hand in creating “Harry Potter.”","Well, I don’t have any problems about “Harry Potter.” He did, I guess, because it dealt with witchcraft. He wasn’t the only guy who was troubled by “Harry Potter.”","Sure, it’s not a unique opinion. But you made him the subject of a documentary.","So, what do I feel about what? Here’s what I feel. First of all, I feel there is evil in the world, without a doubt. Some of it has been alleviated by groups that have come out and spoken up for themselves and fought back, but it’s not even about group evil. There’s evil in every human being, just as there’s a bit of good in many human beings. But how do you explain a guy that goes up into the Mandalay Bay in Vegas and shoots up a rock concert? Or these guys that shoot up the schools? Or the nanny who cold-bloodedly killed two little girls? Is that sickness or is it evil? I don’t know. It may be both. Where does that come from?","In the case of the woman in my documentary, the evil is directed at her, not from her. But I have seen evil in people that I know. You see it in the smallest way almost every day if you drive in Los Angeles. You see road rage. That’s when people turn evil. Have you never felt so badly about somebody that you might have wanted to kill them? We all have. You wouldn’t do it because you have restraints. Some people don’t have restraints.","Father Amorth believed the devil was a metaphor, not an actual person or thing. Certainly I can’t argue with that.","A few years ago, you said, “When you’re making a film, you don’t start to think of the social consequences, or whether there will be any.” But today’s filmmakers, as well as today’s audiences, do think more critically about the social implications of entertainment. We’re much more politically conscious, even though the ’70s are known for being such a politically charged decade in and out of Hollywood. Do you think that evolution toward socially conscious film criticism is a good thing?","I don’t think so. No. I don’t know that I could say this is good, but it does happen. No, I think a film should be enjoyed on its own terms for the ingredients in it. You like the story or you don’t. You like these actors or you don’t. This interests you in the way it’s done or it doesn’t. To apply some other set of principles to it is so subjective. I don’t look at “The Boys in the Band” as a film simply about the gay lifestyle. It’s a wonderful love story to me, with great humor.","And it’s still controversial, even as it reopens on Broadway. Part of why everything is so political right now is because the culture hasn’t served folks pushed to the margins. That speaks to the success of “Black Panther,” for example.","Yeah, I don’t go to see a work of entertainment to be politicized. I don’t know what the political nature of the Bruce Springsteen show is. It’s his life. I saw it. It was great. I know that his politics are liberal; that’s been obvious for years, before this show. But I enjoyed the show as entertainment, period — not entertainment from a liberal performer who’s trying to proselytize me about voting his way or something. Things are more politicized, you’re right. Everything is political. The whole idea of diversity kind of snags me. I think people should be hired on merit. I’ve always believed that, and yet they weren’t.","But what happens when the system isn’t in place to hire people of merit who don’t fit the dominant demographic?","It was always in place. I just have to tell you that when I hired people, I hired women, men, I didn’t know if they were gay or not gay. I could not have cared less. I was interested in their talent, period. And that’s all that you can be.","I don’t like Michelangelo because he’s a gay artist. I like him because he’s a great artist. I don’t like Picasso because he was a straight artist. I value a work of art, be it music or painting or cinema, because of the work. I don’t give a good goddamn about Leonardo’s sexuality or Michelangelo’s or Miles Davis’. I just like the work, and I’m not going to hire somebody just because they’re black. If they’re black and good, that’s wonderful. If they’re black and they’re not as good as this other dude over here…","Sure, but what happens when the people at the top — executives, for example — aren’t historically hiring people of color or greenlighting movies about queer people? It becomes a systemic issue.","I don’t know anybody who is that way now, who would say, “I’m not going to make this story because the guy is gay or the guy is black or it’s a lesbian.” I don’t know anybody in charge of a studio who would do that today.","You have to understand something. The guys who founded the movie industry all started at the bottom somewhere. They started in entry-level jobs. They were stage hands and gaffers and grips. They moved up to become directors. John Ford did that, and Howard Hawks. Some of the greats started on the crew, and they learned every facet of their work. That tradition carried on. There weren’t a lot of women then who sought out jobs as carpenters on a film. There just weren’t. Not because they thought they wouldn’t get them, but it just wasn’t the kind of job a woman sought. Now they do. The thing is, then there were a great many closeted homosexuals who started the film industry. But mostly they were straight guys who were working on the soundstages, or working an entry-level job somewhere and worked their way up. That tradition continued. Instead of carpenters, they became agents. And agents worked their way up to be heads of a studio.","Now, I personally think the best action filmmaker in America today is Kathryn Bigelow, a woman. I think she’s a great director of actors and action. There were years when people wouldn’t hire her to do an action picture because they thought a woman couldn’t do that, until she did it. So it takes someone coming out of left field to do it. Why have there not been more women who were great artists? Great painters? There was one woman impressionist, I think, Marie Laurencin. Maybe there was somebody else, but I’m not aware offhand of any of the other impressionists being women, or the pre-Raphaelites or the 17th-century Dutch. The great movements of art: Where were the women’s paintings? They were not told you could not paint.","But the canon is dominated by men. And art is full of gatekeepers. If you aren’t invited to the table to be exhibited in a gallery, for example, you’re never given the chance to be considered great.","You don’t get to be invited. You do great work, it gets hung. Marie Laurencin was invited. If you do great work, it’s going to be seen. Vincent van Gogh never sold a painting in his lifetime, died at about 44 by committing suicide. You look at a van Gogh today and say, “This is great! What didn’t they see then?” And his brother, Theo, was the dealer for the impressionists. He couldn’t sell a Vincent. Why? Now you’ve got to be a billionaire to own a Vincent. What happened? In the short period of less that 100 years, van Gogh went from being unsaleable to one of the great appreciated masters. If Vincent sold one of his paintings then for what they sell now, he would have been a rich man and done more. But he produced well over 3,000 works: oils, water colors, drawings, prints. What did they have against him? He was great and he couldn’t sell, so it’s hard for me to make the argument that there are women like that who were great and couldn’t sell, because I don’t know any.","But history always leaves people out.","Yeah, but nobody ever said that a gay painter will not be working. Michelangelo and Leonardo got the greatest commissions and delivered. I don’t know if anyone gave a shit what they were. Do you care? I don’t.","No, but it’s hard to talk about today’s landscape by referencing Michelangelo. For a long time, the infrastructure wasn’t there for women directors and protagonists of color.","There were women directors.","Few and far between until just a few years ago.","Ida Lupino, Dorothy Arzner.","Sure, but they are not mentioned in the same breath as —","They weren’t as good. The weren’t as good as William Wyler, Orson Welles, Richard Brooks.","Maybe, but the point is more that women weren’t invited to the table and then exalted at the same rate that Howard Hawks and John Ford were.","You don’t get invited to the table.","Well, someone has to sign over a paycheck. Someone has to hire you. During the classic studio system, especially.","You don’t get invited to the table. You make your own place at the table.","Many people think that I’m gay, but nobody knew or cared if I was or wasn’t. I swear to you. It never was a factor. I neither traded on that fact or not. And I frankly don’t care what people think of me, as long as they don’t think something horrible that isn’t true. But that’s not horrible to me. Who gives a flying fuck into a rolling donut? I really don’t. I never thought in working with someone — and that includes “The Boys in the Band” — “Are these guys gay? Is he gay? Is that guy gay?” The guy who played the most flaming character in the show was not gay. Cliff Gorman was doing an imitation of a gay man at that time. Some of the others who were, let’s say more butch, were gay. They were actors. And that’s all that seemed to matter.","But the reason we can even sit here and have a 20-minute discussion about this movie is that culture was so starved for stories about gay characters in general, just as people are for the sort of characters of color we saw in “Black Panther.”","You’re right. And they were not given opportunities. There’s no doubt about that.","This interview has been edited for clarity and condensed for length."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ae1dd062000002e00b8fbdf.jpeg?cache=NIxzTl7QPJ&ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"MEDIA","headline":"Joy Reid's Defenders Praise Her Apology — But Ignore Her Apparent Cover-Up","authors":"Hayley Miller","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/joy-reid-hacking-scandal_us_5ae4ab77e4b055fd7fcc3ec2","short_description":"The MSNBC host's most ardent fans are willing to turn a blind eye to her hacking claims, and that's unsettling.","date":"2018-04-29"},"articleContent":["Joy Reid has apologized for writing anti-LGBTQ posts on her old blog, but she still has not answered important questions about her honesty and journalistic integrity.","A weeklong saga surrounding her claims that The Reid Report, her now-defunct blog, was subject to a cyberattack culminated with the MSNBC host apologizing ― once again ― for previously espousing homophobic positions.","The host of “AM Joy” said on air Saturday that her opinions have evolved since writing “offensive” statements several years ago. She echoed an apology she delivered in December after screenshots surfaced of blog posts she wrote between 2007 and 2009 that accused a former Florida governor of being a closeted gay man.","Many of her most vocal supporters online have enthusiastically accepted her apologies, concluding ― and rightly so ― that people should be allowed to re-examine their beliefs over time.","What stands out, though, is the ease with which her supporters have accepted her hacking claims, ignoring monumental gaps in plausibility.","After screenshots appearing to capture dozens of her past homophobic blog posts were tweeted the previous week, Reid told Mediaite last Monday that she didn’t author the posts. According to her initial statement, “an unknown, external party accessed and manipulated material ... to include offensive and hateful references.” Reid said that the newly revealed content “seems to be part of an effort to taint my character with false information.”","“I can state unequivocally that it does not represent the original entries,” she said. “I hope that whoever corrupted the site recognizes the pain they have caused, not just to me, but to my family and communities that I care deeply about: LGBTQ, immigrants, people of color and other marginalized groups.”","But the hacking claims fell apart under scrutiny from several media outlets. Documents and statements provided to HuffPost by Reid’s hired cybersecurity consultant, Jonathan Nichols, failed to prove Reid’s blog had been hacked or that the disputed posts were in fact fraudulent.","What’s more, these homophobic statements Reid has been accused of writing aren’t a major departure from what she’s already owned up to, nor are they far from the liberal blogging norms of the mid-2000s, as Richard Kim noted in The Nation.","Nichols also told HuffPost that the alleged posts captured in the recent batch of screenshots never existed on Reid’s blog. But HuffPost and other outlets found this simply wasn’t true. You can view the alleged posts in full here.","Many of Reid’s followers either cast doubt on reports calling into question the veracity of her hacking claims or pledged unwavering support even if the claims proved untrue.","Reid returned to her show this Saturday, after nearly a week of noticeable silence on her social media pages. She addressed the alleged hacking, saying her hired cybersecurity experts could not prove it happened, but that she doesn’t think she wrote the posts.","“When a friend found them in December and sent them to me, I was stunned,” Reid said. “Frankly, I couldn’t imagine where they’d come from or whose voice that was.

But I can definitely understand based on things I have tweeted and have written in the past why some people don’t believe me.”","Her comments appeared in stark contrast to her initial statement.","Reid apologized for her past anti-trans comments about conservative host Ann Coulter, who Reid called a “dude” and a “drag queen” on Twitter in 2011. She explained that she grew up in a household that had “conservative views” on the LGBTQ community.","The next 30 minutes or so of Saturday’s show were dedicated to discussion with a panel of LGBTQ activists on the ways “hurtful speech” imperils marginalized communities.","Reid did not say whether her hired cybersecurity experts were continuing to investigate the alleged hacking, nor did she provide new details about the FBI’s alleged investigation into the matter, as confirmed by her attorney Wednesday. She did not address the posts at all during her show Sunday, nor did any of her guests bring them up.","Support from Reid’s defenders, including several MSNBC reporters, flooded Twitter over the weekend.","It is striking ― and disturbing ― that Reid’s colleagues and her employer aren’t demanding answers about her seemingly contradictory statements on the alleged hacking. In her initial statement, Reid said a cybersecurity expert had “identified ... unauthorized activity” on her blog that resulted in numerous “fabricated” posts. But on Saturday, Reid said her hired experts couldn’t prove it.","MSNBC has not publicly released a statement supporting Reid. On Sunday, a MSNBC spokesman told NPR’s David Folkenflik that network executives “remain supportive of Reid.”","A representative for MSNBC declined to provide HuffPost with evidence suggesting Reid’s blog had been subject to “unauthorized activity,” as Reid claimed in her initial statement. Nichols did not respond to a request for additional comment.","MSNBC also hasn’t responded to a request for comment about whether the network is conducting an internal investigation into Reid’s story.","If the network can’t be trusted to seek truth in its own organization, how can it expect its viewers to trust it to seek truth from the highest levels of the government?","Memory is malleable, and it’s possible that Reid, when first confronted with the latest batch of screenshots, genuinely believed that she did not write them. But as a journalist and public intellectual, she had an obligation to thoroughly examine whether she wrote the items that she now views as hateful. Instead, she waved away this responsibility by declaring that she does not “believe” she wrote them.","At a time when the press is routinely attacked by the Trump administration, integrity should be of the utmost importance to every media organization. Reid is obviously well-liked by liberals, and as a female political analyst of color she offers a voice that’s often underrepresented on cable news.","Surely people needn’t condemn Reid’s character to eternal damnation over this incident, but the public can ― and should ― demand transparency and truth from journalists. As some of Reid’s most high-profile defenders have noted in the past, our democracy depends on it.","This article has been updated to note that an MSNBC spokesman’s comment to NPR was not an official statement from the network."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ae4a3b41e000043008e3ebf.png?cache=5v8GO8bMVk&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"NASA Terminates Last Moon Rover After Trump Touts New Era Of Lunar Exploration","authors":"Mary Papenfuss","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nasa-terminates-last-moon-rover-after-trump-touts-new-era-of-lunar-exploration_us_5ae51e86e4b02baed1bac38a","short_description":"The space agency is seeking \"commercial partners\" as it drops work on a rover designed to extract resources for a human moon colony.","date":"2018-04-29"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Police Guard White Nationalist Conference From Protesters At Tennessee State Park","authors":"Christopher Mathias","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/american-renaissance-white-supremacist-conference-tennessee-state-park_us_5ae5d552e4b02baed1bb2050","short_description":"The American Renaissance conference took over a taxpayer-owned hotel. Protesters wanted the racists inside to know they're not welcome in Tennessee.","date":"2018-04-29"},"articleContent":["BURNS, Tenn. — Police formed a tight perimeter around a Tennessee state-owned hotel Saturday, guarding a white nationalist conference inside the building from anti-racist protesters gathered outside.","American Renaissance, a racist Virginia-based organization listed by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a hate group, reserved the 125 rooms inside Montgomery Bell State Park Inn for the weekend conference. Attendees not staying at the hotel arrived there early Saturday morning. Nearly all of them were men. They wore suit and ties — mandatory dress for the event — and didn’t respond to reporters’ questions as police escorted them inside.","Anti-racist protesters arrived a short time later. State park rangers subjected each protester to a metal detector test before allowing them to enter a fenced-off area across from the hotel.","One protester, Beth Foster, grew upset when park rangers wouldn’t allow her to bring a purse inside, as bags were prohibited in the protest zone.","“This is absolutely absurd,” she told the officers. “Nazis” from out of state, she told them, were allowed to rent out an entire Tennessee taxpayer-owned hotel, and yet she wasn’t allowed to bring a tiny purse inside a section of her own state park. Eventually Foster — co-director of the Mercy Junction Justice and Peace Center in Chattanooga, Tennessee — left her purse and walked through the security checkpoint.","“It’s anti-racist activists that the state sees as the enemies,” she told reporters. “Not the Nazis or the white supremacists who are in our buildings, using our public restrooms, and eating in our public restaurant, plotting genocide.”","The Inn at Montgomery Bell State Park — nestled in a 3,850-acre state park 30 miles west of Nashville — has hosted American Renaissance’s annual conference since 2012. Privately owned venues had repeatedly canceled or denied reservations to American Renaissance before that, after pressure from anti-racist activists. Legally, it’s more difficult for publicly owned venues like the park’s inn to deny reservations to racist groups.","But this year’s American Renaissance conference was marked by a much larger police presence than in years past. Over 100 officers from local and state law enforcement were in the park Saturday. A handful were stationed on the roof of the inn, looking down at protesters. A helicopter circled overhead. Police rode around on horseback. Police dogs sniffed at cars. At one point, police opened and searched a vehicle that appeared to belong to an anti-racist protester.","Since the deadly “Unite The Right” white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, last August — which erupted into violence and ended with a neo-Nazi driving his car into a crowd of anti-racist protesters, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer and injuring 19 others — cities across the country have aggressively policed white supremacist events.","At the American Renaissance conference Saturday, the 60 or so anti-racist protesters — from groups including Nashville AntiFa, Anti-Racist Action Nashville, the Tennessee Anti-Racist Network, Women’s March Tennessee and Shelbyville Loves — were kept about 100 yards away from the hotel behind a police barricade. Over 50 police officers stood guard outside the inn.","“Those are the most influential white supremacists in the world meeting at this rural location in Tennessee!” Lacy MacAuley, an anti-fascist activist from Washington, D.C., yelled at the cops. “You all are protecting absolute evil right now and you’re looking at us as if we’re the problem!”","Marisa Richmond, a history professor at Middle Tennessee State University, said she has come to multiple protests against American Renaissance. In previous years, protesters were allowed to go into the building, to use the bathroom, buy some food, and occasionally confront the white supremacists face to face.","“I’m a Tennessee taxpayer and I grew up here and I’m not even allowed to enter the building now,” she said. “We pay for that.”","Police also prohibited protesters from wearing masks at this year’s protest. When one young protester briefly wore a bandana around the lower half of his face, police charged at him, grabbed him by the arms and walked him out of the protest pen. Other protesters followed, swarming the police and chanting “Let him go!” and “Shame!”","Police did not arrest the masked protester but forced him out of the protest area. In an act of solidarity, a group of his fellow protesters then donned masks of their own and stared down police for an hour. This time the police did nothing.","The Southern Poverty Law Center, a legal advocacy group that tracks extremism, describes American Renaissance as a “self-styled think tank that promotes pseudo-scientific studies and research that purport to show the inferiority of blacks to whites — although in hifalutin language that avoids open racial slurs and attempts to portray itself as serious scholarship.”","Its founder, Jared Taylor, has said: “Blacks and whites are different. When blacks are left entirely to their own devices, Western civilization — any kind of civilization — disappears.” He’s discussed sterilizing mothers who are on welfare, and has advocated for the creation of a whites-only country, or ethnostate, within the U.S.","Previous American Renaissance conferences have attracted some of America’s most notorious white supremacists, including David Duke and Richard Spencer, who called for “peaceful ethnic cleansing” in the U.S. at a prior year’s event.","American Renaissance denied this HuffPost reporter press credentials to report from inside this year’s conference. (“There will be plenty of media at our conference,” Taylor wrote in an email. “You, on the other hand, have a record of covering any form of racial dissidence, not as a journalist, but as a closed-minded bigot.”)","The conference was billed on the American Renaissance website as an opportunity for speakers and attendees to “plot a course for the years ahead” after some “startling setbacks” over the last year, likely referring to infighting that has fractured the white nationalist movement since last year’s rally in Charlottesville.","Paul Adams, a 65-year-old U.S. Navy veteran, drove over 50 miles from Smyrna, Tennessee, for Saturday’s protest. “If my neighbor had a rattlesnake in his backyard, I’d sure come over and tell him,” he explained.","He held a sign showing a giant Uncle Sam preparing to crush a group of Nazis. “You again?” it said. “Stop the ‘alt-right.’ We beat ’em before. We’ll beat ’em now.”","Daryle Lamont Jenkins, a longtime anti-racist activist and executive director of the One People’s Project, which monitors far-right groups, said “the suit and ties” that typically attend American Renaissance conferences are especially concerning because “they’re the ones that have real careers, they’re the ones that get into academia, they’re the ones that get into politics.”","“You gotta maintain vigilance against groups like this,” he said. “You gotta say, ‘We’re watching.’”","The American Renaissance attendees appeared content to hunker down in the hotel all day Saturday, offering protesters few chances to heckle them. When one older man in a suit and tie was escorted by police into the event, protesters yelled “Nazi scum!”","The protesters also did their best to try and be heard inside the hotel, breaking out in chants of “Heather Heyer! Say her name!” and blaring Billie Holiday songs through a megaphone.","Some protesters lit candles for those murdered by white supremacists. Others denounced the Tennessee state House of Representatives for declining last month to pass a resolution condemning neo-Nazis and white supremacists.","Rumors spread that police were preparing for a mass arrest, but by 3:30 p.m., it became clear that was just a rumor. Protesters walked out of the protest pen, many retiring to a park pavilion for drinks and food, taking in the beautiful spring day.","The white nationalists, whose conference lasts through Sunday, stayed fortified in the hotel.

They’re coming anyway.","date":"2018-04-29"},"articleContent":["SAN DIEGO ― President Donald Trump whipped himself into a fury earlier this month after learning that a caravan of hundreds of Central Americans was traveling through Mexico, planning to seek asylum in the United States. Shortly after learning about it, he mobilized the National Guard. He railed against what he viewed as a “crisis” at the border, despite the fact that illegal entries have plummeted to their lowest level since 1971. The secretary of homeland security issued a statement likening the caravan’s organizers to “smugglers” and the attorney general threatened to prosecute them.","But hundreds of participants in the caravan made their way to the U.S.-Mexico border on Sunday anyway. And despite Trump’s fulminations against them, it’s unclear whether his administration has any practical way to stop them from crossing in the coming days.","The caravan’s organizers, immigrant rights activists and legal observers marched toward International Friendship Park, which straddles the U.S.-Mexico border, as the caravan’s participants marched from Tijuana to San Diego on Sunday morning.","On the U.S. side of the border, a group of about 100 people chanted, “No borders! No wall! Sanctuary for all!” as they marched along the beach toward the port of entry. Roughly 200 of their counterparts in Mexico gathered in front of the metal fencing that divides the two countries, with more than a dozen people hoisting themselves atop the barrier.","“We have to push back against this administration,” demonstrator Laiken Jordahl, a borderlands campaigner for the nonprofit Center for Biological Diversity, told HuffPost. “Its culture of hate, bigotry and fear cannot be accepted. The administration doesn’t even talk to us, we had to come out and march.”","Another demonstrator, Roberto Saravia from Los Angeles, said: “This goes back further than the Trump administration. I find it ridiculous that any time there is an issue in the U.S., immigrants get scapegoated, they get mistreated, they get criminalized just for existing. This border is just a divide that shouldn’t be here and I want to see it gone ― it shouldn’t divide us.”","By Sunday afternoon, a group of about 150 of the caravan’s members had begun crossing into the U.S., along with legal advisers, organizers said.","But U.S. Customs and Border Protection warned it would limit the number of asylum-seekers making claims at the San Ysidro port of entry. “Depending upon port circumstances at the time of arrival, those individuals may need to wait in Mexico as CBP officers work to process those already within our facilities,” CBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said in a statement.","The 150 migrants, many of whom were children, spent the night sleeping on the ground outside, waiting to present their claims to U.S. immigration officials. By Monday morning, they had yet to speak to immigration officials and remained on the Mexican side of the border, organizers said.","“They’re using the excuse of capacity to keep people from coming,” said Nicole Ramos, an attorney with the nonprofit group Al Otro Lado, who has provided legal services to the migrants traveling with the caravan. “The people that are waiting outside are children, infants, a disabled woman who relies on her mother to take care of all her needs, trans women ― these are the most vulnerable asylum seekers. What the U.S. is doing is creating a humanitarian crisis that doesn’t need to be created.”","The Trump administration is hoping that it won’t have to let the migrants into the U.S. at all. And his administration’s threats appear to be dissuading some. Between 150 and 200 Central American migrants plan to present asylum claims in the coming days, organizers said, while roughly another 150 have yet to decide whether to cross.","But for all the noise and slow-walking of the asylum seekers’ claims, it remains to be seen whether the White House’s actions do anything to push away those who do make asylum claims.","Trump’s ire at the caravan stems from larger concerns he’s expressed since he first started running for president three years ago. He wants the U.S. to stop releasing unauthorized immigrants caught at the border with notices to appear in immigration court instead of uniformly detaining or deporting them — a practice he and his supporters disparagingly call “catch and release.” Attorney General Jeff Sessions is one of his most enthusiastic partners in that project.","Unfortunately for them, ending the practice is not currently possible under U.S. law. When space in detention centers runs out, there’s simply no place to put people who can’t be quickly deported. Many immigrants from Mexico can be deported quickly. But many of the people crossing the border these days are Central American children and families, who aren’t as easy to deport — and generally can’t be detained for long. Unaccompanied children must be released to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, and the mothers cannot usually be locked up with their kids for longer than three weeks due to a federal court order. Migrants have a right to apply for asylum, whether or not they get detained in the process. And immigrants who get picked up within the interior of the country often qualify for bond hearings.","None of this matters to the Trump administration, whose actions and statements have likened the arrival of a few hundred Central Americans seeking asylum to a national security crisis. In an attempt to deter them, Trump mobilized the National Guard to help patrol the four Southwest border states, despite the fact that its presence will be purely ornamental — the National Guard can’t make immigration arrests, and the caravan’s members plan to travel through legal ports of entry.","Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen chipped in with a similarly aggressive but toothless statement last Wednesday, saying the department was “monitoring” the caravan’s movements. She encouraged asylum-seekers to stay in Mexico.","“Let me be clear,” Nielsen’s statement read. “We will enforce the immigration laws as set forth by Congress. If you enter our country illegally, you have broken the law and will be referred for prosecution. If you make a false immigration claim, you have broken the law and will be referred for prosecution. If you assist or coach an individual in making a false immigration claim, you have broken the law and will be referred for prosecution.”","Nielsen’s repeated statements targeting the caravan met with criticism from Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), the ranking member of the House Committee on Homeland Security.","“It’s overkill,” Thompson told HuffPost. “You would have expected [Trump] to have been briefed by intelligence officials exactly who was headed this way. … We know who they are. We know where they are. And we even know why they’re coming. So to try to elevate this into some heightened sense of threat, it just didn’t measure up.”","Sessions had his own response to the caravan, issuing a statement Monday saying he’d “directed our U.S. Attorneys at the border to take whatever immediate action to ensure that we have sufficient prosecutors available.”","It’s unclear what practical consequences any of these threats will have. The people whom Nielsen accuses of “coaching” the caravan’s members are lawyers and immigrant rights advocates counseling migrants about the process for claiming asylum. And crossing through a legal port of entry to ask for asylum, as the caravan’s members plan to do, doesn’t expose them to prosecution, as Sessions contends.","“It’s typical anti-immigrant fear-mongering,” said Alex Mensing, a project coordinator for the caravan’s main organizing group, Pueblos Sin Fronteras. “The right-wing media and the administration have been trying really hard to make it look like there are no legitimate asylum-seekers, and that’s just not true. And it’s not for them to decide anyway.”","This story has been updated to reflect further developments at the U.S.-Mexico border and a statement from Attorney General Jeff Sessions."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ae601da1e00002d008e3f46.jpeg?cache=QE2zDLNBNK&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"CRIME","headline":"How To Convict A Rapist","authors":"Angelina Chapin","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-to-convict-a-rapist_us_5ae23bd3e4b02baed1b861f5","short_description":"Bill Cosby's guilty verdict is a rare victory for survivors. But it will take a lot more to combat sexual assault myths that run rampant in courtrooms.","date":"2018-04-29"},"articleContent":["On an overcast Friday morning in February, three lawyers gathered at their office in Washington, D.C., to discuss a particularly difficult sexual assault case. They knew the behavior of Erica Layne, an 18-year-old college student who said she was raped by a group of four other students, would be hard for a judge and jury to understand.","The night of the alleged crime, Layne had been drinking heavily: four shots of vodka in her dorm room, followed by two or three cups of Kool-Aid mixed with Everclear at a house party on a Saturday night. She was already drunk when her crush, a junior football player named Ryan Boland, suggested they do a few shots of tequila. Layne didn’t feel well, but how could she say no? After they made out in the kitchen, Boland took her hand and suggested they go upstairs to his room for more privacy.","He asked to take a video of her giving him a blowjob. Layne agreed, and the last thing she remembers is passing out in his bed. She woke up alone, naked and with a sore vagina. She was confused, but on Monday, the events became clear. A Snapchat video of a football player having sex with her while three other guys, including Boland, watched and talked about “going for a ride,” was making the rounds on campus. She texted him: “Can you call me?” He didn’t respond.","The prosecutors knew the fact that Layne was drunk and had consensual oral sex with Boland would make a judge and a juror question her credibility. But they were most worried about what happened next: A few weeks after reporting the assault to the police, Layne posted a photo of herself to Instagram. She was at a football game, topless and giving the middle finger to the camera. A few students shared the shot on their own accounts, with the caption: “Is this what a real rape victim looks like?”","The lawyers needed the jury to understand that Layne’s actions — however baffling they might seem to the average person — did not make her a liar. They decided to bring an expert witness on the stand, someone who could explain that it was common for victims to act out in a sexual or emotional way after an assault to cope with the trauma.","― ―","Here’s a curveball: Erica Layne’s case is fake and the “lawyers” are actually Georgetown University law students. They’re taking a course on sexual assault cases run by AEquitas, an organization that wants to transform the way prosecutors think about sexual violence through interactive training that involves role-playing and mock trials.","Sexual assaults are the most difficult kind of crimes to prosecute: Of the 31 percent of cases that are reported to police, less than 2 percent result in convictions, according to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network. One of the biggest reasons these numbers are so low is that, despite the complexity of sexual assault trials, lawyers are not required to go through any specialized training before handling them. Many prosecutors throw out cases, mistreat complainants and botch lawsuits in court because they don’t understand victim behavior.","“Everyone thinks they are doing the right thing,” says Jennifer Long, AEquitas’ CEO. “And they might not realize that while some practices in their jurisdiction are really good, others are not good.”","Comedian Bill Cosby’s recent sexual assault conviction is a rare victory for victims, but it will take much more than a high-profile guilty verdict to change a legal system with a long history of mistreating survivors. The public has many misconceptions about how sexual assault survivors should act — misconceptions that trained legal professionals and jurors bring into the courtroom every day.","There’s a stereotype that offenders are creepy-looking strangers who attack unsuspecting women in dark parking lots and that any credible victim should put up a fight, run away and immediately report the assault to the police. When survivors instead act in seemingly counterintuitive ways — seeing their offender again, delaying a police report or posting a topless photo on Instagram — even the lawyers tasked with explaining this behavior to a judge and jury are quick to label victims as liars.","“Prosecutors at their very core are just human beings,” said Richard Smothermon, the district attorney for two Oklahoma counties and a champion of sexual violence training. “We all have these inherent biases that have been built in from hearing about them or seeing them on television.”","AEquitas’ trademark program is a 3½-day course that uses a mix of mock trial exercises and short lectures to run through all the steps involved in prosecuting a sexual assault case, from victim interviews to closing arguments (the organization also offers courses on related crimes, such as domestic violence and human trafficking). Each training begins with participants examining police reports full of the kind of sexual assault victims society tends to disbelieve: an underage, intoxicated college student; a woman whose husband is a deputy sheriff; and a recent U.S. immigrant who works as a scantily clad bartender. The participants, usually gathered in a hotel conference room, use the scenarios to act out mock bail hearings, meetings with police officers and victim interviews. They don’t just learn to litigate these complex cases, they come face-to-face with their own biases about sexual assault victims.","These sessions equip lawyers with the skills they need to support complainants and, ultimately, to win more cases. Yet, due to a lack of resources and an excess of red tape, AEquitas holds its multiday trainings only a few times a year — reaching a very small number of the almost 25,000 prosecutors in the U.S. The organization receives $1.5 million in primarily government funding annually, which barely stretches to cover the more than 4,300 hours of training and technical assistance the 12 staff members provide each year. There is also an approximately 90-day government approval process for every 3½-day course and shorter trainings, which makes it logistically difficult to hold more of them, according to Christina Supinski, AEquitas’ chief operating officer.","AEquitas wants more funding. But the government and nongovernmental organizations — donations from NGOs make up 5 percent of AEquitas’ budget — tend to prioritize giving money to frontline organizations, such as women’s shelters and advocacy groups, Supinski says.","AEquitas wants potential funders to know that fixing a broken legal system is a key part of reducing violence against women. When the legal systems fails survivors, “it discourages victims and survivors from coming forward in future cases because they don’t believe that justice will be done on their behalf,” Supinski said. “And then perpetrators go unchecked and assault more victims.”","Without better-trained prosecutors, victims will never trust a legal process that re-victimizes them and sides with their abusers.","“If you don’t understand the dynamics of sexual assault and the dynamics of trauma and the gender bias that plays into violence-against-women crimes in America, you’re not going to be as successful in the courtroom,” said Casey Gwinn, a former prosecutor and president of Alliance for HOPE International, an organization that provides services to victims of sexual violence. “[You] are going to re-victimize victims and do a terrible job.”","What prosecutors need to know about victims","The way prosecutors interview victims before a trial is a crucial part of sexual violence cases. Yet too often lawyers make a series of faux pas, said John Wilkinson, an attorney adviser at AEquitas who runs trainings. When dealing with victims, prosecutors tend to rush the process, ask judgmental questions and assume victims are lying if they have a scattered memory or appear unemotional, he said. Many don’t know that in traumatic situations the body releases a series of hormones that may cause victims to freeze and prevent their brains from forming memories. Or that survivors might laugh or speak with a flat affect while recounting the assault, due to a flood of natural opiates and oxytocin in the body that help people cope with pain.","Wilkinson himself used to be terse with sexual assault victims before he understood how trauma affects their behavior.","“I was a classic elements-checklist type of interviewer, cutting victims off and getting what I needed,” he said of the seven years he spent working as a state prosecutor in Fredericksburg, Virginia. “I’d say things like, ‘OK, I know that didn’t happen. Now tell me what really happened.’ But in a really crappy way, like, ‘You’re a child.’... It’s not like I was trying to be a jerk, but I was kind of being a jerk.”","Wilkinson trains prosecutors with similar attitudes. In one exercise, lawyers take turns interviewing “Elena Boginskaya,” a 22-year-old bartender who was sexually assaulted after finishing her shift at a club. The police report notes the bar’s dress code for young female staff ― “tight pants or skirts and tight shirts” ― and that the offender took a body shot off Boginskaya’s stomach earlier in the evening. The attorneys often ask questions during role-playing that reveal their own biases, according to Wilkinson.","“I’ve seen prosecutors start to question the victim, and they are sort of going down a fine line — and some jump right over the line — and start asking questions about whether or not she’s a prostitute,” he said. “And some of the victims [played by facilitators] just shut down and say, ‘I don’t want to answer any of your questions.’”","Through a combination of mini-lectures and role-playing, AEquitas trainers and guest lecturers teach a “trauma-informed” approach to dealing with victims, encouraging prosecutors to slow down, withhold judgment and form a trusting relationship with complainants. Prosecutors take turns playing the victim, to feel what it’s like to have a stranger pelt them with questions about trauma.","“If [the interviewer] comes in hot, and they are like, ‘Just the facts, ma’am,’... you immediately see the ‘victim’ tense up and ... they start becoming defensive,” said Supinski from AEquitas. “It’s eye-opening for folks when they go through that to be like, ’Wow, this is all pretend, but still, the questions you were asking me made me feel like it was a real invasion of privacy or made me uncomfortable.”","John Young, an assistant attorney general for the Cherokee Nation in Tahlequah, Oklahoma, said he became more patient and compassionate during interviews after taking an AEquitas course in 2016. Before he learned how trauma fragments memory, he expected victims to have a detailed, linear account of their assault and didn’t know to ask them open-ended questions. “I wanted to hear a story and [would say,] ‘Let me frame this visually: Tell me where you started and tell me what happened next and kind of walk me through it,’” he said. “I don’t think it really dawned on me until after the training that this is not how people tell you these stories.”","How do you convince a jury to believe a victim?","Even the best victim interviews won’t lead to fair trials if prosecutors can’t convince a jury to believe a survivor’s story. But it’s incredibly difficult to fight biases in the courtroom. A recent study by British psychologists found that jurors who scored high in “rape myth acceptance” rejected facts that didn’t match their narratives of the case and were likely to side with the defendant.","AEquitas teaches prosecutors to pick less-biased jurors by asking specific questions during the selection process, such as “Is there anyone here who believes that rape is only committed by people who are strangers?” or “Do you have any expectation about how a person would react after a traumatic event?”","“[Being] raped is not a consequence of getting drunk ― that’s a consequence of a rapist being around when you’re vulnerable,” Wilkinson explained. “You have to say that right into the face of the jury: ‘Who needs force when you have alcohol?’ That might be the theme of your alcohol-facilitated case because that’s going to hook that jury. You’re going to talk about the facts in the case and repeat that theme.’”","Does any of this make a difference?","Although AEquitas’ success stories are mostly anecdotal, there is research that shows education can help change people’s attitudes about sexual assault survivors. Jurors who learned about victim behavior, either from an expert witness or a judge, were less likely to think a complainant who delayed reporting an assault or who spoke with a flat demeanor was not credible, according to a 2009 study by researchers at the University of Leeds and the University of Nottingham. And AEquitas developed a program to help district attorneys’ offices track their progress on sexual assault cases using a mix of statistics, victim feedback and case analysis.","There is plenty of demand for AEquitas’ work, Supinski said, but the government does not prioritize prosecutor training. The amount of grant money available for AEquitas from the Department of Justice’s Office on Violence Against Women has declined by around 25 percent in the past nine years, which Supinski says is in part because organizations that provide direct resources for victims in danger, such as shelters and advocates, take precedence.","“If you have $5, who are you going to give it to?” she said. “Mostly likely not an agency that provides training and technical assistance for prosecutors … [even though] it’s contributing to the prevention of these crimes.”","But the real problem is that many lawyers aren’t interested in taking courses on sexual assault, Gwinn, the Alliance for HOPE president, argued. “Prosecutors’ offices across America have never treated violence against women as a high priority offense historically,” he said, adding that prosecutors have “large egos” and often consider themselves jacks-of-all-trades. “I believe specialization is crucial — prosecuting a murder case is not the same as prosecuting a sexual assault case or a domestic violence case. But you can go to lots of places where elected district attorneys will say, ‘I’m tired of everyone ... [focusing on] their own little area. If you work for me, you’re going to do everything.’”","Smothermon, the district attorney in Oklahoma, agrees that prosecutors tend to have an “I can try any case” attitude. But a bigger issue, he argued, is that offices can’t afford to send lawyers to a 3½-day training and cover their caseloads.","“Oklahoma had an $870 million budget hole this past year, which means my budget has been down by approximately 12 percent for the past 18 months,” he said. “We’re trying to keep people employed, not trained.”","Need help?

The U.S. government has opened a probe into alleged coordination by AT&T, Verizon Communications and a telecommunications standards organization to hinder consumers from easily switching wireless carriers, a person briefed on the matter said earlier this month.","The second round of talks between Sprint and T-Mobile ended in November over valuation disagreements, although Deutsche Telekom CEO Tim Hoettges, left the door open at the time, saying: “You always meet twice in life.”","Since then, Sprint’s shares lost about a fifth of their value amid questions about how the company can compete effectively under the weight of its long-term debt of more than $32 billion.","Softbank has been looking to trim its own debt as well, which reached 15.8 trillion yen ($147 billion) as of the end of December. It has said it is planning to raise cash by taking its Japanese mobile phone unit public this year.","Failure to clinch a deal last November left SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, a dealmaker who raised close to $100 billion for his Vision Fund to invest in technology companies, in search of other options for Sprint.","INVESTING IN 5G TECHNOLOGY","Even though Sprint’s customer base has expanded under CEO Marcelo Claure, growth has been driven by discounting. Analysts say that, without T-Mobile, Sprint lacks the scale needed to invest in its network and to compete in a saturated market.","T-Mobile has fared better than Sprint, even if it remains a distant third to Verizon and AT&T. It has managed to score sustained market share gains, as innovative offerings, improving network performance and good customer service attract new customers, according to Moody’s Investors Service Inc.","T-Mobile became the first major U.S. carrier to eliminate two-year contracts, a shift quickly embraced by consumers and copied by competitors. The company has also badgered rivals with its unlimited data plans.","Both Sprint and T-Mobile are far behind Verizon and AT&T in upgrading their network to accommodate next generation 5G wireless technology. Even after their merger, the combined company’s budget to invest in 5G will be smaller than Verizon or AT&T’s.","However, Sprint and T-Mobile hope the deal will give them more firepower to participate in auction for spectrum to develop 5G. They plan to participate in a spectrum auction in late fall.","(Reporting by Greg Roumeliotis in New York; Writing by Sheila Dang; Editing by Lisa Shumaker and Peter Henderson)"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ae5fad91e000043008e3f43.jpeg?cache=OOddTZgzQ5&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"WORLD NEWS","headline":"Palestinian Teen Dies After Being Shot By Israeli Forces In Gaza Protests","authors":"Nidal al-Mughrabi, Reuters","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/israel-gaza-border-protests-teen-killed_us_5ae4631ae4b055fd7fcc2140","short_description":"Israeli forces have killed 42 Palestinians since Gaza residents began staging protests along the border fence on March 30.","date":"2018-04-28"},"articleContent":["GAZA, April 28 (Reuters) - A 15-year-old Palestinian youth died on Saturday after being shot the previous day by Israeli troops during protests along the Gaza border, the Palestinian Health Ministry said.","Israeli forces have killed 42 Palestinians since Gaza residents began staging protests along the border fence on March 30.

What matters is that the final 20 minutes are meant to be a gut punch, testing the tear ducts of Marvel disciples who’ve waited so long to see the OG Avengers collaborate with the franchise’s rookies. Their wishes are granted and denied in the same fatal breath.","What matters even more, though, is that none of this really matters at all. You see, Marvel Studios is a business first (owned by Disney) and a story factory second. And because it’s a business, we know how many movies certain actors are contracted for and which ones have sequels already in development. That includes some whose characters supposedly went bye-bye.","Take T’Challa, for example. His is easily the most shocking of the “Infinity War” deaths, given the ongoing cultural fervor surrounding “Black Panther,” the best film Marvel has made. Seeing T’Challa’s brawny body disintegrate is, in no short order, heartbreaking. But wait. Isn’t the studio “actively” negotiating a deal for Ryan Coogler to return to direct “Black Panther 2”? (Yes.) And hasn’t Chadwick Boseman only completed three of the five movies in his Marvel contract? (Yep.) T’Challa, in other words, will rise again, one way or another.","And what about little Peter Parker, who joined the series in 2016 and graduated to leading lad in last year’s jocular “Spider-Man: Homecoming”? Acting-wise, Tom Holland lands the finest moment in “Infinity War,” pleading with his mentor, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), that he is not ready to die. But we needn’t think hard to connect the dots on this one: 21-year-old Holland will reportedly shoot the next “Spider-Man” movie this summer, even though his web-slinger just perished.","For kicks, here’s one more. Sebastian Stan, who plays the well-coiffed Bucky Barnes, is reportedly contracted for nine Marvel joints. (Nine?! Who has the time?) So far, he’s appeared in six ― and that’s only if we include his uncredited cameos in “Ant-Man” and “Black Panther,” which probably don’t count toward Stan’s tally. After the movie that will join “Infinity War” in concluding the principal “Avengers” saga next year, Stan will have at least two to go. What can we conclude from this information? Bucky Barnes will be back, as will the Guardians of the Galaxy, who are slated to conclude their standalone story with a third installment due out in 2020, according to director James Gunn. (Chris Pratt, otherwise known as the “late” Star-Lord, has already discussed “Vol. 3.”)","And so on and so forth. Most of the Avengers left standing at the end of “Infinity War” hail from the first phase of Marvel’s big-screen ambitions. Chris Evans’ and Mark Ruffalo’s contracts are nearing their end, and Robert Downey Jr. has long operated under a picture-by-picture arrangement that does not guarantee his presence in any future entities. Those guys can cede custody of the series to the presumably resurrected generation of superheroes in the aforementioned “Avengers” conclusion, whose title has not been revealed because it would constitute a spoiler that probably concerns these deaths.","Or something! Again, I’m less concerned with how the Great Rebirth will happen than I am with the idea that we have ample cause to assume it will happen. Which brings us back to my original point: Fundamentally, the Marvel machine is not about storytelling. It’s about commerce. These films cost a fortune ― with a reported $300 million to $400 million budget, “Infinity War” may be the most expensive movie ever made ― and must be negotiated years in advance. That only leaves so much room for narrative mystery. When we know which characters are slated for which future installments, death is relatively futile. In keeping, the entire third act of this movie is a manipulative ploy. All those tears shed in multiplexes this weekend? The only real point they served was to ensure you’d hand over another $12 next year to see what comes of your favorite swashbucklers.","But we already know, more or less. There are no stakes.","Even the baton-passing sometimes seen in the corresponding comic books ― a nurse named Jane Foster becoming the new Thor, for example ― can’t override the business transactions made public in this otherwise tight-lipped franchise. Sure, perhaps Shuri, T’Challa’s whiz-kid sister, can don the Black Panther suit next. But then how will Boseman fulfill his contract? (Here, fanboy theories are beside the point.)","No matter what happens in the comics ― crisscrossing timelines, cape-swapping plot devices, whatever ― Marvel’s movies must function as, well, movies. “Avengers: Infinity War,” and anything else that grosses close to $1 billion, is pitched at anyone and everyone who is or isn’t familiar with its literary origins. But as the franchise progresses, the chronology of its events departs further and further from the order in which movies are released. That alone is inane. Historically, sequels, prequels and spinoffs clearly demarcate where an individual installment exists on a series’ grander timeline ― but Marvel makes little effort to do so. Audiences shouldn’t need a guidebook to figure out which plot technically occurred first, and they shouldn’t have to suspend their disbelief by pretending characters committed to future installments are dead. I don’t want to hear anything about how “Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 3” could maybe, possibly, actually occur before “Infinity War,” despite hitting theaters two years later.","For comparison’s sake, when the “Star Wars” galaxy hopscotches between time periods, each movie’s title clearly contextualizes its placement in the series. Trilogies are numbered by episodes, and one-offs are given the subtitle “A Star Wars Story.” There is no confusion as to how the plots ― or individual characters’ involvement ― fit together, even when the movies are released in a non-chronological fashion. So, from one overlapping Marvel pageant to the next, we should be able to assume that the ensuing movies’ events have a logical through-line. That is, after all, how sequels work, dammit. Just because Marvel is a so-called “cinematic universe” doesn’t make it any different.","To kill off so many vital players in “Infinity War” is a cheap reflection of Hollywood’s bloated franchise infatuation. Disney knows you’ll be back for more next year. Hell, you might even be back for more next weekend. And as someone who just wants to see clever (and sensical) storytelling, I’m tired.","Someone save us from this capitalistic catastrophe.

He said the bank sought to sell the animals against his advice.","But court records show that the court-appointed receiver, charged with managing the disputed property, actually tried to place the animals in sanctuaries against Thanedar’s wishes.","In fact, it was Thanedar’s attorneys who unsuccessfully sought to have the animals assessed and sold.","“The lawyers were just using any leverage to keep the bank to do its job,” Thanedar told HuffPost on Saturday. He said the animals were not abandoned.","The candidate owned the lab, AniClin Preclinical Services, through its parent company Azopharma until it was shuttered in April 2010.","In July of that year, two animal welfare groups rescued 118 testing beagles stranded in the laboratory. Prior to the organizations’ intervention, the animals’ caregivers climbed the fences of the shuttered facility to provide the dogs with food and water, according to a USA Today report at the time.","Another animal welfare group intervened later that month to find homes for 55 long-tailed macaque monkeys stuck there. The group reportedly learned about the situation thanks to a tip from a caregiver.","The candidate went on a media tour Thursday to defend himself.","“I told the bank that there is sensitive research being done ... living animals’ lives involved, and let us take care of it,” Thanedar told Michigan Fox affiliate WJBK. “But they did not accept our advice. They were anxious to sell all of the assets and get their money, and they did.”","Thanedar’s actions at the time tell a very different story.","The firm acting as a receiver, Morris-Anderson & Associates, filed a motion with the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri on June 14, 2010, seeking permission to transfer the animals to sanctuaries that had agreed to grant various releases.","“The Receiver has investigated the various options available with respect to the Animals and has determined that it is in the best interests of the Receivership Estate for the Animals to be placed with the various animal sanctuaries,” Morris-Anderson’s motion said.","An attorney for Thanedar’s companies objected to the proposal, arguing instead that Morris-Anderson should have tried to sell the animals. The proceeds from the sale, Thanedar’s attorney maintained, could have benefited the creditors and thus reduced Thanedar’s debts to them.","“The value of the animals could have a range of between $189,000.00 to $445,000.00,” the filing states. “The Motion does not indicate whether Receiver has taken any action to sell the animals (i.e. to another testing facility) for the benefit of the creditors.”","The judge in the case, Rodney Sippel, ruled in favor of Morris-Anderson on June 30, authorizing the animals’ transfer to the sanctuaries. Thanedar’s attorneys had withdrawn their objection by then, the judge noted.","Thanedar is locked in a contentious three-way Democratic primary with Gretchen Whitmer, the former Democratic leader of the state Senate, and Abdul El-Sayed, a physician and former Detroit health director.","Thanedar held a narrow lead over Whitmer, and a double-digit lead over El-Sayed, in a March poll.

In recent years the beaux-arts structure and its grounds also have become a cinematic backdrop for wedding photos, a starting point for community bike rides, and even a course for street racing.","Now, a rumored sale to Ford Motor Co. has ignited giddy local media speculation that the industrial-age relic might soon be converted into a tech hub. Ford has neither confirmed nor denied reports of the talks, saying only that it would like to expand its footprint in the area for autonomous and electric vehicle production.","Detroit’s story is a complex one that refuses to fit neatly into well-worn narratives of urban decline. Once one of the wealthiest cities in America, the city suffered five decades of population loss as its manufacturing base collapsed and unemployment and crime rose, leaving vacant lots sprawled across its neighborhoods and overstretched public infrastructure. Today, it is home to a tenuous, corporate-driven revitalization that has seen local billionaires and corporate investors gobble up real estate in the city’s hollowed-out core.","Revamping the station, situated in Corktown, due west of Detroit’s downtown, would create jobs and turn a haunting vestige of the city’s decline into a beacon of resurgence. But any side effects of an influx of white-collar workers ― rising rents, a changing culture ― would undoubtedly be magnified when set against the metropolis’ broader backdrop of deterioration. In a poor city still starved for investment, this potentially ugly tradeoff between private cash and public benefit raises the central question of who really gains from such redevelopment ― the existing communities and people who live there, or the companies and their middle-class employees who move in.","Ricardo White, a first-time candidate for a state House seat that represents Corktown, says he’s thrilled by the possibility of converting an eyesore into a modern office space.","“But the biggest concern for me is what it means for residents in the neighborhood,” White says. “You hear these words a lot: ‘The new Detroit.’ What happens to people who’ve been with Detroit in its darkest days?”","To appreciate what’s at stake, it’s important to understand how Detroit got to where it is today. Throughout the 20th century, development spread outward from the city’s south-facing bank of the Detroit River along a handful of main traffic arteries that point away from downtown and outside city limits like spokes on a wheel. Concentric semicircles of growth left concentric semicircles of depopulation in their wake, and the ensuing erosion of the city’s tax base culminated in 2013 with the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history.","Since then, investors have raced to take a stake in Detroit’s downtown, remaking this sliver of the city into a hive of mostly white professionals and a playground for suburban concertgoers and sports fans.","It’s a form of disaster capitalism. The wealthy were able to amass so much real estate and civic clout precisely because of Detroit’s collapse. And local government has cheered the efforts, facilitating them as it can.","“The city itself cannot afford to do this,” says June Manning Thomas, a University of Michigan professor who has authored several books on planning in Detroit. What’s more, she adds, “most of the downtown development didn’t involve displacement because no one was really living there.”","In other words, the uglier side of gentrification has thus far been minimized. But the thorny questions grow more complicated as that development spills outward into more residential areas, like Corktown.","The city’s oldest surviving neighborhood, Corktown is one of the few in Detroit already drawing outside investment, with new businesses and trendy restaurants peppering the main thoroughfare of Michigan Avenue. The growth in property values in the area was among the fastest of any neighborhood in the city from 2017 to 2018, according to the city assessor. Construction began last year on a $150 million mixed-use development centered around loft-style apartments. And in March, a youth athletic facility and banquet hall opened on the lot where the Detroit Tigers’ baseball stadium once stood.","Revitalization of Michigan Central Station would undoubtedly kick what’s happening in Corktown into even higher gear. It would also raise questions about the impact a new corporate campus would have on property values and tax burdens in surrounding areas, such as North Corktown, Southwest Detroit and Core City, parts of which now have high vacancy rates.","Second-term Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan has made the revival of such neighborhoods outside of downtown central to his political platform, bulldozing empty houses and improving trash pickup and street lighting. Last year, the city’s planning department unveiled a program targeting three areas for small-scale projects, including renovating dilapidated buildings and converting vacant lots into green space. The five-year program, intended to make these select communities more dense and walkable, is backed by a combination of public funds and nonprofit grants.","“As we all know, the recovery of Detroit is going to be defined by our neighborhoods,” Duggan said in his annual State of the City address in March. “It took 60 years to empty these neighborhoods out and it’s going to take a few years to get them back, but we are treating this issue with the urgency it deserves.”","Noble rhetoric aside, the efforts illustrate the inherent difficulties of equitable redevelopment in a city lacking public resources. Municipal services remain underfunded, a tax foreclosure epidemic continues, and planners must win over residents who’ve experienced a long and racialized history of forced relocation.","Philanthropic organizations have tried to open up the planning process in recent years by jump-starting a development think tank known as Detroit Future City, among other efforts. But community engagement is difficult, even on smaller projects, says local planning professional Lauren Hood, particularly in a city where civic leaders want to see immediate results. The notion that a corporation with its own interests would meaningfully collaborate on a refurbished train station or any other sizable project is difficult to imagine, says Hood.","“Presenting people with an idea and then asking them if they like it is different than bringing them into the decision-making process from the get-go,” Hood says. “Efficiency is inversely related to inclusion. You have to build relationships with people, and you can’t build relationships fast.”","There are reasons to think a happy medium might be found between the strategic imperatives of a company like Ford and the quality-of-life imperatives of the surrounding community. A Detroit Free Press analysis found that the city owns nearly half of the acreage surrounding the 500,000-square-foot train station, which may well give it leverage over any eventual buyer. The price tag of any such project ― likely in the hundreds of millions ― would also trigger a community benefits ordinance requiring the developer to meet with a neighborhood council to discuss issues such as jobs and affordable housing.","Regardless of how the reported talks shake out, mere speculation about the project may already be having an impact. The owners of a 128,000-foot warehouse behind Michigan Central Station put it up for sale in mid-April. Local real estate brokers have already begun reporting an influx of potential buyers for nearby homes.","In Corktown, residents like Blake Almstead, 33, will continue waiting as the possible deal for Michigan Central Station unfolds. Previous attempts to redevelop the station have failed due to a lack of vision, money, or both. “To have a beautiful building like that be renovated would be hugely symbolic for us ― I’m optimistic,” says Almstead, a homeowner.","But Hood, whose development work has spanned various neighborhoods in the city, is ambivalent. She also wonders about the potential side effects of such massive development, including where several hundred new employees might park their cars.","“So many people are so happy to have any development in their neighborhood ― they haven’t seen it for so long,” Hood says. “Others are doing more critical thinking. … Will people be supporting the shiny new things five or 10 years from now?”","For more content and to be part of the “This New World” community, follow our Facebook Page.","HuffPost’s “This New World” series is funded by Partners for a New Economy and the Kendeda Fund.

The event’s brochure, a copy of which HuffPost reviewed, listed the group’s programs on “bioethics and life” and “religious freedom,” and advertised a downloadable white paper responding to the way in which “politics as usual has failed Christian conservatives.”","Rebekah Mercer, the billionaire GOP megadonor and financier of anti-abortion groups, Christian colleges and climate change denial think tanks, bankrolled the confab, according to the brochure.","Brent Bozell, founder of the right-wing Media Research Center, opened the program as the master of ceremonies before Pruitt gave his roughly four-minute speech in acceptance of an award for “human dignity leadership.” The Rev. Thomas Joseph White, a professor at the Catholic Pontifical Faculty of the Immaculate Conception, followed him with an invocation.","This was Pruitt’s hometown crowd. Until 2017, he had served on the board of trustees at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky, an institution that called for “a wife is to submit herself graciously” to her husband and formally opposed “all forms of sexual immorality, including … homosexuality.” The bio on Pruitt’s now-defunct official Twitter account as Oklahoma’s attorney general reads: “Husband, Father, Christ Follower.” He been attending Bible studies with Vice President Mike Pence and other Cabinet secretaries since shortly after taking office at the EPA last year.","While Pruitt’s penchant for rolling back environmental regulations and bolstering the fossil fuel industry is widely touted as the reason President Donald Trump has refused to fire the EPA chief amid a four-week whirlwind of ethical and spending scandals, that largely overlooks Pruitt’s other asset: His reputation as a zealous crusader for conservative Christian politics.","For a president dogged by accusations of adultery and sexual impropriety, that sort of reputation has currency. The ostentatiously devout Pruitt gives Trump cred among evangelical Christian power players at a time when five Republican lawmakers and 170 Democrats in Congress are calling for his resignation. On Thursday, the EPA head testified before two House hearings for a total of six hours, during which Republicans leaped to his defense, arguing the administrator was the victim of “Washington politics,” “innuendo and McCarthyism,” and “a shameful attempt to denigrate the work that’s being done at the EPA.”","Neither the White House nor the EPA returned requests for comment.","“Pruitt is clearly part of the Christian right wing of the Republican Party, and it’s possible that these elite Christian right networks are protecting him, or they’ve sent some kind of message that this is our guy,” said Lydia Bean, author of The Politics of Evangelical Identity. “He’s opposed abortion and worked as an attorney for religious liberty cases, so he checks the right boxes for Christian right evangelicals.”","White evangelicals overwhelmingly support Trump’s job performance, at 61 percent in a December Pew survey, compared to just 32 percent of voters overall. Still, that marks a significant decline from the 78 percent approval in February 2017. Among nonwhite evangelicals, his approval rating plummets, according to a FiveThirtyEight analysis.","Pruitt has played an outsize role in courting leaders on the evangelical right. In September, Trump hosted a dinner with “grassroots leaders,” including evangelical heavyweights such as Concerned Women for America CEO Penny Nance, Faith & Freedom Coalition Chairman Ralph Reed and Tim Goeglein, a vice president at Focus on the Family. In a photo posted to the White House website, Pruitt appears at the table opposite Trump, the only Cabinet secretary in attendance, though his name is not listed in the caption.","As Pruitt’s scandals mount, Christian groups have rallied to defend him. On April 6, the Conservative Action Project published an open letter calling for Pruitt’s “continued tenure at the EPA” and thanking him “for the significant actions he has taken to implement President Trump’s deregulatory agenda.” The list of 186 signatories included Christians for a Sustainable Economy Executive Director David Kullberg, Christian educator Lisa Calvert and Faith Wins President Chad Connelly. Some of the religiously affiliated signatories, such as Anne Schlafly Cori, chair of the “pro-family” Eagle Forum, have a history of backing climate change denial efforts, according to research compiled by the nonpartisan Climate Investigations Center.","White evangelical Christians, more than 80 percent of whom supported Trump in 2016, are the least likely of any religious group in the U.S. to understand the science behind climate change, according to 2015 data from the Pew Research Center. Just 28 percent of white evangelicals believed the planet is warming primarily due to human activity, compared to 41 percent of white mainline Protestants and 56 percent of black Protestants. About 37 percent of white evangelicals don’t believe the climate is changing at all.","In 2005, the National Association of Evangelicals was on the cusp of affirming climate science in a new national platform called “For the Health of a Nation.” But, after passing the board unanimously, the rank-and-file rejected that followed a campaign by oil, gas and coal-linked groups. Since then, the same dark-money donors ― including Mercer ― who sponsor the network of think tanks that provide contrarian (and readily debunked) research contesting the consensus on climate change have also funded conservative Christian groups. The fossil fuel industry made climate change denial, as Splinter’s Brendan O’Connor described it last year, “the word of God.”","Pruitt hasn’t been shy about proselytizing that view. Last October, Pruitt invoked God’s warning to pagans in the book of Joshua to “choose this day whom you will serve” in a speech announcing a new policy barring scientists who receive EPA research funding from serving on the agency’s advisory boards.","In a February interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network, Pruitt said, “The biblical worldview with respect to these issues is that we have a responsibility to manage and cultivate, harvest the natural resources that we’ve been blessed with to truly bless our fellow mankind.”","In March, Politico published tapes from more than decade ago in which Pruitt disputes evolution: “There aren’t sufficient scientific facts to establish the theory of evolution, and it deals with the origins of man, which is more from a philosophical standpoint than a scientific standpoint.”","The statements have rankled EPA workers.","“It’s terrifying,” said one EPA employee who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. “The impression we are left with is that his faith has led him to counterfactual beliefs.”","The staffer, who identifies as queer, said Pruitt’s past affiliations with groups that take hard-line stances on gender and sexuality “are painful to confront.”","“Knowing that the man I work for every day not only disrespects the agency’s mission but also believes that I, as a pansexual woman, and many other EPA employees … are ‘perversions’ in his belief system, is a heavy weight I feel each day at work,” she said.","Though Pruitt’s reputation for piety may help protect him for now, Bean cautioned that it may not filter down to ordinary evangelical voters.","“He’s not an individual with a mass following, not a household name for the evangelical rank and file,” she said. “I do not think Scott Pruitt has a national brand as an evangelical leader that, by itself, would stop Trump from firing him.”","Pruitt’s legacy could alienate him from moderate evangelicals. In 2015, the National Association of Evangelicals adopted a resolution calling for climate action. Ronald Sider, a professor at the Palmer Theological Seminary in Pennsylvania, called Pruitt’s lead role in pushing Trump to withdraw from the Paris climate accord one of the administration’s “really big, longer-term negative policies,” and said the administrator’s failure to take climate change seriously will define his tenure for years to come.","“It’s really immoral and tragic,” Sider said. “Unless that can be turned around fairly soon, our grandchildren will pay for it.”\n","This story has been updated to reflect the NAE’s adoption of a climate resolution."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ae3a2881e00002c008e3e2c.jpeg?cache=Z02VMGgdKb&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Melania Is Trapped In The White House, Says France's First Lady","authors":"Mary Papenfuss","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/melania-trump-trapped-in-white-house_us_5ae3dec9e4b02baed1ba6191","short_description":"She \"can't do anything,\" laments Brigitte Macron.","date":"2018-04-28"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"WEIRD NEWS","headline":"Of Course The Historic North And South Korea Summit Is Now An Amusing Meme","authors":"Lee Moran","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/north-south-korea-summit-meme_us_5ae421d2e4b04aa23f234d6f","short_description":"Kim Jong Un and Moon Jae-in playing tennis?

But Congress has spent years struggling to pass comprehensive immigration reform, and the E-Verify program remains voluntary across most of the country.","Although President Donald Trump included mandatory E-Verify use in his 2019 federal budget proposal, some traditionally Republican interest groups, such as agriculture, have concerns about mandating E-Verify without an overhaul to the U.S. guest-worker program.","Stateline conducted a state-by-state analysis of E-Verify use, looking at Homeland Security data and hiring statistics from the federal Quarterly Workforce Indicators, and found that a critical tool for preventing the illegal hiring of undocumented workers hasn’t been used uniformly even in the states that require it.","The deciding factor in how many employers use the federal E-Verify program might not be state law alone — but also whether a state’s leading industry is one that relies heavily on an immigrant workforce: namely, the poultry industry.","Stateline’s analysis illustrates a dictum that private industry often pushes: Give us the tools, and we’ll take care of the problem without burdensome regulations.","Four of the five states with the highest rates of E-Verify use are also among the nation’s top producers of broilers, the chickens raised, slaughtered and packaged before being shelved in grocery stores across the country.","Poultry plant workers are concentrated in Georgia and Arkansas, the top two states for E-Verify use, with a combined 60,000 employees, according to federal statistics.","E-Verify use is most widespread in Georgia, with 94 percent of hires screened between July 2016 and June 2017, according to Stateline’s analysis. Georgia’s law isn’t the strictest, but it does require all government agencies and most private employers to use E-Verify.","Poultry also is Georgia’s top agricultural commodity, with 1.4 billion broilers produced in 2016, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.","Alabama, another state requiring E-Verify use, had a 60 percent screening rate and produced 1.1 billion broilers in 2016.","Perhaps most interesting is Arkansas, which has achieved the second-highest E-Verify rate without legislation, at 66 percent.","Arkansas, home to Tyson Foods, produced a billion broilers in 2016.","Delaware, home to Perdue, had a 65 percent screening rate. Maryland, home of Holly Poultry, was at 55 percent. Neither state requires E-Verify.","In only nine states did employers screen half of new hires in the year that Statelinestudied, July 2016 to July 2017. All but Arizona and Rhode Island have significant poultry industries. The others — Georgia, Arkansas, Delaware, Tennessee, Alabama, Maryland and South Carolina — are among the top bird-raising states in the country.","Tamar Jacoby, an E-Verify supporter and advocate for legal immigration who runs the group ImmigrationWorks USA, figures that major poultry producers have vivid memories of federal workplace raids a decade ago that resulted in legal fees and many of their workers being detained.","“The meat and poultry industry started earliest and has gone the furthest down that road of seeing the value and the benefit of E-Verify,” Jacoby said.","Tyson Foods — after being charged with smuggling unauthorized immigrants from Mexico and cleared by a jury in 2003 — is now a member of a federal immigration enforcement program that requires an audit of immigration documents for all current workers as well as use of E-Verify for new hires.","Poultry processors may have more influence on smaller states like Arkansas and Delaware than larger states like Texas, said Matt Spencer, director of human resources for the American Poultry Association, a trade group. Industry giants like Tyson and Perdue have plants in many states and adopt the same E-Verify policy in all of them, regardless of local laws and politics, he said. Some members don’t use E-Verify, and the association does not take a position on it.","Tyson has locations in many states and uses both E-Verify and a federal service to verify Social Security numbers, said Caroline Ahn, a company spokeswoman.","Aside from the poultry industry, Stateline’s analysis found that usage rates often reflect state-based regulations.","Georgia has had unparalleled success in getting employers to use E-Verify by requiring it for a business license.","In California, where 23 percent of new hires are screened, E-Verify is discouraged, and local ordinances mandating its use are prohibited.","Some of the states with high screening rates are red states with strong anti-immigrant sentiment. Not Texas and Florida, where employers screen fewer than a third of new hires — fewer than blue states Minnesota and Washington.","Jason Fry, a senior director at Equifax, which handles about 4 million E-Verify screens a year for clients, said laws can be more important than politics, even in states that are politically hostile to unauthorized immigration.","“Businesses in general will follow requirements — they’ll do what they have to do,” Fry said. “It’s not so much about the local politics.”","In states that don’t mandate E-Verify screening, employers hiring workers with falsified paperwork can still comply with federal law, which says only that they cannot knowingly hire unauthorized workers.","Nor can E-Verify be used to screen existing employees — only new hires.","Stateline’s analysis, showing such an uneven use of E-Verify, “creates a case for a uniform, 50-state solution,” said Jennifer Pett, spokeswoman for U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith, a member of the Judiciary and Homeland Security committees. Smith, a Texas Republican, has sponsored a bill in multiple Congresses that would require universal E-Verify use.","Smith’s bill creating a national E-Verify mandate was passed by the Judiciary Committee in October and folded into an immigration package sponsored by Republican U.S. Rep. Bob Goodlatte of Virginia, Smith’s office said. Some E-Verify proponents have been disappointed to see it languish since then.","Companies are mixed on E-Verify. Although the service is free, it costs businesses money through administrative time or hiring independent contractors such as Equifax. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, long an opponent of E-Verify, switched gears in 2015, testifying to Congress in support of the program.","Jacoby, of ImmigrationWorks USA, said larger restaurants and homebuilders also have changed their minds and now support E-Verify.","“The bigger restaurant chains got religion on this, to the point they’re now upset that the smaller ones are not doing it,” Jacoby said. “They see it’s better to have a national mandate than 50 different state laws.”","Dallas Fed researchers determined in 2017 that state-based E-Verify mandates either reduced or slowed the growth of the population of unauthorized immigrants in Alabama, Arizona, Mississippi and Utah.","No significant change was observed in Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. (Support for the study was provided by The Pew Charitable Trusts, which also funds Stateline.)","Not all right-of-center organizations support E-Verify. Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute in Washington, D.C., argues that nobody should have to ask the government for permission to work.","And pro-immigration activists say they oppose a national E-Verify mandate unless it includes help for the unauthorized workers who are already here.","Stateline home page","Sign up for exclusive state policy reporting and research"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ae339d92000004f00b8fe13.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"What Ben Carson Doesn't Understand About The History Of Fair Housing","authors":"The Conversation US, Editorial Partner","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/housing-discrimination-thrives-50-years-after-fair_us_5ae23425e4b08248abaa6e6e","short_description":"By Prentiss A. Dantzler, Colorado College/The Conversation In the midst of riots in 1968 after civil rights leader Martin","date":"2018-04-27"},"articleContent":["By Prentiss A. Dantzler, Colorado College/The Conversation","In the midst of riots in 1968 after civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. was slain, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Fair Housing Act.","The federal legislation addressed one of the bitterest aspects of racism in the U.S.: segregated housing. It prohibited discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion and national origin when selling and renting housing.","The Department of Housing and Urban Development, or HUD, has administered the act with some success. From 1970 to 2010, the share of African-Americans living in highly segregated neighborhoods declined by half. But in areas that remained highly segregated in 2010, there were no signs of improvement. In several cities, such as Baltimore and Philadelphia, average levels of segregation had actually increased.","My scholarship on public housing and residential mobility demonstrates that where African-American people live is often still limited by discrimination.","Meanwhile, HUD – the department charged with ending housing discrimination – has shifted much of its focus away from that core mission to instead promote economic self-sufficiency.","The effect of this change could mean the discrimination that continues to exist will remain, and people of color will continue to have limited options for housing, attend lower-performing schools and experience poorer health outcomes.","Refocusing HUD’s mission","The Fair Housing Act’s dual mission was to eliminate housing discrimination and to promote residential integration. The communities its authors imagined were desegregated and open to all people.","The first HUD secretary, Robert C. Weaver, believed such places would allow for a diverse mix of people and housing options. This founding tenet is reflected in the mission statement HUD has used since 2010: “HUD’s mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.”","However, HUD’s current secretary, Ben Carson, appointed by President Donald Trump, has proposed a new mission statement. It reads: “HUD’s mission is to ensure Americans have access to fair, affordable housing and opportunities to achieve self-sufficiency, thereby strengthening our communities and our nation.”","One of the key differences between these two mission statements is the goal. While the former focused on building inclusive communities, the new mission focuses on individuals being self-sufficient. This shift reflects an age-old debate about the role of the government in helping poor people secure housing. Recent actions by conservatives suggest they are interested in decreasing government assistance for housing to poor people.","For example, the White House’s fiscal year 2019 budget proposal called for slashing HUD’s funding by US$8.8 billion. Shortly thereafter, HUD Secretary Carson tweeted, “The proposed budget is focused on moving more people toward self-sufficiency through reforming rental assistance programs and moving aging public housing to more sustainable platforms.”","On March 23, in lieu of a government shutdown, Congress passed an omnibus bill that actually added money to HUD’s budget. Yet, there is still a possibility that the White House will rescind some of these increases. Conservatives are still split on whether or not they should go against their deal with liberals to save money. This could drastically change the way HUD operates over the next year.","Diminishing role of government","Such efforts to diminish the government’s role in providing housing assistance to the poorest populations is based on historic ideas on the causes of poverty.","Poverty, some people argue, is caused by an individual’s lack of motivation. Blaming other factors out of their control, according to this line of thinking, is a way of not accepting responsibility. This idea is now being translated into housing policy.","The focus on economic self-sufficiency is not new. Starting in the 1980s, HUD linked housing programs and policies with efforts to increase an individual’s ability to support themselves without government assistance.","Promoting self-sufficiency isn’t a bad idea. Raising the income levels of low-income people is a useful endeavor, since housing is often the largest expense among families.","But here’s the problem with focusing on self-sufficiency: It creates the illusion that where people live is solely their choice. It’s not. The market dictates where people can live, and so does discrimination by landlords and mortgage lenders.","Incomes in the U.S. are not increasing at the same rate as housing costs. And as the economy is bouncing back from the Great Recession, housing is becoming increasingly unaffordable for people at nearly all income levels.","So getting people off of housing assistance, while providing training so they can get higher-paying jobs, does not mean they can find affordable housing in the neighborhood of their choice.","To be effective, housing policies must address, not ignore these challenges. A full return to the spirit with which the Fair Housing Act was passed could be a step in the right direction.","If the Fair Housing Act has taught us anything in the last 50 years, it has highlighted that attaining affordable housing is a problem for many people. Focusing on self-sufficiency and turning a blind eye to housing discrimination shifts the focus of housing policy in the United States away from building “inclusive and sustainable communities free from discrimination.”","Prentiss A.

Teachers involved in the protests are seeking higher wages, better classroom funding and improved work conditions.","But underneath the outward fight for these workplace improvements, a more indirect fight for women’s equality is also driving the strikes, say some leaders involved with the walkouts.","An overwhelming majority of teachers are women, and leaders who have participated in the walkouts say they believe many of the reasons they have been forced to protest ― low pay, declining resources, lack of respect from legislators ― might be a function of their gender. It’s no coincidence either that the walkouts are coming at a time when women have been driving conversations about workplace conditions with campaigns like the Me Too movement.","“I think it is absolutely no accident this is happening to an industry, to a field, that is predominantly women. An industry that is seen as serving children, which is ‘women’s work,’” said Dawn Penich-Thacker, a spokeswoman for Save Our Schools Arizona, an education advocacy group that has been involved with the protests. “There’s that societal expectation of, like, you don’t need to be compensated, you don’t need to be regarded as a skilled professional, you’re doing this because it’s in your genes, this is what you do.”","In 2015, public school teachers, on average, made about $1,092 per week, compared with the higher weekly wages earned by all college graduates of $1,416, according to an analysis from the liberal Economic Policy Institute. Because the research compares teachers with all college graduates, the pay gap likely differs from what it would be if educators were compared with other graduates working in the public sector, and the gap varies vastly by state. But the analysis does show how much the gap has grown over the years.","Over the past several decades, the weekly wages of teachers have fallen drastically compared with those of other college-educated professional workers. In 1994, the weekly wages of teachers were about 2 percent lower than those of college-educated professional workers, but by 2015, this gap had increased to over 11 percent.","While there has overall been a downward trend in public sector job growth, gender may explain some of what’s going on for educators.","Paula England, a professor of sociology at New York University, has found that female-filled professions tend to pay lower than other professions that require the same amount of skill and training. She has also found that jobs centered around caregiving tend to pay less than jobs requiring comparable experience. These jobs tend to face a “cultural devaluation” because society is used to the idea of mothers caring for children for free, said England.","“When a field is associated with women and a task has traditionally been associated with women, whoever is making the decisions about pay seems to have a harder time thinking people deserve more money,” she said.","The teacher strikes have largely been in conservative states, where school systems have been starved of resources, though they also took hold this week in Colorado, a state with a Democratic governor.","In West Virginia, teachers went on strike for almost two weeks in late February over low teacher pay, a severe teacher shortage and low levels of school funding. In Kentucky, teachers staged a quasi-strike in late March, after legislators voted to overhaul the state’s pension system in a way that introduces more uncertainty to teachers’ retirement plans. In Oklahoma, teachers shut down schools for nearly two weeks this month over declining classroom resources. In Arizona, teachers walked off the job this week, demanding increased levels of school funding and pay bumps. And in Colorado, thousands of teachers protested this week over low levels of school funding and poor teacher pay.","For Lydia Coffey, a former teacher who protested in Kentucky and is now running for a state House seat, the protests have everything to do with womanhood. Coffey, who has a master’s degree and retired in 2010 after almost 30 years of teaching, never made $50,000. She connects the teacher protests to a rise in female voices addressing politics, amid the Me Too movement and massive women’s marches.","“I think women are just tired of feeling like we’re second class. We’re tired of white men in power telling all of us what to do,” Coffey said.","She recalls protesting with mostly women, many of whom were worried about what would happen to their livelihood amid the pension changes. She recalls the distinct condescension in the voices of legislators ― mostly men ― who didn’t take the concerns of educators seriously.","“We’re tired of being put under somebody’s thumb that doesn’t have a clue what it’s like,” Coffey recalled of the experience. “I think that it’s almost like they don’t think we’re smart enough to see what’s happening to us.”","Penich-Thacker isn’t a full-time K-12 classroom teacher ― she works with college students during the year and high school kids over the summer. But she is a woman. And to be a woman in 2018 is to understand what it’s like to have to repeatedly respond to disrespect with a smile and nod, before finally having enough, she said.","“In many ways, this is kind of a political embodiment of what many women’s lives can sometimes feel like,” Penich-Thacker said of the reasons behind the teacher protests. “You take it, and you stay silent, you do what you can, and you smile through it. And you take it and take it and finally you just can’t anymore.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ae3455f1a00002700cdd176.jpeg?cache=vcIH0XJt95&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Temple University Rescinds Bill Cosby's Honorary Degree","authors":"Alanna Vagianos","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/temple-university-rescinds-bill-cosbys-honorary-degree-after-guilty-verdict_us_5ae36280e4b02baed1ba270e","short_description":"Cosby was found guilty on Thursday of three felony counts of aggravated indecent assault.","date":"2018-04-27"},"articleContent":["Temple University announced on Friday afternoon that the school is rescinding Bill Cosby’s honorary degree after the comedian was found guilty in his sexual assault retrial.","“In 1991, based on his career achievements, Temple awarded an honorary degree to William Cosby.

Amazon debuted this new show on Feb. 1.\n\nPremise: Based on an Agatha Christie novel, this takes place in the 1930s and tells the story of a once-famous detective who longs for his glory years while spending much of his time alone. A serial killer starts to send messages to the detective, which sets off a cat-and-mouse mystery that, of course, involves murder.\n\nStars: Rupert Grint and John Malkovich.","How excited should you be? Amazon doesn’t have as many British crime shows as Netflix, so adding this highly stylized detective thriller should be a welcome move for fans of that genre. Malkovich elevates everything he stars in (even with a ridiculous accent this time around) and Grint looks nothing like Grint in this role, so that’s kind of fun. Although this show wallows in grimness, clever moments of humor peek through occasionally.\n\nAny reasons to be skeptical? This show plods along at a glacial pace. During multiple scenes, I wondered if my internet had slowed down and I was watching this at half-speed. The poor direction and dialogue make this hard to get through, so you really have to love detective thrillers to find enjoyment here. Sometimes I watch shows with hourlong episodes that feel too long, but it’s hard to say what should have been cut. That’s not the case here, as the show decides to spend a laughable amount of time focusing on shots of sinks and typewriters and other uninteresting inanimate objects.","Will everyone be talking about this?

Don Beyer (D-Va.) and Ted Lieu (D-Calif.), EPA Inspector General Arthur Elkins said his office “received requests from multiple members of Congress” and would both broaden existing investigations and open “new reviews.”","“Some of these matters will be reviewed as part of previously announced and still ongoing OIG [Office of Inspector General] reviews,” Elkins wrote. “Some will be the impetus for new reviews.”","The EPA declined to comment.","The notice came in response to an April 3 letter Beyer and Lieu sent the watchdog, requesting that his office “consider possible waste or fraud associated with the decision to lay this cost at the taxpayer’s feet, rather than charge Administrator Pruitt personally.”","It’s unclear how many total investigations the EPA chief is facing. But the number of open federal investigations into Pruitt’s activities winnowed down to nine last week after the Government Accountability Office concluded that the agency’s decision to spend $43,000 on a soundproof phone booth broke two laws.","The inspector general in January began auditing the administrator’s costly flights to his home state of Oklahoma. The watchdog twice expanded the probe to cover a wider time window to include Pruitt’s trip to Morocco in December. The office is also looking into Pruitt’s team of round-the-clock bodyguards, whom the agency paid to join the administrator on family trips to Disneyland and the Rose Bowl.","The inspector general’s separate investigation into five-figure raises granted to two long-time aides from Oklahoma who joined Pruitt at the EPA became a flashpoint Thursday in the administrator’s nearly six hours of testimony before two House committees. Pruitt admitted he knew about the salary hikes ― contradicting statements made in a high-profile Fox News interview earlier this month ― and noted that the watchdog’s preliminary report found Ryan Jackson, Pruitt’s chief of staff, authorized the increases.","Both the White House Office of Management and Budget and the Republican-led House Oversight and Government Reform Committee are investigating Pruitt’s spending.","The new inspector general reports come days after Bloomberg reported the White House had begun urging GOP lawmakers to temper their defenses of Pruitt, signaling that President Donald Trump’s support may be waning.","At least five Republican members of Congress and 170 Democrats have called for Pruitt’s resignation.

The world kind of caught up with the piece.”","To be fair, Grandage’s version, which opened March 22 at New York’s St. James Theatre, maintains the themes of its source material. Nearly all of the film’s beloved scenes — from a glittering coronation ball to a swirling blizzard to a snowman’s summery pipe dream — are recreated in dazzling three-dimensional detail.","Many of the show’s most memorable moments, however, are those in which Grandage and stars Patti Murin (Anna) and Caissie Levy (Elsa) are allowed to venture furthest from the film’s now well-trodden plot. Of course, there would be no “Frozen” without “Let It Go,” performed here by Levy with show-stopping vigor. For Broadway, composers Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez have delved even deeper into Elsa’s inner turmoil with “Monster,” one of 12 new songs that Levy has described as “a badass, Kelly Clarkson emo ballad.”","Watch Caissie Levy perform “Monster” below.","“Monster,” which appears in the show’s second half, acts as a sort of “Let It Go” counterpoint, but also sees Elsa going into unprecedented emotional territory for a Disney princess: contemplating suicide.","“For me, when I was offered ‘Frozen,’ it was ‘Monster’ that gave the show real gravity, actually,” Grandage said. “There’s an incredibly dark heart at the center of the song. Elsa talks to her dead parents … she charts whether she would help the chaos she’s created by taking her own life and leaving this world.”","“Monster” would, however, go through a number of incarnations before “Frozen” hit Broadway. When Grandage began working with Levy to stage the number during the show’s out-of-town tryout in Denver, he and designer Christopher Oram had Elsa dressed in a “nightdress-negligee” inspired by Lady Macbeth (yes, really). By the end of the scene, Elsa is captured by Prince Hans (John Riddle) and his guards and transported back to the fictional kingdom of Arendelle, but the impact was underwhelming at best.","“We watched it in Denver, and something just felt very wrong with the resolution,” Grandage recalled. For Broadway, the director and stars completely reconceived the scene so that Elsa’s journey felt more deliberate, keeping it in line with the show’s overriding message of self-empowerment.","Now, Grandage said, “Elsa entraps the men coming into her ice palace. Rather than them imprisoning her, she imprisons them … and when she releases them, she decides to give herself up rather than be captured, in order to strategize and move herself forward from what she’s told us in the song.”","The revamped interpretation of the scene, of course, required a new costume, so Oram opted to take another Disney departure by dressing Elsa in a bejeweled bodice and pants to “mirror the new axis of empowerment that came out of the song,” Grandage said. This time, the inspiration was less Lady Macbeth, more Joan of Arc.","“It’s a type of armor that’s also feminine,” Grandage said. “It takes Elsa’s story on from the original movie.” Given that most of the movie’s creative team also lent their talents to the Broadway show, the director is hopeful that the costume will find its way into “Frozen 2,” currently slated for a 2019 release. “We, as the Broadway show, are sort of joyously anchored between the two films. The development of Elsa in a pantsuit is something that they’ll take on, I hope.”","“I hope that, most particularly, young girls — who make up the vast amount of our audience — are going to watch this piece and be inspired by the journey within ‘Monster,’” he added.","While reviews of the show have been mixed, Levy’s performance in particular has generated ample buzz. One thing Grandage won’t do, however, is try to predict how “Frozen” will fare May 1, when the nominations for the 2018 Tony Awards will be announced.","“It’s been a very, very interesting year with a lot of extraordinary performances emerging, so that’s not something that’s helpful for me to do,” the director, who is currently at work on the revivals of John Logan’s “Red” and Martin McDonagh’s “The Lieutenant of Inishmore” in London, said. Ultimately, he hopes the lengths he and the team have taken to strengthen its feminist message through “Frozen” and other scenes will be impactful in other ways.","“Whatever it does or doesn’t get from awards or reviews ... in the time we’re living through now, I think there are messages that can be meaningful to a lot of people,” he said."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ae0a45f1e00002c008e3993.jpeg?cache=nrhLXJDl80&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"QUEER VOICES","headline":"Richard Grenell Is Trump Administration's Highest Ranking Gay Official","authors":"Patricia Zengerle, Reuters","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/richard-grenell-gay-trump-official_us_5ae1f53de4b04aa23f20b8fe","short_description":"The U.S. ambassador to Germany was confirmed Thursday.","date":"2018-04-27"},"articleContent":["WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate confirmed President Donald Trump’s nominee to be ambassador to Germany on Thursday, just before Chancellor Angela Merkel was due in Washington for talks on Berlin’s desire that Trump preserve the international nuclear agreement with Iran.","The Senate voted 56-42 to confirm Richard Grenell, largely along party lines, filling a position that had been vacant since January 2017.

This","date":"2018-04-27"},"articleContent":["Bill Cosby’s sexual assault retrial ended Thursday with his conviction on three counts of aggravated indecent assault. This has been a long time coming for the victim in this case, Andrea Constand, who said the comedian, now 80, assaulted her 14 years ago, and a small victory for the many other women who claim they were also drugged and victimized by Cosby as far back as the 1960s.","Cosby’s victimizing went on for decades — in his own deposition testimony, he admitted to giving quaaludes to women he wanted to have sex with in the ’70s. It wasn’t until October 2014 that this whole thing really blew up, and it was — of all people — another comedian, Hannibal Buress, who got it going. That’s when the former “Saturday Night Live” and “30 Rock” writer and actor (“Neighbors,” “Broad City”) called out Cosby during a standup show.","“Bill Cosby has the f**king smuggest old black man public persona that I hate,” Buress said. “‘Pull your pants up, black people. I was on TV in the ’80s. I can talk down to you because I had a successful sitcom.’ Yeah, but you raped women, Bill Cosby. So, brings you down a couple notches. I don’t curse onstage. But yeah, you’re a rapist.”","Buress’s comedy bit about Cosby from 2014:","Buress continued, “I want to just at least make it weird for you to watch ‘Cosby Show’ reruns. If you don’t know about it, trust me. When you leave here, Google ‘Bill Cosby rape.’ That s*** has more results than ‘Hannibal Buress.’”","Footage of his act went viral, and people finally stopped to really consider what had been a well-circulated rumor in the entertainment industry. It took on a life outside of social media with news organizations starting to report on it, including CBS News with “Who is Hannibal Buress, and why did he call Bill Cosby a ‘rapist’?” a month later. More important, brave women started speaking out — and didn’t stop. So many women — dozens — accused him of the same thing.","Soon, Cosby, who had a family comedy in the works, lost that show amid the widespread backlash, (finally) pulled the plug on his own comedy tour, and soon found himself at the center of legal action. Constand’s is the only criminal case so far, but other accusers have filed civil suits. He also filed civil suits of his own. While the accusations against Harvey Weinstein last year are credited for birthing the #MeToo movement, the women accusing Cosby had their own even before that. Five of Cosby’s other accusers testified against him in this retrial — including model and TV personality Janice Dickinson, who is perhaps the best known of the bunch — which took place less than a year after another jury deadlocked on the charges.","Buress spoke about being pulled into the Cosby narrative in 2015. “You can’t predict s*** like that,” he told GQ. When the interviewer brought up his being a “feminist hero,” he replied, “People are going to put on you whatever they want to put on you. It is conflicting, because people think I’m like this amazing guy or something. I’m a decent guy.”","Not everything about it was good. A special he was doing with Comedy Central was delayed due to the controversy, but the show went on to air soon after.","In 2016, during a Netflix panel discussion, Buress said it was a weird surprise that his joke had had such an impact. “I was doing a joke in my show, and that shouldn’t influence public opinion. I don’t know if it should go that far. It’s weird to me that a joke did that.” He also noted that there was more to his routine than Cosby jokes. “I do a lot of other s***,” he said. “It’s weird that it happened like that. I was calling a bunch of other comedians rapists, and that was the only one people took seriously. That’s just one joke people took and really ran with it.”","Buress has gone on to have more success in recent years, but fellow comedian Patton Oswalt said Cosby had nothing to do with it. “Hannibal was doing fine without that [Cosby controversy],” he said at the same panel. “He’d be sitting here now if that had not happened. … That’s just incidental to where he was going anyway.”While Buress’s act isn’t focused on Cosby jokes, he did crack another one that got some headlines in 2015. At Justin Bieber’s 2015 Comedy Central roast, he said, “I hate your music more than Bill Cosby hates my comedy.”Buress hasn’t yet spoken out about Cosby’s conviction, for which the disgraced comedian faces up to 10 years in prison for each of the three counts, despite Yahoo’s request for comment via his legal rep. Seems likely he’s saving it for his standup.","Read more from Yahoo Entertainment:","Kanye West posts private texts with John Legend about Trump, says ‘don’t let peer pressure manipulate’ your politics\nKim Zolciak-Biermann tries to explain racism comment.

He also repeated unfounded speculation that Abdul El-Sayed, a Muslim American doctor running for the Democratic nomination, has ties to the Muslim Brotherhood.","The Muslim Brotherhood has influence throughout the Middle East. U.S. foreign policy and counterterrorism officials have been highly critical of the organization and its ideology but have generally not viewed it as a threat to national security. However, advocates for American Muslims have long insisted that conspiracy theories about the Muslim Brotherhood are promoted to foster mistrust of legitimate Islamic organizations working to advance their communities’ interests.","Colbeck claims that the Muslim Brotherhood has ties to the Muslim Student Association, a student-run religious group that El-Sayed participated in at the University of Michigan. The MSA, which has chapters across the U.S., seeks to empower Muslim students and foster religious community on colleges campuses.","On Friday, Colbeck, who is not showing much support in polls, said in a statement that he was being attacked by Democrats and “their allies in the media” for suggesting El-Sayed “has ties to an organization that seeks to eliminate and destroy Western Civilization from within.”","Colbeck said of his Senate floor speech, “My statement was not anti-Muslim any more than associating someone with the Westboro Baptist Church would be seen as anti-Christian.”","Michigan Democrats issued condemnations of Colbeck’s remarks. State Sen. David Knezek called Colbeck a “coward” and a “bully,” describing his behavior as “a cheap rip-off of Joseph McCarthy.” State Rep. Abdullah Hammoud of Dearborn, a Democrat from a district with a large Arab-American population, called for Colbeck’s resignation.","El-Sayed’s team said Republican leaders haven’t done enough to reject Colbeck’s conspiracy theories.","A spokesperson for the Donald Trump–endorsed Republican front-runner in the race, state Attorney General Bill Schuette, said he “took an oath to defend the Constitution and enforce the laws of the state of Michigan, and he believes that all people must be treated with dignity and respect.”","His representatives did not reply to a request for a more direct response to Colbeck’s allegations.","Dr. Jim Hines, another GOP candidate, apologized in a statement “for any disrespect that Senator Colbeck has caused.” Hines said, “No one, regardless of their faith, should be discriminated against.”","Lt. Gov. Brian Calley, who is also seeking the Republican gubernatorial nomination, did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.","Adam Joseph, the communications director for El-Sayed’s campaign, said his team is not satisfied with Schuette’s and Calley’s responses. Joseph is calling on both men to “clearly and unequivocally denounce” Colbeck’s statements.","“Anything short of this is a clear kowtow to racism and hatred for political gain,” Joseph said. “In their silence, they have yet to prove themselves any different from Colbeck — and they should be ashamed.”","President Donald Trump is scheduled to speak at a campaign-style event in Washington, Michigan, on Saturday.

Can you pinch me?” The more than 60 women who have accused Cosby of sexual misconduct expressed relief to the media, and many people touted the verdict as a milestone on Twitter.","“We did it. We won. We beat Goliath,” Heidi Thomas, who accused Cosby of sexually assaulting her in 1984, said on CNN.","There are many, many reasons to celebrate this verdict. Most sexual assault victims have terrible experiences with the legal system. Police and prosecutors often judge or dismiss them, and in the few cases that make it to trial, the defense often retraumatizes, shames and attacks the victims on the witness stand.","Conviction rates for these crimes are notoriously low, and it’s more than likely that at the end of a long, painful process, the jury will side with the defendant. The Cosby verdict, along with the conviction of former USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar for sexually assaulting over 260 women and girls, sends a very important and high-profile message: that judges and jurors may start believing victims.","While that message is extremely important in encouraging more survivors to come forward, this victory should be put in perspective. The legal system is still stacked against victims, and a high-profile guilty verdict is not enough to shift a legal culture that treats complainants as if they were the ones on trial.","Cosby’s sexual assault case was unique. A first trial ended in a mistrial 10 months ago, which means jurors in the retrial already knew about the lawsuit and were likely aware of the wave of sexual predators the Me Too movement has exposed. The judge allowed testimony from five other women who accused the comedian of sexual assault — an anomaly for most cases — which buttressed complainant Andrea Constand’s allegations and establish that the criminal behavior was part of a pattern.","The prosecutors were able to present the jury with Cosby’s testimony from a 2005 civil case, in which he admitted that his sexual encounter with Constand existed in a gray area “somewhere between permission and rejection.”","Most sexual violence crimes lack evidence and public attention. Most lawyers call them the most difficult cases to prosecute because they so often lack physical proof ― victims often don’t have injuries or DNA evidence from rape kits ― and there are rarely any witnesses. These trials are often dubbed “he said, she said,” since they boil down to one person’s account of events against another’s. Most judges and jurors are predisposed to believe the defendant. Many victims instead choose to settle their cases in civil court or don’t report their assaults at all.","Despite the national dialogue on sexual violence that the Me Too movement has sparked, the public holds deeply entrenched stereotypes about sexual assault victims that are very difficult to reverse. Many people think survivors should be blamed for their assaults, based on what they wore, how much they had to drink or how they acted. The cultural expectation is that credible victims should follow a script: Fight, flee and immediately report the abuse. However, experts on violence against women say that isn’t typical behavior.","These myths — which are constantly reinforced in movies, television shows and music — aren’t just something the general public believes; police, lawyers, judges and jurors have internalized them, and those are the very people responsible for deciding if a case makes it to court and whether the accused goes to prison.","The criminal justice system holds such backward views when it come to sexual assault that marital rape is still partly legal in eight states. Police regularly throw out rape reports without investigating them, and prosecutors often mishandle sex assault cases because they think that victims who delay reporting their assault or who speak with a flat affect about their abuse must be lying.","These biases regularly come out in courtrooms. A Canadian judge recently asked an alleged rape victim, “Why couldn’t you just keep your knees together?” The judge who sentenced Brock Turner to only six months in jail for sexually assaulting an unconscious 23-year-old woman behind a dumpster in 2016 said he worried about how a prison sentence might affect Turner, who was a successful athlete.","“Prosecutors need a jury pool trained in the reality of what sexual violence is, and then at the end of the day, they also need judges who receive this training,” said Gretchen Hunt, the head of the office of victims advocacy for the Kentucky attorney general’s office. “There’s very little work specifically being done on training judges on sexual assault as a group.”","Jurors often make their decisions based on myths they believe about victims, which are reinforced by the defense. (One of Cosby’s lawyers called Constand a “con artist” who was after his money. Another said of fellow accuser Janice Dickinson, “It sounds as though she slept with every single man on the planet.”)","Kaarin Long, an an assistant attorney in Ramsey County, Minnesota, said that having the right jurors in a trial is crucial to a case’s success but that the jury selection process doesn’t give her much control over who makes the cut. “Sometimes I get a group of 12 people who are open to hearing the evidence and the state’s point of view,” she said. “[But] I had a trial a couple of months ago where I felt like we almost had no one at all.”","Cosby’s guilty verdict can’t overhaul a legal process that’s always been set up to fail survivors. The problems are so deeply embedded in the legal system that any solutions will have to be longer term ― such as educating kids about consent and training legal experts who handle these cases. In the meantime, while it’s important to celebrate a landmark trial, it’s crucial to keep fighting for systemic changes that will have a much greater impact on the majority of victims than any high-profile sexual assault case."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ae3ba092000004200b8feaa.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Republicans Reject Investigation Into Why Paul Ryan Fired House Chaplain","authors":"Jennifer Bendery and Matt Fuller","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-ryan-house-chaplain-vote_us_5ae34c8fe4b02baed1ba09b5","short_description":"Patrick Conroy was forced out of his job after praying for no “winners and losers” under the GOP tax law.","date":"2018-04-27"},"articleContent":["WASHINGTON ― A top Democratic congressman on Friday unsuccessfully tried to create a special committee to investigate why House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) abruptly fired the House chaplain last week.","Rep.

The measure aimed to fix the flaws in an earlier version of the law, SB 14, that had been blocked by federal courts because it discriminated against black and Latino voters.","Texas officials argued the new law was an adequate fix because it allowed voters without acceptable identification to present a range of documents to prove their identity as well as signing a declaration swearing that they didn’t have photo ID. But in August last year, U.S. District Judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos said the new law was still discriminatory because those who lacked ID “are subjected to separate voting obstacles and procedures.”","In a split decision, the 5th Circuit ruled that Ramos had incorrectly blocked the law on the basis that it continued the discrimination of the prior legislation. The lower court decision, the 5th Circuit wrote, should have been more deferential to the judgment of Texas officials.","“Under the circumstances of this case, the court had no legal or factual basis to invalidate SB 5,” Judge Edith Jones wrote for the 5th Circuit. She added, “[U]ntil a plaintiff pleads and proves some constitutional or statutory infirmity in SB 5, that law must be reinstated, and it affords a generous, tailored remedy for the actual violations found [in SB 14].”","Further, Jones wrote, the district court “overlooked SB 5’s improvements for disadvantaged minority voters” and made no finding that the state legislature “intentionally” discriminated in passing SB 5.","Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) praised the appellate court’s decision on Friday, saying the state’s revised law “removes any burden on voters who cannot obtain a photo ID.”","“The court rightly recognized that when the Legislature passed Senate Bill 5 last session, it complied with every change the 5th Circuit ordered to the original voter ID law,” Paxton said in a statement.","Danielle Lang, an attorney at the Campaign Legal Center who represented the plaintiffs in the case, expressed disappointment in the 5th Circuit’s ruling, but noted that the litigation itself had made voting easier in Texas.","“Because of our brave clients and this litigation, voters statewide can never be turned away from the polls simply for lacking a certain type of photo ID,” she said in a statement. “With respect to the revised law, we are exploring all legal options. We will also work with our partners to ensure that voters are well-educated about their options and not deterred from exercising their right to vote by any confusion around the photo ID rules.”","In his dissent, Circuit Judge James Graves argued that the new law should remain blocked. He noted that SB 5 did not significantly expand the list of acceptable photo IDs and didn’t address the discriminatory issues with voter education that the courts had found with the original law.","“S.B. 14 is legislation borne out of a discriminatory purpose,” Graves wrote. “Even if S.B. 5 were, as Texas and the majority both claim, ostensibly to remove or otherwise lessen the discriminatory impacts of S.B. 14, it still does not change the reason — the discriminatory reason — why the State enacted a voter ID law in the first place. Should S.B. 5 be allowed to govern, its congenital defect would persist.”","The case, Veasey v. Abbott, was originally filed in 2013. It argued that SB 14’s photo ID requirements had been passed in 2011 with the intent to discriminate against minority voters and that the law violated the federal Voting Rights Act as well as the 14th and 15th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. In 2014, Ramos found that the law was discriminatory, and Texas appealed to the 5th Circuit.","At the time, the circuit court upheld Ramos’ ruling that the law had a discriminatory effect, but sent the case back to her to reconsider whether it was passed with the intent to discriminate. In April 2017, she ruled that it was. That decision led some to speculate that Texas could be put back under the heightened supervision of the Voting Rights Act, which would mean the federal government would have to sign off on changes to the state’s election laws.","Richard Hasen, an election law professor at the University of California, Irvine, noted that Jones wrote in her opinion that Texas’ adoption of SB 5 meant that the state shouldn’t be put back under federal supervision. In a blog post, Hasen called that argument “disingenuous.”","“Even if Texas’s enactment of SB5 later on was not done with racially discriminatory intent, SB 14 was, and that alone could be the basis for the imposition of preclearance,” he wrote in a blog post. “Judge Jones just ignores all that and [throws] out the right of plaintiffs in the first instance to seek Section 3 relief before the district court.”","In the 2016 election, while the case was still moving through the courts, Texas implemented a voter ID measure that allowed people to present alternative forms of identification while swearing they did not have any of SB 14’s acceptable forms of ID. That measure became the basis for SB 5 last year.","“While we’re disappointed that the majority of the panel is letting Texas continue to use its new ID law, the ruling did not disturb the court’s findings that the original photo ID law was discriminatory,” said Ezra Rosenberg, co-director of the voting rights project at the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. “Texans deserve laws that make it easier, not harder, to vote.”","This story has been updated with comment from Richard Hasen."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ae3965e1e000044008e3e29.jpeg?cache=BBEQWXp3LU&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Donald Trump And The Next Crash","authors":"TomDispatch, Editorial Partner","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-return-of-the-great-meltdown_us_5ae33439e4b0d538c22dfc14","short_description":"Making the fed an instrument for disaster","date":"2018-04-27"},"articleContent":["This article originally appeared at TomDispatch.com.

It’s the Beltway story hiding in plain sight with trillions of dollars in play and an economy to commandeer.","While we’ve been bombarded with a litany of scandals from the Oval Office and the Trump family, there’s a crucial institution in Washington that few in the media seem to be paying attention to, even as President Trump quietly makes it his own. More obscure than the chambers of the Supreme Court, it’s a place where he has already made substantial changes. I’m talking about the Federal Reserve.","As the central bank of the United States, the “Fed” sets the financial tone for the global economy by manipulating interest rate levels. This impacts everyone, yet very few grasp the scope of its influence.","During times of relative economic calm, the Fed is regularly forgotten. But what history shows us is that having leaders who are primed to neglect Wall Street’s misdoings often sets the scene for economic dangers to come. That’s why nominees to the Fed are so crucial.","We have entered a landmark moment: no president since Woodrow Wilson (during whose administration the Federal Reserve was established) will have appointed as many board members to the Fed as Donald Trump. His fingerprints will, in other words, not just be on Supreme Court decisions, but no less significantly Fed policy-making for years to come ― even though, like that court, it occupies a mandated position of political independence.","The president’s latest two nominees to that institution’s Board of Governors exemplify this. He has nominated Richard Clarida, a former Treasury Department official from the days of President George W. Bush who later became a strategic adviser to investment goliath Pimco, to the Fed’s second most important slot, while giving the nod to Michelle Bowman, a Kansas bank commissioner, to represent community banks on that same board.","Like many other entities in Washington, the Fed’s Board of Governors has been operating with less than a full staff. If Clarida is approved, he will join Trump-appointed Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and incoming New York Federal Reserve Bank head John C. Williams ― the New York Fed generally exists in a mind meld with Wall Street ― as part of the most powerful trio at that institution.","Williams served as president of the San Francisco Fed. Under his watch, the third largest U.S. bank, Wells Fargo, created about 3.5 million fake accounts, gave its CEO a whopping raise, and copped to a $1 billion fine for bilking its customers on auto and mortgage insurance contracts.","Not surprisingly, Wall Street has embraced Trump’s new Fed line-up because its members are so favorably disposed to loosening restrictions on financial institutions of every sort. Initially, the financial markets reflected concern that Chairman Powell might turn out to be a hawk on interest rates, meaning he’d raise them too quickly, but he’s proved to be anything but.","As Trump stacks the deck in his favor, count on an economic impact that will be felt for years to come and could leave the world devastated. But rest assured, if the Fed can help Trump keep the stock market buoyant for a while by letting money stay cheap for Wall Street speculation and the dollar competitive for a trade war, it will.","History Warns Us","At a time when inequality, economic hardship, and household and personal debt levels are escalating and wages are not, why should any of this matter to the rest of us? The answer is simple enough: because the Fed sets the level of interest rates and so the cost of money. This, in turn, indirectly impacts the value of the dollar, which means everything you buy.","Since the financial crisis, the Fed has kept the cost of borrowing money for banks at near zero percent interest. That allowed those banks to borrow money to buy their own stock (as did many corporations) to inflate their value but not, of course, the value of their service to Main Street.","When money is cheap because interest rates are low or near zero, the beneficiaries are those with the most direct access to it. That means, of course, that the biggest banks, members of the Fed since its inception, get the largest chunks of fabricated money and pay the least amount of interest for it.","Although during the election campaign of 2016 Trump chastised the Fed for its cheap-money policies, he’s since evidently changed his mind (which is, of course, very Trumpian of him). That’s because he knows that the lower the cost of money is, the easier it is for major companies to borrow it. Easy money means easy speculation for Wall Street and its main corporate clients, which sooner or later will be a threat to the rest of us.","The era of trade wars, soaring stock markets, and Trump gaffes may feel like it’s gone on forever. Don’t forget, though, that there was a moment not so long ago when the same banking policies still reigning caused turmoil, ripping through the country and devouring the finances of so many. It’s worth recalling for a moment what happened during the Great Meltdown of 2008, when unrestrained mega-banks ravaged the economy before being bailed out. In the midst of the current market ecstasy, it’s an easy past to ignore. That’s why Trump’s takeover of the Fed and its impact on the financial system matters so much.","Let’s recall that, on September 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers crashed. That bank, like Goldman Sachs a former employer of mine, had been around for more than 150 years. Its collapse was a key catalyst in a spiral of disaster that nearly decimated the world financial system. It wasn’t the bankruptcy that did it, however, but the massive amount of money the surviving banks had already lent Lehman to buy the toxic assets they created.","Around the same time, Merrill Lynch, a competitor of Lehman’s, was sold to Bank of America for $50 billion and American International Group (AIG) received $182 billion in government assistance. JPMorgan Chase had already bought Bear Stearns, which had crashed six months earlier, utilizing a $29 billion government and Federal Reserve security blanket in the process.","In the wake of Lehman’s bankruptcy, $16 trillion in bailouts and other subsidies from the Federal Reserve and Congress were offered mostly to Wall Street’s biggest banks. That flow of money allowed them to return from the edge of financial disaster. At the same time, it fueled the stock and bond markets, as untethered from economic realities as the hot air balloon in The Wizard of Oz.","After nearly tripling since the post-financial crisis spring of 2009, last year the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose magically again by nearly 24%. Why? Because despite all of his swamp-draining campaign talk, Trump embraced the exact same bank-coddling behavior as President Obama. He advocated the Fed’s cheap-money policy and hired Steve Mnuchin, an ex-Goldman Sachs partner and Wall Street’s special friend, as his Treasury secretary. He doubled down on rewarding ongoing malfeasance and fraud by promoting the deregulation of the banks, as if Wall Street’s greed and high appetite for risk had vanished.","Impending Signs of Crisis","A quarter of the way into 2018, shadows of 2008 are already emerging. Only two months ago, the Dow logged its worst single-day point decline in history before bouncing back with vigor. In the meantime, the country whose banks caused the last crisis faces record consumer and corporate debt levels and a vulnerable geopolitical global landscape.","True, the unemployment rate is significantly lower than it was at the height of the financial crisis, but for Main Street, growth hasn’t been quite so apparent. About one in five U.S. jobs still pays a median income below the federal poverty line. Median household income is only up 5.3% since 2008 and remains well below where it was in 1998, if you adjust for inflation. Workforce participation remains nearly as low as it’s ever been. Meanwhile, the top 1% of American earners saw their incomes go up by leaps and bounds since the Fed started manufacturing money ― to more than 40 times that of the bottom 90%.","Just as before the 2007-2008 financial crisis, there’s a scary level of confidence among politicians and regulators that neither the economy nor the banking sector could possibly go bust. Even the new Federal Reserve chair views the possible need for bailouts as a relic of a bygone time. As he said at his confirmation hearing, “Generally speaking I think the financial system is quite strong.” When asked if there are any U.S. banks that are still too big to fail, he responded, “I would say no to that.”","That’s a pretty decisive statement, and not strikingly different from one outgoing Fed Chair Janet Yellen made last year. By extension, it means that Trump’s new chairman supports laxer structures for the big banks and more cheap money, if needed, to help them. So watch out.","When a crisis hits, liquidity dies, and banks close their doors to the public. Ultimately, the same formula for crisis will surely send Wall Street executives crawling back to the government for aid and then Donald Trump will find out what financial negligence truly is.","A Time of Crisis and Financial Collusion","As signs of crisis emerge, few in Washington have delved into how we can ensure that a systemic crash does not happen again. That’s why I’ll never forget the strange message I got one day. It was in the middle of May 2015, about a year after my book, All the Presidents’ Bankers, had been published, when I received an email from the Federal Reserve. Every year, the Fed, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank hold an annual conference where the most elite central bankers from around the globe assemble. To my shock, since I hadn’t exactly written in a kindly fashion about the Fed, I was being invited to speak at the opening session about why Wall Street wasn’t helping Main Street.","Two months later, I found myself sitting in front of a room filled with central bankers from around the world, listening to Fed Chair Janet Yellen proclaim that the worst of the crisis and its causes were behind us. In response, the first thing I asked that distinguished crowd was this: “Do you want to know why big Wall Street banks aren’t helping Main Street as much as they could?” The room was silent. I paused before answering, “Because you never required them to.”","I added, “The biggest six U.S. banks have been rewarded with an endless supply of cheap money in bailouts and loans for their dangerous behavior. They have been given open access to these funds with no major consequences, and no rules on how they should utilize the Fed’s largess to them to help the real economy. Why should you expect their benevolence?”","After I returned home, I became obsessed with uncovering just how the bailouts and loans of that moment were only the tip of an iceberg, the sort of berg that had once taken down the Titanic ― how that cheap money fabricated for Wall Street had been no isolated American incident.","What my research for my new book, Collusion: How Central Bankers Rigged the World, revealed was how central bankers and massive financial institutions have worked together to manipulate global markets for the past decade. Major central banks gave themselves a blank check with which to resurrect problematic banks; purchase government, mortgage, and corporate bonds; and in some cases ― as in Japan and Switzerland ― stocks, too. They have not had to explain to the public where those funds were going or why. Instead, their policies have inflated asset bubbles, while coddling private banks and corporations under the guise of helping the real economy.","The zero-interest-rate and bond-buying central bank policies prevailing in the U.S., Europe, and Japan have been part of a coordinated effort that has plastered over potential financial instability in the largest countries and in private banks. It has, in turn, created asset bubbles that could explode into an even greater crisis the next time around.","So, today, we stand near ― how near we don’t yet know ― the edge of a dangerous financial precipice. The risks posed by the largest of the private banks still exist, only now they’re even bigger than they were in 2007-2008 and operating in an arena of even more debt. In Donald Trump’s America, what this means is that the same dangerous policies are still being promoted today. The difference now is that the president is appointing members to the Fed who will only increase the danger of those risks for years to come.","A crash could prove to be President Trump’s worst legacy. Not only is he ― and the Fed he’s helping to create ― not paying attention to the alarm bells (ignored by the last iteration of the Fed as well), but he’s ensured that none of his appointees will either. After campaigning hard against the ills of global finance in the 2016 election campaign and promising a modern era Glass-Steagall Act to separate bank deposits from the more speculative activities on Wall Street, Trump’s policy reversals and appointees leave our economy more exposed than ever.","When politicians and regulators are asleep at the wheel, it’s the rest of us who will suffer sooner or later. Because of the collusion that’s gone on and continues to go on among the world’s main central banks, that problem is now an international one.","Nomi Prins is a TomDispatch regular.

Their research uncovered more than 4,400 victims from 1877 to 1950, including 800 previously unknown cases.","Stevenson drew inspiration for the Montgomery memorial from the Apartheid Museum in Johannesburg, South Africa, and the Holocaust Memorial in Berlin, Germany, to create a singular monument that would illustrate the racist violence of lynchings and the dark stain on America’s past.","The memorial sits atop a hill overlooking the Alabama State Capitol.

We paid $150 billion. We gave $1.8 billion in cash. That’s actual cash, barrels of cash. It’s insane. It’s ridiculous.

The deal’s other signatories include France, the United Kingdom and Germany, as well as the European Union, Russia and China.","But for Republicans running for president in 2015 and early 2016, the correct position on the Iran deal was simple: oppose it, the more vociferously, the better.","The deal was achieved by Obama.

Anything Obama did, therefore, was by definition bad and had to be undone quickly.","But even as GOP presidential candidates lambasted the deal, Republican foreign policy leaders on Capitol Hill understood that an international agreement that put the Iranian nuclear program on hold through at least 2025 was better than no deal at all. They passed a law that allowed Obama to go forward with the agreement while also providing political cover to Republicans who believed they needed it.","“The GOP votes in 2015, especially in the Senate, were relatively safe ones because it allowed a lot of anti-Obama, anti-Iran and pro-Israel posturing without actually owning the consequences of the deal collapsing, including a very real prospect of another major war in the Middle East,” said Colin Kahl, former Vice President Joe Biden’s national security adviser.","Among the established GOP presidential candidates in the field, though, there was little chance of the deal collapsing.","Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, even Texas Sen. Ted Cruz ― they and others, had they won the presidency, almost certainly would have stayed in the agreement, said Rick Tyler, a Republican political consultant who worked for Cruz.","“They probably would have looked at it and thought: What’s best for the country?” he said. “I don’t know anybody who would have ripped up the deal.”","That, of course, was not the public position of the candidates in the summer of 2015 and through the primary season the following winter and spring.","And if Trump was woefully ill-informed about the Iran deal then, his views did not emerge from a vacuum. Rather, they tracked congressional Republicans’ attacks on the agreement, which were then amplified by candidates seeking the GOP nomination, which were then further escalated by Fox News hosts and others in the right-wing media ecosystem.","“Our president has betrayed Israel,” Rubio said at a March 5, 2016 rally in Florida. “On my first day in office, I’m going to cancel the Iran deal,” he said two days later.","“If a guy is threatening to cut your throat, don’t buy him a knife,” South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said at a Feb. 10, 2016 town hall. “This Iran deal is the worst deal.”","Cruz promised literal violence to the agreement itself. “Day one, I will rip to shreds the Iran deal,” he repeated at a North Carolina rally on March 7, 2016.","Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee went even further, essentially accusing Obama of enabling the eventual genocide of Israelis. “It is so naive that he would trust the Iranians. By doing so he will take the Israelis and march them to the door of the oven,” he said on July 26, 2015.","Right-wing media, meanwhile, described the agreement as literally giving Iran nuclear weapons as well as billions of dollars of U.S. taxpayer cash.","In fact, the agreement has forced Iran to give up most of its nuclear material as well as dismantle the machinery it could use to manufacture more. The $1.7 billion the United States gave to Iran was money it held in U.S. banks at the time of the 1979 revolution, plus accrued interest, which had been frozen there by U.S. sanctions for the next three and a half decades.","Whether Trump understood that during the campaign, or even if he understands it now, is not clear. Trump famously bragged at one point that he did not study issues like NATO, even as he went on to describe his strong opinions about NATO. In August 2015, Trump told NBC News that he learned military policy from “the shows” ― television news and interview programs.","One Republican adviser close to the White House said on condition of anonymity that Trump has made no effort since taking office to inform himself ― not on the Iran deal or policy issues generally. “He doesn’t know,” the adviser said. “And he doesn’t care.”","The Iran deal is just one instance where Trump’s not knowing or caring about policy has put his administration in a bind.","On the campaign trail, he repeatedly promised he would repeal Obamacare and replace it with a plan that would both offer everyone better coverage and cost far less ― an absurd claim on its face. Only after he was in office did he acknowledge that the task perhaps wasn’t that simple. “Nobody knew that health care could be so complicated,” he said in February 2017.","Trump’s promise to rip up the Iran agreement actually began causing heartburn even earlier, within days of his taking office.","After Iran tested a long-range missile ― something not covered by the agreement ― then-national security adviser Michael Flynn went before the White House press corps to deliver a bellicose response. But just hours later, top National Security Council staff in a briefing with those same reporters acknowledged that Iran was still complying with the agreement and said that the United States would continue to comply as well.","Under the lran deal legislation passed by Congress, Trump must certify every 90 days whether Iran is in compliance to prevent the reapplication of U.S. sanctions. Trump did this twice since taking office but made it clear he was unhappy about not being able to fulfill his campaign promise. Last October, he refused to certify that Iran was in compliance, bringing about the new, May 12 deadline about whether to re-impose sanctions.","During his first year in office, Trump’s top foreign policy advisers unanimously supported staying in the Iran deal. But in the past two months, Trump has fired national security adviser H.R. McMaster and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, leaving Defense Secretary Jim Mattis as the sole major voice for keeping the deal.","Trump’s new national security adviser, John Bolton, has been best known in recent years for broadcasting his pro-interventionist views on Iran and other countries in his Fox News appearances. And newly confirmed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, as a Kansas congressman in December 2015, told a Westminster Institute audience that the only real solution in Iran was “the abolition of the current regime.”","Given that shift in the Trump administration’s policy-making lineup and Iran’s threat to resume its nuclear program should the United States re-impose sanctions, a top priority of both French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel in their White House visits this week has been to persuade Trump to remain in the agreement.","During his visit earlier this week, Macron tried to appeal to Trump’s fondness for largeness, selling the idea that the deal could be made bigger and better by adding on agreements that dealt with missile technology and Iran’s role in funding regional conflicts. Merkel is to repeat that message Friday, according to Western European diplomats.","Whether their words have any effect remains to be seen. Trump has already ignored U.S. allies on tariffs and the Paris climate agreement because he believes those issues are important to his loyal supporters, even as his popularity has plummeted among everybody else, according to those close to him.","Ironically, it is precisely that cult-like loyalty that could give Trump a path to preserving the deal without losing any support, said Tyler, the former campaign aide to Cruz.","“The Iran deal used to be important to the ideologically based Republican Party, which no longer exists,” Tyler said. “Trump’s supporters are not paying attention to policy in any deep way. It’s basically: ‘Whatever Trump says goes, and that’s fine with us.’”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ae24b2b2000002d00b8fc74.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Donald Trump Deserves Nobel Peace Prize, Says GOP Congressman","authors":"Amanda Terkel","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-nobel-peace-prize_us_5ae3386fe4b04aa23f22b37f","short_description":"\"We are seeing unprecedented progress toward peace, and it’s a direct result of President Trump’s strong leadership,\" said Rep.

Messer first proposed the idea in March and has consistently pushed it since then.","At a historic summit this week, North and South Korea announced that they agreed to the goals of removing nuclear weapons from the Korean Peninsula and pursuing talks with the United States to declare an official end to the Korean War.","“Our peace through strength strategy is delivering never before seen results,” said Messer, saying Trump deserves the credit for the Korean leaders’ announcement.","Messer said he is in the process of gathering congressional support for the nomination.","Trump has agreed to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, possibly in late May or early June. Mike Pompeo, Trump’s newly confirmed secretary of state, met with Kim in secret three weeks ago. At the time, Pompeo was the CIA director.","But Trump had also ratcheted up tensions with North Korea. White House officials contemplated striking the country, and he and Kim traded insults.","President Barack Obama was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, less than one year into his first term ― an honor that infuriated conservatives. The Nobel Committee pointed to “his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples” and “attached special importance to Obama’s vision of and work for a world without nuclear weapons.”","Messer is seeking the Indiana GOP Senate nomination this year, and many of the candidates are trying to prove how much they’re like Trump. Messer has pitched himself as a “conservative who supports the Trump/Pence agenda.”","UPDATE: April 30 ― Rep.

Twenty-three days later, another head in a bag was found near a lake in neighboring Texas.","About 150 miles separate the discoveries, but in each case, the victims, who have yet to be identified, are thought to be white women with brown or auburn hair and between 25 to 40 years old, police said.","Las Vegas criminologist Scott Bonn, who has spent years studying and interviewing some of the most notorious criminals, is disturbed by the similarities in the two cases.","“If the victims had been male, I’d say it could be gang related because that area is fraught with drugs and distribution,” Bonn said. “But we’re talking about two women, which increases the likelihood that this could be a serial killer’s dumping grounds.”","A prison inmate doing clean-up labor along Louisiana Highway 27 in Cameron Parish discovered the first severed head on March 1. It was inside a grocery bag not far from Calcasieu Lake. A preliminary autopsy indicated the head had been outside for about three months. There was no obvious trauma to the skull, but the medical examiner did note the victim had had extensive work done on her teeth, police said.","The second head was discovered by volunteers cleaning up trash near Farm-to-Market Road 1960 in Houston. It was found inside a black plastic bag in a rocky area by Lake Houston, according to the Houston Police Department. An autopsy determined the head had been outside for at least one week. The medical examiner noted the victim’s teeth were in especially good condition, and she had eyeliner and eyebrow makeup tattoos.","Because authorities have only partial human remains, it makes it difficult to gather clues. The head found in Louisiana has been sent to Louisiana State University’s forensics lab for additional testing. The Texas head is being examined by an anthropologist at the Harris County Medical Examiner’s Office in Texas.","Finding the torsos, according to Bonn, would go a long way toward determining whether the cases are linked or if more than one person is responsible.","“Sometimes dismemberment is simply part of an elaborate plan to dispose of a body,” Bonn said. “Other times, it’s part of a fantasy or signature. The bodies are somewhere, and it’s just a question of what’s been done with them.”","The Cameron Parish Sheriff’s Office and the Houston Police Department are working on the cases together. As of Friday, neither agency has ruled out the possibility that the cases are connected or that a serial killer could be responsible.","While authorities do not have any suspects, they do have a person of interest they’d like to identify. According to Houston police, about two weeks before the head was found near FM 1960, someone was seen throwing a bag off a bridge on that roadway.","The individual being sought is described as a light-skinned male in his early to mid-20s, 5 feet, 4 inches to 5 feet, 8 inches, with short dark brown hair with long bangs. He was reportedly seen getting out of a teal or bluish green Chevrolet Silverado extended-cab pickup truck. The truck had rust spots and visible damage, and the rear left passenger window was missing and covered with a cardboard-like material, police said.","Maurice Godwin, a criminal investigative psychologist, thinks it’s likely the same person is responsible for both slayings and is familiar with the areas where the heads were discarded. Serial killers, he said, will sometimes intentionally kill or dump bodies in separate jurisdictions to throw off investigators.","“The killer likely lives within the 150-mile area of where the severed heads were found,” Godwin said. “I suspect [the individual] has killed before.”","Godwin also said the person responsible probably has a criminal record. “Domestic violence, drug convictions and alcohol-related charges.”","Bonn and Godwin both said that additional victims might be found along the 150-mile stretch between the two crime scenes. It would be an area to start searching, they agreed.","The two experts also share the same belief that if a serial killer is responsible, he or she would continue killing until stopped.","“More victims will be found,” Godwin said.","Bonn added, “Not all serial killers have a type, but given the similarities in those two heads, this killer could very well have a certain type [of victim] they’re looking for.”","Anyone with information on the cases is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 713-222-TIPS.","Send David Lohr an email or follow him on Facebook and Twitter."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ae390e51e00002c008e3e26.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"GOP-Led House Panel Ends Its Russia Probe By Claiming To Clear Trump","authors":"Akbar Shahid Ahmed and Ryan J.

It contends that a Trump-driven change in the Republican Party platform ― to remove an endorsement of arming Ukraine in its yearslong conflict with Russian-backed separatists ― actually led to a stronger U.S. policy on the crisis. As for efforts to create a secret channel between Moscow and the Trump team after the election, it says they don’t show secret dealings, but instead prove the two sides did not have significant contact before Trump’s victory.","Additionally, the report calls for Congress to consider repealing the Logan Act, a law barring unauthorized contact between Americans and foreign governments in disputes with the U.S. that Trump critics say the president’s associates may have violated.","Begun in a bipartisan fashion after the U.S. intelligence community publicly accused Russia of intervening in the election to help Trump, the House intelligence committee’s investigation devolved into mudslinging as the panel’s chairmain, Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), sought to shift its focus to alleged Obama administration misdeeds. Nunes grew close to the White House and continued to drive important decisions about how the panel conducted its work even after he publicly committed to taking a step back.","Trump praised the document on Twitter soon after it was released, highlighting the Clinton mention and lobbing an attack at other ongoing investigations of potential collusion with Russia. Two Senate committees are still looking into the issue, as is special counsel Robert Mueller at the Justice Department.","Democrats slammed the report. The House intelligence committee’s top Democrat, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), issued a statement calling its findings “superficial and political.” He criticized how the Republican line changed over time ― citing the way GOP members first disputed the intelligence community’s claim that Moscow wanted to help Trump and hurt Clinton, and then avoided making that case in their final product.","“Throughout the investigation, Committee Republicans chose not to seriously investigate — or even see, when in plain sight — evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, instead adopting the role of defense counsel for key investigation witnesses,” Schiff said. He cited pro-Trump postings by Russian-run social media accounts and the Russian-linked released of hacked materials from Democrats.","Republicans did not allow the panel to interview all witnesses it sought to before formally ending the probe last month, he added.","Schiff said the Democratic minority on the panel is continuing to investigate and received new materials from a witness just this week. Democrats also issued their own 98-page document rebutting several pro-Trump arguments in the majority-controlled report. They noted defects like its downplaying of the role of George Papadopoulos, who has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI as part of Mueller’s inquiry.","The Republican report says Papadopoulos “made minor contributions” and “often acted on his own without the official backing of the Trump campaign.” Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who previously worked on the Trump campaign, testified that he “pushed back pretty sharply” when Papadopoulos said he could engage with Russia on behalf of the campaign, the report adds.","Some material in the majority report sheds new light on how Trump associates say they were assessing the Russian interference as it became clearer in 2016. It says the decision to use material from WikiLeaks was the subject of debate within the campaign. “I remember making a decision that it [a trove of hacked emails] was in the public domain, and it would be silly not to use it,” Sessions told the House panel. “So I used it, although I could understand somebody else not wanting to.”","And it addresses what has become one of the president’s personal fixations: the charge, made in Steele’s dossier, that he paid Russian prostitutes during a Moscow trip in 2013. “The Committee found no evidence to support these allegations,” the report says.","Much of the report is redacted, including, notably, the number of Trump associates that law enforcement began investigating during the election. In a statement after the release, Nunes expressed the GOP’s unhappiness about those cuts ― which were likely demanded by national security officials ― and said the panel will issue “a less redacted version in the near future.”","This story has been updated with additional details about report and a Democratic rebuttal."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ae352b82000004200b8fe4e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"BLACK VOICES","headline":"Robbin' Season's True Criminal Is Revealed In The Latest Episode Of 'Atlanta'","authors":"Julia Craven and Taryn Finley","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/atlanta-season-2-episode-9_us_5ae35a94e4b04aa23f22f60d","short_description":"The rise of Paper Boi and the fall of Earn was inevitable.","date":"2018-04-27"},"articleContent":["Earn is confidently running down another poorly thought-out scheme. Paper Boi is rolling his eyes, doubting his cousin’s capabilities. Darius is darting around in the background, looking for “his fork” and asking if Earn is allergic to jicama. The uninvited and often unwelcomed Tracy is in the kitchen snacking and asking if he can tag along on the trio’s adventure to a performance outside the city.","The latest installment of “Atlanta” has all the trappings of a typical Season 1 episode. There is no opening scene stuffed with broader social critique. Instead, the crew is just preparing for another one of those hilariously relatable outings we all grew fond of early on in the series.","But, because this season has taken a much darker turn, “North of the Border” eventually transforms into a tragically dark comedy that plays out in three acts. Tensions mount throughout the first third of the episode, which culminates with Tracy mushing a black woman down some steps. This incites a mob of students willing to fight the crew, who seek refuge in a college frat house equipped with Confederate flags, antique guns and naked, hooded pledges. Paper Boi and Earn share a blunt from opposite ends of the couch before the rapper finally dumps his cousin as his manager. In the end, Earn and Tracy — the series’ most interesting foil characters — throw hands on the side of the road, which leaves Earn badly beaten.","On this week’s “Run That Back,” Taryn Finley and Julia Craven discuss the show’s treatment of black women, white fraternity life and how, sometimes, we can bring bad things on ourselves.","Oh, and how Earn is the show’s most trash character.","Earn, Paper Boi and Darius are packing up to take a trip to a college in Statesboro. Earn’s plan is simple: Paper Boi is going to perform at Pajama Jam for free and set himself up to play at another function that spring. Earn assures the rapper that he’s set to secure $60,000 in a couple of months. Paper Boi is clearly exasperated by his cousin’s antics. While Paper Boi’s holding his .38-caliber revolver, Tracy pops up from behind the kitchen counter and Paper Boi almost shoots him. In true Tracy fashion, he’s unfazed by the encounter and asks the group where it’s headed. Earn attempts to deter Tracy from tagging along but is unsuccessful. Tracy is going to be the rapper’s security detail. He mentions a hotel and Earn reveals that the group is staying with a girl named Violet, a potential Instagram Honey who, oddly, has only 300 followers. Earn brushes it off while Darius notes that that probably means the girl is “weird.”","Taryn: This episode was a shit show powered by Earn’s poor judgment.","Julia: Yep and a really powerful, tense, hard-to-watch culmination of his poor judgment. I think this is another one where we should just move from the beginning on down because, after a second watch, this is the best episode this season and also the densest.","Taryn: It really is, and a result of the slow burn of Earn and Paper Boi’s work relationship that we’ve seen this season thus far. Judging by the Band-Aid he has on his nose the entire time, this episode doesn’t take place too much time after “Woods,” where Paper Boi finally realized he can’t just be Al when he’s off stage. You can kind of feel the tension as they’re getting ready to leave the house. Earn thinks he has a master plan to get Paper Boi $60,000, but first he has to do a free ― or damn near free ― show at a college in Statesboro. Paper Boi ain’t with the shits and you can tell. Mostly because it’s free but also probably because we know Earn’s cheap ass is probably gonna get him into some shit.\n","Julia: The whole episode feels like Earn is oblivious as he goes through his final shot to convince Paper Boi to keep him on as manager. When Paper Boi said, “You stay tryna be slick.” And Earn replied, “I am slick!” I knew that Earn didn’t have a real grasp on why Paper Boi was agitated. He kind of took it as, “Oh he’s mad about doing the free shit to get big gigs.” But Earn doesn’t understand that Paper Boi doesn’t need to do free gigs anymore, which speaks to how bad of a manager he is.","I do have a special shoutout for Darius and Tracy, though ― the show’s most wholesome characters.\n","Taryn: That line right there really cemented the fact that Earn severely lacks self-awareness. I really don’t like his character and I want to fight him. And I know I’ll win but I’ll get to that later.\n","Julia: LMAOOOO. Even without that scene, I would have bet on you.\n","Taryn: Darius is the most wholesome. Tracy is the most lovable. I have to take away Tracy’s wholesome card this episode.","I also love that, in true nigga fashion, Tracy still lives with Paper Boi and Darius. Months after telling them it would only be a week lmao. Tracy is at home and can’t nobody tell him shit. This nigga didn’t even flinch when Paper Boi pulled a gun on him thinking he was some nigga breaking into his house. He laughed it off and went to the fridge to eat what looked like some kinda cold spaghetti that Darius probably cooked with his bare hands. Icon.","Once the crew gets to Violet’s crib — located in a housing complex that looks dumb similar to where Migos shot “Bad and Boujee” — and settles in, she explains a dream to the rapper. Violet was a crocodile and Paper Boi was a crane. They were cuddling beside a river before she ate him and a light shone from her belly afterward. She says that’s how she knew that she and the rapper were “connected.” Paper Boi, nervously, looks up at the ceiling to see a bloody footprint.","Julia: Tracy is a true nigga and that’s why I appreciate his character (to an extent that we’ll get to in a minute). And I loved how Earn was so bent on keeping Tracy from riding along but Tracy, again in true nigga fashion, grabbed an already packed bag and was like “I’m coming.” I enjoyed that part a lot lmao. Then they’re off, driving along to this college in Statesboro. Once again, these niggas outside the city, which is how I knew something ridiculous was going to happen. And they get to Violet’s crib, a baddie with only ... 300 IG followers. As Darius notes, this is weird.","And it was weird! When her roommate opened the door with that blank ass look on her face, I knew that Violet had a habit of meeting niggas online and inviting them to stay over.\n","Taryn: Weirder than a chick without a sense of reality and more than 3,000 followers, as Darius notes.","That roommate was me in college. Crazy ass roommate who’s always into some shit that I didn’t want anything to do with. She was probably over Violet’s shit by midterms. You see she went right to her room to continue to mind her business. She’s smart.\n","Julia: She is incredibly smart, smarter than Earn. So I like to believe that Paper Boi is an optimist because he was thinking that maybe he can at least sleep with the girl ― his version of a silver lining to Earn’s thoughtlessness about the accommodations. And then she reveals pretty bluntly that she may be a lil off. That dream she explained had me like ... ma’am.\n","Taryn: Like ... that dream. Nah.\n","Julia: “Atlanta” has been doing a good job of making danger known to the audience upfront and bluntly this season. Even if the characters didn’t always see it. But Paper Boi, post-evolution, is starting to see it!","AND THAT FOOTPRINT, MY GOD\n","Taryn: ON THE CEILING AT THAT!\n","Julia: I really wanted them to explain that foot.\n","Taryn: I don’t. I wanted them to leave. GET OUT! FIND A HOTEL. WITCHO CHEAP ASS, EARN.\n","Julia: I need to know how that foot got up there. I really do.\n","Taryn: A séance, probably.","The performance at Pajama Jam goes as planned. Off stage, Rapper Clark County and his manager walk up and dap up Paper Boi. After a quick talk, they take off and two fans approach the rapper, one of whom is writing a paper on him, and he chats them up. That’s when Violet, in a moment of jealousy, dumps her drink on Paper Boi. This sends Tracy running to check her. An argument ensues and Tracy mushes — when you put your hand on someone’s forehead and push them backward — her down the steps. Thankfully, Earn catches her. But she turns around, slaps him and runs to get her brother. During a near-brawl between Paper Boi and Violet’s brother, Tracy runs up and sucker punches the latter. And our protagonists run off.","Taryn: OK, so at the pajama jam, Paper Boi just performed and he, Earn and Darius are dressed like TLC in the creep video. Tracy is taking his role as Paper Boi’s bodyguard way too seriously, which is why we love him ... up until he does some extra fuck shit. While Paper Boi is talking to a girl about the paper she’s writing on him, Violet’s crazy ass sees them from the balcony and dumps her drink on him. Tracy’s brolic ass confronts Violet on the staircase, which was a bad idea in the first place, and their argument turns into him MUSHING HER DOWN THE STAIRS. When I tell you I was PISSED at Tracy.\n","Julia: HE MUSHED HER DOWN THE STEPS! I was pissed at Tracy and at the episode’s writer. I’m sick of black women in this show getting the short end of the stick! We’re mushed. We’re vapid. We’re angry at black men for dating white women. Come on, yo. That shit is tired.","And when this is mixed with the lack of development in Van’s character, I want to mush a man down the steps.\n","Taryn: I had so much hope that this season would delve so much deeper into the lives and perspectives of black women, but alas, they’ve failed us. Everything has been so surface-level (i.e., situationships and social media stunts) and, frankly, we’ve been played and pushed to the side (and literally down the steps in this case). Violet was off but didn’t deserve to be pushed.\n","Julia: Exactly. I could have understood a good cussing out or a firm talking to. I also understand that maybe it’s in Tracy’s character to push women around, but I don’t see a valid reason for this being the pivotal moment in the episode. Why was this the turning point? Why is violence against black women always the turning point on TV? Why? I mean, we know why but it’s disappointing to see it come from Glover’s camp.\n","Taryn: I’m starting to wonder if the writers are purposely giving black women the short end of the stick.\n","Julia: I wonder that too. It’s ridiculous. And sure, Violet was mad clingy and jealous over a man she barely knew. She shouldn’t have dumped the drink on him for speaking to other women. But like you said, a mush down the steps? Come on. That’s just insane to me. It’s like the scene from Van’s episode where ole girl was mad about that guy dating a white woman ... is this what you think of black women? Sure it does pain SOME ― not all, not even most ― black women to see black men constantly date, affirm, uplift, etc., white women, but that isn’t all black women. That scene, and this one with Violet, didn’t give any glimpse into WHY these women feel this way. And, fwiw, black women usually only have something to say about black men dating white women when they openly shit on black chicks in the process. Otherwise, just love your gf and go.","I don’t understand why a mush down the steps was the route to go. It didn’t even seem to fit in thematically. I think violence can be used in TV shows to make larger points (something “Atlanta” does really well, tbh) but this usage wasn’t thoughtful to me. It was just ... odd.","Taryn: Exactly! Black women are too multifaceted for the touch-and-go treatment of some of these narratives in the show. Maybe I need to watch the scene a fourth time, but as dramatic as it was shot, it also felt like it was meant to evoke some humor ― given Tracy’s expression. Like, I’m glad Earn caught her, but I don’t blame Violet for turning around to slap him then running to go get her brother. He should’ve beat Tracy’s ass, and Earn’s, just because he has yet to take accountability for anything.","I also was wondering why they were playing Kodak Black at the beginning of the episode. It felt off to me given he allegedly raped someone. Then I realized it felt very connected with the mush, whether that was intentional or not. Seems like it makes a larger point about us canceling everyone except for those who hurt black women. I’m sleep, though.\n","Julia: OOP!! And I feel like the Twitter TV critic crowd will make the point that that is just Tracy’s character, but I don’t care. It did seem like it was meant to be funny in a dark way but it wasn’t.\n","Taryn: It really wasn’t. Fuck Tracy for that. I’m still flabbergasted. Like ... HE MUSHED HER DOWN THE STEPS! I wish a nigga would. Ugh. Let’s move on before I cuss out the writers for that shit.\n","Julia: The frat house sequence was something I deeply appreciated. And I would like to spend a lot of time on it. Let’s dig in and be fake deep.","The crew seeks refuge in a fraternity house on the other side of campus, with the aid of Darius’ acute sense of smell. They smoke weed with a gang of white boys who love Confederate flags, guns, hazing their naked pledges and (we assume) calling black people they don’t like “niggers.” After a strained conversation about hip-hop — mainly Pimp C and UGK — with one of the frat bros, Paper Boi finally tells Earn that he’s been talking to Clark County’s manager, Lucas, about managing him as well.","Taryn: First off, all Paper Boi wanted was some loud and the white boys who probably say nigger casually had it. That’s not funny but what is funny is how Paper Boi most likely knew that but didn’t give a fuck, because he just needed to smoke after that shit. Also, something in my bones knew that Backwoods would make an appearance in this show and, of course, the white boy was smoking out of one, which both Paper Boi and I appreciate. I love it mostly because it’s the first glimpse we get into how this white frat, steeped in and most likely carrying on a deep legacy of racism, love black culture. This shit is genius. Art imitating life.","Julia: It was so funny to me that I laughed out loud in this coffee shop and a lovely white woman looked at me like I was crazy.","But yeah, it was incredibly genius. I love how the house number was 1863, which was the year Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation. And that, ironically, turned out to be symbolic in more ways than one. It was obviously a tip that these white guys say nigger casually and they def rap it in Paper Boi’s songs. But it was also a nod to Paper Boi’s freedom from Earn. Now he’s free to be whatever it is he wants to be because he no longer has this burden holding him back.","Taryn: Shit, you smart like Violet’s roommate that minds her damn business. I also wanna note that though they’re in the know about black popular culture, they’re oblivious to the black students on campus. While they were on the porch, Paper Boi told them that he just performed at Pajama Jam and the white boys acted like they had never heard of the shit a day in their lives despite the fact that it’s a campus event that probably happens annually. If that ain’t a reflection of society’s relationship with black culture/people, idk what is.","Julia: THAT PART!!!! I was like, damn, that’s good nuance.","Taryn: Also, white Greek culture is so, so, so, so very different than black Greek culture. Like, these fools had ’bout a dozen and a half naked men on their knees with burlap sacks on their heads in this basement with a huge Confederate flag on the wall. Where tf they do that at?????","Julia: You know, I went to a PWI [predominantly white institution] and they do shit like that. I heard a story about some frat dudes who had to jack a goat off or something. That wasn’t specific to my university but it was a story I heard about another PWI. So, I mean, weird shit happens.","Taryn: See. Hell no. Glad I went to an HBCU [historically black colleges and universities] cause nope. I don’t wanna even breathe the same air as that nonsense. The basement scene is so ridiculous on so many levels. I was screaming the entire time.","Julia: They also like rap music but don’t let too many black people into their parties. So, the scene was accurate in a lot of ways lmao.","Taryn: Right. They would’ve been hostile af if it was just four random niggas and not Paper Boi with three random niggas. We also see Paper Boi embracing the fact that he’s famous a lil more and using it as leverage to get what he wants.","Julia: I loved how we have these black dudes on a couch, in front of a Confederate flag, with all these naked dudes with sacks over them. It was degrading but also the juxtaposition of it all fascinated me. The black men are clothed and sitting up a bit higher than these white guys. But the sacks reminded me of hoods, which gave me kneeling Klansmen vibes. It was also powerful to see white men kneeling in front of a Confederate flag. It was a subtly powerful scene.","And, the foreshadowing! The stripped frat brothers were super symbolic of the final stripping of Earn, who goes on to lose everything he’s got.","Taryn: I got those Klansmen vibes too. And that’s a really good observation. Like the influence and presumed wealth made him “better” than the other black folks, which offered him access into this house filled with the racist memorabilia that keeps this organization and the house that its members reside in relevant and running. We can’t see their faces, but if we go with the Klansmen notion, I’m sure some of the pledges were pissed. Not just because they’re getting hazed, but also because they are in this humiliating position in front of four black men in a house ― and its traditions steeped in white supremacy ― that they revere as sacred. It’s levels, bruh.","Julia: Also, that smirk from them white boys and the side eyes from Paper Boi and Earn when Darius said he was considering joining the NRA took me tf out.","Taryn: LMAO Then he said “Y’all crazy.” I. FELL. OUT.","Julia: But I liked how they found common ground over firearms. Let me explain before I am dragged.","Black and white Southerners love their guns! On the other hand, white folks have historically used guns to kill black people. It felt like a nod to that commonality, the history of violence against black bodies, why black people own guns for protection against concrete threats as these men are in what could be a threatening situation, how white people have them for hypothetical situations or as artifacts. It was dense! And the fact that the frat inherited the guns struck me as a nod to how they inherit their violent ways of thinking, their love of blackness but hatred of black people, their privilege to own a gun and see it as just an artifact. This sequence had LEVELS!","I’m nerding the fuck out but I loved this scene. I really did.","Taryn: THAT PART. It was truly a great scene! And you know I live for when folks nerd out, so I’m enjoying this. And shoutout to Tracy for stealing one of their guns while he’s on probation at that. I’m still mad at him but that made me happy.","Julia: That offbeat lean wit it, rock wit it took me tf out too. Then shit got really fucking real.","Taryn: Let me tell you something about that scene.","Julia: I just wanna say I was right all season. But I’ll let you finish, I won’t Kanye you.","Taryn: Girl ... after this week someone needs to Kanye Kanye. But I knew when the white boy said Bed Bug Malone was one of his favorite rappers that somebody was about to do something white and foolish in the name of hip-hop. But I wasn’t ready for the cry that I had when he turned on D4L’s “Laffy Taffy” ― one of my fave songs from the snap era ― and all those white men did the Fabo terribly off beat. EYE HOLLERED.","Julia: It was so offbeat, it hurt to watch.","Taryn: Shawty Lo did not die for this.","Julia: THE MAYOR SURELY DID NOT!","Taryn: They deserved the mud bath they were about to get after that bullshit.","Julia: Klasjdjdnchbeg. But no, when shit got real, it got real af.","Taryn: Earn’s oblivious ass. Ugh. I find it really hard to believe he didn’t see this coming.","Julia: He really thought the conversation was gonna be about Tracy. And it’s like ... no, fam. No.","Taryn: You called this during what? Episode 2?","Julia: Episode 1 or 2. I felt it in my bones and my bones don’t lie because I am an auntie for real, I do this shit.","Taryn: You got them Darius senses.","Julia: It’s because I’m Southern. And I be wearing all black and burning sage so you know the ancestors move through me.","Taryn: LMAO that’s what it is. A Southern auntie! Asé.","Julia: Anyway let’s get back on topic before I start talking about smudging my crystals. You could see Earn’s spirit when it left his body. I wanted to feel bad for him but I couldn’t. He did this to himself. Earn is destructive (as we’ll get to in a min). And he brings everyone down with him, but Paper Boi is ready to soar now. When it’s time to fly ― and when you got the team on your back ― you can’t have somebody toxic like that bringing you down.","Taryn: At all. And Paper Boi was trying to tell Earn that even before they left the house. Earn is so stuck up his own ass that he thinks his way of operating, making money, diffusing altercations, etc., are the only way. There’s no self-evaluation. Ever. This is how he lost Van, Paper Boi and probably his parents. Everyone around him is tired of his shit. He can’t continue to rob the people who are there for him the most and take no accountability. Earn paid for his shit in this episode and I only see a downward spiral unless he deals with his shit. He needs therapy.","Julia: And, I am not trying to be funny but it’s gonna sound funny. ... He can’t even afford therapy.","Taryn: He’s still on probation, right?","Julia: I think so. And all of this struck me as Glover revealing the true criminal in Robbin’ Season: It’s Earn. Like you just said, he constantly takes from those around him and now he’s being robbed of what little he had. It also reminded me of Teddy Perkins. How when he’s directly called out, he spirals into a violent fit.","Taryn: YES!","The next morning, they go back to Violet’s house only to find their things cut up and thrown all over the courtyard. Paper Boi’s weed has been stolen and so has Earn’s laptop. Earn’s had a long night and he lashes out. He bangs on the apartment door, pulls the fire alarm to get its occupants to come out, and tries to kick the door down. On the car ride back, Tracy jokes around with Earn, noting his temper. Earn cracks back that the entire evening was his fault. Tracy ignores it, pretends to pull the antique gun he presumably stole from the frat house on Earn and laughs it off again. Earn tells Paper Boi to pull over so he can fight Tracy. He does and they fight to Tracy’s reluctance. The episode ends with a badly beaten Earn — physically and metaphorically — returning to the car’s back seat.","Taryn: When they went back to Violet’s apartment to get their stuff (which, why leave your stuff at the house of a stranger who just told your homeboy she had a dream she ate him, but whatever), their shit was gone. I didn’t feel bad for any of them, especially Earn. This is the bed you made. Lie in it. It’s fucked up that she cut up their shit and stole Earn’s computer, but I can’t say they didn’t deserve that since they didn’t take the ass-whooping after Tracy mushed Violet down the steps and later snuck ole boy.\n","And Earn was dead ass wrong for turning up at her doorstep knowing damn well three outta four of them are on probation. THIS is why you’re a bad manager, Earnest.\n","Julia: Yep. And the spiral continued on the ride home, which is when I should have felt bad for Earn, but I didn’t.","Taryn: He got his ass beat and I enjoyed it. It was a long time coming. Tracy didn’t want to do it but Earn made him. And he had to eat that body slam on the way home. O whale. 🐋\n","Julia: Earn literally makes everyone treat him poorly. And again we see some damn good juxtaposition in this sequence. Earn was driving when they were on the way to Statesboro. Paper Boi was driving on the way back and Earn was in the back seat, directly behind him. I’ve also been thinking about Earn // Tracy. They’re clear foils of each other, right?","Tracy hasn’t had to fight to work his way into Paper Boi’s circle while Earn always has to prove himself and he can’t. The gun kinda tipped me too ― Tracy’s gun can’t shoot, denoting how harmless he is vs. Earn holding the gold gun for his uncle, which shows that his shitty decision-making is what makes him dangerous.","LMAO THAT WHALE EMOJI! I JUST SAW IT!\n","Taryn: Symbolism on a hunnid. Whole time, I just realized that tension been there since Tracy got outta jail and Earn’s couch surfin’ ass was looking for a place to stay. Meanwhile, it was effortless for Tracy to get out of jail and pop up at Paper Boi’s with no question. Earn is timid, passive-aggressive, selfish and a bad judge of character. That’s why he’ll continue to fail.\n","Julia: Yeah. It was a tough scene but it made sense that, at some point, they’d fight and Earn would lose. You don’t win without change. Maybe Earn will change now that he’s taken that ass whoopin’ he’s desperately needed. I can tell Earn wasn’t beaten up enough as a kid. Or he was beaten up too much and he never let it go.","Honestly, it was probably the latter. And in the final scene, Earn beat his own ass. He did this to himself."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ae35c2b1a00002800cdd1b8.jpeg?cache=3Cwa8kfZKi&ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"WEIRD NEWS","headline":"Texas Town's '0.5K' Fun Run Is A Cakewalk Even For The Lazy","authors":"David Moye","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/boerne-texas-05k-run_us_5ae367dbe4b02baed1ba2ad2","short_description":"There's a donut stand about 150 meters into the run — it's next to the smoking section.","date":"2018-04-27"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Rep.

Patrick Meehan (R-Pa.) said Friday he’s immediately resigning, months after he said he wouldn’t seek re-election following reports that he used taxpayer money to secretly settle a misconduct complaint.","The suburban Philadelphia congressman said he would leave office on Friday and would repay the $39,000 his office used to settle a complaint filed by a former aide, whom he had referred to as his “soul mate.”","“While I do believe I would be exonerated of any wrongdoing, I also did not want to put my staff through the rigors of an Ethics Committee investigation and believed it was best for them to have a head start on new employment rather than being caught up in an inquiry,” Meehan said in a statement. “And since I have chosen to resign, the inquiry will not become a burden to taxpayers and committee staff.”","In a resignation letter sent to Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf on Friday and shared with HuffPost, Meehan said: “It has been an honor and a privilege to serve the people of the 7th District of Pennsylvania.”","The congressman was forced out of his post on the House Ethics Committee in January after The New York Times reported a harassment settlement between the congressman and his former aide.","The aide, who wasn’t named, and staffers familiar with the issue told the Times that Meehan had expressed interest in the aide’s personal life and attempted to pursue a romantic relationship with her. His behavior toward her, they said, turned hostile after she rejected him.","The aide filed a complaint against Meehan, began working from home, and eventually quit.","Meehan entered into mandatory counseling and mediation, and eventually reached a settlement with the woman that included her signing a nondisclosure agreement. The congressman reportedly paid the $39,000 settlement using his congressional office fund, which includes taxpayer money.","Meehan has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and does not appear to have apologized to his accuser. In an interview with The Philadelphia Inquirer in January, he admitted that he had told the aide he saw her as a “soul mate” and suggested that any negative behavior toward her stemmed from stress over the Republican effort to dismantle the Affordable Care Act.","Meehan said in a letter to his campaign chairman that he regretted using the term, the Inquirer reported.","“No characterization of the work relationship I shared with a uniquely close colleague could have been more personally harmful than when I described that co-worker as a ‘soul-mate,’” he wrote.","In announcing his resignation, Meehan also thanked his wife and children for their “unwavering support.”","“Though I wish my time in Congress would have finished in a more satisfying manner, I am proud of our accomplishments and thank the residents of my District for their confidence in me over the last eight years,” Meehan wrote. “I recognize that there are constituents who are disappointed in the manner in which I handled the situation that lead to my decision not to seek re-election and wish I had done better by them.”","Meehan said operations of his office would transition to the clerk of the House of Representatives until a successor takes office. His term would have expired in January.","Under Pennsylvania law, Wolf has 10 days to call a special election to fill the vacancy.

Meehan’s immediate resignation in short order,” Abbott told HuffPost.","Meehan’s resignation comes just days after Rep.

We start with Italy and we end in Ireland, and in the middle we go to a lot of other countries as well.”","The first episode this season finds Chopra’s character, Alex Parrish, leaving her FBI and CIA work behind and harvesting grapes in Italy.","“Alex quits everything after the first two seasons.

And she has a new family drama there.”","That’s not the only drama that will unfold this season: Alex has multiple romances ahead.","“She has a lot of man drama this season,” Chopra said. “There are three guys she’s dealing with. It’s a lot.”","Throughout the season, those love stories will become intertwined with the action viewers have come to expect from “Quantico.”","“Alex almost dies this season — that’s a big spoiler alert,” Chopra revealed. “It has to do with water.”","Chopra, who performs her own stunts on the show, took part in the water scene.","“I was on my swim team. I love swimming, but I’m scared of drowning,” she said. “That scares me.

I’m a little bit more shy. I’m a lot more feminine. I like skirts. We both love heels. She does stunts in heels. I’ve actually started believing that if I get robbed or mugged or something that I actually would be able to beat people for real.

Schroeder ordered the federal agency to reinstate the hydrologist and give her back pay.","“My findings indicate that Ms. Chen is an expert in her field of hydrology,” read the decision, which HuffPost obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request. “There is no reason why she cannot continue to be a productive employee and continue to contribute to NWS’s mission.”","The victory has been a long time coming for the hydrologist, who challenged her termination through the U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board, an independent agency that protects public employees.","FBI agents arrested Chen in 2014, accusing her of using a stolen password to obtain information about U.S. dams. She was also accused of lying about a meeting with a Chinese official. Yet just a week before Chen was to go to trial, the case fell apart and charges were dropped with little explanation.","“We are exercising our prosecutorial discretion,” Jennifer Thornton, the spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio, told press at the time.","Chen’s troubles didn’t end there, however. Months after the case fell apart, Chen received a termination letter citing “conduct demonstrating untrustworthiness” and “misrepresentation” among the reasons she was being fired.","However, Schroeder wrote that officials from the U.S. Department of Commerce, which the National Weather Service is part of, were intent on firing Chen regardless of what facts arose. They were “more concerned about being right than doing the right thing. Based on the unyielding nature of their testimony, I would not have been surprised if they rejected that 2 + 2 = 4,” the judge wrote.","Officials failed to consider a dozen sworn declarations from Chen’s co-workers in their termination decision, Schroder added. Ultimately, the National Weather Service failed to prove the “vast majority” of Chen’s alleged conduct, she said, and the Commerce Department didn’t have cause to terminate Chen.","The judge swapped Chen’s termination for a 15-day suspension without pay, due to what Schroeder called a “singular lapse of judgment on Ms. Chen’s part.” This referred to Chen’s agreement to “provide data to a former member of the weather service with a written assurance not to tell anyone she was doing so.”","Several Asian-American legislators applauded the decision and are now calling for an investigation into the handling of Chen’s case.","“Unfortunately, there have been multiple cases in which Chinese American scientists like Sherry have been wrongfully targeted and arrested for alleged espionage only to have those charges dropped with no explanation,” Rep. Judy Chu (D-Calif.) said in a statement. “That is why [Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus] has made it a top priority to urge the Department of Justice to examine whether there is a pattern or practice of Asian Americans being singled out by federal law enforcement and prosecutors for espionage.”","Rep. Grace Meng (D-N.Y.) and Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) issued similar statements.","“It’s clear that Sherry Chen was the victim of gross injustice and unwarranted racial profiling during her time at the Department,” Lieu said. “I’m calling on the IG to immediately open an investigation into this wrongdoing so that it does not happen to our fellow Americans again.”","As the legislators pointed out, Chen is among a string of scientists and researchers of Asian descent who have been wrongly accused of espionage, including Chinese-American professor Xiaoxing Xi, Eli Lilly scientists Guoqing Cao and Shuyu Li, and NASA contract worker Bo Jiang. While their cases dissolved, the damage had already been done.","“Dropped charges do not erase the trauma and paranoia from FBI surveillance, $200,000 in legal fees, or the many shattered pieces of our lives we still have to put together,” Xi’s daughter Joyce wrote in a blog for HuffPost. “It does not erase the fact that the federal government exerted its overwhelming power to try and criminalize my father in the name of national security, as if he were an enemy of his own country, America.”","Research shows that Americans of Asian descent are disproportionately profiled in espionage cases. The nonpartisan Chinese-American organization Committee of 100 published a white paper last June that revealed Asians were more likely to be charged with economic espionage than people of any other race. They are also found innocent at a rate two times higher than individuals from any other racial group. However, people with Asian-sounding names received sentences twice as long as those with Western-sounding names."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ae392ac2000004200b8fea3.jpeg?cache=TMNvmSTyXe&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"The Avengers Talk Dirty In Jimmy Kimmel's 'Unnecessary Censorship'","authors":"Ron Dicker","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/avengers-jimmy-kimmel-unnecessary-censorship_us_5ae2e97be4b02baed1b91af8","short_description":"Language, superheroes.","date":"2018-04-27"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"MEDIA","headline":"Anderson Cooper Shreds 'Incoherent' Trump: 'Like A Crazy Person On A Park Bench'","authors":"Ed Mazza","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/anderson-cooper-donald-trump-park-bench_us_5ae28812e4b02baed1b88f70","short_description":"CNN host tries in vain to make sense of Trump's Fox News interview.","date":"2018-04-27"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Kim Kardashian Breaks Silence On Khloe's Cheating Scandal: 'It's Just So F**ked Up'","authors":"Cole Delbyck","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kim-kardashian-khloe-tristan-cheating-ellen_us_5ae35afae4b02baed1ba1b73","short_description":"Khloe Kardashian's boyfriend was allegedly caught cheating with multiple women days before she gave birth.","date":"2018-04-27"},"articleContent":["Since Kim Kardashian has become her famous family’s de facto crisis manager at this point *cough* Kanye *cough* she’s taken on her next assignment: Tristan Thompson allegedly cheating on her sister Khloe Kardashian.","In a sneak peek of her appearance on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” airing on Monday, Kim broke her silence about the various videos that surfaced earlier this month allegedly showing Khloe’s boyfriend, NBA star Tristan Thompson, cheating with multiple women.","“Poor Khloe,” the reality TV star told the talk show host. “I don’t even know how to describe it besides it’s just so fucked up.”","Days after the videos made the internet rounds, Khloe welcomed her first child with Thompson, a baby girl named True.

On five-hour missions, they would seed the skies with blankets of clear, stinky, aerosolized sulfur dioxide gas. Dispersing 100,000 tons of SO2 annually over several years would begin to approximate levels of the gas that follow a major volcanic eruption, blocking out the sun and lowering the temperature of the earth.","Scientists have proposed solar radiation management, as it’s called, for decades as a form of global-scale geoengineering that could combat global warming. But few have done what Smith, a partner at a private equity firm and former airline executive, has done ― turned pie-in-the-sky, back-of-the-envelope calculations into a full-fledged feasibility study, complete with a development and operating budget for his fleet of planes.","Encouraged by the attention he has been getting from researchers at institutions like Harvard, where he was recently invited to present his work, Smith has worked out a 10-year operating plan for planes that would begin spraying SO2 in 2023.","The whole endeavor, Smith said, is far cheaper and simpler than he initially imagined. There are no real barriers, he said. The total cost of the project? A measly $3.5 billion, he estimated.","“I think it’s bad news how cheap this is,” Smith told a small group last month in a conference room at Harvard’s Center for the Environment. For that kind of money, Smith argued, it’s possible that any rogue nation, organization or individual could start experimenting with the climate.","The impacts of geoengineering on the global scale are unknown, in part because no massive geoengineering project has been undertaken ― apart from human-induced climate change. But models are potentially troubling. Some suggest geoengineering will disrupt rainfall worldwide and damage the earth’s protective ozone layer. A Rutgers University study published in January suggested that suddenly stopping a large geoengineering project, once it has started, could lead to rapid warming, pushing species into extinction and accelerating climate change.","As global temperatures continue to rise, however, some researchers say geoengineering shouldn’t be dismissed. Helene Muri, a researcher at the University of Oslo geosciences department, said it shows promise as a way to reduce harm from climate change, but it is not ready. “We need to know more about the risks involved before we, if we can ever, deem it safe to use,” she said. “Solar geoengineering is in any case not a substitute for cutting CO2 emissions.”","Yet, with every year and climate conference that passes, a global-scale geoengineering project becomes more and more feasible. There’s virtually no regulation stopping a country or individual from trying this, Michael Gerrard, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University, told me. In fact, from a legal perspective, it’s easier to seed the stratosphere than get a permit to remodel your home, he added.","“I think there is such a large chance that someone will try geoengineering that it really needs to be governed,“ said Gerrard. That’s why, together with Tracy Hester at the University of Houston Law Center, he just published a book, Climate Engineering and the Law, intended to help policymakers, technologists and lawyers better understand current regulations and science underlying big-scale geoengineering projects.","The question is when such a project might be attempted, and by who? Gerrard imagines a scenario in which some country, in the wake of a ruinous climate disaster, sees no other choice.","“One could imagine that if some catastrophic [climate] event were to occur in India, and they had a real concern that another one could happen, they would want to, on their own, launch a geoengineering effort to protect themselves against the next one. That’s an entirely plausible scenario,” said Gerrard. That’s why global agreement on governance is needed, he said, followed by country-by-country laws on geoengineering. Failing to legislate, he warned, could result in war because of the harmful climatic consequences of one country’s hasty project.","However imminent a large-scale geoengineering project may be, what’s complicating serious debate on the matter is the narrative perpetuated, in the media and online, that geoengineering is a way to “solve,” “fix” or “stop” climate change.","Readers are as likely to find headlines like, “Scientists suggest a giant sunshade in the sky could solve global warming,” and “Far-fetched fixes for climate change, from solar shields to air-scrubbing” on mainstream news sites like CNN and The Guardian as they are to find them on the usual-suspect, environmentally conscious blogs like Inhabitat (“5 crazy ways to stop climate change with geoengineering”). Press releases like “Could “cocktail geoengineering” save the climate?” are fond of these terms of salvation, too.","This trend has persisted for over a decade. For a 2014 paper published in Environmental Humanities, researchers in Sweden analyzed hundreds of news articles and found that one of the most prevalent storylines around geoengineering was “the notion that pure technology is the only possible solution and that it is an adequate substitute for politics.”","This may be partly because of the way scientists angle their research. “In these days of click-baits and social media likes, it is perhaps tempting to pitch the extreme case scenarios,” said Muri. “I think it is our responsibility as scientists to present our findings in a careful and nuanced way.”","Washington has now caught the geoengineering bug. Ironically, it’s the politicians who have long questioned ― and attacked ― science who are now heralding it as a quick-fix to our climate conundrum.","In a recent op-ed for conservative news outlet The Daily Caller, House Science Committee Chair Lamar Smith (R-Texas), an avowed global warming skeptic, called out geoengineering as an “area of research that has been overlooked for too long.” Instead of “broad, burdensome, ineffective government regulations” or pledging to meet an “arbitrary climate goal,” Smith wrote, we should use technology to find solutions. “As in the past, by letting technology lead the way, Americans will reap the benefits and enjoy a better quality of life,” he wrote.","It’s no surprise that geoengineering is such an easy sell. Relying on a technological fix that’s just over the horizon avoids the mountain moving required to wean ourselves off fossil fuels, bring hundreds of countries into agreement on how to limit and clean up emissions, and alter the consumption habits of an entire civilization. Those are systemic complexities ingrained in our economies and cultures. Propping up glaciers to limit sea level rise, sprinkling iron dust into the oceans to encourage plankton growth to absorb carbon, or spraying the skies to reflect the sun’s heat just seems simpler. And, as Wake Smith shows, increasingly feasible.","But the problem with the way geoengineering is discussed today, lamented John Ehrenfeld, former director of the MIT Program on Technology, Business, and Environment, is that it doesn’t address the societal issues that got us in this mess in the first place.","“It’s a failure to accept complexity of the system, and the system includes people,” Ehrenfeld told me recently over coffee. For decades, Ehrenfeld, who is now retired, researched and promoted the concept of sustainability. But to Ehrenfeld, after all the climate conferences, all the stakeholder roundtables, all the debates on market-driven solutions, the questions and answers being debated never questioned capitalism, civilization, and the notion of progress.","Tackling a problem as deeply ingrained as global warming, Ehrenfeld said, will require humanity to face an existential question that geoengineering alone cannot address: Are we willing to sacrifice growth to ensure the survival of our species?","“Absent decoupling growth from progress,” Ehrenfeld said, “we won’t address the core of the problem.”","For more content and to be part of the “This New World” community, follow our Facebook Page.\n\nHuffPost’s “This New World” series is funded by Partners for a New Economy and the Kendeda Fund.

On the other hand, 33 percent of Americans said that while they don’t believe in that God, they do believe in some other higher power or spiritual force in the universe.","This belief in something bigger is found even among those who identify as atheists, agnostics or “nothing in particular” ― a group that previous Pew research has found makes up more than 22 percent of adults and is growing. In fact, 72 percent of that religiously unaffiliated group, collectively known as “nones,” expressed belief in God or a higher power. Fifty-three percent of them said they believe in a vague spiritual force, 17 percent confessed to believing in the God of the Bible, and 2 percent were unclear on the particulars.","Not surprisingly, Christians were the most likely to say they believed in the God described in the Bible (80 percent). This belief was especially pronounced among Christians who go to historically black Protestant churches (92 percent) and evangelicals (91 percent).","But there were some differences in belief within Christian denominations. For example, 26 percent of mainline Protestants and 28 percent of Catholics said they believe in a higher power or spiritual force, but not in the God of the Bible.","Only 33 percent of Jews said they believe in the God of the Bible, while 56 percent just believe in a higher power or spiritual force.","There were not enough responses for Pew to draw conclusions about Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus and other religious believers.","Ryan T. Cragun, a professor of sociology at The University of Tampa who studies secularization, told HuffPost that the survey aligns with other research indicating that non-belief is growing in the U.S.","While none of the atheists surveyed said they believe in the God of the Bible, about 18 percent said they believe in another higher power or spiritual force. Cragun said he suspects that this higher power that atheists and many other religiously unaffiliated folks are referring to is not necessarily supernatural and may lack other classic Judeo-Christian characteristics.","“For many people, when they claim they believe in a higher power, they are not referring to something supernatural, like a deistic god or the force that underlies all things that is part of Hinduism or Buddhism,” Cragun said. “To the contrary, they are describing something like the laws of nature or a sense of connection to all of humanity.”","Young people were less likely than older Americans to say they believe in the God of the Bible. About two-thirds of adults 50 and older said they believe in God as described in the Bible, while only 43 percent of those aged 18 to 29 said the same.","While the new survey did not address how beliefs in God or another higher power have changed in recent years, previous studies have indicated that the percentage of Americans who say they believe in God or a universal spirit has generally been declining. In 2007, Pew found that 71 percent of U.S. adults said they believed in God with absolute certainty. In 2014, that number had slipped down to 63 percent.","Tom Krattenmaker, a religion columnist and author of Confessions of a Secular Jesus Follower, told HuffPost that the Pew findings bring encouraging news for those who don’t think faith and secularism need to be at loggerheads.","“Despite this being an age of disaffiliation,” Krattenmaker said, “it’s clear that people are still pursuing spirituality and trying to cultivate meaning and purpose in their lives.”","The Pew Research Center survey had a sampling error of plus or minus 2.3 percentage points."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ae22cee1a00004300cdcf9a.jpeg?cache=MKyL7OB4K1&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Obama Photographer Pete Souza Taunts Trump For Not Buying Melania A Birthday Gift","authors":"Lee Moran","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pete-souza-donald-trump-melania-birthday_us_5ae2c2d3e4b055fd7fca5684","short_description":"“He always gave her a present too.\"","date":"2018-04-27"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"MEDIA","headline":"Rush Limbaugh Vividly Describes Alleged Trump Pee Tape, Then Says It's All Fake","authors":"Ed Mazza","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rush-limbaugh-pee-tape_us_5ae2aa60e4b02baed1b8a6ad","short_description":"\"Somebody is going to produce a tape of prostitutes peeing on a bed.\"","date":"2018-04-27"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"WOMEN","headline":"Former Disney Execs Launch Social Network For Girls","authors":"Caroline Bologna","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ex-disney-execs-launch-maverick_us_5ae33bd5e4b055fd7fcb7598","short_description":"Maverick aims to connect and empower young women and girls.","date":"2018-04-27"},"articleContent":["A pair of former Disney executives have created a new social media platform for girls.","On Friday, Brooke Chaffin and Catherine Connors announced the launch of Maverick, a social network geared toward young women between the ages of 10 and 20. The aim is to connect and empower girls by fostering their creativity and introducing them to inspiring role models.","When users join Maverick, which offers both a free iOS app and desktop experience, they have the opportunity to participate in video, photo and text-based “challenges,” like creating their own superheroes, coming up with lyrics for their personal anthems, making dance videos and creating posters for meaningful causes. One recent challenge involves designing their own “freak flags” to celebrate their eccentricity.","“Maverick aims to provide girls and young women with ongoing opportunities to exercise their powers of creativity, curiosity, and daring in the years of their lives when they are still comfortable being messy, ambitious, and unapologetic,” Connors told HuffPost.","“This is with the hope and expectation that they will become practiced and comfortable in experimenting and taking risks, in challenging the pressures of perfection, in being their real, powerful, authentic selves, and in working together ― and that they will carry them forward into adulthood, and use them to make their own futures and change the world,” Connors added.","The challenges come from “Catalysts,” or role models from a range of fields meant to inspire the young “Mavericks.” After sharing their work in response to challenges, users have the opportunity to view and reward each other’s work with comments and badges for categories like “unique,” “creative,” “unstoppable” and “daring.”","Chaffin and Connors develop the challenges in consultation with the role models themselves, as well as educators and “girl experts” to create experiences that are fun and thought-provoking, inspire creativity and experimentation, and encourage the young women to work together.","The two women met while working at the Walt Disney Company, where Chaffin led Disney Interactive’s women and family division and Connors was editor-in-chief of Babble.","Though they bonded over their shared passion for empowering women and girls, Connors said the seeds for Maverick were actually planted some years before her time at Disney, when she was pursuing a career in academia.","“My area was women and girls in social thought, with a particular focus on how they assert themselves ― or rather, historically, how they’re unable to assert themselves ― in the public sphere. So I was very familiar with all of the research on what’s sometimes called ‘loss of voice’ or the confidence gap ― the phenomenon, around puberty and early adolescence, whereby girls go from being assertive and outspoken to not using their voices, not raising their hands, dropping out of sports, etc.,” Connors explained.","Indeed, studies have highlighted the loss of confidence girls experience at surprisingly early ages and the importance of positive female role models in building their self-esteem.","After Connors and Chaffin had both left Disney, they reconnected and decided to use their digital media experience to tackle this issue.","“Girls and young women do feel extraordinary pressure to be perfect and likable and to follow the rules. Much of their current social media engagement increases that pressure,” said Connors. “Maverick’s emphasis on creative messiness and authenticity allows girls to be able to push back against the myths of perfection - and to meaningfully exercise their very real powers.”","In addition to research, the women also draw inspiration from Connors’ 12-year-old daughter Emilia.","“She has always been intense and outspoken and driven and argumentative, and that’s awesome. But I’ve also found it really hard from a parenting perspective, in ways that have continually surprised me,” Connors told HuffPost. “I consider myself a really progressive, feminist parent, but I’ve found myself, too often, imposing problematic social norms on my daughter ...

Before the bill had been formally introduced, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), one of the founders of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus, didn’t think it prodded hard enough, and that Republicans shouldn’t even bother with it. Now he’s changed his tune.","“I’m all for the welfare reform aspect of it,” Jordan said Wednesday. “I think it’s off to a good start.”","Democrats oppose the food stamp legislation, which is part of a so-called farm bill that lawmakers want to pass by October. That means House Agriculture Committee Chairman Mike Conaway (R-Texas) may need 218 of the 236 Republicans in the House to support his bill ― and can’t lose too many of the three-dozen or so House Freedom Caucus members.","Getting the bill through the House by no means guarantees it becomes law, since Democrats can still block anything they don’t like from passing the Senate. But if the House can pass a more conservative version of its food stamp bill, doing so would give House Republicans a stronger negotiating position when the House and Senate farm bills are eventually merged.","The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, helps more than 40 million Americans buy food every month, making it one of the most important safety net programs in the U.S.","The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said the nutrition provisions of the House bill wouldn’t reduce spending over 10 years, largely because $9 billion in savings from shrinking SNAP enrollment would be offset by $7 billion in spending on new training programs for remaining beneficiaries.","But fewer people might enroll in training to keep their benefits than the CBO expects, Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) told HuffPost this week.","“It doesn’t save any money according to CBO, but in actuality there is a potential for savings,” Meadows said. He pointed to significant drops in food stamp enrollment in several states that recently imposed stricter eligibility requirements on adults without dependents.","Wisconsin, for instance, imposed a three-month limit on benefits for able-bodied adults without dependents in 2015. It’s one of only a few states that guarantees a slot in a training program like Conaway’s bill would require states to do. People could keep their benefits if they worked 20 hours per week or enrolled in the program.","In the first year, Wisconsin referred about 79,000 childless adult recipients to training and only 20,000 enrolled, according to state data. The total number of beneficiaries fell by roughly 79,000 during that time, while around 9,000 training enrollees gained employment that showed up in state tax records.","Currently, states can only impose the limit on adults aged 18 to 49 who aren’t working 20 hours per week and who don’t have minor children. Conaway’s bill would expand work requirements to people in their 50s and parents with children older than 6.","Conaway said he’d been trying to sway Meadows and that it’s possible the CBO underestimated the impact of his proposal. Democrats who have seen the CBO’s analysis on the bill’s effect on enrollment, which has not been made public, say several million would have to enroll in training and that more than 1 million would lose benefits over 10 years.","“If people come off quickly, there will be additional savings,” Conaway told HuffPost.","Conaway isn’t exactly going out on a limb by presenting this possibility.","“We agree that there’s a serious risk that the benefit cuts could be much larger than CBO projects,” Stacy Dean, a nutrition policy expert with the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said in email. “That’s one of our most serious concerns.”","Dean pointed to the hypothetical example of a cashier who has a stable part-time job but whose employer gives her fewer than 20 hours of work per week one month. The punishment for the first violation of the work requirement under the proposal would be no benefits for a year.","“Taking away her food assistance isn’t going to help her get more hours from her employer,” Dean said. “It’s just going to make it harder for her to feed her kids. We worry that the estimate doesn’t capture how many people, including workers, will lose SNAP simply as a result of the paperwork work requirements.”","It’s not a surprise that the Freedom Caucus is sounding less hostile to the farm bill, said Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.), one of the top Democrats on the food stamp issue.","“Freedom Caucus is a lot of bark but no bite,” he said. “At the end of the day, everybody rallies around whatever their leadership wants.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ae200111a00002700cdcf4f.jpeg?cache=8t6SXaumcz&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"COMEDY","headline":"Colbert Mocks ‘Kellyanne Kanye’ For His Bizarre Pro-Trump Tweetstorm","authors":"Ed Mazza","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/stephen-colbert-kanye-west-donald-trump_us_5ae14975e4b02baed1b6549a","short_description":"\"Late Show\" host tries to make sense of Kanye's pro-Trump tweets.","date":"2018-04-26"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Serena Williams Is Also A Total Badass At Ax Throwing","authors":"Lee Moran","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/serena-williams-ax-throwing-contest-jimmy-fallon_us_5ae1a872e4b04aa23f1ff67f","short_description":"We shouldn't be surprised.","date":"2018-04-26"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Arizona Teachers Launch Walkout As The Red-State Revolt Rolls On","authors":"Dave Jamieson","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/arizona-teachers-walkout-strike-funding_us_5ae1ffc3e4b02baed1b7f2f4","short_description":"The state follows West Virginia, Kentucky and Oklahoma with a massive school shutdown over education funding.","date":"2018-04-26"},"articleContent":["The red-state teacher revolt came to Arizona on Thursday, as thousands of educators staged a walkout and converged on Phoenix to demand more school funding from the state legislature.","The protest was expected to close about three-quarters of Arizona’s school districts as teachers reported their absences ahead of time, according to an analysis by the Arizona Republic. Schools in the state’s 30 largest districts did not open on Thursday.","Organizers said they were expecting tens of thousands of teachers at the Phoenix rally. The massive protest follows other recent walkouts that closed schools in West Virginia, Kentucky and Oklahoma. Teachers in all those states have rebelled against years of education cuts that led to stagnating salaries, overcrowded classrooms and dwindling school resources.","The Arizona walkout has been in the works for weeks, after the successful strike in West Virginia in late February and March led to 5 percent pay raises for teachers and state employees. Organizers have billed the walkout as #REDforED, with participants and supporters wearing red clothes as a show of solidarity.","The group coordinating the walkout, Arizona Educators United, has not said how long it will last. Some districts have said they plan to remain closed for as long as their teachers participate.","Arizona Educators United has released a list of concrete demands, including a 20 percent pay raise for teachers and certified staff, a return of school funding to pre-recession levels, and a moratorium on tax cuts until the state’s per-pupil spending meets the national average.","“Our goal is to ensure that students have access to highly qualified and experienced teachers, that educators are compensated fairly, and to improve the educational environment in the state of Arizona,” the group said on its walkout planning website.","The root cause of the Arizona walkout is essentially the same as in West Virginia and Oklahoma.","Just like in those other states, Arizona legislators now find themselves in a jam after years of tax cuts. Funding has dropped as corporate and personal income taxes have fallen, and per-student spending remains far below what it was a decade ago. The loss of revenue has left the state with little money to pump into schools or salaries.","The walkouts have put tremendous pressure on lawmakers to raise taxes in states where Republican leaders are loath to do so. In the case of Oklahoma, the threat of a school shutdown led to the first tax hike in nearly three decades, overcoming a supermajority requirement that three-quarters of lawmakers approve it.","In Arizona, Republicans control both chambers of the statehouse, and the governor is Doug Ducey, a Republican. Ducey has laid out a plan to give teachers the 20 percent raise over the course of several years, but it mostly relies on rosy projections that tax revenue will increase due to an improved economy, as well as cuts to other programs. The state’s teachers unions have dismissed Ducey’s proposal.","The American Federation of Teachers-Arizona, one of the state’s main unions, has called for a 2.5 percent tax on services, such as consulting and legal services, which it estimates would raise $2.65 billion a year for school infrastructure, supplies and pay increases. One lawmaker has instead proposed a temporary, three-year increase of the state sales tax by 1 percent as a “bridge” to a longer-term solution.","Without a clear plan laid out by lawmakers, teachers voted last week to take part in the walkout. The Arizona Education Association union said 78 percent of the more than 50,000 teachers and support staffers who voted supported the move."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ae200642000004200b8fc1b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"BLACK VOICES","headline":"Kelis Says Nas Physically Abused Her During Their Marriage","authors":"Alanna Vagianos","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kelis-nas-physical-abuse_us_5ae1fec0e4b02baed1b7f189","short_description":"“I didn’t say anything [then] because I wanted things to work,\" she said.","date":"2018-04-26"},"articleContent":["Singer Kelis just revealed that her ex-husband and rapper Nas subjected her to “a lot of mental and physical abuse” throughout their five-year marriage.","“I have edited myself for nine years and I woke up this morning and I was like ― not today,” she told Hollywood Unlocked’s Jason Lee on Thursday.","In a rare interview, Kelis, 38, discussed her relationship with Nas, which lasted from the early 2000s until their divorce in 2009.

Do you support the president’s immigration proposals, including giving DACA recipients a path to citizenship? How about his proposal for steel and aluminum tariffs?","Candidates meeting with the White House in recent weeks and months are leaving with an “Opinion Leader Questionnaire” from the Office of Political Affairs, with eight yes-or-no questions to fill out and space to elaborate on their reasoning. The questions range from layups to relatively obscure issues. Some of the questions are potentially divisive in a GOP primary.","The document, described to HuffPost by three GOP sources on condition of anonymity, reflects how the White House hopes to use GOP primaries to move the Republican Party in Trump’s direction. While former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon’s dream of a nationwide insurgency against incumbent Republicans has gone up in smoke, the White House is still looking to turn the GOP into a more populist party.","“It’s necessary for the White House to want to make sure the candidates President Trump lines up behind share his views on issues like trade, immigration and an America first foreign policy,” said one former White House official.","Here are the questions included in the document:","“Do you support or oppose President Trump’s appointment of Neil Gorsuch to the United States Supreme Court?”\n\n“Do you support or oppose President Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a multinational trade agreement?”\n\n“Do you support or oppose President Trump’s Executive Order to suspend the issuance of visas and other immigration benefits to nationals of countries of Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen?”\n\n“Do you support or oppose the repeal of Obamacare’s individual mandate within the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017?”\n\n“Do you support or oppose the President’s intention to withhold foreign security assistance to Pakistan?”\n\n“Do you support or oppose President Trump’s Infrastructure Initiative, which calls for $200 billion in Federal funds to spur at least $1.5 trillion in infrastructure investments with partners at the State, local, Tribal, and private level?”\n\n“On January 30, 2018, President Trump released a framework with the following four proposals to reform our immigration system: 1. Establish a $25 billion trust fund for the border wall system, ports of entry and exit, and northern border improvements 2. Promote nuclear family migration by allowing immigration sponsorships of spouses and minor children only 3. End the visa lottery program 4.

Do you support or oppose President Trump’s framework for immigration reform?”\n\n“Do you support or oppose President Trump’s imposition of 25 percent tariffs on steel imports and 10 percent tariffs on aluminum imports?”","After each question, respondents are given the chance to check “yes” or “no,” plus a box to explain the answer.","The document appears to be evolving; some campaigns had received a seven-question version that didn’t ask about the steel or aluminum tariffs. The version viewed by HuffPost was dated March 16 and requested answers by March 30.","Of the eight questions, five divide at least some elements of the GOP. Economic conservatives and free-traders have revolted against Trump’s protectionist moves, including the tariffs and his decision to throw away the TPP, a 12-nation trade deal negotiated by the Obama administration.","Republicans who favor a robust American presence abroad are likely to question his desire to cut off aid to Pakistan. And conservatives are often unenthusiastic about Trump’s infrastructure plan.","The most controversial might be the question on Trump’s immigration principles, where border-state Republicans are often skeptical of the president’s proposed border wall and immigration hawks don’t like the decision to include permanent legal status for DACA recipients. When a proposal based on the framework came up for a vote in February, it received just 39 votes, with GOP senators opposing the proposal from both the center and the right.","While previous administrations hadn’t issued formal questionnaires to candidates, it was standard for them to gather intelligence on candidates and political leaders meeting with the president.","“The political office is trying to gather the information they need to inform the president,” said Scott Jennings, a GOP strategist who worked in the White House political office under the George W.

Prosecuting violent crimes on Indian reservations falls to the Justice Department, and Purdon himself had worked similar cases as a public defender before taking on the U.S. attorney job.","But when Purdon took office, he found that more than a third of his criminal caseload consisted of immigration prosecutions, even though North Dakota lies more than 1,000 miles from the border with Mexico. Despite the state’s proximity to Canada, the defendants were by and large Latin Americans who’d been caught in the U.S. after getting deported. The cases were easy to win. All prosecutors needed was to present paperwork proving the prior deportation. But the cases sapped time away from Purdon’s prosecutors, whom he’d have rather tasked with crimes on the reservations or white-collar cases.","That all happened under the Obama administration. But President Donald Trump has doubled down on immigration prosecutions, seeing it as a way to draft the Justice Department into his immigration crackdown. Earlier this month, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced what he called a “zero tolerance” policy on immigration crime, directing all U.S. attorneys in the four Southwestern border states to prosecute every misdemeanor illegal border-crossing case “to the extent practicable.”","Purdon was livid.","“If you’re working on a misdemeanor illegal entry case, as a matter of fact, you are not working on something more serious,” Purdon, who left office in 2015, told HuffPost. “It is a net drain on the scarce resources of U.S. attorneys. Full stop.”","Despite Trump’s insistence that the border is in “crisis,” illegal entries from Mexico have hit their lowest level since 1971. But illegal entry prosecutions are still taking up half of the federal criminal courts’ workload. If Sessions gets his way, that percentage will continue to increase: Every U.S. attorney in the country will be doing more of the same work that Purdon complained about, and the five U.S. attorneys whose districts touch the southwest border will take on increasingly petty cases to keep the numbers up.","“We want to achieve this zero tolerance across the border and we are redirecting resources,” Sessions told a House Appropriations subcommittee on Thursday.","Last year, Sessions issued a memo to U.S. attorneys in all 94 districts asking them to prosecute more aggressively the felony re-entry cases like the ones that bogged down Purdon when he served from 2010 to 2015. The memo asked U.S. attorneys in the Southwest to submit plans outlining how they’d go after misdemeanor illegal entry cases. The “zero tolerance” policy is just another step in the same direction.","“Isn’t the reality of the situation that the Justice Department is ICE?” Erendira Castillo, an attorney who has represented defendants facing immigration prosecutions for two decades in Tucson, told HuffPost. “Let’s call a spade a spade.”","Sessions didn’t invent this policy, but he’s taking it to another level.","Sessions’ strategy isn’t new. Although living in the U.S. without authorization is a civil offense, the act of crossing the border illegally was criminalized nearly a century ago. But until about 15 years ago, it wasn’t the Justice Department’s main focus.","Back then, an uptick in the number of Central Americans and other non-Mexican migrants were crossing through the Del Rio sector of Texas. Having run out of detention bed space, the Border Patrol had no choice but let them go after issuing notices to appear in immigration court, which the migrants began referring to a “permiso,” Spanish for “permit.” To solve the problem, the departments of Justice and Homeland Security teamed up to prosecute the migrants for the misdemeanor of illegal entry under a 2005 program called Operation Streamline. But what began as a tailored effort to address a single sector’s problem quickly morphed into a borderwide initiative, swallowing up half the federal criminal docket by 2009.","Although Sessions didn’t invent the system, what makes him unique is that he sees no limit to how much the Justice Department should duplicate the work of ICE and the Border Patrol. And to do it, he’s pressing U.S. attorneys on the border to go after the least significant cases possible.","In practice, U.S. attorneys follow different guidelines. In recent years, the U.S. attorney’s office in Arizona rarely bothered prosecuting migrants for illegal entry unless they’d been caught multiple times, while in Texas first-time offenders were routinely charged.","But with illegal crossings at historic lows, prosecutors have fewer people to charge. Even after Sessions’ directives last year, criminal immigration prosecutions continued to dwindle to less than half their peak of 95,000 cases in 2009. Sessions’ answer to that trend is to urge his U.S. attorneys to file more cases against people caught crossing for the first time ― people who could be summarily deported, without the cost of jailing them for a few days and hauling them before a U.S. magistrate judge. A conviction carries a maximum penalty of six months in prison, but in practice many people receive sentences ranging from time served to three months.","Arizona was the first federal district to follow Sessions’ guidance. Six weeks after last year’s memo, the federal courthouse in Tucson was packed with dozens of first-time offenders facing charges of illegal entry, ending a local policy in place for the last four years of generally limiting prosecution to people who had been caught crossing multiple times. The defendants received sentences of one to five days in jail before being deported.","And in the U.S. District Court for Southern California, where the number of immigration prosecutions had steadily dropped since 2012, those cases nearly doubled last year to 2,149 — despite the fact that illegal crossings through Southern California last year were the lowest on record since 1969. Those figures don’t include the number of pettier cases filed in magistrate court, where the number is also rising. Nationwide, misdemeanor illegal entry cases spiked 448 percent in February, compared to the year before.","Bridget Kennedy, who has worked as a federal public defender in San Diego for the last 10 years, described prosecutions of first-time border crosses as “unheard of” in her district before Sessions’ tenure. And she’s seen a further jump this month, coinciding with Sessions’ “zero tolerance” memo. Prosecutors are also showing less discretion to dismiss what she called “outlier” cases ― like when a defendant needs a hard-to-find interpreter for an indigenous language or has a strong asylum claim ― that were once routinely dropped.","“It is a lot of federal resources being put into a lot of low-level cases,” Kennedy told HuffPost. “It’s not only the numbers, but also the position that they can’t even dismiss the extreme outlier cases.”","Some observers praise Sessions’ commitment to immigration enforcement. Johnny Sutton, the former U.S. attorney for West Texas, credited a steady rise of immigration prosecutions under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama for the drop in illegal crossings.","“Frankly, I don’t think it changes much to what they’ve already been doing in Texas for a long time,” Sutton told HuffPost. “Me, personally, I would support what Sessions is proposing.”","But others who work within the system see Sessions’ efforts to double down on immigration enforcement as a strain on the limited resources of federal judiciary. The cost to prosecute people whom Border Patrol or ICE would likely deport anyway topped $1 billion annually for incarceration alone, according to a 2012 analysis published by Austin-based advocacy group Grassroots leadership. That figure doesn’t include all the other resources that DOJ has to muster to make these cases happen: judges, public defenders, prosecutors and U.S. Marshals.","“It’s a constant single-minded effort at the front end of the criminal justice system without regard for its impact on the rest,” Judge Bernardo Velasco, who presides over immigration prosecutions in Tucson, told HuffPost. “That’s the question that the Department of Justice never asks. In other words, if you’re going to do more of A, does that mean you want to do less of B and C? They never say that, but that’s the question that has to be asked.”","Still others wonder whether the Justice Department can easily change the course set by the George W. Bush administration and institutionalized by Obama ― with or without Sessions at the helm.","“Is it really Sessions as much as the interests that the whole system has in maintaining the investment on these cases?” Castillo, the Tucson attorney, said. “Everybody’s budget relies on keeping their numbers up.”","Doubling down on such small potatoes cases might make sense if the Justice Department did an effective job confronting more serious crimes. But its track record on more complex investigations doesn’t always inspire confidence.","Some 9 million Americans lost their homes in the aftermath of the 2007 housing and financial crisis. Despite widespread allegations that fraudulent and predatory behavior on the part of banks and peddlers of predatory mortgages drove that crisis, the Justice Department secured a conviction in only one major case against an investment banker.","That institutional failure wasn’t a fluke — it’s also a reflection of the Justice Department’s priorities. As the number of immigration prosecutions grew by a factor of 11 over the last two decades, the number of prosecutions for white-collar crime in federal court plummeted by 41 percent, according to data compiled by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University. The steady decline continued in 2017, Sessions’ first year as attorney general.","“DOJ’s real amnesty policy,” said Matt Stoller, a fellow with anti-monopolization nonprofit Open Markets Institute, “was for white-collar executives.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ae204602000002d00b8fc23.jpeg?ops=crop_0_237_4604_2657%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Scott Pruitt Faces New Accusations Of Ethical Lapses Over EPA’s Climate Rule Repeal","authors":"Alexander C.

The letter was signed by eight other states, the District of Columbia, one Florida county and five cities.","“The American people are entitled to an impartial decision-maker,” Becerra said in a statement. “EPA Administrator Pruitt simply cannot be that person. He must be recused from any involvement in the EPA’s attempt to repeal the Clean Power Plan.”","The EPA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","In his previous job as Oklahoma’s attorney general, Pruitt sued the agency more than a dozen times to block the Clean Power Plan, winning a historic stay in the Supreme Court in February 2016. The rule was left in limbo and, last October, Pruitt initiated the formal process to repeal it.","In January, California led the same coalition ― with Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, the District of Columbia, Florida’s Broward County, and the cities of Chicago, New York, Philadelphia, South Miami and Boulder, Colorado ― in filing a formal request calling for Pruitt’s recusal from the repeal effort, arguing that his leading role in the lawsuits that halted the Clean Power Plan made him biased in the new rulemaking process.","Since then, Pruitt has made at least three public remarks indicating he considers the repeal a foregone conclusion, suggesting the public comment period that ended Thursday ― a mandated part of the rulemaking process ― was for show. In comments detailed in the Thursday letter, Pruitt said the Clean Power Plan “is demonstrative of a violation of rule of law,” stated withdrawing the rule “is absolutely an important thing” and affirmed he is “getting rid of” the regulation.","“On January 9, 2018, we underscored that EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt could not reasonably claim to have an open mind on the Clean Power Plan and provided over 500 pages of evidence,” Becerra said. “We now have even more information that supports our case.”","The new complaint comes after a marathon day of back-to-back House hearings at which Pruitt deflected accusations of corruption, blaming his staff and what he called deceptive media reports for a whirlwind of scandals over the past four weeks. Pruitt admitted he authorized his chief of staff to grant raises to two longtime political aides after the White House rejected the request but denied understanding that a legal loophole was used when the EPA awarded the five-figure salary bumps. The affair became a flashpoint in the ongoing saga over Pruitt’s ethics after the administrator denied knowing about the raises in a tense Fox News interview.","Republicans at the hearings signaled strong support for Pruitt, and admonished Democrats for raising concerns over the ethical lapses. But at least five Republican members of Congress have joined 170 Democrats calling on the administrator to step down over the past month. This week, Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.), who considers Pruitt a friend and protégé, distanced himself from the administrator and said he would support a hearing before the powerful Senate Environment and Public Works Committee to investigate allegations of wrongdoing. On Monday, Bloomberg reported that the White House had begun urging Republicans to temper their defenses of Pruitt.","“As you know, there have been many press reports about problems at the EPA under your watch,” Rep. Pete Olson (R-Texas) said at the first of two hearings Thursday. “These problems cannot be solved by Congress and this committee .... The solution is between you and President Donald Trump.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ae24b5c2000004200b8fc75.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"COMEDY","headline":"Jimmy Kimmel Thinks He Knows Where Trump Finds His Cabinet Picks","authors":"Ron Dicker","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jimmy-kimmel-donald-trump-ronny-jackson_us_5ae1a5ace4b055fd7fc8a24b","short_description":"Just click for \"thousands of high-paying jobs you shouldn’t be within a 1,000 miles of.”","date":"2018-04-26"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"QUEER VOICES","headline":"Janelle Monáe Comes Out As Queer In Rolling Stone Interview","authors":"Curtis M.

All the Democrats on the committee supported the measure. They were joined by four Republicans: Sens. Lindsey Graham (S.C.), Jeff Flake (Ariz.), Thom Tillis (N.C.) and Chuck Grassley (Iowa), the chairman.","The vote sends a clear and bipartisan signal to the White House that at least some in Congress are prepared to act if Trump fires Mueller, who is leading an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and possible links between the Russian government and Trump’s campaign.","But as pointed out by Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), who opposed the measure, there are no plans to give the bill a vote on the Senate floor or in the House, and Trump would never sign it. So for now, at least, the vote is little more than symbolic.","Trump doesn’t have the authority to fire Mueller himself, but he could direct Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to do it (since Attorney General Jeff Sessions has recused himself from the case). In the meantime, the president has repeatedly and publicly harassed Mueller and questioned his probe, calling it a ”witch hunt,” a ”total witch hunt″ and illegal.","The bill, which has bipartisan authors, would mandate that a special counsel could be removed only by the attorney general or the most senior Senate-confirmed Justice Department official and could be removed only for “misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest or other good cause.”","It would also require the attorney general to provide written notice specifying the reason for removal and would allow the special counsel to challenge his or her removal within 10 days.","Most of Thursday’s hearing centered on a debate about the constitutionality of Congress’ curbing certain executive powers. Grassley acknowledged that he had “constitutional concerns” with the bill, but emphasized that “it’s clear that Congress has an oversight role to play” when it comes to how the executive branch wields its power.","“Our constitutional system, premised as it is on the separation of powers, cannot function unless Congress exercises robust oversight over the executive branch,” he said. “The Supreme Court has recognized as much.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ae1f4f21a00004400cdcf3e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"John Cena Is Charmingly Blunt About Split From Nikki Bella","authors":"Ron Dicker","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-cena-nikki-bella-sucks_us_5ae19713e4b04aa23f1fbb6f","short_description":"We couldn't have put it any better.","date":"2018-04-26"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"James Comey Is 'Embarrassed And Ashamed' Of The Republican Party","authors":"Nick Visser","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/james-comey-republicans-cnn-town-hall_us_5ae1388de4b04aa23f1f15c7","short_description":"\"What I hope they'll do is ask themselves, Republicans: 'So what will I tell my grandchildren?'\"","date":"2018-04-26"},"articleContent":["Former FBI Director James Comey said at a televised town hall Wednesday that he is “embarrassed and ashamed” of the Republican Party for abandoning the values he once took pride in.","“I was attracted by the notion that character matters and values matter most of all, that that’s where you start in evaluating a person, an entity, a country: What are their values. That’s non-negotiable,” Comey said at the CNN event at his alma mater, the College of William & Mary in Virginia.","Comey has conducted a range of interviews to tout the release of his new book, A Higher Loyalty, this month. CNN’s Anderson Cooper and students asked about a host of issues, including his firing, the moral fitness of President Donald Trump and his thought process regarding an investigation of Hillary Clinton ahead of the 2016 presidential election.","When asked by a young Republican student what first attracted him to the party and what conservatives could “rally around today,” Comey bluntly said he was no longer a Republican before questioning the motives of top lawmakers.","“Where is that commitment to character and values?” he said. “If people have convinced themselves that, well, we’ll trade it temporarily for a tax cut or a Supreme Court justice, as I say in the book, that’s a fool’s bargain, because those values are all you have.”","“There will always be another Supreme Court justice, always another tax bill. You lose this, exactly what are you?”","Comey said in 2016 that he was no longer a registered Republican after being one “for most of his adult life,” and earlier this month he said on an ABC News podcast that Republicans “don’t represent anything I believe in.”","“I see the Republican Party, as near as I can tell, reflects now entirely Donald Trump’s values,” Comey said on ABC’s “Start Here.” “It doesn’t reflect values at all. It’s transactional, it’s ego-driven, it’s in service to his ego. And it’s, I think, consoling itself that we’re going to achieve important policy goals ― a tax cut or something.”","On Wednesday, he questioned what legacy Republicans hoped to leave behind.","“What I hope they’ll do is ask themselves, Republicans: ‘So what will I tell my grandchildren when they ask me so what did you do?

Povich","Starting in fall 2019, students at Ohio’s Sinclair Community College will be able to enroll in a four-year degree program in unmanned aerial systems, also known as drones.","They’ll learn mission planning, maintenance, laws, data analytics and more. Working on drones is a new field, and the college is eager to expand its program to meet the growing demand for graduates.","Just up the road, Youngstown State University offers a somewhat similar four-year degree, in mechanical engineering technology — but tuition there is double Sinclair’s.","Sinclair is one of a growing number of community colleges that have embraced the practice of two-year schools conferring four-year degrees. As college costs rise and state officials look to accommodate nontraditional and low-income students, more are turning to community colleges to develop programs for industries with a lot of need — sometimes irking officials at four-year universities in the process.","About 90 two-year colleges are offering about 900 baccalaureate programs across the country, according to Beth Hagan, executive director of the Community College Baccalaureate Association, a Florida-based trade association.","But officials at four-year universities are balking at what they see as community colleges encroaching on their turf, and competing for scarce resources from the state. Many officials would rather partner with the two-year schools than compete with them.","Ohio is one of 19 states that allow at least one two-year college to offer a four-year degree, and a half-dozen states could be moving in the same direction. Most community colleges in those states can offer only baccalaureate programs that are narrowly tailored, rather than offering many programs across a wide swath of disciplines. The community colleges still offer associate degrees and other certificates to students who want to complete their studies in two years, but those who want a bachelor’s degree stay for four.","“These are very much niche degrees when there is a local workforce need,” Hagan said, “either for skills that need specific training and require a bachelor’s degree, or for someone who has those skills and wants to advance into a supervisory level.”","“These are people who can’t leave their families, or their jobs … to go away to university and get a degree,” she said. “Some are younger students who live with their families in a culture that’s not conducive to going away.”","Despite limits on what they can offer, some two-year schools are offering baccalaureate programs that officials at four-year schools see as competition. Their programs are commonly found at four-year colleges and universities, ranging from nursing and education to information technology and human resources management.","In California, 15 community colleges offer bachelor’s degrees in health and technology subjects such as biomanufacturing and health information management. In Georgia, students at two-year schools can get their bachelor’s in nonprofit management and respiratory therapy.","One California student, Elvia Esquer, is a mother of two college-age children who has worked as a medical coder for 22 years near her home in San Diego. She is going to a community college, San Diego Mesa College, to get her bachelor’s in health information management. She hopes the new degree, which she is set to receive in May, will help her move into a management position.","One of Esquer’s children also attends San Diego Mesa, and the other goes to a different community college. Her husband is a bus driver, and she said cost was the most important factor in her choosing San Diego Mesa over the closest four-year school, Loma Linda University.","“This is a big deal for our family,” she said. “I’ve been encouraging my kids to go to school, and I was encouraged by my father, who passed away. Education is the key to success. That’s why it’s a big deal.”","She said she will have spent about $2,000 a year to go to the community college. Tuition and fees at Loma Linda cost more than $33,000 a year, according to College Factual, a website that tracks college costs.","Tuition at San Diego Mesa was also a factor for Linda Bredeson — but so was the commute. Bredeson, 34, works at a hospital about a 20-minute drive from her home in San Diego. School is 10 minutes from work. Getting to Loma Linda, she said, would take 90 minutes.","“It’s a hop and a skip away, which makes going to school very easy,” Bredeson said, adding that she has gained confidence simply by attending the classes, and got a promotion in January.","In Ohio, Republican Gov. John Kasich’s fiscal 2018 budget has cleared the way for two-year colleges to offer four-year degrees. The governor has long advocated conferring four-year degrees at community colleges as a low-cost pathway to a higher degree.","“Community colleges are doing this to serve the students-and-employers community we serve now,” said Adam Murka, chief of staff for Sinclair Community College in Dayton. “We are not trying to be universities.”","Murka pointed out that the Ohio Department of Higher Education had to approve the school’s application to confer four-year degrees, and that one requirement was that the degree was not already available at other institutions in the state. The drone degree fits that description, he said.","The Youngstown State degree, by comparison, is broader. “The bottom line is there is nowhere else in Ohio where you can get this degree,” Murka said. “This is an area of local economic importance. It’s an area of tremendous growth over the coming decades.”","But representatives of universities say there’s more to a traditional four-year college education than a diploma, and they don’t welcome the competition.","“We live in a state with limited resources for higher education,” Youngstown State’s provost, Martin Abraham, said. “We’re continuously cutting back — not increasing funding — for higher ed. It doesn’t make a lot of sense to set up a competing system for the same set of funds.”","While the Sinclair program may not compete directly with Youngstown State, Abraham said the four-year school has a mechanical engineering technology degree that provides similar training. Purdue University, in nearby Indiana, also has a degree in drones.","Average in-state tuition at a four-year public college in Ohio was close to $7,000 for the 2016-17 school year, according to CollegeCalc, a website that compares college costs using Department of Education data. Sinclair averaged just above $3,000, while Youngstown State came in close to $8,000.","“There’s a reason the tuition structure is different at a four-year university versus a two-year university,” Abraham said. For example, he said, Youngstown State’s career fair attracts 70 companies to campus every year.","“That’s economy of scale. It drives up the cost of our education, but it also provides significant value to our students that is not easily replicated on a community college campus offering one or two baccalaureate degrees.”","And C. Todd Jones, president and general counsel of the Association of Independent Colleges and Universities of Ohio, said the argument that baccalaureate degrees are unaffordable is a “red herring.”","“Financial assistance makes degrees affordable, particularly for low-income individuals in our state,” he said. There’s no reason in terms of costs for creating a community college baccalaureate degree, he said.","The debate played out in testimony this year to the Ohio Department of Higher Education. Representatives from the four-year schools succeeded in removing a passage from a new regulation that would have allowed two-year institutions to teach the same courses that are taught at four-year institutions, with the department’s permission.","For students, there are pros and cons to getting a bachelor’s degree from a community college, according to the Community College Review, which follows issues related to two-year colleges. On the plus side, in addition to lower cost, students have the flexibility of studying closer to home and avoiding housing costs, while tailoring their course schedules to their work and home schedules. On the negative side, courses of study at community colleges are limited, and some schools have outdated equipment.","In California, legislators will decide this year whether to renew or extend a 2016 pilot program that offers a handful of bachelor’s degrees in subjects such as airframe manufacturing and respiratory care at community colleges.","Students have been enrolling in the degree programs, a 2017 report from California’s Legislative Analyst’s Office found, but there is not enough data such as graduation rates with which to evaluate the program.","Some state lawmakers would like to see the program expanded. Democratic state Sen. Jerry Hill, who authored the legislation to start the pilot program, said four-year institutions are often not within commuting distance of the students who would potentially enroll in these kinds of programs.","“Education should be convenient,” he said. Or students “won’t participate and at the end of the day won’t be educated enough to meet the needs of the state and their need for a good-paying job.”","Community colleges could help graduate more low-income and minority students. Forty percent of students at state community colleges, where low-income and underrepresented students are more likely to enroll, transfer to four-year colleges, according to a report by the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California. “The central challenge,” the report said, “is to improve pathways through college.”","Hill maintains his legislation will help to do that by bringing baccalaureate options to students where they are — in their communities. Other arguments, he said, amount to an academic “turf war and nothing else.”","Stateline home page","Sign up for exclusive state policy reporting and research"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ae1de212000001900b8fbe3.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"MEDIA","headline":"Gretchen Carlson Wants To Spotlight Comebacks By Victims, Not Sexual Harassers","authors":"Emily Peck","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gretchen-carlson-sexual-abuse-victims_us_5ae1d4e2e4b04aa23f2047e2","short_description":"\"Those stories are a slap in the face to all the women who have lost their careers,” the former Fox News anchor says.","date":"2018-04-26"},"articleContent":["It’s hard to find a woman who accused of a man of sexual harassment and then carried on with her life and career as normal. Think Anita Hill, or the actresses who rejected or complained about Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, or the untold numbers of women who speak up about discrimination and wind up fired from their jobs, or blackballed from entire industries.","But on Monday, former Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson did just that; she announced her own comeback. Carlson plans to host a new documentary series, set to air on the A&E network, focused on telling stories about workplace sexual harassment.","The move marks her first return to TV since former Fox chairman Roger Ailes forced her out of the network in 2016, after Carlson rebuffed his sexual advances and complained about sex discrimination.","Even as an increasing number of media outlets devote stories to the potential redemption of the many prominent men who’ve been accused of sexual harassment in this Me Too moment, Carlson’s comeback is a poignant reminder of the careers that truly are ruined when sexual harassment is allowed to flourish. Typically, it’s the victims of harassment who vanish.","Focusing on the men is a “slap in the face,” Carlson told HuffPost in a phone interview on Wednesday.","Carlson filed suit against Ailes nearly two years ago, before the hashtag Me Too was a phenomenon. She triumphed. Ailes was ousted from the network he helped found, though with a $40 million exit package. She walked away with a $20 million settlement. Many more women at Fox soon came forward with their own stories.","Since then Carlson’s become an activist on sexual harassment, lobbying Congress on legislation, speaking at conferences and writing a book called “Be Fierce,” published last fall.","She spoke with HuffPost about her comeback, the future of Me Too and another new project she launched this week with the nonprofit March of Dimes called Gretchen Carlson Advocacy Fellows, which broadens her recent focus from sexual harassment to a wider range of women’s issues, including racial disparities in maternal and infant health, maternity leave and post-partum support.","You’ve written about how women are permanently sidelined from their careers after speaking up about harassment. Is coming back to TV particularly meaningful for you?","Yes. 100 percent. I wanted to be able to go back to my passion and what I worked so hard on for 27 years of my life. I want to be an example to thousands and maybe many millions who have lost their professions for having the courage to talk about harassment.","Of the thousands of women who reached out to me [with their stories of harassment], 99 percent of them were never afforded the opportunity to work in their chosen profession again. It’s outrageous on its face. I want to make sure I’m sending a message of hope to other women that they too can make comebacks.","What do you make of the recent rash of media stories about harassers ability to comeback?","Those stories are a slap in the face to all the women who have lost their careers as a result of doing nothing wrong except having the bravery to come forward. I’m not sure there is even evidence that these men are making a comeback.","Even writing the [comeback] story perpetuates the idea that harassing is not that big of a deal. We should write stories about all the women who haven’t been able to go back and imagine how brave it would be for those companies to hire some women to come back. That would be a good story.","What do you think is next for Me Too?","It’s one thing to talk about the famous people, those stories attract a lot of attention. Harassment is an epidemic everywhere, not just with famous people.","I feel like we’ve come to the far end of the tipping point when we focus on everyday-women ― members of military, police, teachers. I want to make sure I give them a mouthpiece. My first special for A&E will focus on these women.","How has your tolerance for “harmless” sexism changed over the years? In your book you speak of the “drip, drip of misogyny” being like torture. On Fox and Friends your co-hosts were often incredibly sexist and you managed to handle it with grace.","I can’t talk about Fox [editor’s note: her settlement with the network prohibits it], but you iterated what was happening. My hope is that women have been empowered to not just sit there and take it. Women are seeing that their voice matters. They’re mobilizing and standing up and saying not so fast. So yeah, I do think millions of women have felt empowered to not just sit there and take it.","I’d make the argument that part of this entire movement has trickled down to the effect we’ve seen with the Parkland high school students.","Even with all these women speaking up, and the Me Too movement catching on, we still have an accused harasser sitting in the Oval Office. Is that disheartening?","I get asked that at every single event that I do. A lot of people are feeling disconnected on that.","Do you think there’s a bit of fatigue with hearing from victims?","I don’t feel that way. I’m of the opinion that we can’t put the genie back in the bottle. There’s been massive progress ― a cultural revolution.","If you look at how I was treated and what happened to me a mere 21 months ago and you look at how that changed in just a year-and-a-half, from women not being believed to omigosh, now we actually believe women. Men not being immediately fired to now harassers being fired. Men not issuing apologies, to on the same day they’re issuing apologies.

Paul Tonko (D-N.Y.). “I was not aware of the amount, nor was I aware of the bypassing or the [White House Office of Presidential Personnel] process not being respected.”","He reiterated the statement in the second hearing later in the afternoon, and insisted he canceled the raises and resubmitted the requests to the White House.","That was the extent of Pruitt’s acknowledgement of any wrongdoing. The hearings ― one before the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, the other in front of the House Committee on Appropriations ― cap a month of mounting calls for Pruitt to step down.","Over the course of the first nearly four-hour hearing, the administrator defiantly blamed the media for his mounting ethics scandals. He repeatedly deflected Democrats’ questions about the lapses and proposals to dramatically weaken public health regulations, ducking yes-or-no inquiries with a verbose torrent of legalese.","“I recognize there have been some very troubling media reports over the past few weeks,” Pruitt said in opening remarks repeated at both hearings. “A lie does not become truth just because it appears on the front page of the newspaper.”","Asked about a proposal to dramatically limit the public health research EPA can use to write regulations, disqualifying the sort of epidemiological pollution studies that undergird federal air pollution rules, Pruitt deployed canned statements to defend what he called “transparency” measures. Asked if he had anything to say to the families of people who died inhaling the toxic paint stripper methylene chloride, Pruitt said he hadn’t made a decision yet on a ban. Asked about his security guard moonlighting for the tabloid publisher who paid to cover up stories about President Donald Trump’s reported extramarital affairs, Pruitt said he “was not aware of that outside contract, and it’s being reviewed.”","Republicans at the first hearing were swift to defend the administrator.","“I apologize for the abrasiveness of some of my colleagues who would rather tarnish your reputation than address the problems facing the nation,” said Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.).","Rep. David McKinley (R-W.Va.) admonished Democrats for a “classic display of innuendo and McCarthyism.”","“I hope that we can stay on policy and talk about some of the progress that’s been made,” McKinley said, “because I think that it’s been good for the environment.”","Rep. Bill Johnson (R-Ohio) dismissed questions into Pruitt’s mounting ethics scandals as “a personal attack” and “a shameful attempt to denigrate the work that’s being done at the EPA.”","Rep. Joe Barton (R-Texas) described Pruitt as “a victim of ... Washington politics.” He lauded Pruitt’s efforts against “radical clean air policies,” and pointed out that the administrator’s penchant for first-class flights “may look bad,” but “it’s not illegal.” The EPA chief hadn’t done anything like renting “a party jet,” he noted.","Rep. Kathy Castor (D-Fla.) criticized Republicans for refusing to take the committee’s oversight duties seriously.","“It’s embarrassing,” she said.","In a stunning rebuke of his critics, Pruitt made no direct mention of the growing heap of corruption accusations against him in his prepared testimony, and again cast blame on his staff for the whirlwind of ethical lapses that triggered 10 federal investigations over the past month.","“I am not afraid to admit there’s been a learning process,” Pruitt said in an unscripted comment during his opening remarks.","Pruitt has faced criticism for months over his spending on first-class flights, seemingly in violation of federal rules, which he justified as a safety measure to avoid passengers in coach who might accost the administrator over his controversial deregulatory agenda.","But, in late March, details emerged about a $50-a-night luxury Capitol Hill condo Pruitt rented from an energy lobbyist with business before the EPA. That scandal quickly cascaded into more than two dozen more as new reports revealed shady real estate deals in Oklahoma, use of multiple email accounts, and a tyrannical management style in which EPA staffers who questioned Pruitt’s actions were fired or pushed out.","A New York Times story published April 5, detailing how five EPA employees were sidelined after raising concerns about Pruitt’s spending, became a flashpoint at the first hearing.","Asked about the article by Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), Pruitt said he didn’t remember the incident, kicking off a testy exchange.","“I don’t ever recall a conversation to that end,” Pruitt said.","Pallone responded: “I’ll take that as a yes.”","“You shouldn’t take that as a yes,” Pruitt said.","Despite regaling what he called a “bloodsport” of going after any Republican who supports the president, Rep. Gregg Harper (R-Miss.) asked later in the hearing how the EPA investigated allegations such as those made in the Times story.","“There’s no truth to the assertion,” Pruitt said. “I’m not aware of that ever happening.”","The EPA’s notoriously hostile press office cast doubt over many of the reports, suggesting political motivations. But, earlier this month, a former top staffer to Pruitt, who described himself as a lifelong Republican and former Trump aide, detailed “unethical and potentially illegal” activities to top Democrats leading an investigation. Four days later, the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office issued a report finding EPA spending on a $43,000 soundproof phone booth for Pruitt broke the law.","Pruitt blamed career staff for taking “the process all the way through.”","“If I had known about it,” Pruitt said, “I would have refused it.”","Trump for weeks projected strong support for Pruitt. But Bloomberg reported on Monday that the White House had begun urging Republicans to temper their defenses of the embattled administrator.","At least five Republicans members of Congress have joined 170 Democrats calling for Pruitt’s departure.

At the start of the month, Pruitt, flanked by auto executives, announced plans to gut a landmark Obama-era rule tightening fuel standards on vehicles, effectively weakening the only major federal policy remaining to reduce planet-warming emissions from the nation’s top source of greenhouse gas pollution. On Tuesday, Pruitt proposed the new “transparency” rule, which former tobacco industry lobbyists hailed as a victory."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ae203641e00002c008e3b95.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"COMEDY","headline":"Colbert Nails Exactly Why Trump Is Sticking With His 'Candyman' White House Doc","authors":"Ed Mazza","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/stephen-colbert-ronny-jackson-donald-trump_us_5ae12533e4b02baed1b626b6","short_description":"\"Late Show\" host thinks they might have something in common.","date":"2018-04-26"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Avicii's Family Releases Statement Saying The DJ 'Could Not Go On Any Longer'","authors":"Carly Ledbetter","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/avicii-death-family-statement_us_5ae1f324e4b02baed1b7d3a5","short_description":"The \"Wake Me Up\" artist died last week at 28 years old.","date":"2018-04-26"},"articleContent":["Avicii’s family released a second statement on Thursday regarding the death of the famed DJ, whose real name is Tim Bergling.

We deserve the room to grow beyond our past. But these allegations are serious enough that they deserve a full examination.”","Shachtman’s announcement follows Reid’s insistence that new screenshots of anti-gay posts shared on the now-defunct Reid Report were the result of a cyberattack.","Reid apologized in December for writing homophobic posts about then-Florida Gov. Charlie Crist (R) between 2007 and 2009 after Twitter user @Jamie_Maz shared screenshots of those posts.\n\nLast week, @Jamie_Maz tweeted dozens more screenshots, also allegedly from Reid’s old blog, that included statements such as “most straight people cringe at the sight of two men kissing” and “adult gay men tend to be attracted to very young, post-pubescent types.”","This time around, Reid has vehemently denied writing the posts, contending that her blog was hacked. But as HuffPost reported, only a pretty bizarre course of events would have led to the allegedly fraudulent posts.\n\nReid’s attorney, John H. Reichman, said in a statement Wednesday that the FBI had opened an investigation into the alleged hacking.\n\n“We have received confirmation the FBI has opened an investigation into potential criminal activities surrounding several online accounts, including personal email and blog accounts, belonging to Joy-Ann Reid,” Reichman said. “Our own investigation and monitoring of the situation will continue in parallel, and we are cooperating with law enforcement as their investigation proceeds.”\n\nOn Thursday night, The Daily Beast published a report on the hacking claims made by Reid’s cybersecurity consultant, Jonathan Nichols. Like HuffPost, Poulsen determined Nichols’ “evidence” of the alleged hacking didn’t hold much water.\n\nReid “says a cybersecurity consultant has proof that her old blog has been hacked,” Poulsen wrote. “But that consultant, Jonathan Nichols, had trouble producing the promised evidence. And what he did produce failed to withstand scrutiny, according to a Daily Beast analysis.”\n\nReid dropped out of a panel she was slated to moderate in New York City on Thursday. She informed event organizers on Wednesday night that she would need to withdraw from the CAFE Change Summit, sources close to the event confirmed to HuffPost.\n\nThe Change Summit was organized by former U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara and his media venture CAFE.

Cyrus Habib, according to BuzzFeed.\n\nA representative for Reid declined to comment on Reid’s withdrawal from the Change Summit and the suspension of her Daily Beast column.\n\nThe LGBTQ advocacy organization PFLAG announced Tuesday that it was rescinding its Straight for Equality in Media award to Reid in light of the “ongoing investigation” into her blog posts.\n\nThe story has been updated with The Daily Beast’s decision on Reid’s column, the results of the outlet’s investigation and her attorney’s statement."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ae1db9d2000004200b8fbdc.jpeg?cache=OsnhTliOtx&ops=crop_17_163_1976_1166%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"CRIME","headline":"Patton Oswalt Celebrates Michelle McNamara's Legacy After Arrest In 'Golden State Killer' Case","authors":"Sara Boboltz","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/patton-oswalt-michelle-mcnamara-golden-state-killer-arrested_us_5ae0ec52e4b055fd7fc79205","short_description":"“I think you got him, Michelle.\"","date":"2018-04-26"},"articleContent":["Tuesday night, Patton Oswalt joined the family of his late wife, crime writer Michelle McNamara, at a promotional event north of Chicago to promote I’ll Be Gone in the Dark, a new book about McNamara’s scrupulous hunt for a serial killer who terrorized California in the late 1970s and early 1980s.","“He’s running out of time,” the comedian recalled saying.","Hours later, his line read as prophecy.

It was Ryan’s.","“As you have requested, I hereby offer my resignation as the 60th Chaplain of the United States House of Representatives,” reads Conroy’s letter to Ryan, dated April 15. Conroy, who has been the chaplain since 2011, will officially resign on May 24.","The Hill reported that four different sources ― two Democrats and two Republicans ― said Conroy was told he had to quit or he would be fired. There’s been no reason given for why he was let go, but Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.) tells HuffPost that his GOP colleagues have pointed him to a prayer that Conroy made on the House floor last fall amid the debate on the GOP tax bill.","Here’s that Nov. 6 prayer, in which Conroy wishes for no “winners and losers” under the legislation. As has been reported, the tax bill greatly benefits the rich over time.","PRAYER\n\nThe Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following prayer:\n\nGod of the universe, we give You thanks for giving us another day. Bless the Members of this assembly as they set upon the work of these hours, of these days. Help them to make wise decisions in a good manner and to carry their responsibilities steadily, with high hopes for a better future for our great Nation.\n\nAs legislation on taxes continues to be debated this week and next, may all Members be mindful that the institutions and structures of our great Nation guarantee the opportunities that have allowed some to achieve great success, while others continue to struggle. May their efforts these days guarantee that there are not winners and losers under new tax laws, but benefits balanced and shared by all Americans.\n\nMay Your blessing, O God, be with them and with us all this day and every day to come, and may all we do be done for Your greater honor and glory.\n\nAmen.","Connolly said Republican lawmakers told him Ryan was peeved because he read that prayer as a “tilt to the Democrats” because it implied criticisms of the tax cuts being more beneficial to the rich (which they are).","“I am informed reliably by my Republican friends about this,” said the Virginia Democrat. “They cite that as evidence as that being more political than he’s comfortable with.”","Another Democratic source familiar with the situation said “several lawmakers” relayed to him that Ryan’s decision was driven by the prayer.","The speaker’s office denied that Conroy was forced out over a specific prayer, but would not clarify if the chaplain’s prayers during the tax debate were related to his termination. The office also gave no reason for Conroy’s termination.","“The speaker consulted with the minority leader, but the decision was his,” said Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong. “He remains grateful for Father Conroy’s service.”","During their Thursday caucus meeting, Connolly said Democrats were “stunned” to learn Conroy had been forced out. The reaction quickly turned to outrage, he said, and that spurred him to write a letter to Ryan demanding details on why the chaplain was let go.","He is starting to collect signatures for it, but it’s already got fellow Catholic Reps. Walter Jones (R-N.C.), Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio) and Carol Shea-Porter (D-N.H.) on it.","Here’s a copy:","Rep. Bill Keating (D-Mass.) told HuffPost that he talked to GOP lawmakers who were “shocked” to hear Conroy was forced out, too. Before Thursday, many in both parties thought Conroy had chosen to leave.","“I happen to know some Republican members not happy with this,” he said.","Keating said that he, too, heard that it may go back to Conroy’s prayer during the tax debate, but wasn’t sure if that was true.","“It’s mind-boggling if that’s part of it,” he said. “The prayer is actually a call for fairness.”","Ultimately, nobody can say for sure why Ryan decided to fire the chaplain. But absent any information, Connolly said, it can lead to ugly guesses.","“We’re all left to speculate this is political or bigoted or personal,” he said. “You can’t do this in the dead of night without risking that.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ae226be1a00004300cdcf90.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"CRIME","headline":"Bill Cosby Found Guilty In Sexual Assault Retrial","authors":"Alanna Vagianos","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bill-cosby-found-guilty-on-all-counts-in-sexual-assault-retrial_us_5adf7c79e4b061c0bfa274b3","short_description":"The 80-year-old comedian was accused of drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand in 2004.","date":"2018-04-26"},"articleContent":["Comedian Bill Cosby was found guilty on Thursday on three felony counts of aggravated indecent assault by a Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, jury.","Cosby, 80, was retried on three felony counts of aggravated indecent assault for drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand in 2004. Constand, 44, was a former women’s basketball coach at Temple University where Cosby was a trustee and major donor during the time he assaulted her.","“This is an extraordinary case to have jury service,” Judge Steven O’Neill told the jurors after announcing the verdict. “You have sacrificed much, but you have sacrificed in the service of justice.”","A sentencing date for the comedian has not been set. Each count of felony aggravated indecent assault carries a sentence of five to 10 years. The maximum Cosby could be sentenced to is 30 years, though it could be as little as five.","According to reports, people in the courtroom gasped as the guilty verdict was handed down. Lili Bernard, who was allegedly assaulted by Cosby, and her friend Caroline Heldman fled the courtroom in tears, hugging one another.","Cosby lashed out at prosecutors after they requested to revoke his bail, with District Attorney Kevin Steele pointing out that Cosby owns a plane. The comedian reportedly shouted in response: “He doesn’t have a plane, you asshole!”","Constand was seen hugging friends and family and smiling as she walked out of the courtroom. Cosby exited the courtroom swiftly, holding onto the arm of his spokesman, Andrew Wyatt.","A few of Cosby’s accusers spoke at a news conference after the guilty verdict was handed down.","“It is a victory for womanhood,” said Bernard, an accuser and former actress on “The Cosby Show.” “It is a victory for all sexual assault survivors, female and male.”","Another accuser, Janice Baker-Kinney, said she felt “vindicated.”","“We are vindicated, we are validated and we are now part of the tsunami of women’s power and justice,” she said. “We are not shutting up and we’re not going away. Get over it!”","Attorney Gloria Allred, who represents 33 of Cosby’s accusers, also spoke after the trial.","“We are so happy that finally we can say that women are believed and not only on hashtag MeToo, but in a court of law where they were under oath, where they testified truthfully, where they were attacked, where they were smeared, where they were denigrated, where there were attempts to discredit them,” Allred said. “When all is said and done: Women were finally believed.”","Allred read a statement on behalf of one of the witnesses, Chelan Lasha, whose testimony was used as evidence of Cosby’s prior bad acts to establish a pattern of behavior. “Thirty-two years of nightmares and tears are over,” Lasha’s statement said.","Cosby’s attorney Tom Mesereau said the defense team is “very disappointed” by the verdict, adding that “the fight is not over.” He said Cosby’s defense team plans to appeal the verdict.","In June of last year, a jury failed to reach a unanimous decision on the charges and the judge declared a mistrial. Cosby reportedly paid Constand $3.4 million in a civil lawsuit settlement in 2006.","The Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network released a statement applauding the jury’s decision.","“RAINN is pleased with the jury’s decision in this case. There are many forces that discourage victims from reporting these crimes,” RAINN President Scott Berkowitz said. “Let’s hope the legacy of this case is that victims feel empowered to come forward, knowing that it can truly make a difference in bringing perpetrators to justice.”","“[R]emember this case is about trust, betrayal and the inability to consent,” Assistant District Attorney Kristen Feden said in her closing arguments on Tuesday, according to Deadline.","Assistant District Attorney M. Stewart Ryan added during his closing arguments that “it is time for each and every one of you to stand with Andrea Constand and tell the truth about what he did.”","Throughout the prosecution’s closing arguments, Cosby was reportedly smiling. Feden called out the comedian’s smirks during her closing arguments.","“He’s laughing like it’s funny,” Feden said. “But there’s absolutely nothing funny about them being stripped of their capacity to consent.”","In the defense’s closing arguments, Cosby’s attorneys attempted to sway the jury by blaming the recent Me Too movement.","“When you join a movement based primarily on emotion and anger, you don’t change a damned thing, which is why each single case must be examined on its merits. All of the evidence must be weighed,” defense attorney Kathleen Bliss said, according to ABC News.","“Yes, we do have to deal with sexual assault. We do. It’s a worldwide problem,” Bliss continued. “But questioning an accuser is not shaming a victim. Gut feelings are not rational decisions. Mob rule is not due process, and just as we have had horrible, horrible crimes in our history, we’ve also had horrible, horrible periods of time where emotion and hatred and fear overwhelmed us: witch hunts, lynchings, McCarthyism.”","This trial was slightly different from last year’s because O’Neill allowed five additional accusers to testify, as their stories closely resembled the claims made by Constand. Their testimonies were used as evidence of Cosby’s prior bad acts and allowed the prosecution to show a pattern of predatory behavior by Cosby.","The five other accusers who testified were former supermodel Janice Dickinson, Heidi Thomas, Lise-Lotte Lublin, Baker-Kinney and Lasha.","Dickinson testified that Cosby drugged and raped her after the two had dinner at a Lake Tahoe, California, hotel.","“Here was ‘America’s Dad’ on top of me ― a happily married man with five children. And I remember thinking how wrong it was ― how very, very wrong,” she testified, adding later that she wanted to “punch him in the face.”","Cosby’s lawyers unsuccessfully sought a mistrial during the hearing. On April 11, a visibly emotional Lasha took the stand to testify that Cosby had drugged and assaulted her in Las Vegas, Nevada, in 1986 when she was 17 years old.","As the courtroom was being dismissed for a lunch break after Lasha’s testimony, Lasha looked at Cosby and said, “You know what you did” or “You remember, don’t you, Mr. Cosby?” according to various reports. O’Neill denied the defense’s mistrial request.","Warning: The image below contains nudity.","The three-week trial was the first high-profile sexual assault case in the Me Too era and tensions were high. Dozens of protestors flocked to the Pennsylvania courtroom outside of Philadelphia.","One protestor named Nicolle Rochelle, who appeared on “The Cosby Show” in the 1990s, lunged at Cosby outside of the courtroom on the first day of the trial. Rochelle was topless and had the names of Cosby’s alleged victims written all over her body, with the words “women’s lives matter” written on her chest.","“He’s a man who’s disempowered women’s bodies for decades. It doesn’t seem to be recognized,” Rochelle told People at the time. “The case is being publicized with this narrative of race. He’s being painted as the victim. I wanted to emphasize that this is about rape. I wanted to make him uncomfortable and to make people think about women’s bodies.”\n\nOther demonstrators protested in support of Cosby, claiming the entertainer is innocent. One protester passed out fliers at the courthouse throughout the trial that warned of “mass demonstrations” if Cosby is convicted.","More than 50 women have accused the veteran entertainer of sexual assault, with many saying he drugged and raped them.","This is a developing story.

Charlie Crist (D) between 2007 and 2009 after Twitter user @Jamie_Maz shared screenshots of the posts.","Last week, @Jamie_Maz tweeted dozens more screenshots, also allegedly from Reid’s old blog, that included statements such as “most straight people cringe at the sight of two men kissing” and “adult gay men tend to be attracted to very young, post-pubescent types.”","Yet this time around, Reid has steadfastly denied writing the posts. She released the following statement to Mediaite on Monday:","In December I learned that an unknown, external party accessed and manipulated material from my now-defunct blog, The Reid Report, to include offensive and hateful references that are fabricated and run counter to my personal beliefs and ideology.\n\nI began working with a cyber-security expert who first identified the unauthorized activity, and we notified federal law enforcement officials of the breach. The manipulated material seems to be part of an effort to taint my character with false information by distorting a blog that ended a decade ago.\n\nNow that the site has been compromised I can state unequivocally that it does not represent the original entries. I hope that whoever corrupted the site recognizes the pain they have caused, not just to me, but to my family and communities that I care deeply about: LGBTQ, immigrants, people of color and other marginalized groups.","This statement raises a number of questions, however. To accept Reid’s hacking claim at face value, you would also need to explain at least some of the following:","1.) Why would someone hack Joy Reid’s blog repeatedly for years, at a time when she had a much lower profile?","The screenshots circulated this week were allegedly captured using Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine, an expansive digital library that archives sites in real time so people can continue to access the pages. HuffPost confirmed several of the alleged posts captured in the screenshots could be found on Wayback Machine.","Jonathan Nichols, a cybersecurity consultant hired by Reid, said in a statement Monday that “fabricated” posts were not a result of a cyberattack against Wayback Machine, but against The Reid Report.","Since Wayback Machine captures sites in real time, this means someone would have had to hack Reid’s blog numerous times between 2005 and 2009. If someone hacked her blog recently and attempted to change the timestamps to a previous year, Wayback Machine would still archive the posts according to the date they were actually hacked.","Nichols confirmed to HuffPost that he believes the blog was hacked in that period, but would not say exactly when. He later told HuffPost the recent screenshots themselves could also have been manipulated ― a separate issue from the alleged blog hacking. (More on that to come).","It’s unclear who would repeatedly target Reid in the mid-to-late-2000s, more than a decade before she rose to national fame with MSNBC. Reid’s Wikipedia page wasn’t even created until 2014.","2.) Why didn’t Reid notice that someone else was posting content under her name on her own blog?","Reid and Nichols both claim her blog was repeatedly hacked in the mid-2000s ― and yet the journalist apparently never noticed until December 2017.","“I don’t think that’s too much of a stretch,” Nichols told HuffPost. “Why would anyone go back to their own blog to check to see if what they posted was authentic?”","For example, an allegedly fraudulent post was added on March 7, 2005. On March 9, 2005, Reid published a post that has not been called into question. Wouldn’t the supposedly unfamiliar post have caught her eye when she added the next one?","Nichols also argued that the lack of comments on the disputed posts suggests the blog was hacked. But there don’t appear to be any comments on most of the posts from the mid-2000s.","3.) Are the bigoted statements really such a departure from the statements Reid has already owned up to?","Reid took responsibility in December for writing the homophobic statements captured in the screenshots @Jamie_Maz initially shared. In the several posts dated between 2007 and 2009, she accused Crist of being a closeted gay man and mocked him by calling him “Miss Charlie.”","“It was insensitive, tone-deaf and dumb,” Reid wrote in her apology statement. “There is no excusing it — not based on the taste-skewing mores of talk radio or the then-blogosphere, and not based on my intentions.”","Reid’s Twitter profile has been a platform for insensitive comments toward gay people in the past:","The more recent screenshots @Jamie_Maz shared don’t sound very different from what Reid has already admitted she wrote.","“Does that make me homophobic? Probably,” Reid allegedly wrote about her disinterest in seeing “Brokeback Mountain” in a newly released but disputed post from 2007. “For the record, I’m sure gay people think straight sex is gross, too, it’s just that the nature of political correctness is that gay people are allowed to say straight sex is gross, but the reverse is considered to be patently homophobic.”","4.) Are the screenshots fake, or was the blog hacked?","Nichols’ position about the authenticity of the screenshotted posts ― whether they were forged or genuine screenshots from Reid’s hacked site ― isn’t clear.","“We have significant evidence indicating that not only was Ms. Reid’s old blog compromised, some of the recently circulated posts were not even on the site at any time, suggesting that these instances may be the result of screenshot manipulation with the intent to tarnish Ms. Reid’s character,” Nichols wrote in his statement Tuesday.","@Jamie_Maz has repeatedly denied altering the screenshots, aside from underlining statements in red to highlight specific statements.","In his statement Tuesday, Nichols also discussed these same posts as if they had truly appeared on the site: “Oddly, there were no responses in the comments section of the entries, despite the inflammatory nature of the posts. If those posts were real, they would have undoubtedly elicited responses from Ms. Reid’s base.”","Nichols told HuffPost on Wednesday that most of the recent screenshots @Jamie_Maz shared have been manipulated to appear as though they were captured from Reid’s blog, but had never existed on the blog before or after it was hacked.","However, HuffPost was able to find many of the posts in the Wayback Machine archives.","When asked for clarification, Nichols appeared to walk back his statement that most of the recent screenshots had never existed on the site.","“I would suspect that that is one of the fake posts,” Nichols told HuffPost. “I would defer to Joy on any specific instance.”","The Library of Congress, which uses a local installation of the Wayback Machine, contains the disputed posts, CNN reported Tuesday. Archive.today, another archiving site, also contained the posts, HuffPost discovered.","HuffPost asked Nichols whether he had sent letters to these sites requesting they remove the posts and help with the investigation into the alleged hacking, as he did in December with Google and the Internet Archive. He replied that he had not.","“The initial engagement with archive.org was in an attempt to see whether [their] hack and ours was correlated,” he wrote in an email to HuffPost on Wednesday. “After we gained a deeper understanding, the discussion switched to simply pulling down the fraudulent posts.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ae0afa82000004200b8fa36.jpeg?cache=sgHfLTK537&ops=crop_0_0_2338_1963%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Diamond And Silk Appear To Lie Under Oath About Trump Payments","authors":"Eliot Nelson","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/diamond-and-silk-appear-lie-under-oath-about-trump-payments_us_5ae2111ae4b055fd7fc9a78b","short_description":"The conservative social media duo said they weren't paid by the president's campaign... but campaign filings indicate otherwise.","date":"2018-04-26"},"articleContent":["Conservative internet pundits Lynnette “Diamond” Hardaway and Rochelle “Silk” Richardson appeared on Thursday to lie under oath to a congressional panel about their financial relationship to President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign.","During a House Judiciary Committee hearing on free speech and social media, Rep. Sheila Jackson-Lee (D-Texas) asked the pair whether the Trump campaign had paid them. The two emphatically denied receiving any payments.","“Ms. Hardaway have you ever been paid by the Trump campaign?” asked Jackson-Lee.","“No, we’ve never been paid by the Trump campaign,” replied Hardaway.","“Not $5?” Jackson-Lee followed up. “Not $100? What about $1,274.94?”","“We have never been paid,” Hardaway replied.","The Trump campaign’s Federal Election Commission filings indicate that the pair were paid $1,274.94 on Nov. 22, 2016 for “Field Consulting.”","During a combative exchange, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) asked Hardaway and Richardson about the discrepancy, reminding them that they were under oath and subject to criminal penalties if they lie.","Hardaway and Richardson told the committee that the payment was improperly labeled and that money was actually a reimbursement for airfare that the two had purchased to speak at a Trump rally.","The two also repeatedly claimed that Facebook has “censored” them, despite a lack of evidence proving the social network specifically targeted their content. While the social media giant had messaged the pair that their videos were “unsafe,” it later clarified that it was sent in error.","“We have communicated directly with Diamond And Silk about this issue. The message they received last week was inaccurate and not reflective of the way we communicate with our community and the people who run Pages on our platform,” a Facebook representative told the Washington Post, “We have provided them with more information about our policies and the tools that are applicable to their Page and look forward to the opportunity to speak with them.”","Hardaway and Richardson are among President Trump’s most ardent and popular African-American supporters. They currently have nearly 150,000 subscribers on YouTube and several of their videos have been viewed over a million times each. They began their rise to fame in December 2015, when then-candidate Trump invited them onto the stage at a rally.","“I hope you’ve monetized this,” Trump told the pair, referencing their growing fame on social media.","During the hearing, they exhibited the same mixture of indignation and ultra-conservative politics that have made them famous. “If illegal aliens can come here and achieve the American dream,” exclaimed Hardaway at one point, “why can’t Diamond and Silk?”","After being pressed on their payment from the Trump campaign, the two rebuffed Rep. Jeffries for attacking what they described as their entrepreneurial spirit.","“I don’t see you walking up to a white person saying ‘no, you shouldn’t monetize that,’” Hardaway said.","“I respect your game,” Jeffries replied.","This isn’t the first time that the social media stars have found themselves financially entwined with a campaign. On Aug. 14, 2016, Hardaway and Richardson received $7,025 in payments from the campaign of Republican businessman Paul Nehlen, according to the FEC. Nehlen was mounting a primary challenge to Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.). Several days later, the pair endorsed Nehlen’s campaign.","Late Thursday afternoon, Bradley Crate, treasurer for Donald Trump’s election campaign, issued a statement saying the Trump campaign’s disbursement of $1,274.94 to Diamond and Silk was erroneously listed due improper paperwork.","“The issue regarding Diamond and Silk is merely one of semantics, resulting from a reasonable misunderstanding of the Campaign’s reporting obligations,” Crate said. “The Campaign’s payment to Diamond and Silk for field consulting was based on an invoice they submitted reflecting their costs for air travel to a Campaign event. The invoice was not supported by accompanying receipts, so as a technical matter, could not be reported as a reimbursement even though its purpose was to make them whole for their out-of-pocket costs.”","This story has been updated to include Bradley Crate’s statement."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ae211711e000044008e3bb3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Pro-Choice GOP Senators Keep Voting For Trump's Anti-Abortion Judges","authors":"Jennifer Bendery","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/abortion-lisa-murkowski-susan-collins-trump-judges_us_5ade226ae4b0b2e8113244df","short_description":"Looking at you, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski.","date":"2018-04-26"},"articleContent":["WASHINGTON ― The Senate voted Tuesday to confirm one of President Donald Trump’s judicial nominees, Kyle Duncan, a lawyer who built his career on fighting abortion rights, LGBTQ rights and voting rights.","Every Republican voted to confirm Duncan, 45, to a lifetime seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit. One Democrat voted for him, Sen. Joe Manchin (W.Va.).","There’s nothing particularly surprising about Republicans lining up behind a Republican president’s court pick. In fact, not a single GOP senator has voted against any of Trump’s judicial nominees, aside from one no vote cast by Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.).","But what’s puzzling is that Republican senators who identify as pro-choice or pro-LGBTQ rights keep voting to confirm lifetime judges poised to chip away at those rights ― and the interest groups that praise these senators for their views seem to be ignoring their contrary votes on judges, whose decisions will affect generations of people.","Take Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska). Both are pro-choice; Murkowski is a member of several GOP organizations that support abortion rights, including the Republican Majority for Choice, and Collins just won a big award from Planned Parenthood.","“Throughout my service in the Senate, I have been a strong proponent of measures to promote and protect women’s health and expand all Americans’ access to quality health care,” Collins said in November when she received her award.","And yet, both just voted to confirm Duncan, who led the legal fight against the Affordable Care Act’s requirement that employers provide insurance coverage for contraceptives. He also wrote a brief in opposition to a Washington state law that required pharmacies to stock birth control, and co-authored a brief supporting Texas’ extreme restrictions on abortion that the U.S. Supreme Court later struck down as unconstitutional.","They voted in July to confirm 53-year-old John Bush as a U.S. circuit judge. He had compared abortion to slavery and referred to them as the “two greatest tragedies in our country.”","They voted in October to confirm Amy Coney Barrett, then 45, to the 7th Circuit. She had suggested Roe v. Wade was an “erroneous decision” and called the Affordable Care Act’s birth control benefit “an assault on religious liberty.”","They voted in August to confirm Kevin Newsom, then 44, to the 11th Circuit. He had equated the rationale of Roe v. Wade to Dred Scott v. Sandford, the 1857 Supreme Court decision upholding slavery.","They voted in December to confirm Leonard Steven Grasz, 56, as a U.S. circuit judge. He had compared the “personhood” of fetuses to the civil rights of Native Americans and African-Americans. He’d also argued that lower courts should be able to overrule Supreme Court decisions on abortion rights because “abortion jurisprudence is, to a significant extent, a word game.”","Ahead of Duncan’s vote, Planned Parenthood tweeted for days urging senators to vote no and highlighting how awful he would be for women’s reproductive rights. After he was confirmed, the group thanked Democrats for speaking out against Duncan, but said nothing about its GOP allies who voted yes.","Aides to Collins and Murkowski did not respond to requests for comment on how they square their pro-choice position with their votes for Trump’s judges.","Planned Parenthood did not respond to a request for comment.","What happened to being an LGBTQ ally?","It’s not just hypocrisy on abortion rights. Collins, Murkowski and Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) have cast themselves as allies to the LGBTQ community, yet they keep voting to confirm lifetime judges who are rabidly anti-gay.","Collins said in 2014 that she was “proud” to be an ally to the Human Rights Campaign, which endorsed Collins in her reelection campaign that year. Murkowski announced her support for same-sex marriage in 2013, and voted to repeal the military’s ban on openly gay troops in 2010, saying, “I’ve heard from Alaskans across the state who believe it’s time to end this discriminatory policy, and I agree with them.”","Portman, meanwhile, announced his support for same-sex marriage in 2013 after his son came out as gay. He followed that by voting for a bill to ban workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.","All three of them voted in December to confirm James Ho as a U.S. circuit judge. Ho had donated thousands of pro bono hours to First Liberty Institute, a conservative legal group that takes up cases opposing LGBTQ rights. Its clients include the owners of Sweet Cakes, an Oregon bakery fined for refusing to serve a lesbian couple, and a newspaper editor fired for writing a post condemning the “LGBTQXYZ crowd and the Gaystapo” for trying to “make their sinful nature right with God.”","They all voted for Judge Bush, who criticized the State Department for modifying passport application forms to include same-sex parents.","They all voted for Judge Grasz, who, as chief deputy attorney general for Nebraska, opposed the recognition of same-sex marriages contracted in other states. He also used his role on a city of Omaha committee to push for an amendment to the city charter to allow employers to discriminate against LGBTQ employees by citing religious liberty.","And on Tuesday, they all voted for Duncan, who previously filed a brief on behalf of 15 states opposing nationwide marriage equality and led efforts to keep same-sex marriage bans in Louisiana and Virginia. He also represented the birth mother of three children who refused visitation rights to her former same-sex spouse.","The Human Rights Campaign torched the Senate for confirming Duncan and cast him as one of Trump’s most extreme anti-LGBTQ judicial nominees. But the group didn’t call out any of its supposed GOP allies for voting for him.","“In a string of anti-equality nominees from the Trump-Pence administration, Kyle Duncan stands out for his long career fighting to limit the legal protections for LGBTQ Americans,” David Stacy, HRC’s government affairs director, said in a statement. “It is unconscionable that the Senate has rubber stamped yet another unfit and extreme nominee to a lifetime appointment to the federal bench.”","Aides to Collins, Murkowski and Portman did not respond to requests for comment on how they square their support for LGBTQ rights with their votes for Trump’s judges.","The Human Rights Campaign did not respond to a request for comment."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ae0a9651a00004300cdcd52.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Samantha Bee Issues Chilling Warning About Steve Bannon’s Racist Tour Of Europe","authors":"Lee Moran","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/samantha-bee-steve-bannon-hitler_us_5ae1ba09e4b055fd7fc8cb64","short_description":"\"I can’t remember, but I feel like someone else once united the far right parties of Italy and Germany and then invaded France with their ideas.\"","date":"2018-04-26"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"MEDIA","headline":"New York Times Journalists Who Broke Harvey Weinstein Story Are Getting A Movie","authors":"Marina Fang","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/harvey-weinstein-me-too-new-york-times-movie_us_5ae1b7c3e4b02baed1b73586","short_description":"The film aims to be the next \"Spotlight\" or \"All the President's Men,\" focusing on the dogged reporting.","date":"2018-04-26"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Here’s What Is Coming To Hulu In May 2018","authors":"Todd Van Luling","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hulu-coming-may_us_5addeb04e4b009869bfbe202","short_description":"All the movies and shows joining Hulu.","date":"2018-04-26"},"articleContent":["If you’re using Hulu this May, it will probably be for “The Handmaid’s Tale” and the many new movies the service is adding this month.","The second season of “The Handmaid’s Tale” premiered April 25 and will have new episodes on a weekly basis through May.

Melissa M. Pavey, 45, and Jolene E. Houchens, 38, used drills, lasers and surgical tools on at least five people between July 2016 and December 2017.","The women operated out of an office in Glendale, where they charged victims thousands of dollars for illegal procedures, according to the Arizona Attorney General’s Office.","In one instance, Pavey and Houchens allegedly charged a man $6,000 for a tooth extraction. In another, a Glendale woman had multiple teeth extracted by the pair in January 2017, authorities said.","“During the whole procedure, I felt something was off ― the time it took, the numbing … the pain I felt, dropping the tool on the ground and putting it back in my mouth,” she told CBS 5 News in Phoenix.","The Glendale woman claims the phony dentists told her she did not need antibiotics and instead gave her loose pills in a bag, along with a prescription for Percocet.

Freeman only learned that she was pregnant in January, per BuzzFeed, when she was already in her third trimester, and she had booked her vacation flight before finding out.","“I was in shock,” Freeman told HuffPost. “I never saw myself as a mom before. I was more career-oriented. That’s probably why I was in denial after finding out.”","On March 7, she took a 14-hour flight to Istanbul, Turkey, where she had an overnight layover en route to Germany.","Freeman explained on Twitter that after eating an in-flight meal, she began to feel sick but chalked it up to food poisoning at first. At the airport in Istanbul, it dawned on her that maybe there was another explanation.","When she finally made it to her hotel room, she began searching on YouTube for videos on how to deliver your own baby.","Freeman told the Independent that she nixed the idea of going to the hospital for several reasons.","“Not many people spoke English that I encountered at first,” she told the news outlet. “And I didn’t know what the country’s emergency number was and I didn’t know how my insurance would work overseas so I just decided to DIY it.”","Freeman then grabbed two towels — one to wrap her baby in and the other to bite onto while she gave birth — and filled the bathtub with warm water. Thanks to research on the internet, she began to push once her contractions were a minute apart.","After just a few pushes, the baby “popped out” and “floated right on up to the top of the water,” she wrote on Twitter. It was a boy!","Freeman then had to figure out a procedure for removing an umbilical cord without the proper tools. After checking online, she sterilized her shoelaces by boiling them in water and used them as clamps as she cut the cord.","After all this, the new mother still didn’t go to the hospital. Instead, she cleaned the bathroom because “it looked like the set of a horror movie” and went to bed with her newborn son.","Naturally, when she got to the airport the next day, there was a lot of confusion.","“They thought I was a human trafficker trying to smuggle out a baby,” she wrote online.","But once Freeman and her son were examined and her story checked out, airport staff apparently were very nice.","According to BuzzFeed, they even helped name her son, Xavier Ata.","“The ladies at the airport who helped me said that he should have a Turkish name,” Freeman told the site. “So I asked them for a cute boy name and they suggested Ata.”","Freeman was taken to the U.S. Embassy in Turkey where her son was issued a birth certificate and a passport.","She was then transported to the hospital where she and Xavier received a clean bill of health. She remained in Istanbul for two more weeks, a stay that Turkish Airlines paid for in full.","During her time in the city, Freeman’s incredible story made headlines at several local news outlets.","Freeman told BuzzFeed that no one in her family had known she was pregnant.","“They all found out a couple days after he was born.”","She said that she told her grandma, who told her mom, “and then my mom went crazy telling the rest of our family and every other person she came in contact with.”","“When I got back even our lawn care guys knew!”","People online absolutely loved Freeman’s story.","Freeman told the Independent that despite all the risks she took, she wouldn’t change a thing.","“The experience taught me so much.

I almost gave up,” the “Voice” coach wrote on Twitter. “But I can finally see something on the horizon up there!! Wait!! Could it be?! Yep!! It’s karma!!”","Shelton went on to retweet a fan’s response to the tweet with a lyric from girlfriend Gwen Stefani’s song “This Is What The Truth Feels Like.”","Shelton and Lambert, the country music world’s former golden couple, announced their split in 2015 after four years of marriage and another six years together.","While neither has commented on the reason for the divorce, rumors about Lambert’s infidelity have long swirled thanks to Shelton’s 2016 song “She’s Got a Way with Words,” which takes aim at a cheating ex.","“When we recorded the vocals for some of these songs, I was only six months removed from when all the crap went down,” Shelton told Billboard about the inspiration behind his post-divorce album. “When you have a broken heart — at least, when I do — you got to get it out of your system. You want people to sympathize with you. I was at rock bottom, in the middle of hell.”","Months after the split, Lambert found love with singer Anderson East, whom she dated for two years. Multiple outlets confirmed earlier this month that the two were no longer a couple.","In January, she invited Felker’s band to join her on her Livin’ Like Hippies tour. At the time, the frontman was reportedly still married to wife Staci Nelson, who later filed for divorce in February, according to People. Reports claim that Lambert and Felker’s romance began while they were both still in relationships.","“Staci found out that he had filed for divorce because a friend called her after seeing it in a local newspaper,” a source told E!

No, seriously. When Betty’s long-lost brother Charles aka Chic (Hart Denton) first arrived in “Riverdale,” there was clearly something a bit off, but we had no idea things would go from zero to tied up and tortured in a basement so quickly.","Sure, the constant lurking, extracurricular web-camming and, oh, that time he murdered someone in the family kitchen might have raised some red flags. But it’s “Riverdale,” after all, and we got a little distracted by last week’s deadly high school musical, OK?","All was revealed on Wednesday night’s episode when (Spoiler alert!) Betty, her mother Alice and Jughead confronted Chic in a bloody face-off that’s been building all season. We learned that not only has Chic been pretending to be Charles Cooper all this time, but he also claims to have accidentally killed him during a heated argument. At least that’s one story he’s selling ― he also told Alice that her real son overdosed on jingle jangle, a fictional drug with a name we will never take seriously.","And the most twisted thing is, we might never know. By the end of the episode, Betty essentially leads Chic to slaughter by arranging a death date between him and the Black Hood, a serial killer that’s been picking off the town’s residents one by one. She does give him a head start though, sending Chic running into the distance as a man ― who Betty later suspects is her father, Hal Cooper (!) ― chases after him.","Before the episode, HuffPost spoke to Denton about his character’s possible demise, why he would never judge Chic after all he’s done and if we might see him on “Riverdale” ever again.","Chic above all else is a survivor, so I have to ask: Is this really the last we’ll see of him? He seems a bit more sprightly than the Black Hood in that chase scene.","Chic is going to get away. I was sprinting and just hauling through that graveyard. To my knowledge, there’s no way [the Black Hood] could catch me because I’d definitely survive. I think there’s more Chic to come and some redemption left for him. I have so many more questions and I want to see those things answered. Everyone should hang in there and wait and see.","If Chic were to return one day, how do you think he might pop up?","He’s got to come back in a heroic fashion and save the town, Betty or somebody else, especially if he wants to get another shot, since he is so creepy.","Speaking of ... it’s been well-established that Chic is, to put it one way, creepy AF. Do you empathize with him more now that some of his backstory has been revealed?","Since he was rescued from a horrible situation in that very first episode, I’ve had such a soft spot in my heart for Chic throughout the season. He comes from a whole different world and he doesn’t know how to live in this utopian-like town. It’s a circle and a square situation. He was trying to escape and blend into a new environment, but it got to a point where it wasn’t possible for him to do so. But you don’t know what someone has been through, so hold judgment.","When did you learn about Chic’s real identity, and how did that inform your approach to playing him?","[Series creator Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa] really wanted me to be in the dark for acting purposes and just live organically week by week. I talked to him to ask him some things like, “What is up with this guy?” and “What is going on?” But looking back on that now, I appreciate him keeping me on the edge and not revealing anything until I got the script. Everyone works in different ways, but I like that process.","Now we know Chic lived with and maybe killed Betty’s real brother, Charles. It’s clear the two shared a close relationship. Your character’s sexuality is never really established on the show, so did you imagine them as lovers?","I do think he genuinely loved Charles, but to what capacity, I’m not sure. I felt that this was his love and they shared a very deep connection with each other. Chic does have a very dark past, but also such a deep adoration for so many people. I think he’s a very loving person.","But can we actually trust anything he says since he’s been lying this whole time?","I don’t think so. In most situations, he just says what someone wants to hear which makes it difficult to know if he’s good or not. It’s “Riverdale,” so who knows? Hopefully, at some point he gets to a place where all the lying is done and he apologizes for taking so long to get to the truth.","For fans who don’t know you outside of the show, what are you really like? Lili Reinhart (Betty) has joked that you have the same personality as Austin Powers. Is that true?","She’s such a goof. We quote “Austin Powers” all the time because we watch it so much. That character is obviously not the most intelligent being, so I’m not identical to him [Laughs] but I’m just a genuinely smiley, happy person. Chic is the complete opposite of me in that sense. While we were shooting the season, Lili always said she couldn’t wait for me to do interviews, so people can see me smiling nonstop.","Sometimes you play a role that’s too close to who you are and then people can’t separate it. Everybody is pretty understanding that I’m not a psycho, creepy or lying about stuff. It was a bit of therapy to crawl into someone else’s skin and not be Hart all the time.","Looking back, what was it like to join such a tight-knit cast in the second season? Do you feel part of the “Riverdale” family now?","Yeah, everybody took me in pretty lovingly with open arms from the get-go. I didn’t know that it was going to become what is is now. This whole process has been so wonderful and the cast is a real pleasure to be around because we are very grateful of this platform we’ve been given. The show is so powerful and it’s a beautiful thing.","I have to ask about Coachella, because it seemed like everybody from the cast was there. How did K.J. Apa (Archie) end up performing onstage with Kygo?","Kygo’s manager reached out to me and said they’re fans of the show and would love for [us] to come. We got to talking about K.J. playing guitar and then I called and got him down to Coachella.","So you hooked it up?!","Yeah, it was amazing to see. He had a phenomenal solo at the end and killed it.","This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ae0e4ce1e000044008e3a0b.jpeg?cache=hfXltcwZRd&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Karen Gillan Volunteers To Direct An All-Female Marvel Movie","authors":"Leigh Blickley","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/karen-gillan-interview_us_5adf71f6e4b061c0bfa26c98","short_description":"The \"Avengers\" star and first-time director says Marvel actresses talk about a women-only superhero film all the time.","date":"2018-04-26"},"articleContent":["She may have gotten her start on the BBC series “Doctor Who” in 2010 as the title character’s beloved, fan-favorite companion Amy Pond, but Karen Gillan’s evolved since then. Eight years later, she’s a bona fide action antihero.","After appearing in both “Guardians of the Galaxy” movies as the blue, bald-headed Nebula, the adopted sister of Gamora (Zoe Saldana) and daughter of evil warlord Thanos (Josh Brolin), Gillan registers to fans these days as the villain with a heart. Now, she’s got a “significant role” in “Avengers: Infinity War,” the Marvel movie predicted to make over $200 million this weekend.","The ensemble film features 60-plus characters from the Marvel universe, including Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), Captain America (Chris Evans), Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), Spider-Man (Tom Holland), Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and Star-Lord (Chris Pratt). As you might expect, there’s a whole lot of men in that lineup, but ― if the rumors are true ― a women-only Marvel film could be on the horizon.","In fact, the 30-year-old Gillan said she’d volunteer to direct the all-female project if the studio moves ahead with the idea.","“OK, I’ll do it,” she told HuffPost at the Tribeca Film Festival last week, where she was promoting her directorial debut, “The Party’s Just Beginning.” Gillan doesn’t see any reason why a film featuring the many formidable women of the universe couldn’t be a possibility.","“Absolutely,” she said. “I know all of the Marvel actresses talk about it and we’re all for it. I don’t know whether it will happen or not, but everybody’s really up for it.”","Outside of her action persona, Gillan is hoping her latest indie movie opens a few new doors for her in terms of writing and directing. It takes on a darker coming-of-age tale revolving around a 20-something woman who turns to sex and alcohol to ease the pain of losing her best friend to suicide. In a sit-down interview at the Roxy Hotel in New York, the actress and filmmaker spoke in-depth about “The Party’s Just Beginning,” her blossoming career and Nebula’s “Avengers” role.","You’ve had a really busy past few years.","I know! It’s been incredibly exciting. Everything seems to be happening all at once.","“The Party’s Just Beginning” is a passion project of yours, about your hometown of Inverness in the Scottish Highlands, which you’ve been working on for the past six years. What struck me, though, is how in tune the film is to very current topics of discussion in your industry, whether it be depression, suicide, gender identity, connectivity…","There’s a lot of stuff in there that really wasn’t being discussed when I wrote it and now it just seems to be discussed so much more. But that just makes me happy that it’s at the forefront of people’s minds ― these conversations ― because obviously they are issues that should be talked about.","When did you discover the statistic about the alarming rate of suicide in Inverness, and how did you want to go about addressing it?","I remember reading about that eight years ago roughly, and it was something that just always stuck with me. It struck me as so strange because I grew up there and it’s so idyllic and beautiful. It was just a contradiction to me. I was like, how is this possible to have this dark statistic looming over us? And then a couple of years after that I wanted to write my own screenplay, as I felt involved in telling other people’s stories so much as an actress that I really wanted to tell one of my own. And this just felt like the most natural thing to do, because it was something I felt was so strange and it hadn’t left my mind.","What was the scariest part of this: the writing, acting or directing?","I guess it’s the combination of acting and directing at the same time. It wasn’t scary so much as frustrating, because I love visuals so much that I really wanted to be behind the monitor watching everything that was going down the lens. Being in the scenes meant I couldn’t just sit behind the monitor. That provided an interesting form of directing, because instead of coming in with notes for the actors, I could just say to them, “Be responsive to what I’m giving you.” I provoked emotions within rather than discussing it beforehand, which feels a little more organic.","Was it then odd to direct yourself, jumping in front of and then behind the camera?","As an actor, I’ve made so many self-tapes ― which is something we just do now instead of auditions if we can’t get there ― and so I’ve developed, like most actors, this skill of knowing when you got it and when you don’t. So for myself, what I did was I gave myself options. I would do multiple takes and each one would be different so I could sit in the edit and pick and choose the performance.","What was the process like finding a producer to back the project?","I didn’t know how any of this stuff worked. I wrote this script in the U.K. and then I moved to America to do this film called “Oculus,” a horror movie. I showed the script to the director [Mike Flanagan] and he was like, “I know the producer who needs to make this movie.” And I was like, “Um, amazing! Bring me to her!” And then he’s like, “Actually, she’s right here.” And then [Mali Elfman] comes into the bar, this pub in L.A., and she had already read the script and she really connected to it. So that was just amazing ― one of those life moments where it was all in sync and really working. And then she and I worked together for four years to try and get funding for it.","Once you found funding, did you start creating a vision for the film or pull any inspiration from other directors?","Well, I feel like I might have taken a lot of inspiration from one of my favorite directors, Michael Haneke. My favorites are Haneke and Stanley Kubrick, and I don’t think this film looks like a Kubrick film. I mean, I wish! [Laughs] So maybe I’ve been influenced there subconsciously, but I had a really strong idea of what I wanted it to look like visually from the beginning, so much so that I storyboarded the entire film just for myself so I could essentially watch it by looking at the pages. But then I didn’t want my director of photography [Edd Lukas] to follow that, because I didn’t want to influence him too much. I wanted him to offer his ideas and bring them to the table and he totally agreed with that approach. But it’s scary how similar some of it is to the original storyboard.","How did you find the time to do all this storyboarding? You mentioned “Oculus” and from there, your career really took off.","I was doing the storyboards on the set of “Jumanji.” [Laughs] And they were trying to get me out of my trailer and I’m like, “Just one more picture!”","This film compared to “Jumanji” is quite the leap.","I know. [Laughs]","You play with dark comedy in “The Party’s Just Beginning,” but what was your experience like working on “Jumanji” with Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart and Jack Black?","I loved it. Just working with such funny guys was such a cool, fun experience, and such a good learning curve, because they’re all so brilliant at what they do with comedy in such individual ways.","I’m sure it’s an interesting transition to go from filming big budget movies like “Jumanji” or “Guardians of the Galaxy” to filming your own indie project.","Yeah, the difference was so extreme.","Did it maybe inspire you to one day be a director who’s given the chance to helm a movie of that magnitude?","First of all, I’m so happy to see that more women are directing blockbuster movies because, frankly, more women should be. If you look at the audience numbers, it’s not as if they’re predominately male ― just as many females watch those types of movies, so why can’t women make them? We’re starting to see more of that now. I would definitely love to be a part of that one day, just because I feel like I’ve picked up a lot of knowledge on how they’re made by being in the environment. Therefore, I feel like I could put that to good use one day.","That Marvel environment must be insane. Talk about the filming aspect of those movies ― how crazy is it?","I’ve had nothing but great experiences working on Marvel movies. So many people think working on big budget movies presents a lack of creativity or something, and I just don’t find that to be true at all. If anything, having a bigger budget allows you to have more time, which means you can do more takes and try more things. As an actor, you can really start to explore, whereas on indie movies it’s like, “We’re running out of time!” So sometimes you only get one or two go’s at things. So I find [Marvel movies] incredibly rewarding, creatively. And it’s just so impressive the way the whole machine works ― it’s such a well-oiled machine and the technology is mind-blowing.","What was it like shooting “Avengers: Infinity War” with so many characters? And directly after shooting “Guardians 2.”","We have been shooting those [Marvel} films for the last year. So I essentially wrapped filming “The Party’s Just Beginning” and went straight onto “Avengers” and juggled the [“Party’s”] edit with “Avengers.” But it was cool since I already know the character of Nebula so well now because I’ve played her in a couple of movies, so it’s slightly different because you don’t have the whole research part. The whole thing just felt like such an event that I can’t believe even logistically they pulled off getting 60-plus actors in major roles in one movie ― I don’t know how they did that! I kept on wondering, “The crew must be so tired, they worked for a year straight!” The actors are in and out a little bit more, but the crew is consistent. And they were all so happy. I think the way they achieved that was from keeping the shoot to 10-hour days so that they wouldn’t wear everybody down, where sometimes we could do 18- or 20-hour days if you include makeup and everything.","When you signed on for “Guardians,” did you know you’d be a part of the whole “Avengers” world?","No! I thought I was going to be in “Guardians” for an eight-day shoot. [Laughs] That’s what I signed on for! And now we’re sitting here five years later talking about the “Avengers” movie, so it’s blowing my mind so much.","Is your role big in this upcoming movie?","Nebula has a significant role and has a lot of stuff to do because her father is Thanos, who is the villain of the movies. She has some serious daddy issues with him, so she has a lot to confront. But also, I don’t know, because I haven’t seen the movie and I haven’t read the movie.","Yes, they’re keeping it very secret. We’re on the edge of our seats waiting!","The actors, too! We don’t know how any of our scenes fit into the overall context. So I guess I’ll find out at the premiere [which occurred in Los Angeles earlier this week].","Do you know how it ends?","No, because it’s hard to know. It’s hard to know what you’re shooting and where that fits into the story. We could’ve shot the end and I wouldn’t know it’s the end. And also, you only get your scenes from that day and then they’re taken away from you at the end of the day.","That’s intense! But through Marvel, you met people like Lee Pace, who stars in “The Party’s Just Beginning.”","Yes! We were already in Scotland prepping the film, we still needed a Dale [his character] and then I just thought of him, and we were like, “We’ll never be able to get him. He’s too big of an actor and so brilliant. Will he even do it?” And I just rang him, and he happened to be free. He was like, “Yeah, all right, I’ll come to Scotland for an experience!”","You have a whole list now of Marvel actors you can cast in future movies!","Yeah! That sounds great ... hopefully. [Laughs]","Will you continue directing?","Yes, I’m incredibly passionate about it. I can’t wait to make another film. It’s all I want to do right now.","I feel like you should direct the all-women Marvel movie we’re all waiting for.","OK, I’ll do it. [Laughs]","Do you think that could even happen?","Yeah, why not? Absolutely. I know all of the Marvel actresses talk about it and we’re all for it. I don’t know whether it will happen or not, but everybody’s really up for it.","Women directors, an all-women Marvel film, a female Doctor Who…","Yes! It’s so representative of everything that’s happening within the industry right now. It just makes me so happy because so many people have been skeptical as to whether a woman could play the Doctor, but it’s like, “How is that even still a question?” Of course a female could play that role, and I’m glad we get to see Jodie [Whittaker] do it."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ae0b4cc2000002d00b8fa42.jpeg?cache=oNSndAetsb&ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"WOMEN","headline":"Bill Cosby's Accusers: 'May This Verdict Open The Floodgates'","authors":"Carla Herreria","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cosby-victims-react-to-verdict_us_5ae22d3ce4b02baed1b84b41","short_description":"Here's how the women who came forward reacted after Cosby was found guilty.","date":"2018-04-26"},"articleContent":["The more than 50 women who have accused disgraced comedian Bill Cosby of sexual assault are finally one step closer to vindication.","A jury on Thursday found the veteran entertainer guilty on three felony counts ― including penetration with lack of consent, penetration while unconscious and penetration after administering an intoxicant ― at a retrial in Montgomery County court in Pennsylvania.","Speaking to the press outside the courthouse in Norristown, attorney Gloria Allred, who represents 33 of Cosby’s accusers, denounced the 80-year-old entertainer’s legal team for trying to smear the victims’ reputations after they testified against him.","“You tried. You failed. The personal attacks did not work,” Allred said. “Bill Cosby, three words for you: Guilty, guilty, guilty.”","After the verdict, three of the women who came forward, Victoria Valentina, Caroline Heldman and Lili Bernard, left the courtroom crying, celebrating the judgment with an emotional embrace.","Andrea Constand, who accused Cosby of drugging and sexually assaulting her in the present case, did not speak publicly after the verdict, but she was seen holding friends and family as she exited the courtroom.","“We are vindicated, we are validated and we are now part of the tsunami of women’s power and justice,” Valentino, 73, said during a press conference with other accusers and Allred.","“We are not shutting up and we are not going away,” Valentino added. “Get over it.”","Valentino, a former Playboy playmate, says Cosby raped her in an apartment in the Hollywood Hills in 1969.","Bernard, an actress who said Cosby drugged and raped her while she guest-starred on “The Cosby Show” in the early 1990s, also spoke after the trial, praising the Me Too movement.","“I stand here in the spirit of Martin Luther King, who said that the arc of the moral universe is long, but today it has bent towards justice,” Bernard said. “Today, this jury has shown what the Me Too movement is saying: that women are worthy of being believed.”","She added: “This is a victory not just for Andrea Constand, who I consider to be the Joan of Arc in the war on rape.

The lab’s workers had been jumping the lab’s fences to provide food and water for the dogs, according to a USA Today report.","Two animal welfare groups teamed up to find homes for the beagles and were finally able to take them from the shuttered lab on July 4 to shelters, where they would be matched with adoptive families. A video report conducted by the Times Herald-Record, based in Middletown, New York, showed the dogs arriving in a van from the lab to a staging area where volunteers groomed and attended to the forlorn animals.","Even before the beagles were abandoned, they led lonely lives in small plexiglass crates where they were subject to toxicology tests.","“We believe that they have never been outside, ever,” said an unnamed woman in the Times Herald-Record video. “I don’t think they’ve actually had their paws on the grass. When I walked in here it looked like they were walking on eggshells. They were kind of afraid to walk on the grass.”","A few days later, the California-based group In Defense of Animals rescued 55 long-tailed macaque monkeys that had been left in the shuttered AniClin testing facility.","Acting on an anonymous tip from one of the monkeys’ former caregivers, IDA negotiated with the company that was liquidating the facility’s assets to release the monkeys rather than sell them to another testing facility. IDA claimed that the U.S. Department of Agriculture had cited the lab before it closed.","Thanedar told HuffPost on Wednesday night that the lab was under the control of Bank of America, which seized it when he declared bankruptcy.","“I have no knowledge how well the bank took care of the animals,” he said.","Thanedar also defended the treatment of animals in his lab while it was operating, claiming that it adhered to all the necessary rules and regulations of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and other government agencies.","“No animal was harmed or subjected to any harmful conditions. No electric experiments were conducted,” he said.","Thanedar issued a second statement on Thursday further denying responsibility for the animals’ suffering.","“It is my understanding that Bank of America made arrangements to assign caretakers for the animals and secure homes for them, but those decisions came from the bank after I left the company,” Thanedar said. “I am an animal lover and completely understand the sensitivity of this issue.”","The campaigns of Thanedar’s two main competitors, former Michigan Senate Democratic Leader Gretchen Whitmer and former Detroit health director Abdul El-Sayed, declined to comment on the apparent mistreatment of animals left in the AniClin facility.","However, a veteran Michigan Democrat with ties to none of the campaigns called the reports “concerning.”","“There are Democrats, Republicans and independents in Michigan and around the country,” said the Democrat, who asked not to be named due to the sensitive nature of the topic. “They disagree on many things. But I wouldn’t be afraid to wager that everybody, no matter their partisan affiliation, would be wary of someone who would so cruelly disregard the life of a domestic animal.”","It “should cause many people deep concerns about what other potential problems will come up throughout the campaign,” the Democrat added.","Thanedar poses a unique challenge for Michigan Democrats ― both in the party establishment, which has thrown its support behind Whitmer, and among the progressive activists who have warmed to El-Sayed’s candidacy.","Many top Michigan Democrats believe Thanedar is simply borrowing the progressive label to advance his political career. While Thanedar has donated to Democrats in recent years, in 2008, he contributed $2,300 to the presidential run of Republican Sen. John McCain (Ariz.). He also reportedly asked Michigan political consultants whether he should run as a Republican or a Democrat when he was planning his gubernatorial bid. Thanedar claims he was “noncommittal” about party affiliation so as not to reveal information to the consultants until he announced his candidacy, and he explains that he supported McCain because a friend was running the Arizona senator’s bid.","The abandonment of test animals is not the only controversial feature of Thanedar’s business history. An over-the-counter male enhancement supplement, S.W.A.G., that Thanedar’s company Avomeen tested in 2013, was later revealed to contain Viagra. An employee of Thanedar’s told the Detroit News in March that he had notified Thanedar when he found the traces of Viagra in the drug, but Thanedar did not report it to the Food and Drug Administration. The employee then notified the FDA on his own.","Thanedar claimed that it was his obligation to test the drugs and inform his clients of the rules, not to inform the federal government about client misconduct.","“We told them you have to report it. It’s illegal to do that,” Thanedar told HuffPost earlier this month. “That was the extent of my obligation.”","But Thanedar’s personal wealth from chemical testing businesses appears to have allowed him to project a tailored image of his candidacy. He has spent millions of dollars plastering the airwaves with ads that call him the most progressive candidate in the race.","Thanedar received the support of 21 percent of Democratic primary voters in a March poll, compared with 18 percent for Whitmer and 10 percent for El-Sayed.","Michigan’s Democratic primary is Aug. 7. The Democratic gubernatorial nominee will have the chance to win back the seat for Democrats after eight years of GOP rule.","This article has been updated with a Thursday statement from Thanedar."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ae12d6f2000004100b8fab4.jpeg?cache=voukSNFQpM&ops=crop_0_6_1512_1526%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Guy Hawks His '99 Toyota Corolla On Craigslist Using Brutal Honesty","authors":"Andy McDonald","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/this-guy-sells-his-99-toyota-corolla-on-craigslist-like-a-boss_us_5ae1dfe2e4b055fd7fc92e33","short_description":"Unorthodox.

Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), who chairs one of the House Appropriations subcommittees, told reporters on Wednesday that, based on his conversations with Mulvaney, he believed $25 billion would be the “ceiling” for any package. But the move could still undermine bipartisan negotiations on next year’s appropriations bills, as well as hold up agency spending over cuts that most lawmakers don’t believe will ever be enacted.","The top Democrat on Cole’s subcommittee, Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), and her counterpart on the matching Senate subcommittee, Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), sent a letter to the National Labor Relations Board on Wednesday urging the NLRB, long a target of Republican spending cuts, to not freeze funds out of some expectation that the administration may try to slash its programs.","“We remind you that Congress, not the administration, has the ultimate authority to set funding levels for executive branch agencies,” DeLauro and Murray wrote.","“Any attempt to go back on the deal we made would be an extreme act of bad faith, in addition to being bad for workers and a violation of the law,” they added.","Democrats are worried that the White House’s mere proposal of a rescissions package could drive agencies to put some plans on hold until questions about their budgets are resolved, even though, as DeLauro and Murray point out, agencies aren’t supposed to withhold funds until the president at least sends a formal spending impoundment message to Congress.","But communication from this White House to Congress has been spotty at best.","House Appropriations Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen (R-N.J.) told reporters Wednesday morning that there’s been “no communication” from the administration on what a rescissions package would look like. He said there’s also been “zero” communication from House leadership.","“We had a caps deal,” Frelinghuysen said Wednesday, referring to the agreement between Republicans and Democrats to set spending limits for two years. “We made a decision ― leadership made a decision ― and obviously there may be aspects in the rescissions package that violates that agreement.”","Frelinghuysen added that presidents have made rescissions proposals in the past, and there could be valid reasons for some of the cuts. But GOP lawmakers acknowledged to HuffPost that such an exercise now could poison the well for appropriators and make it more difficult to move spending bills through the chambers. And the whole process of suggesting cuts could be pointless, as Republican senators already seem cool to any proposal.","“I’m hearing that more than half the Republicans would vote against the rescission package in the Senate,” one GOP lawmaker told HuffPost on Wednesday.","Asked whether a rescissions package could delay spending bills reaching the House floor, Cole said that it was a possibility and that appropriators would have to “stop and take a look” at the proposed cuts.","Cole also said it would be one thing if the package were just taking back so-called unobligated funds ― money that agencies didn’t spend in the past ― and another thing if it were attacking the new spending in the omnibus deal. If it went after new spending, Cole said that would make it “much more difficult to get an agreement next year.”","The whole rescissions idea seems to be more messaging than substance ― a scheme cooked up between House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and Trump himself. While McCarthy has enthusiastically backed the notion, other House leaders have been more cagey about their support, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has signaled open opposition to the idea.","“You can’t make an agreement one month and say, ‘OK, we really didn’t mean it’” the next, McConnell told Fox News last week."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ae0c9241a00002800cdcd98.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Supreme Court Leans Toward Upholding Trump's Travel Ban","authors":"Lawrence Hurley and Andrew Chung, Reuters","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-travel-plan-supreme-court-leans-towards-upholding_us_5ae0a78fe4b055fd7fc717ff","short_description":"Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Anthony Kennedy indicated an unwillingness to second-guess the justifications offered for the policy.","date":"2018-04-25"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"BLACK VOICES","headline":"Cops Attempt To Unlock Phone Of Man They Killed Using His Finger","authors":"David Moye","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/florida-cops-use-dead-mans-finger-in-attempt-to-unlock-iphone_us_5ae0bcc1e4b02baed1b5ac3a","short_description":"\"It’s disgusting,” the man's fiancee told ABC Action News.","date":"2018-04-25"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"COMEDY","headline":"Melania Trump Pulls Off Perfect State Dinner With KFC In 'Jimmy Kimmel' Bit","authors":"Ron Dicker","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/melania-trump-state-dinner-kfc-jimmy-kimmel_us_5ae06377e4b07be4d4c6a4fb","short_description":"Bon appetit with a bucket.","date":"2018-04-25"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"QUEER VOICES","headline":"Indiana Pizzeria That Refused To Cater Same-Sex Weddings Closes","authors":"Curtis M.

Macron has emerged as a leader in the fight to protect the legitimacy of the Paris climate agreement after Trump announced that the U.S. would withdraw last June. Minutes after Trump’s announcement, Macron tweeted a slogan riffing off of Trump’s own campaign rallying cry: “Make our planet great again.”","On Wednesday, he demanded again that the U.S. do its part to provide future generations with “a planet that is still habitable in 25 years.” Some people, he continued, feel that securing jobs and restoring industry are more urgent concerns, yet he insisted that the long-term goal of creating a low-carbon economy is primordial.","“What is the meaning of our life, really, if we work and live destroying the planet, sacrificing the future of our children?” he asked as the room erupted, mostly among Democratic members of Congress, in applause.","He’s confident, he added, that the U.S. and France can work out their disagreements on the matter because “on the long term we will have to face the same realities.”","Travis Nichols, media director for Greenpeace USA, applauded Macron’s address.\n\n“Donald Trump should never have rejected the Paris Climate Accord in the first place, and he should by all means reverse course immediately,” Nichols said on Wednesday. “Trump must listen to not only President Macron, but the majority of people in this country who want the United States to stay in the Paris Agreement. As climate-fueled disasters around the world continue to worsen, even Trump should now see that the Paris terms are immensely favorable when compared to climate inaction, denial, and isolation. Destruction wrought from climate change is only going to get worse, and the rest of the world already knows it.”","Macron’s time in Washington, D.C., this week marks the first official state visit of the Trump administration. Macron and Trump have quickly developed an affability that the U.S. leader hasn’t displayed toward other key allies. A series of praiseworthy comments ― Trump at one point called Macron “perfect” ― plus a variety of hugs and handshakes during public events on Tuesday pointed to the warmth between the two.","Yet a handful of thorny international issues are on the table as the two leaders meet, most notably the Iran nuclear deal and Western involvement in the ongoing civil war in Syria.","Many view Macron as the only person with a shot at getting Trump to change his mind about pulling out of the Iran nuclear agreement. Trump has long railed against the deal signed during the Obama administration. He yet again called the agreement “insane” and “ridiculous” on Tuesday but did signal a willingness to negotiate a new deal.","Trump set a deadline of May 12 to determine the fate of the current Iran deal. In classic Trump fashion, he has so far not indicated what he plans to do.","“Nobody knows what I’m going to do on the 12th, although Mr. President, you have a pretty good idea,” Trump said on Tuesday, addressing Macron. “We’ll see also if I do what some people expect, whether or not it will be possible to do a new deal with solid foundations.”","Macron said Wednesday that France doesn’t plan to leave the agreement but is happy to work with Trump in crafting a new, more comprehensive deal that addresses some of the issues that both countries feel were left out of the current deal.","As for Syria, Macron is thought to be playing an integral role in influencing Trump’s decisions. He said in a recent interview that he was the one to convince Trump not to pull troops out of the beleaguered country.","“We’ll be coming home but we want to leave a strong and lasting footprint,” Trump said Tuesday of his decision to leave troops in Syria.","Macron also took credit for persuading the president to carry out joint strikes with France and the U.K. on Syrian military targets following a deadly chemical attack on civilians earlier this month.","“This action was one of the best evidence of strong multilateralism,” Macron said Wednesday, promising to continue working together towards humanitarian solutions to the crisis."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ae0b6901a00004400cdcd71.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Questlove Has A Superhero Power When It Comes To Prince Songs","authors":"Lee Moran","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/questlove-prince-jimmy-fallon_us_5ae0416fe4b07560f396edc8","short_description":"Legend.","date":"2018-04-25"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Sting Reveals The Weird Way He Met His Current Collaborator, Shaggy","authors":"Elyse Wanshel","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sting-reveals-the-weird-way-he-met-shaggy_us_5ae0c831e4b04aa23f1ea959","short_description":"Let’s just say it was a very abrupt first encounter.","date":"2018-04-25"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Hank Azaria Is Happy To 'Step Aside' From Voicing Apu On 'The Simpsons'","authors":"Lee Moran","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hank-azaria-apu-the-simpsons_us_5ae021ebe4b07560f396adf9","short_description":"\"The idea that anyone young or old, past or present, being bullied based on Apu really makes me sad.\"","date":"2018-04-25"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Tennessee Senate Passes A Bill To Erect A Memorial To 'Victims Of Abortion'","authors":"Alanna Vagianos","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tennessee-senate-passed-a-bill-to-erect-a-monument-to-unborn-children_us_5ae07e26e4b061c0bfa3f31b","short_description":"The state Senate voted for the legislation that still needs to be approved in the state House.","date":"2018-04-25"},"articleContent":["Republicans in Tennessee are trying to erect a monument “in memory of the victims of abortion” on the grounds of the state Capitol.","The state’s Senate passed a bill 23-3 on Monday that would require the Capitol to “develop and implement a plan for the commissioning of the Tennessee Monument to Unborn Children,” the Associated Press reports.","The state House passed a version of the bill last week in 63-15 vote.

The foundation worked to help cities transition away from coal use and instead toward energy sources that limit carbon emissions.","Though Blankenship tried to throw scrutiny over McConnell’s extended family and his ties to China ― calling it “one small example” of conflicts of interest seen in Washington ― he has many ties of his own.","Blankenship’s fiancée is Farrah Meiling Hobbs, who was born in Beijing and moved to the U.S. in 1996 where she founded her second trading company, according to The New York Times, citing a website belonging to her.","In 2009, Blankenship also discussed with the Charleston Gazette-Mail his desire to move to Asia and seek dual citizenship in China.

Jackson’s nickname was “Candyman” among White House staff, because he would give them prescription medications whenever they wanted without paperwork.","The summary of the serious allegations against Jackson are laid out in a new document released on Wednesday by the office of Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.), the ranking member on the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee.","Democratic staffers conducted interviews with 23 of Jackson’s colleagues and former colleagues. They “have raised serious concerns about Jackson’s temperament and ethics” and “cast doubt” on his ability to lead the VA, the second-largest government agency.","Jackson has been the White House physician under Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama and now Trump, and has garnered praise from both Democratic and Republican staffers.","But as soon as Trump announced that he was nominating Jackson, senators and veterans groups immediately questioned whether the doctor ― who has little management experience ― was qualified to run the massive, notoriously difficult bureaucracy.","Other questions then began popping up about Jackson’s fitness for the job. On Wednesday, CNN reported that Jackson drunkenly banged on the hotel room door of a female employee during a 2015 overseas trip in the middle of the night.","Other findings from the Democratic document released Wednesday:","Jackson wrote himself prescriptions. When caught, he would have his assistant do it instead.\n\nThe White House Medical Unit, under Jackson, did not properly document pharmaceuticals, making it difficult to track them. Jackson would account for the pills after the fact in paperwork to account for shortages.\n\nJackson was described as “the most unethical person I have ever worked with,” “toxic,” “abusive” and “incapable of not losing his temper.”\n\nJackson was known to have a “kiss up, kick down” approach where he was “a suck up to those above him and abusive to those below him.”","In March, Trump fired the previous VA secretary, David Shulkin, who was a holdover from Obama’s administration.

Three national Republican organs ― the National Republican Congressional Committee, the Republican National Committee and the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC aligned with House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) ― together spent more than $1.2 million on Lesko’s behalf.","The outcome likely provides limited comfort to Republican strategists confronted with still more evidence that the party is due for a reckoning in November.","“This district is no longer an extremely safe Republican district,” said Gina Woodall, a politics expert at Arizona State University. “You can’t beat the proportion of Republican voters or senior citizens who vote regularly in this district. The fact that the GOP still had to work for it is ominous for November.”","The demographics of Arizona’s 8th District, which encompasses a part of Maricopa County known as the West Valley, fundamentally favor Republicans. Over 84 percent of residents are white, and nearly 22 percent are aged 65 or older ― both groups that generally lean Republican.","Prior to his resignation in December, Rep. Trent Franks (R) routinely won re-election by more than 30 percentage points. (Franks left Congress in December after allegedly offering a female aide $5 million to serve as a surrogate for him and his wife.)","Still, Tipirneni, who ran as a defender of Social Security and Medicare, public education and universal health care, proved a prodigious fundraiser, outpacing Lesko by about $180,000 as of the beginning of April. She also limited how much she spoke about Trump on the campaign trail, opting instead to decry overall Republican policies like the tax legislation, which she called “atrocious.”","Despite describing herself as a “moderate Democrat” who would use a “data-driven” approach to governing, Tipirneni proposed allowing people of all ages to buy into the Medicare system. (She also sought to grant Medicaid beneficiaries the opportunity to purchase private coverage.)","The stance won Tipirneni accolades on the left, but prompted Republicans to inaccurately label her an advocate for single-payer health care, in which the federal government covers all Americans as part of one insurance plan.","“Hiral Tipirneni will be the first of many single-payer supporters to suffer defeat this year,” National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Jesse Hunt predicted on Monday.","Some public polls suggested that Tipirneni might overcome the district’s strong conservative bent.","Ultimately though, the national Republican infrastructure helped Lesko close the gap with Tipirneni. Trump recorded a robocall for Lesko, and several congressional leaders traveled to the district to rally voters and raise money.","The GOP proved especially adept at taking advantage of Arizona’s capacious voting rules, which allowed early voting in person or by mail beginning on March 28.","The Ryan-aligned super PAC, the Congressional Leadership Fund, contracted with local GOP consulting firm Calvary LLC, which bombarded a group of 70,000 to 100,000 voters on Arizona’s permanent absentee voter list with digital advertisements encouraging them to vote for Lesko. The ads also reminded voters to submit their mail-in ballots.","“By targeting early and banking votes for Debbie Lesko, we were able to make sure there wasn’t an enthusiasm gap,” said Mike Duncan, a partner at Calvary LLC.","Calvary’s handiwork appeared to show in the makeup of early voters. Of more than 154,000 ballots already cast by the end of the day on Monday, 49 percent of voters were registered Republicans, compared with 28 percent who were Democrats and 23 percent who were independents. The median age of the people who have already voted is 67.","National Democrats never matched the GOP’s commitment to the district, apparently viewing it as too much of a reach. The Democratic National Committee contributed indirectly through a $75,000 innovation grant to the state party, as well as by raising $85,000 for Tipirneni and providing her campaign $17,000 in in-kind services.","The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which helps elect Democrats to the House, did not contribute any cash to Tipirneni’s campaign.","The biggest national player to step in on Tipirneni’s behalf was the Working Families Party, a national progressive group active in state and local races. The Working Families Party invested $100,000 in two ads featuring Ady Barkan, an ALS-stricken activist, who has launched a campaign to hold Republicans accountable for the GOP tax cuts. Barkan and the Working Families Party maintain that the cuts, which added $1.5 trillion to the national debt, have created the political impetus for Republicans to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.","“There is no such a thing as a safe Republican seat this year,” Barkan said in a statement late Tuesday night. “Dr. Hiral Tipirneni overcame the odds to come within striking distance of victory in a deep red district, because the Republicans put their donors’ greed ahead of the health of families like mine.”","For Arizona Democrats, Tipirneni’s bid was a useful vehicle to lay the groundwork for long-term gains in the state. The state party erected a field office and dedicated staffers to assisting Tipirneni, enabling it to identify and engage voters as it looks to races where Democrats enjoy more favorable odds.","Democrats have a serious shot in November of flipping the Arizona state Senate, where the GOP has a four-seat edge. The party plans to target at least six GOP-held state Senate seats, and has fielded promising candidates for an open U.S. Senate seat as well, including Rep. Kyrsten Sinema and Deedra Abboud, an attorney and Muslim civil rights advocate.","The same factors that propelled Tipirneni’s bid are likely to remain in play in November. Tipirneni benefited from a highly energized Democratic electorate, led by suburban women, many of whom are active in the countless “Resistance” groups that have popped up in the wake of Trump’s election.","Many of the Democratic activists had already mobilized against a private school voucher bill that Lesko helped shepherd into law. Grassroots resistance to the measure has won voters the opportunity to decide its fate on the November ballot, suggesting it could help Democrats running then as well.","A closely related fight over teacher pay and public school funding has also generated activism that redounded to Tipirneni’s benefit and could well continue through the fall. Arizona teachers are due to hold a statewide walkout on Thursday as part of an ongoing movement to protest what they contend is low pay and inadequate school funding.","Ann Teeters Johnson, a retiree from Sun City West and member of the grassroots group Rogue Democratic Women, described an excitement among the region’s Democrats that she had never seen before.","The race has “already done some magic” for local Democrats, she said. “Because there is a primary and an election again so soon, I think it would carry over.”","Kevin Robillard contributed reporting."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5adfdd3c1a00004300cdcc1b.jpeg?cache=9kfe5EVuBc&ops=crop_0_5_1332_1599%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"What Care For The Criminally Insane Can Teach Us About Mental Health Treatment","authors":"Stateline, Editorial Partner","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-care-for-the-criminally-insane-can-teach-us-about_us_5ae08c34e4b05ce9b1ff49c3","short_description":"Those judged to be criminally insane often receive better mental health treatment than practically anybody else — including people who have never committed a crime.","date":"2018-04-25"},"articleContent":["By Michael Ollove","PORTLAND, Ore. — In the midst of a harrowing psychotic episode in summer 2009, Annie broke into her ex-husband’s house and used a hammer and scissors to lay waste to plates, knickknacks, clothing, “and honestly, I don’t know what else.”","Had the mother of four, a retired captain in the National Guard, chosen to plead guilty, as a first offender she might have gotten off with the six months she’d already spent in jail.","Instead, she chose to accept the verdict of “guilty except for insanity” — Oregon’s version of the insanity defense. For Annie, who asked that her real name not be used because she fears being stigmatized, that meant accepting state supervision until 2029, when she will be 68.","She has no doubt she made the right choice.","“If I had been released with the hallucinations I had then … I wouldn’t be alive today,” said Annie, an outgoing redhead who during a recent interview wore a black blouse festooned with ladybugs.","About 14 percent of state and federal prisoners (about 200,000) and 26 percent of jailed inmates (about 190,000) have serious mental illnesses, according to a report last year by the U.S. Department of Justice. Prison and jail officials don’t have the resources to treat them, and many deteriorate behind bars.","By contrast, in some states those judged to be criminally insane receive better mental health treatment than practically anybody else — including people who have never committed a crime.","This is especially true in Oregon, according to the Treatment Advocacy Center, an Arlington, Virginia, nonprofit that advocates for those with severe mental illness.","Oregon’s Psychiatric Security Review Board oversees the care of the criminally insane from the time they receive the verdict until they are discharged from state care. During that period, which can go on indefinitely for someone serving a life sentence, the board supervises the treatment plan and determines when a person is ready for a less secure facility and, eventually, conditional release.","In Oregon, that final stage includes not just clinical treatment but supportive housing and help with job hunting, transportation, budgeting and grocery shopping.","“The amount of contact they have with clinicians and support staff is much, much higher than anyone in community mental health would get,” said Katrina Bennett, clinical director of criminally insane patients at Cascadia Behavioral Healthcare.","Cascadia provides outpatient mental health care to about 18,000 people a year in the Portland area. Among them are about 70 people found guilty except for insanity, mostly from the Oregon State Hospital in Salem.","Not many states match Oregon in caring for the criminally insane, according to the Treatment Advocacy Center. Only three states — Arizona, Connecticut and Washington — have a centralized authority comparable to Oregon’s Psychiatric Security Review Board.","Four states — Idaho, Kansas, Montana and Utah — don’t allow an insanity defense, so defendants with extreme mental illness usually are sent to prison instead of being hospitalized and treated. Others, including Idaho, Indiana, Massachusetts, New Mexico, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Texas, do not have conditional release laws.","Oregon’s model of intense care and supervision is not cheap: Caring for a patient at the Oregon State Hospital costs between $383,000 and $437,000 annually, according to the Oregon Health Authority. Conditional release supervision costs between $30,000 and $157,000 a year.","It has, however, yielded impressive results. Over the past five years, the rate of recidivism for those on conditional release in Oregon after a verdict of criminal insanity is 0.47 percent. By comparison, one report put the recidivism rate among all Oregon ex-inmates, whether mentally ill or not, at about 18 percent.","The irony of intensive care for the criminally insane is not lost on those who study the subject. “You shouldn’t have to be found guilty except for insanity to get high quality care,” said Lisa Dailey, the legislative and policy counsel at the Treatment Advocacy Center.","‘Keep the Public Safe’","Across the United States each year, about 1,500 patients who committed felony crimes and were judged to be criminally insane are released from state psychiatric hospitals.","The criminally insane force states to perform a delicate balancing act. They have committed felonies, sometimes violent ones, so states are wary of returning them to communities where they might endanger others. At the same time, states recognize the responsibility to treat, rather than punish, those patients.","There is little data on recidivism among the criminally insane after they leave state supervision. But a 2016 study of Connecticut’s conditional release program, which is similar to Oregon’s, found that it lowered recidivism rates.","“Our mandate is to keep the public safe,” said Sid Moore, acting director of Oregon’s Psychiatric Security Review Board. “Comprehensive treatment that acknowledges their offense but also their humanity is how we maintain public safety.”","The stakes in getting it right are enormously high. In the past 18 months in Oregon, two men who were found guilty except for insanity and were eventually released were subsequently charged with murder in separate incidents. In both cases, the psychiatric board faced withering criticism for endangering the community. In response, the board added another layer of psychiatric review for those under consideration for conditional release.","The success stories, which are far more numerous, don’t make headlines.","Bobby, who was charged with a sex offense involving children he was babysitting, pleaded guilty except for insanity in 2008, when he was 18. Bobby, who asked that his last name not be used, said he’s been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of being abused as a child.","After three and a half years in the state psychiatric hospital, which he described as torture, he was conditionally released and ultimately came to Cascadia, which provided him with clinical treatment, housing and other services.","On this day, wearing a hat from the Home Depot, where he works as a parking lot attendant, Bobby described himself as something he never expected he’d be: happy. He said he’s learned to control his behavior, particularly his angry outbursts. “I have a 40-hour-a-week job, a great relationship going on two years, I’m driving.","“I’m doing great.”","Request Denied","On a crisp morning last month, Oregon’s Psychiatric Security Review Board met on the grounds of the Oregon State Hospital, where “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest” was filmed. The board has 10 members, who sit in groups of three for hearings. On the panel were a psychiatrist, a psychologist and an attorney.","On the agenda were several cases of people requesting to move from the hospital to conditional release, or even complete discharge. The patients all had a state-appointed attorney, and the state was represented by an assistant attorney general.","Hospitalized patients and those on conditional release can ask for a change in their status once every six months. If the patient makes no such requests, the board reviews the status of each hospitalized patient every two years and every five years for those on conditional release. The board considers the mental status of the patient, the seriousness of the crime committed, and the risk that the patient might harm others if released.","One case this morning involved a young man with shoulder-length dark hair and glasses who had landed in the hospital after robbing cigarettes from a convenience store claiming — falsely — that he had a gun. A hospital psychiatrist testified to the board that the young man, diagnosed as bipolar, had cooperated and was engaged in his treatment.","In requesting a conditional release, the 22-year-old told the board, “I’ve really worked on my impulsivity, and my substance abuse issues I’ve gotten a handle on.” He said he had improved insight into his mental illness.","But the prosecutor, in questioning the witnesses, brought up two incidents. The young man had broken his glasses and smashed his hand into a suggestion box when nurses wouldn’t permit him to smoke. He’d also hatched a scheme to assault another patient in the hopes that patient would kill him.","After a brief consultation, the board returned and the chairwoman told the young man his request was rejected. They wanted to give his new medications more time to work and to see how he did when given privileges, such as trips away from the hospital. “This is what we think is in your best interests,” she said. “Keep up the good work.”","On this day, the board rejected all requests for a change in status. And it revoked the conditional release of a patient who appeared to have stopped taking his medications.","Patients from the Portland area who are on conditional release most likely have received services from Cascadia. Unless approved to live on their own or with family, they are assigned housing, which entails various levels of security and staffing. Many live in group homes in neighborhoods around the city, some with staff on duty 24 hours a day.","Each patient has a program of clinical treatment, most of it at a Cascadia facility in southeast Portland, the Hope Center. Patients are required to participate in at least 20 hours a week of structured activity. For some, this can be work, school or volunteering.","For others, it’s group sessions, which might be devoted to life skills such as good hygiene, how to ride a bus, how to open a bank account, and how to shop for groceries. There are addiction and anger management groups. There are also painting, writing and recreation classes.","A treatment team monitors each patient’s progress. Case managers carry about a dozen cases at a time, lower than an average mental health case load.","Annie has progressed to what is called semi-independent living. She lives in a group home where staff is on duty eight hours a day. She is driving again and owns a car. She sits on the board of a community organization that provides peer support for those in recovery. She plans to pursue a master’s degree in counseling.","But she has no plans to request a discharge from state jurisdiction.","“I am not ready yet,” she said.","CORRECTION: Because of inaccurate information provided to Stateline, an earlier version of this story erroneously described the review process used by the Psychiatric Security Review Board. It conducts reviews every two years for hospitalized patients and every five years for those on conditional release.","Stateline home page","Sign up for exclusive state policy reporting and research"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ae08ce92000001900b8f9c9.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Missouri Senate Panel Considers Declaring Porn A Public Health Threat","authors":"Alanna Vagianos","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/missouri-senate-porn-public-health-threat_us_5ae0c605e4b055fd7fc75ad2","short_description":"The bill claims porn use increases the \"likelihood that individuals will engage in group intercourse,” among other things.","date":"2018-04-25"},"articleContent":["A Missouri Senate committee is considering a resolution that would deem pornography a public health threat.","A group of state senators reviewed the resolution during a Tuesday hearing of the rules and ethics committee, according to The St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Republican state Sen. Ed Emery proposed the resolution in March.","The bill, Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 52, says it aims to recognize the “societal harms brought by pornography and the need for education, prevention, research and policy change.” Among its reasons to declare porn a public health threat are porn addiction, the “hypersexualization of teenagers,” pornography’s equation of “violence with sex and pain with pleasure,” “increased likelihood that individuals will engage in group intercourse” and porn’s possible contribution to “emotional and medical illnesses.”","In a statement last week, Emery suggested that porn may have been a reason Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens, a fellow Republican, had an extramarital affair with a woman and allegedly blackmailed her to keep her quiet.","“What is unveiled by a personal moral failure may be a reflection of a disturbing and invasive social evil ― that of the proliferation of pornography and modern culture’s ambivalence toward it,” Emery said of the scandal. “Far too often, such behavior grows out of an exposure to pornography.”","Greitens admitted to the affair, but in a separate statement through his lawyer denied the blackmail claim.","Porn can be problematic because it often depicts violence against women and is a main source of sex education for teenagers. But viewing pornography is a form of safe sex and can be a low-risk way for someone to explore new things. Research has shown that using porn increases sexual satisfaction and helps people find out what turns them on.","No action was taken during the committee hearing on Tuesday.

Don Beyer (D-Va.) told the crowd.","Pruitt is scheduled to appear before a pair of House committees on Thursday, where he is expected to face tough questions about his numerous ethical scandals and seemingly lavish use of taxpayer money. Among other things, federal watchdogs are probing Pruitt’s travel aboard private planes, the purchase of a $43,000 soundproof phone booth for his office, his 24-hour security detail and a sweetheart deal in which he rented a room in a luxury Capitol Hill condo for just $50 per night.","Initially, President Donald Trump defended Pruitt, tweeting that he was “doing a great job.” But the administration’s support appears to be withering. Bloomberg reported Tuesday that White House officials were warning Republicans against defending the EPA chief. And on Wednesday an official told E&E News that “staff believe pretty uniformly that this guy is going to be fired soon.”","For many gathered at the Federal Triangle on Wednesday, Pruitt’s dogged efforts to roll back environmental protections are more problematic than any ethical lapse.","Nate James, an 18-year staffer at the EPA and president of AFGE Local 3331, a bargaining unit representing some 3,000 employees at EPA headquarters, told HuffPost that employees are dedicated to the agency’s mission regardless of who’s in charge. But under Pruitt’s wing, he said, staffers are increasingly afraid to speak the truth.","“We’ve done everything we can to remain focused, to continue to accomplish the mission,” he said. “But it’s difficult with the budget cuts. It’s difficult with the reduction to the workforce. It’s difficult when you tell what science really says, then see people who bring those truths forward eliminated from service. That’s a very frightening environment to work in.”","Pruitt’s deregulatory blitz has repeatedly hit legal snares, and at least 10 of his rollbacks were blocked by courts. But scientists say his efforts to reshape the EPA’s science advisory boards and alter the way the agency uses research to write regulations could have lasting effects. In October, he barred scientists who receive EPA grants from serving on the agency’s advisory boards, effectively clearing the way for industry-friendly researchers to dominate the oversight panels. On Tuesday, Pruitt proposed a new rule that would limit the use of public health studies in writing regulations, a strategy to cripple fossil fuel industry rules on air pollution cribbed from the tobacco industry’s playbook. Tom Burke, a Johns Hopkins University professor and former EPA adviser, told HuffPost the regulation threatened to send the country back to “the Dark Ages.”","Another employee who attended Wednesday’s rally said they’ve watched many administrators come and go, and all of them were changed by the job, usually after coming face-to-face with a serious environmental disaster. So far, the staffer hasn’t seen that from Pruitt, but remains hopeful he will come to recognize the untapped potential of the agency and the opportunity he has to be a leader.","“Right now he’s trying to change us,” the staffer said. “We’re too busy to be changed.”","A representative of the American Federation of Government Employees, a labor union representing 700,000 federal and D.C. government employees, estimated at least 30 EPA employees joined the rally. The event featured speeches from representatives of environmental groups and several members of Congress.","Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) said that instead of focusing on Pruitt and his scandals, he wanted to speak directly to EPA workers, whom he called the “last line of defense for clean air, clean water, a breathable, livable society.”","“We are with you in the fight … We are 100 percent behind you,” he said.","Alex Kaufman contributed to this report."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ae0da7d2000002e00b8fa85.jpeg?cache=EQpcK0b05u&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Steven Mnuchin Sure Seemed To Enjoy The Eclipse He Claimed Not To Care About","authors":"David Moye","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/steve-mnuchin-eclipse-photo_us_5ae099dee4b07560f397fffe","short_description":"“Being a New Yorker, I don’t have any interest in watching the eclipse,\" he previously said.","date":"2018-04-25"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"LATINO VOICES","headline":"What Life Looks Like For A Toddler Growing Up In A Mexican Women's Prison","authors":"Irene Caselli and Melissa Lyttle","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-its-like-to-be-a-toddler-inside-a-mexican-womens-prison-photos_us_5adf5ef3e4b07be4d4c55619","short_description":"“It’s the strength that God sent me to keep going while in prison.\"","date":"2018-04-25"},"articleContent":["CHIHUAHUA CITY, Mexico ― Melissa is 18 months old, and she lives in the Aquiles Serdán female state prison in Chihuahua City, Mexico. The chubby toddler hides behind her mother’s legs when strangers address her, but she is at ease surrounded by the inmates.","When her mother, inmate Barbara Sánchez, attends her Zumba class in the morning, Melissa observes as the women dance. She stands around while the women dance. In the afternoon, after her nap, she watches Spongebob on a small television in the cell her mother shares with two other women.","“It’s the strength that God sent me to keep going while in prison,” said Sánchez. “When I found out I was pregnant, it made me very happy.”","Sánchez, 27, was charged with being an accomplice to kidnapping six years ago after police arrested her former husband on abduction-related charges. Sánchez says she was unaware of his real occupation and played no part in the crime, but she was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Her former husband is serving a 20-year sentence.","Mexico’s violence, which has been fuelled in part by the intensifying war on drugs in the last decade, is increasingly affecting women. A recent study from the Mexican feminist organization Equis found a 103.3 percent increase in women imprisoned for drug-related crimes between 2014 and 2016. While some women are willing collaborators with their partners, others are forced to take part in the crimes.","Twelve children, including Melissa, are housed with 167 women inmates in the Aquiles Serdán Social Rehabilitation Center. Children are allowed to stay with their mothers until they are three or four years old, depending on when the mother was arrested. Some women were pregnant when they were arrested, but others got pregnant while in custody; most of Mexico’s prisons allow conjugal visits.","Melissa is Sánchez’s fourth child, and the second born in prison. When she was arrested, she was six months pregnant. Her baby boy was born premature, and the prison authorities took him from her, arguing that he could not receive proper care within the prison. Her son now lives with her ex-husband’s family in Ciudad Juárez, some 230 miles away. He doesn’t know that Sánchez is his mother.","But things were different with Melissa, who has a different father. The authorities allowed Sánchez to keep her baby daughter because there were no health complications. Though Melissa will leave the prison before Sánchez serves her full sentence, she is happy that they have a relationship. “She will know that I am her mother,” she says.","Sánchez said she is grateful for the support she receives raising Melissa in prison, but she still worries her daughter will be taken away from her. She also hopes that growing up with her in prison will serve as a cautionary tale.","“I am in here because I was naive,” she says. “This place has taught me a lot about life, even if it’s in a hard way.”","In the United States, nine states operate prison nursery programs: California, Illinois, Indiana, Nebraska, New York, Ohio, South Dakota, Washington and West Virginia. There, mothers and children are usually given separate units to live. In Mexico, however, children grow up within the main correctional facility, following their mothers’ regular routine. Rules about how long children can stay in prison vary from state to state. In Mexico City, for example, children can stay with their mothers until they are 6 years old.","There are between 300 and 600 children living in Mexico’s federal and state-run prisons, according to the Mexican nongovernmental organization Reinserta. These children are often “invisible,” the group says. Prison authorities do not account for them in their budgets, and often children do not have their own beds or food allocations. Mothers often rely on their families outside or on charities for food, clothes and toys.","Children in the Aquiles Serdán prison can see a pediatrician in the in-house clinic, and there are donated cribs, strollers, toys and baby food. When the children are a little older, like Melissa, they share a bed with their mothers.","Fernanda Moreno plays with fellow inmate Saira Durán’s 9-month-old daughter, Isaura. “Isaura is the owner of this bunker,” says Moreno.","“Imagine waking up and seeing this child smiling in this place,” says Deira Silva, another inmate. “She lights up the whole cell.”","The three women share a cell, and Moreno and Silva have become Isaura’s resident aunties.","“It’s been hard to have her here, but I am happy,” says Durán. “She gives me motivation and makes the time in here go by faster.”","Studies have recognized the positive psychological effects on mothers.","“It provides a huge emotional support,” said Macario Vela Corral, the on-site psychologist at the Aquiles Serdán prison. “It is important for them to have someone else to look after.”","There are not, however, clear studies on how living in a prison affects the children, and Vela Corral is concerned about how suitable the prison is for children.","“They are locked up, and children shouldn’t be locked up,” said Vela Corral. “They did not commit a crime.”","But prisons are part of life, says inmate Areli Estrada, 42, a former certified public accountant awaiting sentencing on a fraud conviction. She says she has learned a lot from being incarcerated. She shares a cell with her daughter, Maria Jose, who is one and half.","“No matter how bad this is, it gave me time to reflect, to look at my mistakes, to understand what I had done wrong,” says Estrada. “Of course the children are not guilty. They are little innocent creatures. But now what they need is to be with their mothers, independently from the place.

Investigators believe those homicides are connected to at least 10 others committed by the same individual.","“We all knew that we were looking for a needle in a haystack, but we also all knew that the needle was there,” Schubert said.","Police arrested DeAngelo, of Citrus Heights, in front of his home in Sacramento on Tuesday. He is being held without bail on two counts of murder for the 1978 killings of Brian and Katie Maggiore, police said. Investigators did not say whether DeAngelo has said anything since his arrest.","The suspect looked “very surprised” but was taken into custody “without incident,” said Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones at the press conference.","Officials in Ventura County filed two additional capital murder charges against DeAngelo on Wednesday morning, the county’s District Attorney Greg Totten said. These charges were for the March 1980 murders of Charlene and Lyman Smith; and they included three special circumstances: multiple murder convictions, murder during the commission of a rape, and murder during the commission of a burglary.","Authorities said the series of rapes attributed to the media-dubbed East Area Rapist were linked to the Golden State killer in the early 2000s.","Schubert noted that DeAngelo’s DNA has been connected to other crimes and said further charges are likely to come. DeAngelo’s alleged crimes span some 10 counties, Schubert added. Authorities have yet to determine the jurisdiction in which he will be tried.","Jones also confirmed previous reports that DeAngelo formerly served as a police officer, first with the Exeter Police Department from 1973 to 1976 and then with the Auburn Police Department from 1976 until he was fired in 1979 after being charged for shoplifting.","The sheriff added that police had interviewed several of DeAngelo’s family members, though he did not specify their relation to the suspect.","Jane Carson-Sandler, a woman who suspects she was sexually assaulted by the East Area Rapist in 1976, told The Associated Press a retired detective contacted her on Wednesday and notified her a suspect was in custody.","“I have just been overjoyed, ecstatic,” Carson-Sandler told the AP. “It’s an emotional roller coaster right now. I feel like I’m in the middle of a dream and I’m going to wake up, and it’s not going to be true. It’s just so nice to have closure and to know he’s in jail.”","The Sacramento Bee interviewed a neighbor of DeAngelo, and she was quoted on Wednesday as saying it’s “terrifying” to think about living next door to a possible serial killer.","“This man could have hopped the fence and come into my backyard,” said Beth Walsh, who reportedly lives behind DeAngelo on an adjacent street. “I have children. I’m glad to know they caught this guy.”","Paul Sanchietti, another neighbor of DeAngelo, described him as “odd.”","When “he was aggravated or upset, his voice would carry. His swearing was alarming,” Sanchietti told The Sacramento Bee.","For years, the unsolved crimes incited a fear among California’s residents and a passion for justice among law enforcement and victims’ families. Bruce Harrington, whose brother and sister-in-law were among the killer’s victims, helped organize and finance a voter initiative that led to the 2004 passage of Proposition 69, which required the collection of DNA samples from anyone convicted of a felony, or arrested for or charged with certain other crimes.","“It is time for the victims to begin to heal,” Harrington said, speaking at the press conference on Wednesday.","Asked by reporters present at the press conference where officials had obtained DeAngelo’s DNA, Schubert and Smith only said they were able to find the suspect using a “discarded DNA sample.”","According to the FBI, the series of crimes began in 1976, with several burglaries and rapes in the Sacramento suburbs of Rancho Cordova and Carmichael.","“The [suspect] gained entry into the homes of his victims by prying open a window or door while they slept,” the FBI said in a 2016 press release. “He would then shine a flashlight into the face of his victims, tie up the female victim and, if a male victim was present, tied him up as well.”","Upon ransacking the residence, the suspect would rape the female victims, some of whom were later taunted with menacing phone calls from the suspect, investigators said.","The suspect allegedly turned to murder in 1978, with a couple who was shot and killed while walking their dog in Rancho Cordova. The rapes and murders continued until 1986, when police say they stopped just as suddenly as they’d begun.","The case received renewed media attention earlier this year with the publication of the book I’ll Be Gone in the Dark, by the late Michelle McNamara.

In those posts ― written in 2007 for The Reid Report, a politics blog Reid kept during her years as a morning talk show host in Florida ― she repeatedly accused then-Florida Gov. Charlie Crist (D) of being a closeted gay man.","“As someone who is not a member of the LGBT community, I regret the way I addressed the complex issue of the closet and speculation on a person’s sexual orientation with a mocking tone and sarcasm,” Reid wrote in her statement in December. “It was insensitive, tone deaf and dumb.”","Last week, @Jamie_Maz shared new screenshots that allegedly feature dozens more anti-LGBTQ posts from Reid’s old blog, as Mediaite first reported on Monday. While the blog itself has been shut down for several years, the amateur sleuth allegedly accessed the posts via the Internet Archive, a nonprofit dedicated to building a massive digital library known as the Wayback Machine.","Some of the most damning posts claimed “most straight people cringe at the sight of two men kissing” and that “adult gay men tend to be attracted to very young, post-pubescent types.”","In response to the new screenshots, Reid issued a statement on Monday denying having authored them and claiming her personal blog had been hacked.","According to her statement:","In December I learned that an unknown, external party accessed and manipulated material from my now-defunct blog, The Reid Report, to include offensive and hateful references that are fabricated and run counter to my personal beliefs and ideology.\n\nI began working with a cyber-security expert who first identified the unauthorized activity, and we notified federal law enforcement officials of the breach. The manipulated material seems to be part of an effort to taint my character with false information by distorting a blog that ended a decade ago.\n\nNow that the site has been compromised I can state unequivocally that it does not represent the original entries. I hope that whoever corrupted the site recognizes the pain they have caused, not just to me, but to my family and communities that I care deeply about: LGBTQ, immigrants, people of color and other marginalized groups.","A representative for Reid’s MSNBC show also told HuffPost on Monday that the alleged hacking was subject to an ongoing federal investigation. When asked to clarify which federal agency was handling the case, the representative responded Wednesday that Reid’s “team brought the matter to the attention of the FBI and we are respectfully letting that process play itself out.”","“By policy, the FBI neither confirms nor denies the existence of investigations,” the FBI told HuffPost in an email Wednesday.","Reid’s attorney, John H. Reichman, said in a statement Wednesday that the FBI confirmed opening an investigation into the matter.","“We have received confirmation the FBI has opened an investigation into potential criminal activities surrounding several online accounts, including personal email and blog accounts, belonging to Joy-Ann Reid,” Reichman said in the statement. “Our own investigation and monitoring of the situation will continue in parallel, and we are cooperating with law enforcement as their investigation proceeds.”","Links to the resurfaced posts stopped working around mid-February, according to @Jamie_Maz and SplinterNews, making it difficult for HuffPost to confirm their legitimacy.","HuffPost also obtained letters sent in December by Reid’s lawyer to Internet Archive and Google, requesting metadata about the blog and information regarding login attempts.","Internet Archive published a blog post on Tuesday stating that Reid’s lawyers approached the group in December to ask about removing archives of Reid’s blog, claiming “fraudulent” posts were “inserted into legitimate content.” Internet Archive denied the request, saying it “found nothing to indicate tampering or hacking of the Wayback Machine versions.”","“Her attorneys stated that they didn’t know if the alleged insertion happened on the original site or with our archives (the point at which the manipulation is to have occurred, according to Reid, is still unclear to us),” according to Internet Archive’s post on Tuesday.\n\n“At least some of the examples of allegedly fraudulent posts provided to us had been archived at different dates and by different entities,” the statement continued. “We let Reid’s lawyers know that the information provided was not sufficient for us to verify claims of manipulation. Consequently, and due to Reid’s being a journalist (a very high-profile one, at that) and the journalistic nature of the blog archives, we declined to take down the archives.”\n\nFollowing Internet Archive’s correspondence with Reid’s lawyers, Reid’s blog implemented a code that prevented the archive from indexing her blog, the organization said in its statement. Internet Archive did not speculate as to who placed the code.\n\n“That request was automatically recognized and processed by the Wayback Machine and the blog archives were excluded, unbeknownst to us (the process is fully automated),” according to Internet Archive’s statement. “The robots.txt exclusion from the web archive remains automatically in effect due to the presence of the request on the live blog.”\n\nNichols, Reid’s cybersecurity consultant, said Tuesday that there was “significant evidence” indicating the recently circulated posts were never even on the site ― even after the alleged hacking.\n\n“These instances may be the result of screenshot manipulation with the intent to tarnish Ms. Reid’s character,” Nichols said in his statement. “Oddly, there were no responses in the comments section of the entries, despite the inflammatory nature of the posts. If those posts were real, they would have undoubtedly elicited responses from Ms. Reid’s base.”\n\nTwitter user @Jamie_Maz vehemently denied manipulating the screenshots, aside from adding red lines to some of them to highlight particular statements made in the alleged posts.\n\n“Nothing was doctored or altered or created,” @Jamie_Maz told HuffPost. “What you see is what I saw on the Wayback Machine site.”\n\nThe LGBTQ advocacy organization PFLAG announced Tuesday that it was rescinding its Straight for Equality in Media award to Reid in light of the “ongoing investigation” into her blog posts.\n\n“When we extended our invitation to Ms. Reid to honor her at our 45th anniversary celebration, we did so knowing about the blog posts from the late 2000s regarding Charlie Crist,” Jean Hodges, PFLAG’s national president, said in a statement. “We appreciated how she stepped up, took ownership, apologized for them, and did better ― this is the behavior and approach we ask of any ally. However, in light of new information, and the ongoing investigation of that information, we must at this time rescind our award to Ms. Reid.”\n\nThis article has been updated throughout."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5adfa16a2000002d00b8f8ba.jpeg?cache=dFDLlsk6c5&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"'Family Guy' Wickedly Pranks Emmy Voters","authors":"Ron Dicker","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/family-guy-wickedly-pranks-emmy-voters_us_5ae04c78e4b07560f3971a46","short_description":"We hope they're laughing.","date":"2018-04-25"},"articleContent":["Good one, “Family Guy.”","The long-running animated series enlisted its goofy dad, Peter Griffin, to appeal to Emmy voters in a mailer, Deadline reported Tuesday.","A DVD package with Peter and the Hollywood sign on the cover alludes to the cartoon’s long-ago scene mentioning Kevin Spacey and a speech by show creator Seth MacFarlane that included a joke about Harvey Weinstein and actresses.

They also had a much higher risk of suicidal thoughts and self-inflicted injuries than cisgender children and teens.","A second study examined survey data from almost 82,000 high school students in Minnesota and found LGBTQ adolescents were more likely to experience abuse and victimization than heterosexual teens.","While the majority of youth didn’t experience any abuse, bullying or victimization, LGBTQ youth in the study were still more likely to be victims of these behaviors and more apt to experience multiple forms of bullying, abuse, victimization or mistreatment, the study found. LGBTQ teens also tended to experience more severe forms of torment than heterosexual adolescents.","“The more gender nonconformity an adolescent reports, the higher their risk of experiencing abuse,” study author Laura Baams of the University of Groningen in the Netherlands said by email.","For the third study, researchers examined survey data from 2,396 teens and young adults and found lesbian, gay, bisexual and questioning youth were more likely to experience depression than their heterosexual peers.","The increased risk of depression may be explained in part by lower satisfaction with family relationships, greater exposure to cyberbullying and peer victimization, and more unmet medical needs, the study found.","“We know that LGBQ teens face discrimination because of their sexual orientation. In addition they may experience problems with family acceptance and more frequent bullying from peers,” said lead author Jeremy Luk of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development in Rockville, Maryland.","“All of these factors are known risks for mental health problems,” Luk said by email. “Our study identified two additional sources of risk - victimization in cyberspace and unmet medical needs.”","None of the studies were controlled experiments designed to prove whether or how sexual orientation or gender identity might directly impact physical or mental health.","Taken together, however, the studies add to a large and growing body of evidence suggesting that LGBTQ youth are at higher risk for problems such as depression, anxiety, suicide, homelessness and substance abuse, said Dr. Stanley Ray Vance of the Child and Adolescent Gender Center at the University of California, San Francisco.","Parents can be part of the problem, Vance, coauthor of an accompanying editorial, said by email. Some parents may reject their child’s sexuality or gender identity and this may increase the chance of abuse, and other parents may try to change their child out of concern that life might be easier if a kid was heterosexual and gender conforming.","“It should be emphasized that LGBTQ youth are incredibly resilient, but they unfortunately face poor mental health outcomes and adversity,” Vance added. “Their childhood environment and experiences matter and reducing rejection, abuse and other adverse events could potentially make a difference.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ae0999d1a00004400cdcd26.jpeg?cache=ZdtgDIMG7F&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Kirsten Gillibrand Unveils A Public Option For Banking","authors":"Daniel Marans","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kirsten-gillibrand-postal-banking-bill_us_5ae07f9fe4b07be4d4c6feae","short_description":"The idea would provide a low-cost alternative to payday loans -- and it might just save the Postal Service, too.","date":"2018-04-25"},"articleContent":["Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) is introducing legislation Wednesday that would require every U.S. post office to provide basic banking services, an ambitious step aimed at improving the lives of Americans with limited financial resources.","The bill brings to Congress for the first time a policy idea that has already won the support of liberal economists and anti-poverty activists: Turning the nation’s sprawling network of U.S. Postal Service facilities into places where working-class and low-income Americans who lack adequate access to commercial banking can obtain low-cost, short-term loans. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) have both spoken out in favor of postal banking, but Gillibrand is the first to introduce legislation mandating it.","The central goal of the bill is to replace risky financial products like payday loans, which can trap borrowers in prolonged cycles of debt, with regulated alternatives.","“This is a solution to take on payday lenders, to take on the problems that the unbanked have all across the country. It’s a solution whose time has come,” Gillibrand said in an interview with HuffPost.","To hear Gillibrand and other postal banking proponents tell it, the Postal Service and underbanked Americans are the perfect complements.","The postal system’s 30,000 locations touch every community. A majority ― 59 percent ― are in so-called banking deserts, or zip codes that have either no bank branches or just one.","Launching a postal banking system would require startup funding that could either be obtained through a loan from the treasury or a congressional appropriation. Gillibrand’s staff plans to seek an estimate of the cost from the Congressional Budget Office.","A postal banking system could be a major boon to the financially strained Postal Service. If even 10 percent of the money Americans currently spend on interest and fees for risky financial products went toward postal banking loans that cost 90 percent less, the Postal Service would gain almost $9 billion in annual revenue, according to a 2014 study conducted by the Postal Service Inspector General.","“It is really an elegant solution,” said Gillibrand, who emphasized that benefits to the postal system, though significant, were a secondary consideration. “You have a system that already works. And you have the ability to let the unbanked have banking in a way that’s affordable.”","Under Gillibrand’s proposal, Americans could cash paychecks and deposit money in accounts free of charge at each post office location. Deposits would be capped at the larger of two amounts ― $20,000, or the median balance in all American bank accounts.","The postal banks would be able to distribute loans to borrowers of up to $1,000 at an interest rate slightly higher than the yield on one-month Treasury bonds, currently about 2 percent.","A postal banking system would be an alternative to the for-profit payday lending system, in which people routinely pay triple-digit fees to borrow money for bills that come due before their next paycheck. The average payday loan of $375 typically costs a borrower an additional $520 in interest and fees, according to Pew Charitable Trusts.","These costs are disproportionately shouldered by the most vulnerable people in the economy: Lower-earning workers who can’t afford fees that commercial banks levy if an account balance falls too low, or simply live in an area that lacks a traditional banking option. The lack of resources typically precludes these Americans from qualifying for a credit card with a reasonable interest rate.","More than one-quarter of Americans households (34 million homes) are either “unbanked” ― meaning they lack someone with a bank account altogether ― or “underbanked” ― relying on payday loans or other so-called alternative lenders to supplement the services of a traditional bank.","Their predicament shows how expensive it is to be poor in America. The average underbanked household has an annual income of $25,500, and spends nearly 10 percent on alternative financial products and associated fees, according to a 2011 KPMG study.","Due in no small part to racial wealth and income gaps, black and Latino households are more likely to be both unbanked and underbanked. The unbanked rate among black households is 18.2 percent, compared with 7 percent for the population as a whole.","“There is a huge racial justice issue,” Gillibrand said. “The average person who gets a payday loan is a 44-year-old African American single mom. It overwhelmingly affects communities of color.”","Postal banking is not a new idea. In fact, United States post offices provided savings and deposit services for Americans from 1911 to 1967, though it did not provide lending. The postal systems of a host of developed nations provide some basic banking services.","Mehrsa Baradaran, a national authority on postal banking and author of How The Other Half Banks, advised Gillibrand on the legislation.","“It’s the most important thing that we can be doing to make people’s lives easier that is basically cost-free to the taxpayer,” said Baradaran, a professor at the University of Georgia School of Law.","The U.S. Postal Service, as a self-funded federal agency, already has the legal authority to expand its sources of revenue without additional action from Congress.","Gillibrand legislation would add a congressional mandate to speed the process.","“They could do it themselves, but they haven’t chosen to do that in the last 40 years,” she said.","The timing of Gillibrand’s bill is deliberate. In January, Mick Mulvaney, the anti-regulatory ideologue now at the helm of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, shelved a new payday lending rule that had been imposed by his predecessor.","The payday lending industry has showered members of Congress with nearly $14 million in contributions since 2010, including $63,000 to Mulvaney, who left his House seat in 2017 to serve in the Trump White House. (Mulvaney told an audience of bankers on Tuesday that his willingness to speak to industry lobbyists depended on whether, and how much, they had donated to him.)","President Donald Trump this month ordered a review of Postal Service finances that some Democrats, including Gillibrand, fear could lay the groundwork for privatization of the system.","Gillibrand said she anticipates broad support for the legislation in the Senate Democratic Caucus.","“Literally the only person who is going to be against this is somebody who wants to protect payday lender profits,” she said.","Payday lenders’ main trade group, the Community Financial Services Association of America, did not explicitly object to the proposal, however.","“We welcome new entrants into the small dollar credit market provided they will be subject to the same laws and regulations as other lenders in this space,” the group’s CEO, Dennis Shaul, said in a statement. “Greater market competition spurs innovation and drives down costs for consumers, but to date almost all of the attempts to create small-dollar loan alternatives have been charity-based, required government subsidies, or were unprofitable and unsustainable. The private sector remains the best opportunity for serving small dollar, short-term loans.”","Postal banking is the latest progressive policy to find a champion in the U.S. Senate, where rumored 2020 presidential hopefuls are expanding the bounds of the debate.","On Monday, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) announced plans to introduce legislation requiring the federal government to guarantee every American a job. Gillibrand has also voiced support for the idea.","Gillibrand in September was one of 16 Democratic senators to co-sponsor Sanders’ Medicare-for-all legislation creating a single, comprehensive government-run insurance plan for all Americans.","Asked why leading congressional Democrats have embraced sweeping economic reforms once considered marginal in Congress, Gillibrand said, “You need bold ideas to fix some of the structural challenges that we have in our economy today.","“You have so much income inequality,” she continued. “So if you are going to be tinkering around the edges and picking around the margins, you are literally never going to fix the problem.”","This article has been updated to include a statement from the Community Financial Services Association of America CEO."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ae0820c2000002d00b8f9ad.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"'The Handmaid's Tale' Showrunner Wishes The Show Was Irrelevant","authors":"Emma Gray","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/handmaids-tale-season-2-bruce-miller_us_5adf9210e4b07be4d4c58f3e","short_description":"Bruce Miller talks Me Too, race in Gilead and why \"The Handmaid's Tale\" will never be torture porn.","date":"2018-04-25"},"articleContent":["“The road to hell is a lot scarier when you realize you had this chance to get off of it at some point, and you didn’t recognize it,” Bruce Miller, showrunner of “The Handmaid’s Tale,” told me.","It was hard not to wonder whether he was talking about the fictional world of Gilead or America in 2018.","“The Handmaid’s Tale” ― a show that can feel terrifyingly on-the-nose ― is set in a brutal dystopian future in which childbearing women’s bodies are treated as reproductive hosts for the theocratic society’s most powerful (cis, white, male, Christian) leaders. Now in its sophomore season, the Hulu show is exploring what happens to Offred (Elisabeth Moss) and her friends after the events laid out in the Margaret Atwood novel upon which the series is based.","Season 2, which premiered on April 25, offers up more information about the creation of Gilead, the colonies that subsidize it, and the internal dynamics of the punishing society.","Ahead of the premiere, HuffPost spoke with Miller about the pressures of offering definitive answers to a beloved feminist story, the Me Too movement’s influence on the production of the show, and why the show is watchable despite being the most stressful thing on television.","Season one of “The Handmaid’s Tale” essentially ended where Margaret Atwood’s novel did. I’d love to hear from you a little bit about the process of creating Season 2 where there was no Atwood roadmap.","I think there was an Atwood roadmap. We’re certainly living in her world ― the world that she created with the characters she created. Even more important, there’s that kind of Atwood-ness, the way the stories are told and what themes they explore. We tried very hard to get our heads around that the first season so that we could continue that in the second season. Normally, in a television show, you don’t have anything to go on. The other thing [is], I read the book a long time ago. Everybody I know who reads the book is furious when it ends, because they’re dying to know what happens next. I spent 35 years thinking about Season 2, since I read the book.","Well, in Season 2 we get a definitive answer to the question of what happens next. The book, however, ends on a note where you can interpret it in many ways. Were you at all nervous about the responsibility of giving that answer?","I’ll give you two answers. First of all, I’m nervous about everything. I’m a guy adapting one of the great feminist works of forever, who the hell do I think I am? Of course I’m nervous. I’m nervous all the time.","But in this case, I think that Margaret was so encouraging to me and to the writing staff, so enthusiastic about the stuff that we were coming up with, very encouraging to us to break rules and go in this direction and that direction. She’s such a storyteller, such a writer’s writer. In some ways we were more nervous about mucking up her vision of the future, her vision of the world, but in the end, that really gave us a lot of confidence to move forward and say, OK, the person who created this world is not trying to break down our office and beat us with a stick. Maybe we’re coming up with stuff that could be good.","So, yes, you’re terrified. It’s scary to start out adapting such a sacred book, and then it’s terrifying to continue to adapt [it], especially after people liked the first season. If people hate the first season, there’s nothing to lose. People like it, they want to see what happens next, and we want to make sure that they are satisfied.","How much was Margaret Atwood involved in plotting out this season?","As much as I could possibly pull her off her ... [pauses] She has this whole other job as an author.","Right, that.","Margaret and I started talking about Season 2 really halfway through Season 1. Once you start planning in your head how Season 1 might end ― and I knew where it was going to end ― I started to talk to her about things that I thought I might do. She was close to the writers at the beginning of the season. I think she’s a little busier this year, but she still reads every script and every outline and calls with thoughts and sees cuts as they get finished.","I take as much time as I can get. I want to grow up to be Margaret. We’re excited by any involvement she’s willing to bestow upon us. It’s obviously essential. It’s beyond counsel. This is Margaret’s world, we just live in it.","At the Women in the World conference, Margaret Atwood said that her one rule for Season 2, which is obviously the same rule she had for the book, was that everything had to have actually happened somewhere, sometime. Can you reveal any specific examples from Season 2 that you drew from history or current events?","I am a very strict adherent to her philosophy. It was something she used for the book. It’s what keeps [the show] from turning into torture pornography, and we’re not interested in making something that’s torturous for the sake of being torturous. I would be sick to my stomach if that’s what we ended up doing. We definitely try to show as little as possible when we do those things. Just enough to tell the story and make the emotions hit.","But there’s a scene very late in the season where two people get thrown in a swimming pool with their legs tied to weights. It’s a very updated version of a very old concept ― they would have wells where they would throw the witches. They would throw them in there, I think [they were called] dunking wells, to drown them. That’s how they would execute women, [because it] was considered nicer. No hanging or cutting heads off. No blood. Which to me just sounds like a horrible misunderstanding of what it probably feels like to drown.","Our modern version is in a swimming pool and they’re chained to kettlebells. The type you’d find at the gym. It’s updated in a horrible way, but it’s very much tied to a legal remedy that’s been around for a very long time, focused very much on women.","Are we going to see more about the way that racial dynamics operate in Gilead this season?","Absolutely. When we adapted the book, I made the decision to not make it an all-white world, as it was in the book, but to add diversity into Gilead to make it represent people of color visually and narratively in that world. We’ve been lucky that we have amazing characters and amazing actors and so we’re able to follow lots of different characters and we do that a lot more this season. The first season was so focused on Offred.","I know that there was criticism in the first season [about how the show handled race]. I think me and all the writers took that to heart. It was very reasoned, thoughtful ― the internet gets a bad rap, but boy, they were very thoughtful and smart and polite and interested and seemingly trying to be helpful. It was a very helpful conversation for us to witness.","Moving forward, we’re trying more and more to integrate race into the stories and address race in the stories, and I think we’ll hopefully keep improving. I think we did better this year than last year, and we’re always energized that there’s places to go in the show. The last thing we want to do is ignore something interesting. So, in a show that covers religion and women’s sovereignty over their own bodies and politics, we certainly have a lot of heavy loads. It’s always daunting to take on even those, but we’re thrilled that we have interesting places to go in Gilead still.","Last year, watching the show, it felt sometimes terrifyingly on-the-nose. Do you feel like this season is going to resonate with audiences in that same eerie, prescient way?","God, it would be so lovely if it was completely irrelevant. That would be really, really nice. It’s hard for me to comment on how people are going to consume the show and how they’re going to put it in their life and how it’s going to affect them. [Season 2] certainly affected me more than Season 1.","I think it’s partially because we’re getting revelations all the time about what kind of government we have, and I think those revelations can’t help but make you think about what’s happening in Gilead and how the precursors to an upheaval in government, what they feel like to go through. We cover that a bit more in Season 2, the lead-up to Gilead. I certainly couldn’t watch the season without feeling those connections, but I’m not going to tell anybody else what connections to feel. If they don’t see it and they get something else out of the show, God bless. I just want them to feel something.","The world of “The Handmaid’s Tale” is really bleak in a lot of ways, but the arc of Season 1, in some capacity, felt like it was leading toward hopefulness. Did you worry at all about having to undo that hopefulness for Season 2?","I worried about it and I didn’t want to do it. I don’t like that two steps forward, one step back, just to reset so you can have another season that has the same dynamics. I think that Offred is confronted by moments where she pushes and she has small victories and big victories, and she had lots of them in Season 1. Much of the impossible becomes possible. She never thought she’d see Moira again, she never thought she’d see her daughter again, and those things happened. So I think that even though things get difficult and they ebb and flow on levels of difficulty, I don’t think she was deterred in her hope, in general.","The most inspiring thing about her is that she has her snarky sense of humor, her internal voice. June is very much alive in there and very much strong and still planning and scheming ― and trying to live, not just survive. So as long as we have that, I think we have hope.","I always feel like the show is hopeful because our world is not Gilead. It always makes me feel like, wow, if Offred could make a stand and try to change things in her world, what am I doing sitting on the couch? I should be able to change things in my world. My world’s a lot easier and more friendly and less dangerous than her world. Every time she survives at the end of the episode gives me hope.","As you alluded to, it feels like complacency in the face of rights being encroached upon is one of the themes of Season 2. Is there anything you hope that audiences might take away from seeing the pre-Gilead flashbacks? They sometimes feel more terrifying than the dystopian future.","I agree. Her flashbacks in the book always felt more terrifying. The road to hell is a lot scarier when you realize you had this chance to get off of it at some point and you didn’t recognize it. I’m sure we’re not trying to instruct people on what to do, but you can lay out in a TV show: This is what happened to Offred because she acted in a certain way. That’s the only lesson I can try to lay out, is a lesson for Offred in this particular position.","That I think people extrapolate [from] and generalize to their own lives, is something I don’t feel comfortable doing. That feels like I’m mansplaining the show, trying to shove it down their throats in a certain way and I would hate to do that.","Do you feel like the Me Too movement informed anything about the marketing or the production of this season?","Absolutely. The Me Too movement ― it was our industry. It’s central to who we are, and it’s our friends who were being victimized and our friends who were being accused and having their careers shortened. I know personally as a white guy, I feel like an idiot. You feel like all this stuff was going on in front of your eyes and you didn’t see it and it was happening to the people you are closest to, the people you work with for years and years and you just feel like, how much did I miss?","I go through a lot in my life thinking “what an idiot you’re being,” but this was a particularly bad one. It makes you feel like you’re blind to the stuff that really matters about those people’s lives. Not only was it happening, but they felt, if you didn’t recognize it, they felt like they couldn’t say anything because either [people felt] like it didn’t matter or it was too painful. So the first feeling for me was just shame of being a part of it, a player in a system, and not recognizing how terrible it was being to some people.","I think that our show, we were in a lucky position, because we were already trying so hard for diversity, especially diversity of gender. We had taken a lot of strides for storytelling, narrative reasons that I think would have been the strides I would try to take if the Me Too movement had happened and I had been on another show. We were already trying to hire as many women for as many key positions as possible, just because it was important to our show and our storytelling.","Well thank you so much for chatting with me, I’m excited about this season.","Thank you. Get a bottle of scotch.","I’m stressed out but I’m excited.","That’s perfect. That’s just what I’m looking for.","This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ae0af971a00004300cdcd5d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"James Bay Is Fed Up About Inequality In Music. And He’s Doing Something About It.","authors":"Lauren Moraski","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/james-bay-unity-electric-light_us_5ade3200e4b036e7aeb5700a","short_description":"The singer gets personal with thoughts on unity, his evolution and shedding those longer locks.","date":"2018-04-25"},"articleContent":["In the fall of 2013, James Bay played an intimate gig in New York City as part of the CMJ Music Festival. He was just at the start of his career, performing for maybe a hundred or so people.","“It feels like a short space of time,” he said when I asked him about that CMJ show. “That does in so many respects feel like yesterday, to be where I’m at now and talking to you.”","In the last five years, the English singer has put out multiple EPs and released his full-length debut album, featuring the single “Let It Go.” He’s been nominated for three Grammys, and in March, he made his debut on “Saturday Night Live.” On May 18, he’ll unveil his sophomore album, “Electric Light.” He’s also done away with his signature long hair.","“It’s been a lot of fun,” Bay said about the last few years. “It’s been an amazing journey. I think I’d be a little bit insane if I didn’t think I was still on some sort of ride. I’m only 27, still got so much to do and to prove and all that stuff.”","We caught up about “all that stuff,” along with his thoughts on the Me Too movement and working alongside “Stranger Things” actress Natalia Dyer.","“Electric Light” really feels like a full album. I don’t know if that’s because of the cool commentary throughout it. Is that what you wanted to do ― put out an album that people would listen to you from start to finish?","Yes. I think to some degree. I’ll be honest with you, yes I’ve done that because I’ve grown up seeing albums to be full bodies of work that you’re supposed to listen to start to finish ... I’ve been quite inspired by movies making this album. Some of the soundscapes on some of the tracks are quite cinematic. Of course, there’s the intro dialogue, and there’s interlude dialogue halfway through, which cuts very loosely on some of the running commentary through the lyrics of the album. The other thing I’d say is, yes, it was quite a cinematic atmosphere I was living in, and I was feeling inspired by movies as much as I was other artists and songwriters.","I think movies, in addition to music, can make you feel a specific way. Are there any movies that you’ve seen recently that really made you feel something, that really inspired you?","There’s a big theme on this album I’ve made of unity and the importance of being together with each other, but very much physically … and in the world together, as opposed to just getting in touch with each other through our phones and whatever. I remember I rewatched “Interstellar,” which has some incredible beats and heart-wrenching emotional thread running through it. I remember another movie I saw was a movie called “Detroit” … It was fantastic, but it was pretty excruciating at the same time. It was in response to movies like that and also in response to things that have gone on in my life with relationships and people I know, even extending to one of my first albums that made unity this huge theme in my songwriting. I only realized that after I’ve written the songs. I actually saw ”Call Me by Your Name” very recently. That’s a stunning film. These movies have made me yearn for being with people, in the presence of my friends, as opposed to just being in touch with them, like say, on my phone or something. That isn’t enough. I toured my first album and I had this great heightened sense of unity and togetherness, being in front of massive crowds, what I sing in front of massive crowds, being in rooms with all these people. From the movies I’ve seen to the experiences I’ve had over the last three or four years, it’s that great sense of unity that has inspired the music.","There are specific songs like “Us” that I feel like that unity theme comes through.","It is one of the greater examples of what I’ve just been talking about. It was a wild experience writing that song because it was one of those rare, few magical moments. It just does not happen with every song you write. It might not even happen with the favorite song you’ve ever written. Some songs come in this flash of consciousness, and there’s something a little bit magical about it. An hour or two passes, and you’ve got this song. You don’t quite know how it came together, but it did. It just flowed through. That’s what happened with “Us.” Me and my friend, John, sat down at the beginning of a day to muscle through the day and try and get anything. In the first couple hours, we sat around the piano, and everything fell into place, lyrics included, and the song was born. It was one of those rare moments where you feel like that one was waiting to come. That was the moment that we got lucky enough to be there to receive it.","What do you hope people feel or take away from listening to your new record?","With my music, like with any music, I hope people are moved. There is listening to music. There’s enjoying a song, and then there’s being moved by it, which is a whole other level of experience. I hope that happens to the people that listen to music of mine because that’s a very human feeling. As humans, we’re the only things who we know that we can feel sadness. We can feel happiness, and we can feel all the mad feelings in-between. I hope people look a little deeper into the past in their lives, the future. Like we do when we listen to music, I hope they feel. I hope they express things in response to this music and talk to each other. This is what you want from your music. You want people to cry or laugh or feel brave or feel courage. I want those things.","I also like that introduced this album with a very cool video starring Natalia Dyer on “Wild Love.” What was it like to film that and work alongside her? She’s an actress of the moment right now, obviously, with “Stranger Things.”","Big time. Yes, definitely. It was an absolute honor. She’s an enormous talent. Right at the beginning of her career she used to do things in the public eye with so much talent and so much future potential for whatever she does next. That’s very inspiring. I am by no means an actor, so of course I was terrified and nervous. On top of that, I’m a big “Stranger Things” fan. I was trying to keep my shit together. She’s wonderful as a person. She’s got her head screwed on. She’s very cool, calm and collected and inspiring to be around. As an artist in my own right and her as an artist in her own right, that’s a really cool thing that you get to collaborate in that capacity. I was learning a lot when I had her on set. I was plainly learning a lot. She was walking into my world but bringing her own world in as the pro actor opposite me the absolute novice.","Is there any extra pressure coming out of the gate with your sophomore album following Grammy noms and a hit song?","There’s something in a slightly twisted way that I enjoy about that. I enjoy the pressure. I enjoyed it because it’s very exciting to the music, this fuel to be inspired, to conquer that obstacle of pressure and expectation to not necessarily do the same again. Life is longer than that, and anyone’s career could be longer than one-and-half to two albums. There’s also a place for it. It’s always extremely exciting. I believe eternally in this music that I’ve created. As soon as people get to it, and they are already, it’ll all start to unfold in a way I want it to and I’ve been excited for it to do. Of course, it comes with pressure, but that’s great. If it didn’t come with pressure, none of this would matter. That’s the way that I look at it. What would be the point?","Whose career would you say you admire the most or that you look up to in terms of music?","There’s a few names spring to mind: David Bowie, Michael Jackson, Prince. Beyoncé is a big one as well, because she’s the king and queen of music all rolled into one. She’s the absolute superstar. I think I look at those artists and say “wow” because they dared to do things differently. They pushed their own boundaries beyond what anybody else, any of their diehard fans expected. They trust their fans, and they understand that those fans believe and are wanting to go the distance with them. You need that exciting friction in a relationship with your fans, or with your girlfriend. You need that what’s-going-to-happen-next feeling. If things feel too expected, then again what’s the point? If everybody thinks they know what’s coming and then they get what they thought was coming, it’s going to go quiet or boring pretty quick. Those artists that I named, they’re the ones who have really inspired me since I started listening to music, but particularly since I’ve moved from my first record into my second one.","I was at the Grammys back in January, and it was in the midst of the Me Too movement. I spoke to a lot of artists on the red carpet about that representation. Why do you think it’s, one, important, and what can we do to get more equality in music?","We have to do the most obvious things. The first thing that springs to mind is if you are an employer, whether you’re a man or a woman, and you have two potential employees in front of you ― I think at this stage, if they’re both in the final stages of the interview and one of them is male and one of them is female, employ the female because she’s already gone the distance, has the qualifications and all the things that you need her to have. There are just not enough females in this industry and in many industries. You have to make that stand ... We’re lacking in females in the music industry, in the entertainment industry and all the way up the ladder. Some people will go, “There’s loads in this area of this industry.” That doesn’t matter. There aren’t enough in this other area of this industry. It’s not even. It’s completely unfair at the moment. It’s completely male-led, and it has always been. We’re just waking up now. If we’re going to wake up, we can’t just say, “Yes, I’m woken up. I’m there.” You have to act on it. My own experience, I started touring five years ago. For the first couple years, there were only guys on the bus, and it sucked. It was what was at hand at the time. I was somebody who was nowhere and nobody. It was people recommending people, and me going, “You’ve been recommended. And I just need someone now.” It was always a male person. I took what was there. As soon as I got half a second to think about it and try and calculate it, I went out and found a female keys player, female backing singers, a female guitar tech, something that you don’t find. I have female production manager. It’s not rocket science, just make it happen.","I think you’re an example of someone who make it happen and at such an early part of your career that you’re able to do that. I think there’s a glaring omission.","We’ve covered it in all this unnecessary confusion. There’s no confusion. Just employ women in these industries, in all industries all the way up the ladder to the top. Real simple. Sorry, it’s impossible not to get passionate about it. Isn’t it?","I could hear it in your voice. I know the themes on the record are about unity, but I feel like that almost harkens back to equality in some ways, I suppose.","I think they go hand in hand. I realized a lot of the things that was recorded in hindsight. I just made music, and I just wrote songs about things I was feeling. Then I look back and went, “What am I saying here?”","To what do you feel you owe your success?","It’s endless amounts of hard work. It’s more hard work than I have even come to appreciate yet. I’ll never know how much ― I’ll just have to keep working hard, and that is paired with a little bit of luck. I have no control over the luck. If you work really hard, you can almost make your luck, but there’s always a little bit of luck that’ll be completely out of your control. That’s just the way it goes. Otherwise, you just have to work tirelessly and believe in yourself. It all sounds like cheesy cliché stuff they say in the movies, but it’s true. You got to believe or else no one else will.","What would you say is the biggest misconception or something that people really don’t know about you, having been thrust into the spotlight in the last couple years?","I don’t just play slow sad songs [laughs]. I like playing slow sad songs. I really love that emotional side to making music and to my music. But come to show; you’ll see a lot more. You’ll love it just as much. I almost guarantee it.","A lot of attention had been paid to your hair. Are you surprised that so many people have been asking you about cutting your locks shorter?","In this day and age, unfortunately I’m not surprised, but it’s fine. It’s all hilarious, wonderful and lovely that people want to make something out of that. I named different artists earlier like David Bowie from the past, an artist who often changes his look and his aesthetic. I was inspired by that as much as more recent times. You’ve got Lady Gaga, who’s an artist who does that kind of thing, too. I just think it’s cool that those artists dare to switch it up so drastically and in some cases so frequently. Who wants to be the same person, the exact same person that they were five years ago? Not me. I think it’s more my duty and my responsibility to push boundaries and change than it is to remain the same old thing.","This interview has been edited and condensed.","Bay’s sophomore album, “Electric Light,” comes out on May 18."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ade37901a00002700533dc6.jpeg?cache=NFhuBjNLqi&ops=crop_0_35_1638_1164%2Cscalefit_1280_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"U.S. Press Freedom Ranking Falls Again, Thanks To 'Media-Bashing Enthusiast' Trump","authors":"Marina Fang","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/us-press-freedom-ranking-falls-again-thanks-to-media-bashing-enthusiast-trump_us_5ae06a13e4b061c0bfa3b2d3","short_description":"The annual World Press Freedom Index warns the president's “violent anti-press rhetoric” is having dangerous effects, in the U.S. and abroad.","date":"2018-04-25"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"BLACK VOICES","headline":"Michael Brown’s Mother, Lezley McSpadden, Announces Run For Ferguson City Council","authors":"Alanna Vagianos","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/michael-browns-mother-lezley-mcspadden-considering-running-for-ferguson-city-council_us_5ae0f2b3e4b055fd7fc79d7b","short_description":"“What a legacy that would be ― elected to the City Council and supervising the same police department that killed Michael Brown,\" her attorney said.","date":"2018-04-25"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Trump Signals End Of The World By Chiming In On A Kanye Twitter Thread","authors":"Jenna Amatulli","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kanye-west-kim-k-trump-twitter_us_5ae0b9a8e4b04aa23f1e886d","short_description":"The rapper tweeted out a slew of thoughts on Wednesday, garnering responses from Kim and the president.","date":"2018-04-25"},"articleContent":["President Donald Trump responded to Kanye West’s recent Twitter spree, expressing his gratitude.","The rapper tweeted on Wednesday that his wife, Kim Kardashian West, had instructed him to make it “clear to everyone” that he doesn’t “agree with everything Trump does.”","He also said he doesn’t “agree 100%” with anyone but himself.","West said shortly before, “You don’t have to agree with trump but the mob can’t make me not love him. We are both dragon energy. He is my brother. I love everyone.”","To that, Trump quote-tweeted his gratitude, calling the praise “very cool”:","West shared a series of stream-of-consciousness thoughts on social media Wednesday.","He also shared an image of a Trump-signed MAGA hat:","Last week, the “Famous” singer came back to Twitter after a long hiatus to announce new music with Kid Cudi, Nas and his G.O.O.D. Music labelmates. Since then, he’s been sporadically sharing wisdom, snapshots of his upcoming Yeezy season, snapshots of his home, and his thoughts on Trump and Hillary Clinton.","Arguably the most alarming thing West has shared in the last few days has included recommendations to listen to right-wing activist Candace Owens and snippets of a 22-minute video by Scott Adams, the cartoonist behind “Dilbert” and an “alt-right hero” who has previously shared dismissive views about women.","This last behavior by West even prompted a tweet of support from InfoWars’ Alex Jones.","Kardashian West has responded playfully to many of her huband’s tweets, but hasn’t commented on anything said about alt-right-affiliated figures. She also hasn’t indicated whether or not she found her husband’s effort to clarify his views sufficient.","However, she did respond to the media’s reactions to West’s tweets and fiercely defended his expressiveness:","As Kardashian West notes, there has been speculation that mental health issues were behind her husband’s recent tweets.

It’s not news that previous guests leave germs behind, but you might be surprised to learn where those germs are lurking.","With 14 to 16 rooms to clean in an eight-hour shift, hotel staff don’t usually get much time to clean a room, its linens and appliances from top to bottom ― roughly 30 minutes on average, or less during a busy season. (That’s why it’s important to tip the hotel’s cleaning crew if you’re satisfied with your room’s cleanliness.)","It’s also important to note that unless you have an immune deficiency, the germs you’ll find in your hotel room most likely aren’t dangerous. After all, you’re surrounded by bacteria and viruses everywhere you go, and your chances of getting sick from germs left by other hotel guests are low. Still, it’s important to take precautions and wash your hands regularly.","Here are five items in your room to keep your eye on:","The TV Remote","Admit it: Having access to premium TV channels in your hotel room can be pretty exciting. Or maybe you just like listening to the news or weather while you get ready in the morning. Whatever your preference, the TV remote is likely gross. Hundreds of hands have touched the device, and it’s probably not high on the housekeeping team’s long list of things to clean.","Jim Inglis, Valencia College’s program director for hospitality, told Click Orlando in 2015 that the remote control is usually “hands down No. 1” on the list of dirtiest spots in your hotel room.","That’s consistent with the findings of a team of researchers from the University of Houston, Purdue University and the University of South Carolina. After testing a variety of surfaces in hotel rooms in Texas, Indiana and South Carolina, the researchers reported in 2012 that along with the toilet and bathroom sink, the TV remote contained “high levels of bacterial contamination.”","The Bed Comforter or Duvet","Staff typically changes sheets between guests, but the turnaround for checking in new guests can be so fast that washing large comforters isn’t as easy. As we sleep, we release body oils and shed skin flakes, which can get on the bedspread along with bacteria we might be carrying.","Reneta McCarthy, a lecturer at Cornell University’s School of Hotel Administration, summed up the dilemma in 2011, telling CNN: “If you went through and you had a good system in place and you were trying to deep clean each of your rooms four times a year, is it possible that a bedspread might only be changed four times a year? Yeah, it is.”","Kelly Reynolds, an associate professor of environmental health at the University of Arizona, told Time magazine for a February article that if you want to stay away from germs on the bed, getting rid of the comforter is a good start.","“Your best bet is to avoid contact,” she said. “A lot of people will recommend just folding the bedspread back or throwing it on the chair and don’t use it while you’re there.”","Reynolds also said the carpet can be filled with germs, so maybe bring some slippers.","Drinking Glasses","Many hotels now include plastic cups for their guests. If your room includes glasses though, you might want to wipe them down before drinking from them ― especially if those glasses are kept in the bathroom.","A 2018 study confirmed that flushing the toilet can contaminate many other surfaces nearby. Reynolds told Time that if glasses (and similar items like coffee makers) aren’t properly sanitized with a disinfectant ― not just wiped down with a dry cloth ― they can be havens for germs.","What’s more, a 2008 investigation of hotel cleaning habits by Arizona’s ABC15 found that 11 of the 15 hotels it tested across the country did not remove dirty glasses from the rooms for additional cleaning.","Ice buckets might require a decent cleaning too. In 2007, Condé Nast Traveler found E. coli on ice buckets it tested from hotel rooms.","Lamp or Light Switch","The same research team that discovered bacteria on TV remotes also found heavy bacterial contamination on the bedside lamp switch in many hotel rooms. Similarly, as HuffPost explained in March, light switches, especially in the bathroom, are prone to collecting bacteria because of the many hands that touch them.","Housekeeping Materials","Before you say, “These weren’t in my room for very long,” hear us out.","The University of Houston-led research team found that in addition to the remotes and lamp switches and toilets, the housekeeping carts themselves harbor lots of bacteria. Duh, right?","But it actually affects you more than you think.","Because housekeeping teams have to clean many rooms in a day, there is the risk of cross-contamination. Dirty mops, sponges and towels can help germs travel from one room to another, so you might want to keep disinfecting wipes handy in case you think a surface might need some extra cleaning."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ae0c7b71a00004400cdcd93.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"WEIRD NEWS","headline":"'Christian Researcher' Has A Head-Spinning New Doomsday Prediction","authors":"Ed Mazza","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/2018-doomsday-prediction_us_5ae01f88e4b07be4d4c5ecf3","short_description":"But don't cancel your plans just yet.","date":"2018-04-25"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Turning Point USA Keeps Accidentally Hiring Racists","authors":"Ashley Feinberg","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/turning-point-usa-racist-tweets_us_5ad65b06e4b029ebe01ed1ac","short_description":"“I love making racist jokes,” tweeted the woman who replaced the person who wrote, “I HATE BLACK PEOPLE.”","date":"2018-04-25"},"articleContent":["Turning Point USA, a nonprofit founded in 2012 by then-19-year-old Charlie Kirk, has exploded in the Trump era.

End of story.”","Or the woman who effectively replaced her, 22-year-old Shialee Grooman, who tweeted in 2013, “All I get is nigger dick.”","As its star has risen, Turning Point has found itself constantly beset with its employees’ racist comments. Some people get fired over them. Some simply delete their old tweets — whether to hide them from the public or their own organization, it’s not clear.","There are real stakes now for an organization that styles itself as a grassroots opposition to the supposed monolithic liberalism of college campuses. Turning Point has closely aligned itself with the Trump administration. Kirk interviewed the president at last month’s White House youth forum, while Donald Trump Jr. attended Kirk’s 24th birthday celebration, along with former deputy assistant to the president Sebastian Gorka.","In December, Jane Mayer of the New Yorker reported that the group engaged in the sort of political activity barred by campaign finance laws governing charitable organizations. Mayer also unearthed the “I HATE BLACK PEOPLE” text from Clanton. Kirk told Mayer that the group “took decisive action” within 72 hours of being told about the texts; presumably he meant firing Clanton, who left the company shortly thereafter. According to someone with knowledge of the situation, Kirk then replaced Clanton with two people: Grooman, installed as field operations manager, and Troy Meeker, 24, who became leadership operations director.","Grooman, it turns out, has plenty of baggage of her own.","Grooman has since deleted her Twitter account entirely. Screenshots of the tweets, which were live as of early April, were given to HuffPost by someone who asked to be identified as an “activist.” Vestiges of Grooman’s Twitter activity can still be found in the remaining halves of the conversations shown in the screenshots. (Grooman went by @FreezingArizona on Twitter before changing her username to @shiiialee.)","At the time of publication, Grooman’s LinkedIn profile still listed Turning Point as her current employer, but in a statement to HuffPost, Kirk referred to her as a “former employee”:","This is the only question we will be issuing a statement on and only question addressing:\n\nThese are unconfirmed tweets, alleged to be written by a former employee of Turning Point USA which predates her employment with our organization.","According to a second source who also asked to remain anonymous, the tweets were concerning enough to Turning Point USA that they occasioned a memo, sent April 12.","According to the person who provided the memo, Grooman has still been answering Turning Point-related calls and emails, after the release of the April 12 memo. HuffPost followed up with Kirk to clarify when, exactly, Grooman left and under what circumstances; we’ll update if we hear back. Grooman has not responded to multiple requests for comment.","Meeker, the other half of the duo who replaced Clanton, has had to delete at least one tweet of his own. According to his LinkedIn profile, he remains employed by Turning Point.","Meanwhile, Turning Point’s Midwest regional manager, Timon Prax, was allegedly forced to leave about a month ago. According to our activist source, it was over his use of bigoted language in tweets and texts.","Prax, whose Twitter account has been suspended, was worse in text messages, according to the source. “He used the n-word with the hard R nonstop, made fun of black people and referred to them as slaves and made fun of the mentally disabled,” said the source, who shared several screenshots with HuffPost on the condition that we not publish them.","Prax has since publicly posted on his Facebook that he’s accepted a job as social media director at the Rabine Group. The Rabine Group is owned by Gary Rabine, a current member of Turning Point’s advisory council.","Turning Point is a little more comfortable with other kinds of racial provocation. The group has been in the spotlight recently thanks to Kanye West’s praise on Twitter of Candace Owens, the organization’s director of urban engagement and one of its few black employees.","Kanye was likely responding to a recent video of Owens that had gone viral in which she says: “There is an ideological civil war happening: Black people that are focused on their past and shouting about slavery and black people that are focused on their futures, OK? That’s really what it comes down to, OK? .... And it’s embarrassing that you utilize their history, you utilize their history and you come in here with more emotion than they ever had when they were living through it. You’re not living through anything right now. You’re overly privileged Americans.”","Like Owens, many of Turning Point’s members often lean on the refrain that racism as liberals understand it simply doesn’t exist in the modern world. If only its own employees would stop proving them wrong.","Are you a current or former Turning Point USA employee with something to share?

Fear of losing power corrupts those who wield it.”","date":"2018-04-24"},"articleContent":["Once hailed as one of the world’s most revered human rights defenders, Nobel Peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi’s stunning fall from grace has left heads spinning around the globe. The freedom fighter-turned-politician has watched impassively as a genocide unfolds before her eyes, and she continues to ignore international pleas for action.","Suu Kyi spent decades fighting against Burmese military rule, including nearly 15 years under house arrest as a political prisoner in Yangon. Her remarkable rise to become Myanmar’s de facto leader in 2016 brought hope to a nation long plagued by oppression.","But just two years into her tenure, the democracy darling’s blatant disregard for an ongoing campaign of state-sponsored abuse that has driven 700,000 Rohingya Muslims out of the country has left many of her countless admirers bewildered and outraged.","Suu Kyi has dismissed reports of atrocities committed against the minority Rohingya population ― including documented killings, rapes, shootings, arson and torture ― as “misinformation.” Her inaction and repeated refusals to grant access to humanitarian parties and investigators have even spurred calls to revoke her Nobel Prize, which she claimed in 1991 for her “non-violent struggle for democracy and human rights.”","The disgraced leader’s departure from the values she long championed has drawn mounting rebuke, and begs the question: Why?","Political Priorities","By neglecting to take action or even speak out, Suu Kyi is not just apathetic ― she is complicit in the Rohingya crisis, according to Joshua Kurlantzick, a senior fellow for Southeast Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations.","“She could have pushed to allow journalists and international aid groups to work freely in Rakhine State. She could have publicly called for an investigation into military leaders in Rakhine State who are [accused] of violence,” he said. “But she may feel that because many people in Myanmar don’t care about the Rohingya, that it’s not good policy.”","Although she’s been scorned on the world stage, Suu Kyi remains popular in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, where Rohingya have endured decades of discrimination and little sympathy is evident for their suffering, especially from state-controlled media. Her party, the National League for Democracy, has also shown little concern for the violence against Rohingya in western Myanmar’s Rakhine State.","“It’s possible that she really doesn’t care about the Rohingya,” said Kurlantzick, who noted that Suu Kyi’s silence on the crimes long predates her time in office. “She may think it’s not worth taking a stand because her other priorities are more important to her.”","Some observers speculate that after a lifetime of tirelessly pursuing Burmese democracy and prosperity ― causes her father lived and died fighting for ― 72-year-old Suu Kyi’s desire to remain in power has eroded her commitment to protecting human rights.","South African anti-apartheid leader Desmond Tutu, Suu Kyi’s fellow Nobel laureate, warned his “dear sister” of the perils of power last September, weeks after a provocation by Rohingya insurgents unleashed an explosive retaliation by Myanmar security forces.","“Your emergence into public life allayed our concerns about violence being perpetrated against members of the Rohingya. But what some have called ‘ethnic cleansing’ and others ‘a slow genocide’ has persisted ― and recently accelerated,” he wrote.","“If the political price of your ascension to the highest office in Myanmar is your silence, the price is surely too steep. A country that is not at peace with itself, that fails to acknowledge and protect the dignity and worth of all its people, is not a free country.”","According to Suu Kyi herself, maintaining authority can be a dangerous pursuit.","“It is not power that corrupts but fear,” she once said. “Fear of losing power corrupts those who wield it.”","Limited Power","Suu Kyi’s election was a watershed moment for her country, but she did not secure the presidency: As a mother to foreign-born children, she was constitutionally barred from assuming that office. Instead, after her party’s landslide victory, she named herself state counselor ― a specially created position intended to be “above the president.”","But even at the head of Myanmar’s government, Suu Kyi’s authority remains restricted by the military-drafted Constitution. As such, the military still controls Myanmar’s police and security forces, as well as key cabinet positions.","Experts on authoritarian governance, including American Enterprise Institute fellow Clay Fuller, contend that Suu Kyi’s extremely limited power over the military extends to the military-driven massacre of the Rohingya.","“I don’t believe she’ll publicly come out for the Rohingya. I think, privately, inside, she thinks this is abhorrent ... but the internal politics of Myanmar prevent her from doing that, largely because the military is still in control,” Fuller said. “Holding an election doesn’t make [Myanmar] a democracy.”","He believes that in Suu Kyi’s mind, it is risky to publicly denounce the military’s campaign of targeted abuse because they “have their fingers on all the levers to remove her.”","“I think she is calculating that she shouldn’t say anything because she can do better good if she stays where she is. But if the pressure from the international community mounts on her enough to actually convince her to come out and take a stand against the government, she could go back into house arrest, and Myanmar could go back down the route of extreme military control,” Fuller said.","He has been disturbed to see Suu Kyi excoriated by public condemnation while Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, the commander-in-chief of the Myanmar armed forces, remains relatively unscathed.","“Why are we wasting all our time attacking her? The military of Myanmar is the enemy. They are the government, they are the dictators, they are the ones committing genocide,” said Fuller. “They’re murdering children and we’re sitting here trying to revoke a Nobel Peace Prize. It just seems like a waste of time.”","In a searing editorial titled “As Aung San Suu Kyi’s biographer, I have to say that the only good thing she can do now is resign,” Irish author Peter Popham wrote that instead of challenging the military, Suu Kyi “is now its poodle, its patsy, its flak-catcher in chief,” while Min Aung Hlaing “is off the hook.”","“Today she finds herself the most powerful civilian in the government, but with no right to stand up to, let alone overrule, the government on crucial issues such as Rakhine.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5adf8dfd2000002d00b8f8a3.jpeg?cache=bjb1J7jU1V&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Report: White House Doctor Ronny Jackson Will Not Withdraw VA Secretary Nomination","authors":"Steve Holland and Roberta Rampton, Reuters","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/white-house-ronny-jackson-veteran-affairs-will-not-withdraw_us_5adfa64ae4b061c0bfa28ca3","short_description":"The embattled Veteran Affairs nominee will fight allegations of past unprofessional conduct, a White House official said.","date":"2018-04-24"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"WORLD NEWS","headline":"3 Mexican Students Killed, Dissolved In Acid: Officials","authors":"Lizbeth Diaz, Reuters","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mexican-students-acid_us_5adf241ae4b036e7aeb63be4","short_description":"Authorities say criminals confused the film students for members of a rival gang.","date":"2018-04-24"},"articleContent":["MEXICO CITY (Reuters) ― Three missing Mexican students were killed last month in the western state of Jalisco and their bodies dissolved in acid after criminals confused them with members of a rival gang, authorities said Monday.","The three film students were last seen in the municipality of Tonala after their car broke down and they were later kidnapped by at least six people, who tortured and killed them, according to Jalisco state prosecutors.","“Subsequently their bodies were dissolved in acid so that no trace of them remained,” the state prosecutors office said.","State prosecutor Raul Sanchez said that two people had been arrested so far in the investigation.","Another official told Reuters, on condition of anonymity since he was not authorized to speak to the media, that investigators are analyzing more human remains found on the premises of the building where the young men were dissolved.","Prosecutors said the youths were confused with members of another gang by gunmen from the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG), which has become the most powerful in Mexico, according to U.S. authorities.","Criminal groups in Mexico often kidnap, torture, dismember and even dissolve their victims in acid and many of the remains are dumped in clandestine graves.","In 2014, 43 student teachers disappeared in the southern state of Guerrero and the government said they were kidnapped by police who handed them over to a criminal group that killed them and burned their bodies.","International observers objected to the government’s investigation and the case shook the administration of President Enrique Pena Nieto, who has seen his popularity decline sharply amid corruption allegations and a spike in violence.","More than 25,000 people were murdered last year in Mexico.

The subreddit, which had about 40,000 members, frequently advocated for sexual violence and promoted hatred toward women.","Authorities offered little information about Minassian’s motive. Canadian officials have not characterized the killings as an act of terrorism, and Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said there appears to be no national security connection.","Minassian recently graduated from a computer studies program at Toronto’s Seneca College. Classmates at Seneca described him to Canadian media as socially inept and awkward.

His father gave them back.","date":"2018-04-24"},"articleContent":["In the years before he allegedly shot up a Tennessee Waffle House last Sunday, Travis Reinking, 29, told police that Taylor Swift was stalking him. He said he heard people barking like dogs. He told his family he wanted to kill himself. He was also a legal gun owner known to carry around an AR-15 rifle.","By the time he was arrested at the White House in July 2017 for breaching an outer barrier of the complex and demanding to meet the president, Reinking had established a pattern of erratic and sometimes violent behavior. If someone had looked for signs of an individual who might be unfit to own a firearm, Reinking exhibited red flag upon red flag.","After his arrest last year, Reinking was sentenced to 32 hours of community service on a misdemeanor charge of unlawful entry. But federal officials also thought his guns might be a problem.","The FBI and Secret Service contacted law enforcement in Reinking’s home state of Illinois and convinced them to revoke his gun license, known as a firearm owner’s identification or FOID, and to confiscate four firearms and a cache of ammunition. A spokesperson for the FBI declined to comment on the specifics of that request, citing an open investigation.","Once police obtained the guns, they turned them over to Reinking’s father, Jeffrey, a licensed gun owner. He “was advised that he needed to keep the weapons secure and away from Travis,” a police report said. Yet at some point, the father has since told police, he returned the guns to his son. According to law enforcement, Reinking used one of those firearms, the AR-15, to kill four people and injure several more inside a Waffle House restaurant near Nashville on April 22.","Reinking’s possession of that rifle underscores a larger issue: the difficulty of removing guns from people who are legally prohibited from owning them.","“This is one of the glaring gaps in our nation’s firearm laws,” said Ari Freilich, staff attorney at the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. “In most cases, when someone becomes prohibited from owning a gun for any reason, we don’t have many mechanisms in place to make them relinquish their guns.”","Under federal law, certain people are not allowed to own guns. That includes anyone convicted of a felony or a domestic violence misdemeanor and anyone “adjudicated as a mental defective” or “committed to any mental institution.” Many states have similar laws on the books.","Generally, once a person is prohibited from having guns, they’ll be notified that it’s illegal for them to remain armed, and their name will be flagged in the federal background check system to stop future purchases. But the process of physically removing firearms they already own ― called relinquishment ― varies depending on the state.","The system almost worked in Illinois, which has some of the strongest gun laws in the country. The state requires background checks on all gun sales, and gun owners must have a permit. It is also one of the rare states with a procedure in place to remove guns from individuals once they lose the right to own them.","But the law has a weakness: It allows people who cannot own guns to pass them along to anyone with a valid gun license, even relatives who live in the same house.","“When somebody’s guns are taken by police because their FOID card is revoked, they only lose the right to possess those firearms. They don’t lose title or ownership interest in those firearms,” explained Brendan Bukalski, an Illinois criminal defense attorney. “Under Illinois law, that person gets to designate who they want to have the firearms given to.”","It’s common for states to allow prohibited individuals to transfer their firearms to a third party, who may then let those guns fall right back into the wrong hands, Freilich said.","“In too many cases, those closest to the person are unable or unwilling to keep guns out of their hands,” he said. The better practice is to mandate that relinquished firearms go to law enforcement or a licensed gun dealer.","California is a leader in this area. In 2016, the state passed a law by ballot initiative that requires anyone convicted of a firearm-prohibiting crime ― such as felonies, illegal weapons use or misdemeanors involving domestic abuse ― to provide receipts showing that they sold or transferred their firearms to a licensed gun dealer or law enforcement agency within a specified time period. Enforcing these rules can be a challenge, however, and California authorities have been struggling to clear a backlog of prohibited individuals who may still own guns.","William Rosen, deputy legal director for advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety, said that even though Illinois law ultimately didn’t prevent the shooting in Tennessee, it’s essential for states to have a process for flagging dangerous people and revoking their access to firearms.","“In most states, there are no laws on the books that would prohibit even someone with all of these obvious warning signs of dangerousness,” he said.","Removing guns from those who aren’t supposed to have them has been a high priority for domestic violence activists for years. Only 17 states require people under final restraining orders for domestic violence to turn in their firearms once they’re prohibited from owning them. States that do so have lower rates of intimate partner homicide.","Taking firearms away from individuals deemed to be a risk is also a key component of “red flag laws,” which have picked up steam in the wake of the Feb. 14 school shooting in Parkland, Florida.","Red flag laws, also called gun violence restraining orders or GVROs, allow family members and law enforcement to petition a court to temporarily remove firearms from a person who is believed to be a danger to themselves or others, even if they haven’t been convicted of a crime.","The gunman who killed 17 inside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School was well-known to local police for his disturbing and threatening behavior. But they had no power to confiscate his firearms because he had not been convicted or even charged with a crime.","Florida passed a red flag law after the Parkland massacre, as have Vermont and Maryland. At least 25 other states and the District of Columbia have considered similar bills this year.","Illinois doesn’t have a red flag law, but state lawmakers are debating such legislation. Following the Tennessee shooting, the legislature is reportedly considering a provision that would prohibit people forced to relinquish firearms under this process from transferring those weapons to relatives.","A separate 2013 Illinois law requires physicians, psychologists, law enforcement officials and school administrators to report to state police if they believe a person poses a “clear and present danger” to themselves or others, so their gun license can be revoked.","Police reports obtained by HuffPost reveal a string of troubling incidents involving Reinking in the years before the shooting. Law enforcement knew he was armed and had expressed unstable and suicidal thoughts.","“Travis is hostile towards police and does not recognize police authority. Travis also possesses several firearms,” a Tazewell County, Illinois, sheriff’s deputy wrote in a May 2016 report, after responding to what was documented as a “suicide attempt by firearms.” Police ended up taking Reinking against his will to a nearby hospital for evaluation.","“Travis has some mental problems and I asked him if he would like to speak to [medical personnel] but he stated he didn’t want to. Travis had already spoke to them before and been in the hospital,” an officer wrote in a June 2017 report, following an episode in which Reinking had allegedly brandished his AR-15 in front of employees of his father’s company.","Still, it wasn’t until Reinking’s arrest at the White House that authorities finally decided he might not be suited for firearms ownership. Unfortunately, his father didn’t appear to agree with their determination."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5adf55b51e00002c008e37cd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"QUEER VOICES","headline":"Why 'Queer Eye' Star Karamo Brown Wants You To Forgive Shania Twain","authors":"Curtis M.

Patty Murray (Wash.) and Dick Durbin (Ill.), who are members of Schumer’s leadership team, also said they hadn’t seen the legislation.","Sanders is looking forward “to starting a conversation with the American people” about the benefits of a jobs guarantee, spokesman Josh Miller-Lewis said in an email.","“A federal jobs guarantee is an already popular idea that has the potential to be the next transformative progressive policy,” he said.","Sanders’ proposal, which hasn’t been formally introduced yet, would likely involve substantial government spending and radically reshape the U.S. labor market. It’s the kind of idea Democrats might have scoffed at in the past; President Barack Obama, for instance, tended to agree with Republicans that it was important to reduce budget deficits.","But Republicans abandoned the pretense of fiscal responsibility when they passed a tax reform bill last year that will add more than $1 trillion to the national debt.","“If Republicans could give $1.5 trillion in tax cuts to corporations and the wealthiest among us,” Gillibrand said in a tweet earlier this month, “why can’t we invest a similar amount in a guaranteed jobs plan for regular Americans who are unemployed and willing to work to better their local community?”","Booker last week announced a separate proposal that would test the jobs guarantee idea in 15 local areas, saying the idea ought to be taken seriously. “Creating an employment guarantee would give all Americans a shot at a day’s work and, by introducing competition into the labor market, raise wages and improve benefits for all worker,” Booker said in a press release.","For years, Democrats in the House of Representatives, led by former Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.), have introduced “full employment” bills that had similar policy goals, but with little hope of success and almost no news coverage. The Donald Trump era has seemingly created space for ideas that may have once seemed politically impossible. A Sanders proposal to give more Americans government health insurance, for instance, garnered far more support among Democratic senators than similar proposals have in previous years.","An effective full employment program would cost more than half a trillion dollars annually, making it almost as large as Medicaid, according to a lengthy paper published in March by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, an influential liberal think tank. (Theoretically, the cost of direct spending on jobs could be largely offset by reduced spending on Medicaid and other safety net programs, since people would have too much income to qualify).","The jobs guarantee proposals offers a stark contrast to Republican “workforce development” proposals, which are designed to make workers more willing to take low-paying jobs by reducing access to benefits such as food stamps.","Both the Democratic jobs guarantee and a Republican food stamps plan under consideration in the House would ramp up existing government workforce offices situated around the country. Democrats in the House have said the GOP plan to shift some food stamp spending from benefits to training programs would create too much of an administrative headache.","Similar concerns about feasibility will inevitably dog the jobs guarantee. Told of the proposal, Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) said, “That strikes me as ambitious.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5adf9dd41e00002d008e3836.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"TECH","headline":"From Cursing To Murder, Facebook Opens Up About The Site's 'Community Standards'","authors":"David Ingram, Reuters","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/facebook-rule-book_us_5adf0559e4b0b2e8113305d5","short_description":"For years, Facebook had “community standards” for what people can post, but only a relatively brief and general version was publicly available.","date":"2018-04-24"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"'Tree Hugger' Donald Trump Gets Mauled On Twitter Over Planting Ceremony","authors":"Lee Moran","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-emmanuel-macron-tree-planting_us_5adecebfe4b0b2e81132b23f","short_description":"\"Apparently Macron didn’t realize that Trump hates all things nature, including trees.\"","date":"2018-04-24"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Chris Rock Says He Hit On Rihanna And She Put Him In The ‘Uncle Zone’","authors":"Elyse Wanshel","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chris-rock-says-he-hit-on-rhianna-and-she-put-him-in-the-uncle-zone_us_5adf6537e4b07560f3961f1e","short_description":"\"She didn't even register me as a sexual being,” the comedian joked.","date":"2018-04-24"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"IMPACT","headline":"This App Helps Donate Leftover Drugs To People Who Struggle To Afford Health Care","authors":"Morgan Meaker, On assignment for HuffPost","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/greek-nonprofit-medication-waste_us_5add9f3ae4b009869bfb181c","short_description":"A Greek nonprofit hopes to find a better use for the billions of dollars worth of prescription medication wasted every year.","date":"2018-04-24"},"articleContent":["Among the things Katerina Kaisari’s grandfather left behind when he died last year was a stockpile of expensive heart medication.","“My mum wanted to throw the boxes away,” said Kaisari from her hometown of Athens. “But I wanted to donate them to people who couldn’t afford to buy their own medication.”","Although Kaisari was keen not to let the drugs go to waste, she had no idea how to actually follow through with her idea until a friend recommended GIVMED, a Greek nonprofit that matches leftover medicines with people on low incomes.","For those based in Athens, where GIVMED is based, people with drugs to donate scan the barcodes of medicines they no longer need using GIVMED’s mobile app. The app then shows which of the 40 listed healthcare organizations around the city need those particular drugs, letting the user choose whichever donation point is most convenient. For donors who live outside the capital, an online map shows the 120 or so donation points across the country.","Within days of downloading the app, Kaisari had delivered her grandfather’s 12 boxes to a nearby social pharmacy, set up to serve unemployed and uninsured Greeks who cannot afford the medications they are prescribed.","Around the world, people struggle to afford medication while drugs worth billions of dollars go to waste. There isn’t detailed data on what happens to these unused drugs, but anecdotal evidence suggests some are thrown in the trash or incinerated. There have even been reports of medical facilities flushing unused medications down the toilet.","In response, a nascent movement of medicine sharing organizations from Greece to the U.S. to Senegal is emerging to tackle the dual problems of waste and unaffordability by redirecting medications to low-income communities.","For GIVMED co-founder Thanasis Vratimos, the idea to set up his organization came seven years ago after a close relative of his died and he realized how difficult it was to re-home unused medicines.","“After a lot of research in my hometown, Tripoli, these medicines eventually ended up in the hands of people who needed them,” says the 25-year-old. “But why should that have been so time-consuming and difficult?”","The former Google intern was convinced medicine-sharing technology was desperately needed. Greece was hit hard by a financial crisis in 2010 which left around two million people living below the poverty line and hundreds of thousands without medical access.","Launched in 2016, GIVMED is funded by a mixture of individuals, private companies and social foundations, and does not charge the healthcare organizations which receive and re-distribute the donated drugs – which they also do for free. According to Vratimos, the app has so far facilitated €200,000 ($246,000) worth of medicine donations.","But some sound a note of caution about medicine sharing. Andy Stergachis, director of the Global Medicines Program at Seattle’s University of Washington, says drug donations can save lives but warns: “There is no assurance that medicines from other healthcare facilities or from individuals are stored properly or not tampered with prior to their donation.”","Some countries, including the U.K., take the position that medicines should not be re-used after they’ve been dispensed to a patient given it’s not known how the products have been stored and consequently how safe or effective they are.","Indeed, soon after GIVMED’s launch, the Greek Association of Pharmacists published a letter that branded the platform “a serious risk to public health”. Vratimos says its concerns are invalid. The non-profit only sends donations to healthcare facilities that have an in-house pharmacist, he says, qualified to inspect each delivery. “I think every time someone has a new idea, people are afraid, especially when young people are behind it,” he adds. “The quality of medicine is our first priority.”","For Dimitra Pipili, manager of the Asylon Aniation hospice that looks after 180 people with neuro-disabilities, there’s no denying the impact GIVMED has had. In the wake of the Greek financial crisis, the hospice was struggling to afford even basic supplies. “It was very difficult to pay for everything: medicine, food, and the large amounts we owed in tax,” says Pipili.","Then two years ago the hospice was approached by GIVMED, offering to integrate it into its network of donation points. Now the hospice sends GIVMED a list of all the medicines it needs every month and, although GIVMED can usually only provide around 20 percent of what’s on the list, it makes a huge difference, says Pipili.","While Vratimos is proud of what GIVMED has achieved, ultimately he wants the government to adopt the organization’s ideas to create a nationwide system that provides free medication for Greeks who can’t pay for their prescriptions, while making the most of resources that would otherwise be thrown away. “Putting leftover medicines to use is important, for the environment and for changing people’s attitudes about their waste – in medicines and in general.”","For more content and to be part of the “This New World” community, follow our Facebook page.","HuffPost’s “This New World” series is funded by Partners for a New Economy and the Kendeda Fund.

The Parkland Five are the fucking hope of this planet ... We have to be with them, pray with them, march with them. Their cause is ours. Their cause is our future.”","Just when you thought you had seen it all, Smith brought Springsteen ― on his night off from “Springsteen on Broadway” ― to join her on “Because the Night,” the 1978 hit they famously co-wrote together.","But that wasn’t the only surprise. Stipe, of R.E.M. fame, then joined Springsteen, Smith, and the band to perform “People Have the Power.”","“We are moving to a new time and I look at young people to lead us … It is the people who make change,” Smith said, continuing the social theme of the night. “People, we have to make change now!”","“Horses: Patti Smith and her Band,” which celebrates the 40th anniversary of Smith’s seminal “Horses” album, chronicles her January 2016 shows at The Wiltern in Los Angeles.

The complaint lists charges including assault, battery and emotional stress, and Carballo is seeking over $50,000 in damages, according to documents obtained by People.","Lee, 95, denied the allegations through his attorney Jonathan Freund, who told the Chicago Tribune that his client was shocked by the allegations.","“He is a high-profile public figure and I think it’s a shakedown,” Freund told the Chicago Tribune. “The guy is 95, I don’t think he would do that.”","Neither Lee or his attorney immediately responded to HuffPost’s request for comment.","According to the lawsuit, Lee hired Carballo to perform a two-hour massage on April 21, 2017, at the Hyatt Regency hotel in Chicago while Lee was in town for an annual comic expo called C2E2. About a half hour into the massage, Carballo alleges that Lee “began to fondle himself” while he was face down on the table. Later in the appointment, Lee allegedly began moaning as Carballo massaged his legs. Carballo immediately became uncomfortable and ended the massage, the suit says.","The next day, Carballo says, her boss called her asking that she massage Lee again. She initially refused, but her boss pressed the issue by apologizing for Lee’s behavior and reiterating the importance of “appeasing VIP clients,” according to the complaint. Eventually, Carballo acquiesced because she was afraid she would lose her job, she says.","An hour into the massage on April 22, 2017, Carballo claims Lee began moaning again, at which time she attempted to end the massage. According to the complaint, Lee stood up, naked and angry, and demanded that Carballo continue the massage.

Pruitt made the announcement at a 2 p.m. event live-streamed from the EPA, flanked by Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas) and Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), who both introduced but failed to pass bills on which the proposed regulation is based.","In a twist for an event billed as a step forward in transparency, Pruitt took no questions, and the EPA did not invite reporters from major news outlets to attend. The agency did not immediately release a copy of the proposal or respond to questions about when it would become public, issuing only a press release containing seven soundbites praising the rule. Roughly an hour and a half after the event, the EPA sent HuffPost a 27-page PDF of the proposal.","“Today is a red-letter day,” Pruitt said, decrying the EPA’s reliance on traditionally peer-reviewed studies as “wrongheaded.” He added, “It’s a banner day.”","The rule, first reported by The Washington Post and confirmed by HuffPost Tuesday morning, would deliver a change long sought by conservatives who say “secret science” unfairly cripples industry. But critics of the new EPA proposal say it blocks the agency from using traditional, peer-reviewed studies that rely on anonymity granted to interview subjects to collect data on their personal health.","“It effectively says our premier public health agency will be prohibited from using many or most public health studies,” said Andrew Rosenberg, director of the Union of Concerned Scientists’ Center for Science and Democracy. “It’s a perfect catch 22.”","The proposal aims to do by EPA writ what has been a pet issue for Smith, the controversial head of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, for years. Smith has pushed two bills aimed at forcing the EPA to rely solely on research whose raw data could be publicly released, a bow to big industry players, particularly petrochemical companies who complained about research finding higher rates of asthma and other respiratory ailments that resulted from airborne particulates spewing from their plants. The bills passed in the Republican-controlled House, but failed in the Senate.","“In general we strongly support the general concepts in the Lamar Smith bill, which is the basis of what Pruitt is doing,” said Myron Ebell, director at the libertarian Competitive Enterprise Institute and the former head of Trump’s EPA transition team.","The concept attacks the fundamental scientific ethical standards that have guided science for more than a century. Scientists conduct research, collecting personal information from individuals under the supervision of universities’ institutional review boards. That research is then reviewed by peers who scrutinize the methodology and statistics, and a study is ultimately published in a journal. Requiring that raw data be released with any research used to write regulations not only discounts the majority of peer-reviewed health studies, it dramatically slows down the rulemaking process, potentially forcing reviewers to replicate decades-long studies down to the most minute data points.","“God forbid this means no regulation until then. We’re back in the Dark Ages,” said Tom Burke, a professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and a former EPA science adviser until January 2017. “Do we turn back the clock and start over? And it’s open season to industries that brought us such pervasive contaminations?”","“I’m hoping during the comment period cooler heads will prevail,” he added.","The new EPA move builds on a strategy long employed by the tobacco industry to sow doubt as mounting research linked smoking to cancer. The playbook dates back to 1996, when Christopher Horner, a former fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, wrote a memo outlining plans to combat the EPA’s finding that tobacco smoke is carcinogenic by constructing “explicit procedural hurdles the agency must follow in issuing scientific reports.”","The fossil fuel industry’s concern dates back to around the same time. In 1993, the industry bucked a groundbreaking Harvard University study that linked polluted air to premature deaths after tracking thousands of people for nearly two decades. The New York Times described the research, called the “Six Cities” study, as “one of the most influential public health examinations ever conducted” and “the backbone of federal air pollution regulations.”","Steve Milloy, a former tobacco lobbyist who recreated himself over the past decade as a staunch climate change denier and online troll to scientists and reporters, has long pushed for a “transparency” rule, bemoaning the “EPA’s secret science” in a Fox News op-ed as far back as February 2001. On Tuesday morning, he took credit for the EPA proposal.","“I look at it as one of my proudest achievements,” Milloy told E&E News. “The reason this is anywhere is because of Steve Milloy.”","The proposal builds on moves Pruitt has already made to shackle scientists whose peer-review process Republicans call into question. In October, he banned scientists who receive EPA research funding from serving on the agency’s advisory boards, effectively turning over control of the oversight panels to industry-friendly researchers. That change, made by executive order, similarly mirrored a bill Smith proposed: the Science Advisory Board Reform Act of 2017. The legislation, as The New Republic’s Emily Atkin noted in an article this month declaring Republicans had won the “war on science,” “is based on the presumption that environmental scientists who have received money from the EPA for research — as many of them have — are biased in favor of regulation.”","“The liberal media and alarmist environmental groups continue to argue against this common sense approach,” Smith said Tuesday before introducing Pruitt at the event.","But the rule proposed Tuesday outlined exceptions for industry-funded research. Emails released in response to a public records request show Nancy Beck, the deputy administrator of the EPA’s Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention, warning that new “transparency” proposals put corporate trade secrets at risk. (The EPA released the documents before then removing them from its website, but the Union of Concerned Scientists re-published them online.)","“It’s a competitive issue,” Beck, a former chemical industry lobbyist, wrote in an email. “These data will be extremely valuable, extremely high quality, and NOT published. The directive needs to be revised.”","The text of the proposal states that the EPA administrator can provide exemptions for “confidential business information” on a case-by-case basis.","The new EPA proposal comes as Pruitt faces mounting pressure to resign after a month-long whirlwind of ethical scandals and federal investigations into his spending and management of the agency. After weeks of signaling strong support for the administrator, the White House started telling Republicans to hold off on defending Pruitt, according to a Bloomberg report.","Smith, who is not seeking re-election to another term this year, bucked the directive and repeatedly praised Pruitt.","“I know of no other administration official who goes on the offensive, who isn’t intimidated and who does what he thinks is the right thing regardless,” Smith said. “That’s why we appreciate the job that the administrator is doing.”","But, on Monday, three of Pruitt’s staunchest allies, including Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.), said they supported holding hearings on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee to investigate Pruitt’s actions. At least one former EPA official suggested the rule unveiled Tuesday was meant to smokescreen Pruitt’s weakening grasp on the agency.","“They’re trying to distract from the ethical questions and fiscal scandals that are going on,” said Liz Purchia, who served as the EPA’s communications director until January 2017. “Right now, it’ll be a proposed rule and it’s unclear if it will ever go into effect.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5adf5b3f2000002d00b8f84b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"'Schoolhouse Rock' Composer Bob Dorough Dead At 94","authors":"David Moye","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bob-dorough-schoolhouse-rock-dead-94_us_5adf5e2de4b07be4d4c555a5","short_description":"The jazz musician also wrote classic kids songs like \"Three Is a Magic Number\" and \"Conjunction Junction.\"","date":"2018-04-24"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"BLACK VOICES","headline":"Kevin Hart Takes On His Own Cheating Scandals In New J.

They represented 18 percent of the total number of anti-Muslim bias incidents documented in 2017.","The first version of Trump’s executive order, which he signed in January 2017, barred the entry of individuals from several Muslim-majority countries into the U.S. CAIR documented a case where an American Muslim father was separated from his noncitizen daughter as a result of the travel ban. The woman later successfully sought legal permanent residence status to join her father.","In another incident, a Muslim man who had been residing in the U.S. as a visa holder and was married to a Muslim U.S. citizen found himself stuck abroad because of the travel ban. With the help of CAIR, the family was eventually reunited in the U.S.","Responding to the report, a Customs and Border Patrol spokesperson told HuffPost that the U.S. “has been and continues to be a welcoming nation.”","The spokesperson said the agency “not only protects U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents in the country but also wants to ensure the safety of our international travelers who come to visit, study and conduct legitimate business in our country. CBP does not discriminate on the entry of foreign nationals to the United States based on religion, race, ethnicity or sexual orientation.”","Officials with the TSA told Huffpost in an email that its officers and contracted screeners “are trained to treat all passengers with dignity and respect, and receive periodic training regarding cultural and religious sensitivities.” The agency has “long made clear that profiling is not only discriminatory, but it is also an ineffective way to identify someone intent on doing harm.”","The FBI declined to comment.","The most common form of abuse against Muslims last year in the CAIR report was harassment ― defined by the group as a “non-violent or non-threatening incident.” CAIR categorized 14 percent of abuse against Muslims as harassment, another 13 percent as harassment and targeting specifically by the CBP, and 10 percent as harassment by the FBI. Hate crimes made up an additional 12 percent of anti-Muslim abuse, and employment discrimination accounted for 9 percent.","Noting that government agencies were found to be major contributors to anti-Muslim bias in 2017, CAIR wrote: “It is possible to attribute this to the unconstitutional Muslim Ban executive order.”","“How do we now protect ourselves when the source that we would otherwise seek to guarantee our rights is no longer guaranteeing our rights, but rather, is infringing upon [them]?” Arain asked.","Air, bus and train terminals were documented as the most common location for anti-Muslim incidents, accounting for 20 percent of total incidents by location.","Another report, released earlier this year by the nonprofit group South Asian Americans Leading Together, found that 1 in 5 perpetrators of hate violence in the United States against various South Asian and Middle Eastern communities invoked Trump’s name, his administration’s policies or his campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again,” during the attacks.","Each year, CAIR complies thousands of reports through methods including telephone calls, emails, online submissions, its mobile application and media reports. CAIR’s civil rights staff members review the material and conduct interviews to determine whether a case demonstrates anti-Muslim, ethnicity-based or other biases and should be added to its national databases and reports.","This story has been updated with comment from TSA."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ade41fe2000004100b8f6ef.jpeg?cache=z6k47asQs9&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"COMEDY","headline":"Seth Meyers Taunts Donald Trump: 'There's A Good Chance He'll Flip On Himself'","authors":"Lee Moran","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/seth-meyers-donald-trump-michael-cohen-nickname_us_5aded7c6e4b0b2e81132b94c","short_description":"\"If the feds put pressure on him...\"","date":"2018-04-24"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"COMEDY","headline":"Trevor Noah: If I Supported Donald Trump, This New Revelation Would Have Me Shook","authors":"Lee Moran","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trevor-noah-donald-trump-origin-lie_us_5adecfa3e4b0b2e81132b30b","short_description":"\"Because it turns out his entire origin story was fake.\"","date":"2018-04-24"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"QUEER VOICES","headline":"'Queer Eye' Star Antoni Porowski Talks About His 'Fluid' Sexuality","authors":"Jenna Amatulli","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/queer-eye-star-antoni-porowski-fluid-sexuality_us_5adf26d2e4b0b2e8113329da","short_description":"“I’ve always considered myself a little more fluid along the spectrum,\" the food and wine specialist said.","date":"2018-04-24"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"COMEDY","headline":"Jimmy Kimmel Slows Down White House Presser To Imagine 'Sarah Drunkabee Sanders'","authors":"Ron Dicker","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sarah-drunkabee-sanders-jimmy-kimmel_us_5adf1756e4b036e7aeb634bc","short_description":"Her job finally drives her to drink.","date":"2018-04-24"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Christina Aguilera And Melissa McCarthy Get 'Dirrty' On 'Carpool Karaoke'","authors":"Lee Moran","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/christina-aguilera-carpool-karaoke-melissa-mccarthy_us_5adef13ee4b036e7aeb5ed90","short_description":"Rowdy!","date":"2018-04-24"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"COMEDY","headline":"Colbert Proves Trump Wrong With A Single Photo","authors":"Ed Mazza","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/stephen-colbert-donald-trump-new-york-times_us_5ade8f92e4b0df502a4ec1bd","short_description":"\"Late Show\" host reveals what got under the president's \"extremely loose skin.\"","date":"2018-04-24"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"CRIME","headline":"Dallas Officer Shot At Home Depot Dies. 2 Others Still In Hospital.","authors":"Sebastian Murdock, Carla Herreria, and Doha Madani","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dallas-officers-shot-home-depot_us_5adfb0fbe4b07560f396644f","short_description":"Officer Rogelio Santander, 27, died the day after the shooting.","date":"2018-04-24"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Meek Mill Released From Prison, Looks Forward To Resuming Music Career","authors":"Jenna Amatulli","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/meek-mill-release-prison_us_5adf8afde4b07560f396482f","short_description":"The rapper was sentenced to two to four years in prison in November.","date":"2018-04-24"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"New Federal Data Shows How Black Students Are Getting Pushed Out Of School","authors":"Rebecca Klein","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/black-students-disabilities-inequality_us_5adf3cf9e4b07be4d4c533c5","short_description":"At the same time, the Department of Education is considering scrapping the guidance that's designed to help protect these students.","date":"2018-04-24"},"articleContent":["Black students and students with disabilities routinely receive harsher punishments at school than their peers. But the Education Department is considering eliminating civil rights guidance designed to stymie these disparities ― even as data released Tuesday illustrates the scope of the problem.","The data comes from responses to a survey sent to all of the nation’s public school districts as part of the Education Department’s Civil Rights Data Collection, reflecting information from the 2015-2016 school year. The survey is conducted every other school year, and is intended to paint a picture of the different opportunities afforded to different groups of students.","This year, as in years past, the numbers show wide gaps in terms of how vulnerable students are treated when compared to their white peers. The Obama administration often cited numbers from this survey when designing civil rights guidance intended to reduce racial disparities. But the Trump administration has put pieces of Obama-era guidance on the chopping block. Specifically, under Secretary Betsy DeVos, the Education Department has signaled it may scrap guidance that is supposed to reduce racial bias in school punishments.","Indeed, even more than in years past, the latest figures show that a growing number of black students are disproportionately subject to school-based arrests and referrals to police. This issue is particularly relevant amid new federal efforts to increase the number of police officers in schools after the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, that killed 17 people.","Black students are also disproportionately suspended and expelled. At the same time, the data shows that high schools dominated by black and Latino students have less access to high-level STEM coursework, compared to all high schools.","Students with disabilities are likewise subject to high rates of suspension and expulsion, and are also more likely to be restrained and secluded in school. While students with disabilities make up just 12 percent of students enrolled at public schools, they make up 28 percent of those subject to school-based arrests.","For the first time, the 2015-2016 survey asked about school-related shootings and homicides. Only 0.2 percent of schools reported having at least one incident related to a school shooting, and even fewer reported a school-related homicide.","The latest data reflects patterns recently found in a report from the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office, which noted stark disparities in terms of how black students are disciplined compared to their white peers.","In response to the release of the survey results, DeVos said in a statement that “protecting all students’ civil rights is at the core of the Department’s mission.”","However, critics will likely see the new numbers as evidence that DeVos’ agenda is specifically harmful to students of color and students with disabilities. Earlier this month, DeVos met with critics and proponents of the Obama-era guidance that is designed to reduce racial bias in school discipline. Critics of the guidance say it has had a compromising effect on school discipline overall. Proponents say it is a necessary protection for vulnerable student communities who are already disproportionately punished. It is not clear when the Education Department will make a decision on whether to keep this guidance."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5adf59f91a00002700cdcb83.jpeg?cache=1nzuDeTQVX&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Maryland's GOP Governor Signs Broad Set Of Gun Bills Into Law","authors":"Nick Wing","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/maryland-gun-laws_us_5ada332be4b04090e551f666","short_description":"The measures include a bump stock ban and at least $5 million for programs to stem gun violence.","date":"2018-04-24"},"articleContent":["Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) signed into law on Tuesday an array of bills ushering in one of the most comprehensive packages of gun-violence legislation passed by any state this year.","The legislation includes a ban on bump stocks and other similar devices that allow semi-automatic firearms to simulate automatic fire. Another bill expands law enforcement’s ability to confiscate guns from individuals labeled an “extreme risk,” a measure known as a “red flag” law.","Both of those measures have garnered support in a number of states following deadly mass shootings in Las Vegas last year and Parkland, Florida, in February, but Maryland is one of the first to put both on the books.","The Las Vegas gunman had outfitted bump stocks to a dozen semi-automatic rifles, allowing him to spray over 1,100 rounds into a crowd of concertgoers over the course of his 10-minute onslaught, killing 58 and injuring hundreds more.","The Parkland shooter was known to local police as a gun owner with violent tendencies, but because he hadn’t been convicted or even charged with a crime, law enforcement had no authority to confiscate his weapons before the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, in which 17 people died.","Red flag laws, also known as gun violence restraining orders, allow family members or law enforcement personnel to petition a court to temporarily remove firearms from individuals deemed to be dangers to themselves or to others.","In the signing ceremony, Hogan hailed the new laws as “common sense bipartisan measures that will keep guns out of the hands of the mentally ill and those with criminal backgrounds.”","Hogan also signed a bill to provide at least $5 million for public health and community-based gun-violence prevention programs. And other measures will strengthen an existing restriction on the purchase or possession of firearms by individuals convicted of domestic violence and revamp the appeals process for certain handgun permitting decisions.","In the Republican wave that marked the 2014 elections, Hogan was one of the surprise winners in a heavily Democratic state (Hillary Clinton carried Maryland in 2016 presidential race by more than 26 percentage points). He is seeking a second term this November.","The new laws build upon previous legislation that had already made Maryland’s gun statutes some of the nation’s strongest. In 2013, the state enacted a ban on a number of semi-automatic rifles including certain types of AR-15s and AK-47s, often referred to as assault weapons, as well as high-capacity ammunition magazines.","The slate of laws will address gun violence in a variety of forms, said Jen Pauliukonis, president of Marylanders to Prevent Gun Violence.","Pauliukonis said a bump stock ban is necessary to try to prevent the type of mass slaughter seen in Las Vegas, but she acknowledged that such a measure would do little to address the sort of shootings that take place across Maryland each day. She said the “broad spectrum” nature of the gun bills suggests lawmakers were eager to look beyond the issue of mass shootings. And she said she believes the red flag law will be particularly valuable.","“It can stop those high-profile mass shootings, it can stop school shootings, it can stop interpersonal gun violence on the streets and it can stop gun suicides,” she said of the legislative package.","She added that suicides using firearms account for “two-thirds of all gun deaths that occur in this country; there are over 22,000 gun suicides every year.”","The investment in community-based organizations and public health initiatives that already exist to stem gun violence also marks a different direction for Maryland. Only five other states have established this sort of fund, which is designed to give a financial injection to evidence-based services that address the root causes of gun violence.","Some programs may work to identify at-risk youth and provide a path for them off the streets, or deploy mediators who can work to de-escalate violence before it erupts. Other programs are based in hospitals and provide continuing care to gun violence victims to prevent them from engaging in revenge violence or being re-victimized once they’re discharged.","It can be hard to get official support for this sort of approach, even though the data suggests it can be effective, said Mike McLively, director of the Urban Gun Violence Initiative at the Giffords Law Center, a gun violence prevention group launched by former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.)","“When states are thinking about the problem of gun violence, they’re usually thinking about law enforcement,” he said. “They think of this as a crime problem and really the main solution that comes to policymakers’ minds is investing more in law enforcement.”","A recent study by Giffords’ group calculated that about 1,672 shootings occur in Maryland each year, many of which are nonfatal. Together, they result in a direct measurable cost of over $1.3 billion.","This bloodshed disproportionately affects communities of color based in a few urban areas, Baltimore and Prince George’s County. With those trends often ignored in the media or by policymakers claiming to be interested in putting forth solutions to gun violence, advocates say this sort of effort is long overdue.","“It speaks to the underlying issue of which lives matter and where we’re going to put our resources,” Pauliukonis said."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5adf5dcd2000004100b8f850.jpeg?cache=1ksozj6mPS&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Actress Allison Mack Is Released To Her Parents On $5 Million Bail In Sex Trafficking Case","authors":"David Moye","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/allison-mack-5-million-bail_us_5adfa8e9e4b07be4d4c59adb","short_description":"Mack is not allowed any contact with members of the alleged Nxivm cult.","date":"2018-04-24"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"BLACK VOICES","headline":"Golf Club Calls Cops On 5 Black Women Members Playing ...

It was the highlight of the Lord’s Day for me, a time to frolic in the store’s toy section while Muss focused on picking up household supplies. My objective was simple: find something I liked and convince her to buy it.","One hot Sunday when I was 8, I was digging through the school supplies and investigating my typical vices — toy makeup kits and cheap action figures. The pens and toys occupied different aisles, and I happily bounced back and forth between the sections, comparing items to decide what I wanted. The mission was going as expected until Muss walked over. She instructed me to put the toys down. It was time to go.","This was uncharacteristic. Typically she’d ask if I had made my decision and was ready to check out. I protested, loudly, wanting to know why this Sunday was different. But her usual tolerance for questions was nowhere to be found. “Let’s go. Now,” she said, grabbing my arm. The bass in her voice told me she was serious. As she dragged me out of the store, I started crying and shifting in my clothes as I tried to free my arm.","“Stop moving,” she said. “Don’t go in your pockets either.”","We got in the car and I again asked her what was happening.","“You ain’t see that woman following you around?”","I hadn’t noticed her.","“She was following you because you black,” she said. “You can’t just run around and pick stuff up. They think you stealing.”","“But I’m not,” I said, choking back tears from the back seat.","“It don’t matter.”","Muss explained that my blackness had consequences beyond my control, and that there was a certain way I needed to conduct myself in public for my own good. I didn’t have the privilege of running around in a store and innocently comparing products with my hands, she said. I couldn’t put my hands in my pockets. I would always be seen and treated differently because of my race.","I prodded her for answers. I wanted to know why, and if it would always be this way.","Her face fell.","I knew the answer.","I tweeted about this exchange and how it relates to the recent racial profiling incident in a Philadelphia Starbucks. On April 12, at about 4:35 p.m., Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson walked into the coffee shop in the city’s Rittenhouse Square neighborhood. They were there to meet a friend, who hadn’t yet arrived. Nelson asked the manager if he could use the bathroom, but was informed that restrooms were for paying customers only. Nelson “left it at that,” he later told ABC’s “Good Morning America,” and joined Robinson in waiting for their friend. The manager approached the men a few seconds later and asked if they wanted to order something. They declined.","At 4:37 p.m., the manager called 911. Police arrested Nelson and Robinson soon after, a moment that went viral when a customer recorded it on her phone.","“When you know that you did nothing wrong, how do you really react to it?” Nelson pondered in an interview with The Associated Press.","It’s a question black folks have struggled with our entire lives. How do you handle these situations once you’re in them? What can you do to avoid ending up in such predicaments? How do you navigate a society that criminalizes you even as a child, and only deepens the stigma as you age? And how do these experiences shape you? How do they change you?","My own experience completely changed how I operate in stores. I quit running between aisles. I no longer pick up items unless I am buying them. I’m hyperaware of my body language. I don’t put my hands in my pockets. I don’t linger after I pay. I buy things I don’t want, to prove I don’t need to steal. I tense up when I walk out of stores, always worried I’ll be accused of stealing. I fear the cops being called. Even at 25, I’m still reduced to that little girl in the Dollar General.","In response to my Twitter thread, many black people shared similar experiences. Here are some of those tweets, along with personal anecdotes others shared with HuffPost that have been edited for length and clarity.","Brandon, 28, Chicago:","Here’s a non-exhaustive list of decisions I make when shopping:\n","I don’t put my hands in coat/pants/sweatshirt pockets.\n\nI take my hood off outside the store before entering, even if it’s snowing or raining (the times when I really want to be wearing a hood).\n\nI don’t wear headphones.\n\nI don’t wear sunglasses.\n\nI very deliberately put items into shopping carts or baskets.\n\nI try to always use a shopping cart or basket, even if I’m only buying one item.\n\nI never use my reusable bag instead of a cart or basket.\n\nI make sure to say “hello” to employees, and smile profusely.\n\nI wear baseball caps backward while shopping so you can see my face.\n\nI don’t sample fruits or veggies (like I used to snack on grapes as a little kid when I shopped with my mom).\n\nI try to always buy something.\n\nI make sure I’m well groomed before shopping.\n\nI’m gay, so I play up my “gayness” whenever I can. It disarms people. “My boyfriend and I are looking for...” often gets a nicer response than “I’m looking for...”\n\nI write a list on paper and carry it with me.\n\nI walk fast, but not too fast.\n\nI walk slow, but not too slow.\n\nI use the main entrance/exit even when a secondary exit is more convenient.","My partner is white, and our nieces are blonde with blue eyes. They live in a different Midwestern state than we do. Once, we were visiting for a fundraiser at the girls’ school. It was one of those yucky Midwestern carnivals with a beer tent, a polka band, and a thousand games for kids to play and win “prizes.” There was a cop car stationed there. Generally, I’m more aware of my race when we visit family than I am when I’m in Chicago. This is especially true at a Catholic school fundraiser where I’m probably the only non-white person (and one of two gay people). I stood out. My in-laws were volunteering at the beer tent, so my partner and I were babysitting the girls and keeping them out of trouble at the carnival. If he and I were together with the nieces, we got some extended stares. Nothing too serious.","Every time I did something one-on-one with one of our nieces, I got the look. If I had to walk one of my nieces to the bathroom, or go get more tokens for the games, or ask if they could have more junk food, it felt like every person at the carnival was watching me. Without a white person escorting me through this white space, I lost all trustworthiness and suddenly became a suspicious black guy. At a fundraiser for a school! I’m here spending money!\n","Practically, this meant I was a less attentive babysitter than normal. This might have been different if my partner wasn’t with me, but he was, so I let him take the lead. I didn’t hold on to my younger niece’s hand, even though she’s the type to run off excitedly. I made sure to say sentences like, “Make sure you tell UNCLE Brandon where you are going.” In my normal life I would never say that sentence. I would say something like, “Hey! Before you run off somewhere, you have to tell me. OK?”","Harry, 26, Atlanta:","When I was around 9 years old, I was at a store with my dad. I recall it being either a gas station or a CVS Pharmacy. I was paying for something small, maybe a Gatorade. When the cashier asked if I wanted a receipt, I told them no. My dad quickly corrected me, and said that I needed one. When we got to the car, he told me that I always needed a receipt when I left the store to protect myself. I didn’t understand it at the time, but that moment always stuck with me, and it wasn’t until I got older that I understood what that meant.","Then there’s the whole routine I learned to go through when getting pulled over. And even when I go through my routine of music off, hands on the wheel, take my hat and sunglasses off and tell an officer where my license and registration is at before I reach for it — I still shake with nerves. It’s just one of those things we’re taught that a lot of other people don’t have to think about. It’s a method of security and, in some cases, survival. For a lot of people, they’ll hear these things endlessly, but will never believe them because it’s just not something they’re going to experience.","West, 34, Charleston, South Carolina:","I was purchasing music equipment at a store, and there was just a single white woman running it. Here I am, an average-sized black man trying my best to make her feel relaxed and calm. I could feel the tension subconsciously bubbling out from within her. It’s interesting that it is usually the store’s responsibility to make the customer feel comfortable in purchasing, but as a black person, that role is always reversed. I purchased a significant number of large items, and I had to carry each one out individually. This area was mostly a “white” space, so I’m anxious that someone will think I’m stealing from this store if they see me loading up my vehicle one box at a time.","I didn’t have “the talk” when I was younger, because my parents were big on integration and wanted me to fit in. I only had white friends, and when I suggested that I’m being treated differently — “Oh, it’s all in your head.” But one time in college, I was carrying a small block of wood to a class, and a public safety officer stopped me and told me there were reports that there was someone holding something suspicious — the R-word never came to mind. I had to learn how to deal with being “an other” everywhere I went.","This anxiety and the stress was so potent that I literally had bouts of paranoia and psychological damage. I went to see a therapist. That’s when I had my wake-up call. And can you believe there were no black therapists in Charleston, South Carolina? I found a Jewish therapist because that was the best I could do. That Jewish man essentially gave me the talk that your grandmom gave you at 8 years old. Then all the dots connected. And it was like my consciousness morphed and I finally accepted my blackness. I wasn’t aware that I had to learn this. After all, before that, “I’m not black, I’m an American” was my mindset. The real world teaches you that’s not the case in the harshest of ways. That’s why it’s a blessing you got the talk early.","Zina, 27, Newport News, Virginia:","My most recent memory involves me wearing a Princeton T-shirt to high school. Upon getting to my AP Spanish class — and there were only seven black folks in there — this white girl walks over to my desk and blatantly says, “You know you have to be smart enough to get in, right?” I felt my temperature rising because of the disrespect. So I politely said, “Yeah, I’m sure my 4.4 GPA will help with that.” I was polite because I felt like as a black teen, they already had an expectation that I’d get out of character at the slightest insult. I didn’t want to give her that satisfaction.","The teacher did not reprimand her in any way. It felt like she condoned that shit. I told my mom about it and she went into a talk about how being black means you have to work twice as hard to be half as good. Then she marched down to the dean and told her if that girl harassed me again and it wasn’t addressed, she’d be escalating it.","When white students display microaggressions that go unchecked by white faculty, at some point you have to get others involved. Those microaggressions are one way we start developing mental health issues, social trauma, etc.","Erin, 18, Las Vegas:","My whole life I attended predominantly white institutions. I was always one of the only black kids in my class, but I never really realized I was different until one day on the playground. I was running with my friends and I had a race against this white boy in my class. I beat him, and he wasn’t too happy about it. He screamed in my face that I was “just a stupid black person.” I told my teacher and they did nothing but slightly reprimand him.","I went home, looked in the mirror and I saw that I was different — and that I always would be — for the first time. I didn’t tell my mom because I felt ashamed, and to this day I still haven’t. From then on it was hard to exist with the white kids all day, every day, and not feel like I was nothing. It’s taken me many years to find my own self-worth, especially as a black female, and every day it’s a struggle.","Laura, 25, Gaithersburg, Maryland:","I was 6 years old, and I distinctly remember I was playing on the playground at after-school care. A girl who I thought was my best friend told me she couldn’t play with me anymore because I was black. I was very confused. It was difficult for me to comprehend why someone would suddenly want to end a friendship over something I could not change. I was black the entire school year, so where did this come from?","I was distraught and told my mom once I got home. My mom told me to ignore it, and that it was safe to assume that the girl had been repeating what she had heard from an adult. It was most likely a sentiment expressed by her parents. But I’ll never forget what my mom did next. I was at another classmate’s birthday party, playing in her backyard, when I saw my mom go up to the girl’s mother. I had never seen her confront another adult. I don’t know what the exact exchange of words was but, allegedly, her mom did not know where her child got that idea from and my former friend apologized.\n","The apology didn’t really matter.

Three national GOP arms ― the National Republican Congressional Committee, the Republican National Committee, and the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC aligned with House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) ― have together spent more than $1.2 million on Lesko’s behalf.","In addition, President Donald Trump recorded a robocall for Lesko, and several Republican leaders have traveled to the district to campaign and raise money for her.","The GOP would suffer a blow to morale from even a narrow win in the solidly Republican seat, which explains why national GOP leaders are not taking any chances, according to Gina Woodall, an Arizona State University politics expert.","“If this very safe Republican seat flips, then anything goes at the state level and at the federal level in November,” Woodall said. “Republicans have a tremendous amount to lose in Arizona.”","The fact that the contest has been competitive is a promising sign for Democrats. The state party, which has set up a field office and dedicated staffers to Tipirneni’s bid, is using the race as an opportunity to generate excitement and infrastructure for upcoming midterm opportunities.","Democrats have a serious shot in November of flipping the state Senate, where the GOP has a four-seat edge. The party plans to target at least six GOP-held state Senate seats, and has fielded promising candidates for an open U.S. Senate seat as well, including Rep. Kyrsten Sinema.","The 8th District special election has “already done some magic” for local Democrats, said Ann Teeters Johnson, a retiree from Sun City West. “Because there is a primary and an election again so soon, I think it would carry over.”","The demographics of Arizona’s 8th fundamentally favor Republicans. Over 84 percent of residents are white, and nearly 22 percent are aged 65 or older ― both groups that generally lean Republican.","Prior to his resignation in December, Rep. Trent Franks (R) routinely won re-election by more than 30 percentage points. (Franks resigned in December after allegedly offering a female aide $5 million to serve as a surrogate mother for him and his wife.)","Democratic Energy That’s A ‘Little Different’","A number of forces have converged to give Democrats a fighting chance in the district, nestled in a section of Maricopa County known as the West Valley.","Chief among them are energized Democratic voters, and grassroots groups that have sprouted since the 2016 election.","Ann Teeters Johnson, who has used the Democratic National Committee’s digital programs to make calls and text messages for Tipirneni, joined Rogue Democratic Women, a 100-person group that organized a Democratic candidate forum during the primary. Tipirneni’s bid has unleashed Democratic pride that has wowed Johnson, who likens the Republican stronghold to hostile territory.","Johnson shows her partisan colors with a bumper sticker that says, “Had Enough? Vote Democratic.” On a number of occasions in recent weeks, people have left notes on her windshield to share their agreement with the sticker’s message.","“I’ve been in Democratic politics a long time and it is a little different,” Johnson said. “I haven’t seen something like this.”","The struggle to increase Arizona teachers’ pay and funding for the state’s schools has only heightened the excitement for Tipirneni’s bid. Tens of thousands of teachers, students, parents and other supporters wore red during a school walkout on April 11, protesting low pay and school budget cuts.","The movement, which they christened #RedforEd, got the attention of Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican up for re-election in November. Ducey vowed to give teachers a 20-percent raise by 2020, and restore education funding. Nonetheless, teachers skeptical that the money would not be cut from other essential services plan a statewide strike on Thursday.","Tipirneni, an ardent supporter of #RedforEd and public-school parent, has found an appealing foil in Lesko, who championed a costly private-school voucher bill. The legislation aroused opposition from many of the same suburban women now attracted to Tipirneni’s bid. While Lesko helped shepherd the bill into law, grassroots resistance to the measure has won voters the opportunity to decide its fate on the November ballot.","Spinning The Outcome","Tipirneni, who has focused her campaign on kitchen-table issues like health care, education and retirement, has proven a prodigious fundraiser. As of the beginning of the month, she had raised nearly $180,000 more than Lesko.","But the national cavalry for Lesko, which has more than closed the individual candidates’ fundraising gap, has not been matched by Democratic cash. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which helps elect Democrats to the House, has spent nothing toward Tipirneni’s bid.","The outside GOP money appears to be having an impact. One public poll that showed Tipirneni leading by 1 percentage point two weeks ago, more recently found Lesko with a 6-point lead.","Election watchers pessimistic about Tipirneni’s chances of an upset also point to the makeup of voters who have already cast their ballots in the state’s capacious early voting program. Arizonans have been able to vote in person and by mail since March 28, and the types of voters who have already submitted ballots bode well for Lesko.","Of more than 154,000 ballots already cast, 49 percent of voters were registered Republicans, compared with 28 percent Democrats and 23 percent independents. The median age of the people who have already voted is 67.","National Republicans are already casting a Lesko win as a referendum on progressive health care policies. Tipirneni advocates allowing Americans of all ages to buy into Medicare, as well as offering Medicaid beneficiaries the opportunity to purchase private coverage. But Lesko and national Republicans have dubbed her a proponent of single-payer health care in which the federal government would be the sole insurer for all Americans.","“Hiral Tipirneni will be the first of many single-payer supporters to suffer defeat this year,” said National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Jesse Hunt.","Progressives hope to argue that Tipirneni kept the race close because she ran strongly as a champion of affordable health care, and defender of Social Security and Medicare. Tipirneni has vowed to protect the social insurance programs and denounced the budget-busting GOP tax cuts for creating a political impetus to cut them.","Ady Barkan, an ALS-stricken progressive activist whose “Be A Hero” initiative targets Republicans who voted for, or back the tax cuts, traveled to the district to campaign on Tipirneni’s behalf. While in Arizona, Barkan, who will need Medicare as his body deteriorates, asked Lesko to respond to the stated intentions of several Republican leaders, including House Speaker Ryan and White House budget director Mick Mulvaney, to seek major cuts to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.","Barkan features a key moment in the exchange in a one-minute ad ― one of two starring Barkan that the progressive Working Families Party has spent $100,000 to air in the district. In the snippet, Lesko tells Barkan, who will be on Medicare, she is “not familiar” with GOP plans to cut social programs.","The video cuts to a Washington Post article from December: “Ryan says Republicans to target welfare, Medicare, Medicaid spending in 2018.”","Lesko “didn’t even know that her agenda would rip health care away from people like me,” Barkan concludes."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ad53add1e00003b137b1ac7.jpeg?cache=nHbi1OvbQA&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"WEIRD NEWS","headline":"Costumed Squirrel 'Furry Boi' Wins Election For Berkeley Student Senate","authors":"Mary Papenfuss","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/costumed-squirrel-furry-boi-wins-election-for-berkeley-student-senate_us_5add54bae4b009869bfaacf9","short_description":"The senator-elect embraced human-friendly issues after his victory.","date":"2018-04-24"},"articleContent":["In a sign that Americans may have had it with human candidates, a squirrel has won a seat in the University of California, Berkeley, student senate.

Main character Richard (Thomas Middleditch) gathers eight CEOs willing to collaborate on his grand project of building a decentralized internet. One of those leaders is DeeDee, a gay man who runs an LGBTQ dating app and tells Richard that he goes to church every Sunday with his partner.","During a meeting, Richard accidentally “outs” DeeDee as a Christian, a revelation that immediately arouses suspicion and distrust among the gathered developers. One potential collaborator even threatens to back out of the partnership with Richard.","“It freaks people out in the Valley,” one of Richard’s colleagues says about Christianity during the episode.","Even DeeDee admits that his religious identity has caused him trouble in the past.","“Dad says my lifestyle makes him sick,” he said in the episode. “He just wants his gay son back.”","But in the end, DeeDee is relieved that he’s now able to be open about his faith.","“I’m out. My nightmare’s over,” he said, adopting the language LGBTQ people use to talk about disclosing sexual orientation or gender identity. “I don’t ever have to go back to the closet again.”","Crystal Cheatham, a queer Christian activist, told HuffPost she “absolutely” identified with DeeDee’s storyline. Cheatham is the creator of Our Bible, a Bible app for progressive Christians. The app provides users with devotionals highlighting interfaith inclusivity and LGBTQ acceptance, and hopes to help progressive Christians create healthy prayer and meditation habits.","Cheatham said she’s found it hard to communicate to others in the tech industry about why her progressive Christian app is so innovative.","“More than anything there is a language barrier that inhibits potential investors from ‘getting it,’ the way they do with some of my other techy counterparts,” Cheatham wrote in an email.","“I think we as a culture would rather hear someone say they are ‘spiritual’ rather than Christian,” she added. “The word Christian is heavy with a lot of baggage that has been tacked on over the years, and especially today in the Trump era.”","However, Cheatham said she doesn’t think this means Christians ― particularly conservative Christians ― are being persecuted for their beliefs.","In most parts of the country, “coming out” as Christian doesn’t have the same repercussions as coming out as queer. While the number of Christians in America is declining and some (white) Christians in particular are anxious about losing ground in the culture wars, overall, Christians in America are a privileged and influential group. They still make up about 70 percent of the population and, significantly, more than 90 percent of Congress.","On the other hand, queer Americans are still fighting for basic rights ― for protection from discrimination in employment, education, housing, healthcare, adoption and public accommodations.","By showcasing the awkward and at times hostile reception DeeDee receives in the bubble of “Silicon Valley,” the writers demonstrate the struggles Christians can face in these progressive spaces ― and illustrate the trials LGBTQ Americans face elsewhere.","“Unfortunately the divide between gays and Christians has only been codified by the fact that most Christian spaces have been unreachable by LGBTQ people. This, in a way, has backfired,” Cheatham said. “By rejecting LGBTQ people as a global church the term ‘Christian’ has come to mean judgmental, pious, self righteous, strict, conservative, anti-women, anti-choice and quite a few other political things that in my humble opinion seemingly deface the name and practice of being a Christian.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5adf8af81a00004300cdcbe9.jpeg?cache=8F3MG8do5D&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Here's Who Dies In 'Avengers: Infinity War,' According To Psychics","authors":"Bill Bradley","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/heres-who-will-die-in-avengers-infinity-war-according-to-psychics_us_5adce842e4b089e33c893303","short_description":"It's time to open your third eyes, people.","date":"2018-04-24"},"articleContent":["I’m not often faced with my own mortality when writing about superhero movies.

Wait a minute, for real?” “Infinity War” writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely said when I later confronted them with the results of my weeklong quest for truth.","I don’t have much experience with psychics, but right away, I learned they don’t normally weigh in on matters of the Marvel universe. After calling more than 30 psychics, astrologers, mediums and tarot carder readers around New York, emailing others around the country, getting denied time and time again, and waiting on doorsteps in the rain for longer than I’d like to admit, I finally scrapped together my team.","Some I had to meet in secret locations; others were across the street from Taco Bell. Some communicated sparsely via email, and others made me question my own existence (and later apologized over text message). But in the end, they included tarot card reader Angela Lucy, celebrity psychic Jesse Bravo, former Vanity Fair astrologer Lutin, the Mystical Empress Brenda Renee, psychic-astrologer Amira Celon, Raphael aka “The World’s Medium” and Anthony Carr, who bills himself as “the world’s most documented psychic.”","These were the terms: I gave each participant a list of major “Infinity War” heroes and asked which names, if any, were marked for death. To aid them, I brought along a bag of relevant items specially plucked from the Hasbro toy chest that is my desk: a Civil War Blaster Reveal Shield (for Captain America), an Infinity War Hero Vision mask (for Iron Man) and a Marvel Avengers Power Hammer (for Thor).","Sure, most of these experts were unfamiliar with the Marvel movies. Nonetheless, after getting my results, I presented some of the most shocking to the actual writers of “Infinity War” in a shameless interview on Sunday ― days before I’d actually see the movie.","So, here’s who dies in “Avengers: Infinity War,” according to psychics, astrologers, mediums and tarot card readers. And here’s what the creators of the movie think about the undoubtedly spot-on predictions.","HIGHEST CHANCE OF DEATH: HULK","I know! What!? Hulk wasn’t even on my radar as a possibility, but he turned out to be the character most often predicted to kick the bucket.","His death was foreshadowed by celebrity psychic Jesse Bravo, whom I met in a secret location in New York City that was basically just an office he doesn’t list online in an effort to avoid people randomly showing up at his place of work unannounced. There, we sequestered ourselves in a small, windowless room (aka a closet), and he broke the news swiftly: Hulk’s going to die, he told me.","Earlier in the day, I attended my first-ever tarot card reading at Angela Lucy’s apartment, where she, too, foresaw Hulk’s death. She was just as shocked as I was when she a drew a card that doomed him to an 80 percent chance of dying.","“Whoa! That’s a little more scary. I didn’t expect Hulk to go. He’s always the big green guy,” she said.","Two other experts who emailed me agreed with Bravo and Lucy. Colorado-based Mystical Empress Brenda Renee specializes in shamanic healing, psychic readings, quantum life-coaching sessions and feng shui, among other things. She didn’t even know the title of the movie we were talking about, so she relied on “imagination and psychic senses” to guide her way. Raphael, who was once based in Los Angeles and now just travels the world “like a digital nomad,” used his “gift of mediumship,” a bronze pendulum, a set of crystals and The Golden Tarot of the Tsar to deduce the outcome.","Both came to the same conclusion: Hulk’s time may be up.","Going into this, I thought Gamora, if anyone, would be the green character to bite the dust. She’s the daughter of the main villain, Thanos, and provides an ominous voice-over on various versions of the “Infinity War” trailer. However, Lucy only gave her a measly 10 percent chance of death. She even consulted the Archangel Michael to reassure me of Gamora’s fate, adding, “I can’t believe I’m taking in the archangels to find out about ‘Avengers.’”","She concluded that “something bad” happens to Gamora. “Maybe she’s trapped or captured at the end and they have to go get her or something like that. She’s like out of the picture ― kind of a death. It’s a weak death, so maybe she’s in a cage or something. She’s kind of waiting in the background, so maybe she’s a damsel in distress, which she’s so not.”","LIKELY TO DIE: IRON MAN","Robert Downey Jr.’s contract with Marvel is reportedly up after “Avengers 4,” which is the sequel to “Infinity War” expected in 2019, but if these predictions are right, it might be ending as early as the upcoming film.","After drawing a chariot card during our session, Lucy gave Iron Man a 70 percent chance to die. She said he’s likely on the way out and “will make quite the exit.”","“Say goodbye to Iron Man. He’s done,” Bravo reiterated after picking up the Iron Man mask I brought him.","I laughed, thinking he was joking at first. “Wait, really?”","Bravo explained that his conclusion was just based on the feeling he got after seeing the names on the list. Sadly, Raphael also suggested in his predictions that Iron Man “could die.”","LIKELY TO DIE: WAR MACHINE","He’s been in bad shape since “Captain America: Civil War,” but just hang in there, buddy. According to the psychics, you won’t have to suffer much longer.","Bravo actually predicted that Iron Man and War Machine would exit the movie together, which makes sense since they’ve been side by side since the first “Iron Man” in 2008. Raphael agreed that it’s “very, very” likely that War Machine won’t make it, as did Renee.","LIKELY TO DIE: HAWKEYE","We didn’t see Hawkeye in the “Infinity War” trailers, which is one indication that he might be gone for good soon.","Another indication: three of the psychics, mediums and astrologers I spoke to predicted he’d bite the dust. First, psychic-astrologer Amira Celon, based in Los Angeles, California, told me over email that his name, as well as that of Drax and Loki, immediately “jumped out” to her “on a psychic level.” Then Bravo identified Hawkeye as one of the characters to go during our closet session. Finally, Raphael called his death “likely.”","We were introduced to Hawkeye’s family back in “Avengers: Age of Ultron,” so his death could pack a bigger emotional punch in the latest film. Ultimately, though, haven’t we always seen this one coming? Hawkeye’s power is basically just shooting arrows really well, so ... yeah, he could die.","LIKELY TO DIE: SCARLET WITCH","No matter of magic hand-waving can save Elizabeth Olsen’s character from psychic predictions. It doesn’t make sense that Marvel would off Scarlet Witch so soon. After all, she’s only been in a few movies so far. But Raphael, Bravo and Renee all listed her among the victims.","Witch is one of the most powerful characters in the Marvel movies, so losing her could be an insurmountable blow to the Avengers. It doesn’t make a ton of sense, but sure. Why not?","MOST SHOCKING CHARACTER TO SURVIVE: CAPTAIN AMERICA","Outside of psychics and other extrasensory perceivers, most critics and fans are predicting that Captain America will die in “Infinity War.”","In a recent interview with The New York Times, Chris Evans heavily hinted that he was close to leaving the shield for good. That’s why it’s surprising that only one psychic, Bravo, deemed the Cap a dead man walking.\n\nAs far as the other participants, Lucy gave him a 50 percent chance of dying, suggesting he might “get into some scrapes.” Raphael said Captain America will be “lost.” “Where does he belong? What is the point? It is a moment for some training with a mentor and a successful relaunch of his skills and mission,” Raphael said, refraining from dooming Captain America to death.\n\nBravo, on the other hand, picked up the items I brought him ― the shield, the mask and the hammer ― and said two of the three related characters would die: Captain America and Iron Man. (Thor, he explained, would have a chance at life, because he is a god.) Here is Bravo’s final list of supposed goners:","MOST CONFUSING RESULT: LOKI","Early on in the trailer, we see Loki handing an infinity stone over to Thanos, and then he’s just gone. This has led many to theorize that the lack of screen time means it’s Loki’s only scene; he’s probably going to die in “Infinity War.”","Three psychics, Celon, Renee and Raphael, did predict his death, but, surprisingly, three others, Bravo, former Vanity Fair astrologer Michael Lutin and Lucy, stated that he’d survive.","This was Lutin’s only prediction. He said he didn’t really know the characters and described my request as “an example of someone’s death anxiety,” but after seeing Tom Hiddleston’s birthdate (listed as Feb. 9, 1981), he said Loki would live because “he’s Aquarius,” and the “north node is in Leo” and the “south node is in Aquarius.”","“He’ll have outside help. I don’t even know the characters, but I think that’s going to happen. He’s going to be severely weakened and wounded and somebody will come to help,” he said.","Lucy admitted that she didn’t know who Loki is, but explained that the high priestess card she drew during our conversation meant he might do something mystical “behind-the-scenes or in secret” ― i.e., betray someone or become a double agent.","MOST SHOCKING POSSIBLE DEATH: ANT-MAN","Yes, Ant-Man has a movie coming up after “Avengers: Infinity War,” but I’m just reporting what the psychics said.","“For some reason, I see him dying,” Raphael said, “even though I know there is a new movie scheduled. I see him completely defeated in the movie, I see him dead. I can be wrong, of course.”","As you can see from Bravo’s list above, he also predicted Ant-Man would die, as did Renee, who by the way, sees a ton of destruction in general.","“As I was musing on the movie, without knowing a title, I saw a lot of catastrophic disaster in the movie. Lots of characters dying. It will be an epic bloody battle, and as the dust settles, a new system will be put in place to restructure the environment/world these characters inhabit,” she said.","Don’t give up on Ant-Man quite yet, though. While three others picked him for death, Lucy drew a tarot card that suggests there’s something coming for Ant-Man in the future ― perhaps, in her words, another movie. It was only then I informed her “Ant-Man and the Wasp” was out later this year.","WEIRDEST PREDICTION: TRUMP","Anthony Carr likes to do his own thing, and rather than make a death prediction, he gave me an equally crazy prophesy involving the Avengers and an “even greater evil,” Donald Trump:","This new superhero movie ― “The Avengers” ― will create more wealth than Disney has ever known! All of the superheroes are joining forces to defeat an incredibly evil monster! But even after it’s been destroyed, they will then marshal all their combined forces in a last-ditch attempt to overcome an even greater evil, one who has already set in motion the possible destruction and annihilation of not only the human race, but this (late?) great planet Earth!... TRUMP!!!! The world will never ever be the same!","What do you think about that result, Donald?","Well, there you have it. Other characters appearing on at least two death lists include Nebula (predicted by Lucy and Renee), Valkyrie (predicted by Renee and Raphael), Starlord (predicted by Renee and Raphael), Mantis (predicted by Bravo and Lucy), Falcon (predicted by Bravo and Raphael) and Heimdall (predicted by Bravo and Raphael).","Somehow Vision wasn’t listed at all, which is weird considering the marketing for “Infinity War” that shows him constantly screaming in pain. So congratulations, Vision.","So, what did the creators think?","Regarding some of the more shocking results, “Infinity War” writer McFeely told me, “You are putting us in an awkward spot, Bill. I would have to be commenting one way or another on the powers of psychics.”","His co-writer Christopher Markus, on the other hand, speculated that on the astral plane, there are an “infinite number of versions of the movie,” so “all the predictions are right in some universe.”","Sounds like an endorsement to me."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5add71091a00004800533c76.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Vin Diesel Actually Dressed As Groot For 'Avengers: Infinity War' Premiere","authors":"Cole Delbyck","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/vin-diesel-actually-dressed-as-groot-for-avengers-infinity-war-premiere_us_5adf3b75e4b061c0bfa22359","short_description":"When will your fave?","date":"2018-04-24"},"articleContent":["Not all superheroes wear capes.

The ACLU says it's consenting to warrantless searches it could refuse.","date":"2018-04-24"},"articleContent":["Border Patrol officers routinely board buses without a warrant, without specific people they’re targeting, up to 100 miles from the border — and ask passengers for their papers. Greyhound, the nation’s largest intercity bus line, lets the Border Patrol do it and doesn’t plan to stop.","Greyhound officials say they’re just complying with the law. But 10 ACLU state affiliates argue Greyhound has the right — and the responsibility to its passengers — to demand a warrant for Border Patrol officers to board its buses.","They believe Greyhound could fight for its rights and win. But first they have to convince the company to try.","“The starting place is to not give your consent,” said Jordan Wells, an attorney for the New York Civil Liberties Union. “If Border Patrol then says, ‘You know what, we actually don’t even need their consent, we’re going to just do this stuff,’ that would violate the Constitution. But we the public don’t get to have that conversation about whether this is constitutional when Greyhound gives away the game by just saying, ‘We consent, so it’s OK.’”","The tactic of boarding buses to ask passengers for papers isn’t new to the Trump administration, but immigrant rights advocates say it’s happening more frequently as the president seeks to detain and deport more immigrants. People were outraged in January when a Greyhound passenger posted video of Border Patrol officers demanding proof of citizenship from every passenger on the bus. It’s not just buses: Border Patrol has also questioned passengers on Amtrak trains, and last year Customs and Border Protection agents demanded passengers on a flight show ID when leaving a domestic flight. This isn’t for buses, trains or flights coming into the U.S.; it happens when people are traveling from place to place inside the U.S.","Customs and Border Protection, which includes Border Patrol, says that’s all within its authority. A spokesperson cited a statute that says immigration officers may “board and search for aliens in any vessel” within a reasonable distance from the border and without a warrant. The CBP spokesperson declined to elaborate on whether the agency requires probable cause or suspicion to board buses and request documents from passengers.","Government regulations set that “reasonable distance” as up to 100 miles from the border, including both the land and coasts, giving CBP authority over an area that includes nine of the 10 largest metropolitan areas and about two-thirds of the entire U.S. population.","A Greyhound spokesperson sent a list of statutes and regulations for why it must allow Border Patrol onto buses any time officers ask.","“Greyhound is required to comply with the law,” the spokesperson said last month after the ACLU wrote to the company to ask it to stop allowing Border Patrol to board without a warrant. “We are aware that routine transportation checks not only affect our operations, but our customers’ travel experience and will continue to do everything legally possible to minimize any negative experiences.”","The question is whether the document checks violate the Fourth Amendment, which protects individuals from unreasonable searches and seizures. The ACLU argues that CBP violates individuals’ rights when it does things like keeping passengers of a plane from deboarding while it questions them or asking for papers of bus passengers far from the border based on thin grounds for suspicion or none at all.","Greyhound isn’t “following the law; they’re facilitating a violation of the law,” said Cecillia Wang, deputy legal director at the national ACLU.","Legal experts were divided on whether Greyhound’s rights are being violated, which will likely have to be answered in the courts or by Congress.","The Border Patrol does have considerable authority to question people within its parameters of a “reasonable” distance from the border, so long as it doesn’t do so in a discriminatory way. That includes asking bus passengers for papers, even if it’s also “definitely unsavory,” said Greg Doucette, a North Carolina-based criminal attorney.","Courts have approved of warrantless stops of cars by the Border Patrol. The Supreme Court ruled in the 1976 case U.S. vs. Martinez-Fuerte that checkpoints on roads a distance from the border, at which every car is stopped for brief questioning, were not a violation of the Fourth Amendment.","But there are some limits. The Supreme Court has ruled that the Fourth Amendment prohibits the Border Patrol from searching private vehicles away from the border without probable cause or consent.","However, Greyhound is consenting to the searches rather than trying to assert a Fourth Amendment challenge. Many legal experts said they were unsure whether the company could prevail if it did try to say no. Kristie De Peña, director of immigration at the libertarian Niskanen Center think tank, said that if bus drivers demanded a warrant, they’d “just make agents mad” and likely wouldn’t succeed in arguing their right to do so in court. If Greyhound wanted to fight the searches, it might be able to get a toehold by arguing that the Border Patrol was trying to enter its non-public areas of business on routes far from the border, but current law indicates they likely wouldn’t be successful, De Peña said.","Others believed Greyhound could win in court. Several cited the fact that buses, because they are for ticketed passengers only, are a non-public area of a business. Greyhound could also argue that the Border Patrol was hurting its business, said Thomas Saenz, president and general counsel of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, or MALDEF.","“If I was Greyhound, I would certainly understand that this is a threat to my business, and I would test this and I would say no and take it where it goes,” Saenz said.","Anil Kalhan, a professor at Drexel University’s Thomas R. Kline School of Law, likened the matter to when Apple resisted the FBI’s demands to gain access to a locked iPhone. Greyhound could similarly take a stand in defense of the privacy of its customers, he said, and could win in courts, although he cautioned that it wasn’t guaranteed.","Greyhound is trying to say “that they’re not making an affirmative choice here, that they’re agreeing to the CBP entering because they have to, and that’s not the case,” Kalhan said. “I think that is obscuring the fact that they’re making this choice.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ade46ed1a00002700cdca17.jpeg?cache=xp04KdFkLB&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Trump Reportedly Uses Private Cell Phone More Often Amid Kelly's Waning Influence","authors":"Nick Visser","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-personal-cell-phone_us_5adebcbbe4b0b2e81132a499","short_description":"“This is potentially a gold mine of intelligence,\" James Clapper said.","date":"2018-04-24"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"SCIENCE","headline":"Uranus Is Actually A Giant Ball Of Farts Floating In Space, Study Finds","authors":"Ed Mazza","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/uranus-smells-like-farts_us_5adeba4ce4b0df502a4ed20e","short_description":"However, the smell could quite literally be the last thing you notice.","date":"2018-04-24"},"articleContent":["Someone light a match.","In a study making people everywhere giggle, researchers found that much of the upper atmosphere of Uranus is hydrogen sulfide.

Flowers were artfully styled. Friends and family were present. The diamond rings were sparkly and large. Chiseled men got down on one knee to propose to beautiful, tall, blond, white women.","In most TV series, these would be the ultimate happy endings for the female characters. Maybe their relationships would fall apart down the road, but in that moment, they would obviously say yes to the proposals ― most likely with teary eyes and expressions of joy only the knowledge that they now (perhaps?) wouldn’t die alone could bring.","But in the most recent seasons of “UnREAL” and “Jessica Jones,” the former of which wrapped up on Monday night, these familiar setups didn’t amount to familiar conclusions. Both aforementioned women turned down their respective proposals, staying single by choice.","On “Jessica Jones,” Jessica’s best friend Trish, an actress-turned-broadcaster-turned-wannabe-vigilante-sidekick, rejects her successful, empathetic and loving broadcast journalist boyfriend. “I don’t want to be with Griffin,” she explains. “I want to be him. I want to do what he does. And that’s not love, and that’s not fair to either one of us.”","On “UnREAL,” things get meta. The rejected proposals happen within “Everlasting,” the “Bachelor(ette)”-like show that the main characters produce. Serena Wolcott is the reality show’s first female lead, a whip-smart single woman who proves difficult to manipulate. On a show that usually depends on a happy ending for ratings and audience buy-in, Serena chooses no one. “I have wanted this so much, but I realize that I have to wait until I know for sure in my soul that I have found my perfect match,” she says to her two dejected suitors ― and all of America.","What might seem like lines plucked straight from the “How To Be a Strong Female Character” guidebook becomes something else in the hands of the “UnREAL” and “Jessica Jones” cast and crew: A rare glimpse at what a Realistic Single Female Character looks like in 2018 (though both series certainly have their pitfalls). They join an increasingly varied and lengthy list of TV shows that are subverting the idea that for women, all narrative roads lead toward and end with coupledom.","Unmarried women are a potent force in American society. As of 2016, there were 110.6 million unmarried people over the age of 18 in the United States, and 53.2 percent of those people were women. As Rebecca Traister wrote in an adapted excerpt of her 2016 book All the Single Ladies, “We are living through the invention of independent female adulthood as a norm, not an aberration, and the creation of an entirely new population: adult women who are no longer economically, socially, sexually, or reproductively dependent on or defined by the men they marry.”","And yet single women are still being explicitly and implicitly told ― by politicians, by pop culture creators, by the wedding industry ― that their lives are fundamentally incomplete. They are constantly in a state of “becoming,” not because of personal growth and possibility, but because of what they lack ― a long-term, monogamous, romantic (implied male) partner. In the words of Simone de Beauvoir: “Marriage is traditionally the destiny offered to women by society. Most women are married or have been, or plan to be or suffer from not being.”","In 1960, nearly 60 percent of Americans between the ages of 18 and 29 were married. By 2011, that percentage had dropped to 20 ― a record low. So what happens when, for the first time in American history, you have a critical mass of unmarried women over the age of 30 who choose to or simply find themselves in a position to build family structures, financially stable careers and homes independently? Do the stories ― even the fictional ones ― we tell about these women expand along with their realities? Or do we continue to privilege romantic partnership as the natural, and only truly happy, end to a female character’s narrative arc?","After all, even Carrie Bradshaw, Liz Lemon and Leslie Knope ended up tying the knot.","On the small screen at least, we’re seeing a resurgence of complicated narratives about unmarried women. Shows like “UnREAL,” “Jessica Jones,” “Being Mary Jane,” “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” and the upcoming “Dietland” are pushing the boundaries of what single womanhood looks like, spotlighting complex, wildly different stories about women who just happen to be unattached ― and might not be immediately compelled to become otherwise.","In “Jessica Jones,” not only is Trish unmarried, but so is the titular character herself, and, in Season 2, high-powered attorney Jeri Hogarth. Romantic and sexual relationships certainly feature in the show, but the Marvel series is ultimately about self-discovery ― Jessica’s embrace of her superhero status, or Trish’s realization that her deepest desires are professional and not romantic. In “UnREAL,” producers Rachel Goldberg and Quinn King are both single, as is the aforementioned protagonist of “Everlasting,” Serena. The show-within-the-show might be laser-focused on manufactured love, but “UnREAL” itself is more interested in power ― how it’s wielded, how it corrupts, how women can reclaim it. For both series, romance is part of the equation, but it’s hardly the only or even primary goal for their female protagonists, a reality that has long been accepted as the norm for male characters.","In 2018, the “behavioral latitude for women is so much wider than it used to be,” film critic and author Molly Haskell told HuffPost. “It’s just a real existentialist adventure for women now.”","Of course, we’ve seen boundary-breaking, unmarried protagonists on television before. Shows like “That Girl,” (1966-71), “The Mary Tyler Moore Show” (1970-77), “Murphy Brown” (1988-98) and “Living Single” (1993-98) centered on single women without condescension and without assuming that romance was the only project they were willing to tackle. And by doing so, they increased audiences’ collective imaginations of what a single woman’s life could be. (Still, some perceived these characters as threatening to the real-world status quo, like when Vice President Dan Quayle called out Murphy Brown for “mocking the importance of fathers by bearing a child alone and calling it just another lifestyle choice.”)","When “Sex and the City” ― another show that centered single women, but with an intentional focus on their love and sex lives ― premiered in 1998, it contained a radical premise: That single women in their 30s were interesting, fabulous and could lead fulfilled lives full of great (and not so great) sex. Before the finale aired in January 2004, there was much discussion about how the series would end. As Emily Nussbaum wrote on Slate in 2002, “SATC” raised a heady question: “What, in a single woman’s life, counts as a happy ending?” (For its part, the show went an emotionally satisfying but traditional route, leaving all of its lead characters in stable partnerships, though not necessarily marriages, by the series’ end.)","The finale of “UnREAL’s” third season asks similar questions. What does a happy ending look like for a 30-something woman who runs her own company in Silicon Valley, has model looks and still finds herself dealing with men who lack the qualities she needs in a partner? What does a happy ending look like for a 30-something woman who is brilliant at her job and dependent on her equally brilliant boss, but suspects her chosen career path might be eating away at her soul? What does a happy ending look like for a woman in her early 40s who is building the empire she always dreamed about and still wants more? These questions alone make for fascinating television.","For “UnREAL” co-creator Sarah Gertrude Shapiro, exploring those questions meant creating space for women “to see reflections of themselves on TV that feel layered and not stereotypical.”","“I think it’s important to come up with different tropes and avatars that show us a different way to look at ourselves,” she said. “And also to show us being valuable ― like, incredibly valuable ― and not only valuable, but fulfilled.”","Faced with this Very Big Goal, “UnREAL” notably resists making simplistic feminist statements for the sake of making feminist statements. In the world of the show, Serena’s televised decision to stay single leads to headlines like “Beware The Princess Fantasy” and “Don’t Settle, Says Serena,” while Twitter users hail Serena as a “feminist hero.” Rachel is self-satisfied and celebratory. “You’ve inspired women everywhere not to settle,” she tells Serena.","“That’s not what this is, Rachel,” Serena says, wryly. “You produced me to pick neither guy. So what, I’d end up like you ― empty, alone?”","“No, I produced an empowered, feminist statement about not being so desperate to pair up that you overlook a mountain of flaws just so you can be done,” counters Rachel.","But Serena is too astute for that. “Tell the truth, Rachel. You don’t hate it here. You love it,” she says. “This is exactly where you belong. Oh, by the way, I made my choice for me, not you. I know it must kill you, but I feel great.”","Moments later, we see Serena in the back of her town car. She takes out her cell phone, opens a Tinder-like app, and starts swiping, again and again and again. She’s already exhausted. I found myself crying watching her, not because her decision felt tragic, but because it felt authentic. Being single, even when you are satisfied with and excited by your life, does not preclude a desire for a romantic relationship that fits. Single women aren’t avatars for a feminist project ― we’re human beings. And sometimes, a Realistic Female Character is more interesting and more narratively important than a Strong Female Character.","In fact, tragedy in both “UnREAL” and “Jessica Jones” is defined not by the end of romantic connection, but in the severing of female bonds and partnerships (Rachel and Quinn’s, Rachel and Serena’s, Jessica and Trish’s). In contrast, triumph on these shows lies in self-discovery, a woman’s reclamation of her future and its ever-expansive opportunities. Those futures might include romance, if the right opportunity arises or if it’s something a given character truly desires. (A future between Quinn and her former flame Chet is teased at the end of “UnREAL,” and the last moments of the “Jessica Jones” finale show Jessica finding solace in dinner with her sexy neighbor and his son.) However, long-term romantic partnership is not a narrative given, and it’s certainly not the only possible happy, or even emotionally satisfying, ending these female characters have before them.","The final moments of the “UnReal” finale find Rachel alone. She’s parted ways with Quinn, her boss and intellectual equal ― “You are a dark twisted wreck, Rachel Goldberg. And I am going to miss every piece of it,” says Quinn, in what might be the single most romantic moment of the series ― to buy the cabin in Oregon she’s been quietly pining over all season. She walks around its empty rooms and out onto the porch. A small smile creeps onto her face as she looks out into the mass of greenery and empty space in front of her. She lays down on the porch, arms splayed, looking up at the sky and just breathes. The future is a question mark ― one we will get to see play out, as the show has already filmed its fourth season ― but she owns it.","As Traister put it, “Single female life is not prescription, but its opposite: liberation.” That lack of structure is equal parts terrifying and exhilarating. Perhaps in a single woman’s life, off-screen as well as on, a “happy” ending is no ending at all."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ade153f1800002800384581.jpeg?cache=lXibidWmfh&ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"TRAVEL","headline":"Los Angeles vs. San Francisco: Which City Rules The West Coast","authors":"Gabriela Kruschewsky","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/los-angeles-vs-san-francisco-which-city-rules-the-west-coast_us_5ade4e10e4b0df502a4ea73e","short_description":"For the most part, Los Angelenos don’t know what it means to walk anywhere, ever. +1: SF 29.

His landlord was Vicki Hart, wife of prominent energy and food company lobbyist J. Steven Hart. A copy of Pruitt’s lease first included Steven Hart’s name as the landlord, which was scratched out and replaced by his wife’s name.","When the eyebrow-raising deal was initially uncovered, Hart said he hadn’t spoken to Pruitt for “many months,” and had no lobbying contact with the EPA in 2017 or 2018.","But Hart, who was chairman and CEO of powerhouse lobbying firm Williams & Jenson at the time, met last summer in Pruitt’s office to discuss EPA protections for the Chesapeake Bay. He was also a registered lobbyist for Smithfield Foods in the first quarter of 2018 and lobbied the EPA on the company’s behalf early this year, according to new disclosure documents filed by Williams & Jenson on Friday. The documents were submitted just hours after Hart announced he was taking early retirement.","Hart insisted, however, that his company’s filings were “inaccurate.” A spokesman confirmed Hart did meet with Pruitt in 2017 and emailed the EPA this year. But he said in a statement Saturday to The Hill that he did so to assist a “friend” on the Chesapeake Bay Commission. “I was not paid for this assistance, and any suggestion that I lobbied for Smithfield Foods is inaccurate,” he added, an assertion that appeared to be backed up by Smithfield Foods.","Hart’s “friend” was Dennis Treacy, a former Smithfield Foods executive now on the board of the Smithfield Foundation and the Chesapeake Bay Commission, The Washington Post reported. Hog and pork producer Smithfield Foods has been supporting Chesapeake Bay environmental protections since it was fined $12.6 million in 1997 for dumping pig waste from its industrial farm into a waterway leading to the bay.","Regardless of who Hart was representing or what was discussed, the fact remains that Hart did meet with Pruitt and reach out to the EPA while the EPA chief was renting from his wife, contradicting Hart’s initial assertions.","At the time Pruitt was renting from his wife, Hart’s company was also representing Cheniere Energy Inc., which is the only exporter of liquified natural gas from the continental U.S. Pruitt touted that very fuel on his controversial trip last year to Morocco. Pruitt and seven aides (at a cost of $40,000) spent four days in Morocco in December touting the benefits of liquified natural gas, according to an EPA press release. The trip was slammed by environmental groups and Democrats as having absolutely nothing to do with EPA’s mission to protect the environment.","The EPA’s ethics office initially signed off on Pruitt’s condo rental but has since issued a statement that officials lacked pertinent facts. The deal is one of several ethical and spending issues currently plaguing the head of the EPA."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5add37cd1800004700e88224.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Tennessee Shooting Suspect Arrested Last Year At White House","authors":"Paul Vale","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tennessee-shooting-suspect-arrested-last-year-at-white-house_us_5addbb04e4b089e33c8a1f95","short_description":"Travis Reinking's guns were taken away after he tried to meet with the president, but his dad apparently got them back for him.","date":"2018-04-23"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"BLACK VOICES","headline":"Beyoncé Inspired Google To Give $100,000 More In HBCU Scholarships","authors":"Jenna Amatulli","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/beyonc%C3%A9-google-hbcu-scholarships_us_5addfbf8e4b0b2e81131ea40","short_description":"Students at Texas Southern, Fisk, Grambling State and Morehouse will now be eligible too.","date":"2018-04-23"},"articleContent":["Beyoncé is celebrating the two-year anniversary of “Lemonade” with two times the generosity, thanks to Google’s matching funds.

Doug Lamborn won’t be on the ballot as a Republican in 2018 after the state’s Supreme Court ruled on Monday, April 23, that one of his petition gatherers wasn’t a Colorado resident.","Five Republicans living in Lamborn’s district had challenged his candidacy earlier this month, arguing he hadn’t properly collected the 1,000 signatures necessary to make the ballot. A lower court had knocked off just 58 signatures, leaving Lamborn with enough to qualify for the ballot. But the state Supreme Court said more than 200 additional signatures were collected by an ineligible petition gatherer and booted Lamborn from the ballot for the June 26 primary.","“We recognize the gravity of this conclusion, but Colorado law does not permit us to conclude otherwise,” the court wrote in a 26-page opinion.","The ruling bars Lamborn for running on the ballot as a Republican. He could challenge the ruling, or potentially mount a re-election bid as an independent.","“We are disappointed by the outcome and we believe it was wrongly decided,” a representative from Lamborn’s campaign told Gray Television News’ D.C. bureau. The campaign will reportedly turn to federal court, seeking to overturn “the part of Colorado law that deprives voters who have petitioned to have Congressman Lamborn on the ballot of their Constitutional rights.”","The decision potentially opens up a lane for Darryl Glenn, an El Paso County Commissioner and Air Force veteran who was the GOP nominee against Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet in 2016. Glenn had announced a primary challenge to Lamborn late last year. State Sen. Owen Hill, another Air Force veteran, is also challenging the incumbent.","Lamborn’s attorney didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. In an earlier statement on the case, the campaign blamed the legal issues on “political tricks” by political allies of Hill.","Lamborn’s district, which is based around heavily conservative Colorado Springs, isn’t considered a Democratic pickup opportunity and isn’t a DCCC target. President Donald Trump won the district in 2016 with 57 percent of the vote to Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s 33 percent.","While Lamborn had typically cruised to general election victories, he had faced prior scares in GOP primaries. He originally won the seat with a plurality in a three-way contest and earned just 52 percent of the vote in 2014.","Many states require petition gatherers to be registered voters in the state. Colorado requires they be “a resident of the state,” but a lower court had suggested a petition gatherer’s intent to live in Colorado in the long term was sufficient.

State Treasurer Walker Stapleton, the GOP frontrunner and a cousin of former President George W. Bush, qualified for the ballot through a convention after determining Kennedy Enterprises had committed fraud while gathering signatures for him.","The Colorado Secretary of State’s office told the Denver Post they feared Lamborn could challenge the legality of the residency requirement in federal court.","“The Colorado Supreme Court just provided an avenue to have a federal court strike down residency requirements for candidate circulators,” Deputy Colorado Secretary of State Suzanne Staiert told the paper.","Clarification: Language in this story has been amended to include more detail about Colorado’s requirements for petition gatherers."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ade4ce82000004200b8f700.jpeg?cache=R7GFessDIe&ops=crop_4_9_2396_1460%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Cage-Free-Egg Laws Spur Cage Match Between States","authors":"Stateline, Editorial Partner","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cage-free-egg-laws-spur-cage-match-between-states_us_5addea18e4b0cf2c46f28c2b","short_description":"Although some consumers say they want eggs from happy chickens, their buying habits indicate they want eggs that are cheap. Now some states are taking sides.","date":"2018-04-23"},"articleContent":["By Rebecca Beitsch","Dennis Bowden has raised chickens in the town of Waldoboro, Maine, nearly his whole life. For more than 40 years, he raised his chickens in cages. Then four years ago, when he turned 65, he cut down his flock and went cage-free.","The decision to switch was Bowden’s alone, but around the country many politicians have firmly taken sides on the issue of penning hens, hoping either to require egg producers to go cage-free or to protect conventional producers by mandating that stores stock their eggs.","Eggs are a staple of the American diet, with 88 billion table eggs produced in 2016. Egg consumption is growing, and the quality of life of the hens that lay the eggs has become an issue not just for animal welfare groups but also for many consumers. Although cage-free hens represent 16 percent of U.S. chickens, their share of the flock grew by a third from 2016 to 2017, and the egg industry and its supporters are paying close attention.","When California and Massachusetts enacted laws requiring that eggs produced and sold there be raised cage-free, 13 states including some of the nation’s largest egg producers sued, saying the laws violated the commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution.","Iowa, the top egg-producing state in the country, went further and enacted a law to protect its conventional, caged-chicken industry. The state now requires any grocer participating in the federal food program for low-income mothers, infants and children, known as WIC, to sell conventional eggs alongside cage-free options.","And last week, U.S. Rep. Steve King, an Iowa Republican, introduced an amendment to the farm bill that would block states from regulating agricultural products that are also produced in other states — a clear shot at cage-free-egg laws.","The tension comes as many restaurants and retailers say they are going cage-free — McDonald’s and Kellogg’s plan to do so by 2025, as does the grocery chain Kroger. And Ohio, Oregon and Washington have banned traditional cages, while this year, bills in Rhode Island and Michigan would require cage-free production and sales.","Conventional egg producers outside those states fear that as more egg-importing states enact such laws, they too will be required to go cage-free, costing them about $40 a bird to convert their facilities.","The Humane Society of the United States, which was behind the ballot measures approved in Massachusetts and California as well as the bill in Rhode Island, said that’s the goal.","“Some states are net importers; some are net exporters,” said Josh Balk, vice president of farm animal protection with the organization. “What we hope to achieve is that there is no place for caged hens to be sold anywhere.”","The Consumer Conundrum","Cage-free doesn’t mean chickens frolicking through pastures. The most common scenario is a big barn with thousands of chickens able to fly and move about freely, even if they are packed in. They may stay inside their entire lives. It’s not chicken utopia, Balk said, but it does give them space to do things chickens like to do — spread their wings, flutter around in the dirt, or just perch.","But having that many chickens cooped up in one space can be dangerous too. Pecking order is not just an expression — the birds seek to create a hierarchy among those they share a space with by pecking those beneath them. Bowden said he trims the beaks of his birds, something he likens to clipping one’s fingernails, so that the birds don’t hurt each other.","Producers who use cages say birds each have about the space of an 8-by-10-inch piece of paper but can move around alongside six or seven other chicken cage-mates, according to a spokesman for the National Association of Egg Farmers, Ken Klippen. That keeps them from pecking each other as much and from pecking at their own feces.","Iowa’s move to protect conventional egg producers was supported by the industry — Klippen said farmers in other states may consider pushing similar legislation. But the bill was narrowed considerably after grocers expressed concern, and lawmakers eventually limited the restrictions to grocers that serve the more than 60,000 WIC participants.","“We want the market to dictate and the consumers’ choice to dictate what you put on the shelf,” said Michelle Hurd, president of the Iowa Grocery Industry Association. “We were concerned it sets a precedent for industry to use the law to force stores to carry their type of product.”","Consumers, however, can present a conundrum.","Cage-free-egg laws appear to be popular with consumers — at least the ones who voted for them. Ballot measures were approved by wide margins in California, with 64 percent of the vote, and in Massachusetts, with 78 percent. This happened despite consumers in both states overwhelmingly buying conventional eggs.","“I call it a vote by paradox,” said Jayson Lusk, an agricultural economist at Purdue University in Indiana who has studied the effects of the California law.","“These cage-free eggs were available in the grocery store, and, at the time, less than 10 percent of market share was cage-free. Why people banned something they were routinely buying in a grocery store, I don’t know,” he said. “It does act something like an unfunded mandate. We have asked farmers to provide something that we as consumers have not funded by buying that product.”","Only California’s law has been fully phased in — the laws typically give farmers a few years to convert from cages — so the impacts of its law have been the most widely studied.","Lusk estimated that the number of eggs produced in the state since the law was enacted was a third lower than it otherwise would have been. In response, stores in the state initially imported more eggs from other states. Shortly after the new law took effect, the price of eggs increased by more than a third, though by fall 2016, Lusk estimated that prices were 9 percent higher than they would have been without the law.","But some economists doubt the egg industry can produce enough cage-free eggs to meet future demand spurred by state mandates and retailer pledges. To do so, three-quarters of the nation’s 320 million birds would have to go cage-free.","At the same time, some egg producers have paused plans to expand cage-free production because their products weren’t being grabbed off store shelves.","Happier Hens, Harder-Working Farmers","Cage-free eggs aren’t just more expensive because farmers must convert their facilities. They require more work from farmers too.","When Bowden in Maine went cage-free, he went from a flock of more than 33,000 hens down to 3,000. But he had to increase his employees from five to eight just to help with the extra work taking care of the chickens.","“The majority of them like the nest box ’cause it’s darker and more private,” Bowden said. “They get in and like setting on their eggs. But some like making nests on the floor and others don’t give a damn and just lay eggs wherever they may be — on the window sill, all kinds of places like that.”","So now they have to collect eggs thrice a day instead of just once, and the shells get dirtier, so it takes more work to clean them.","Bowden didn’t go cage-free for the chickens’ sake. The family farm was cage-free and even sometimes had chickens in the pasture before they bought cages in 1969. When those were at the end of their useful life and Bowden was ready to slow operations down a bit, he converted the old barns by adding nest boxes he built himself.","But he does think his chickens are happier.","“It’s pretty hard to gauge,” he said. “We can’t really get them to vote.” But they are certainly making use of the space. They can move around, spread their wings — they have “free choice,” he said. And egg production per hen, which farmers say is perhaps the best indicator of chicken satisfaction, is the same.","Despite being happy with the switch, Bowden doesn’t think cage-free should be mandatory.","“I think it should be an issue of the person votes when they buy the eggs,” he said. “Does he want to pay $5 a dozen for eggs or $2 a dozen? Poor people can’t afford to buy eggs if they’re all cage-free.”","That’s what legislators in Iowa argued too.","“It’s not just about farmers versus animal rights,” said Iowa state Rep.

A year ago, she was reportedly the reason Pentagon chief Jim Mattis threatened to resign after she repeatedly blocked his choices for top Defense Department positions in her Office of Presidential Personnel role.","One Republican adviser close to the White House, who spoke on condition of anonymity, called Bolton’s move a “shot across the bow” directed at Mattis and a clear statement of his new authority within the Trump White House.","Mattis could not be reached for comment. Neither the Department of Defense nor the White House responded to HuffPost queries on the matter.","Former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, former national security adviser H.R. McMaster and Mattis had become known as the “Axis of Adults” ― a trio of top aides whose calmer temperaments would mitigate Trump’s most impulsive and potentially dangerous foreign policy instincts.","Trump loyalists, though, saw all three not as calming influences but as obstructionists blocking the president’s efforts to replace a “globalist” foreign policy with an “America first” one that favors withdrawing from existing military and trade alliances.","In the past two months, Trump has fired both Tillerson and McMaster ― Tillerson via a morning tweet that appointed his successor.","Opponents of the traditional foreign policy establishment see Bolton’s rise as diminishing Mattis’ influence, possibly even leading to his departure, the Republican adviser said.","Mattis’ disagreements with Ricardel last year were a relatively open secret. After Trump won the presidency in November 2016, Ricardel was named to Trump’s transition team charged with finding and screening thousands of names for high-level political appointments in the executive agencies.","She had previously served in the Republican administrations of Ronald Reagan and George W.

Ricardel, in turn, worked with other White House officials to block Mattis’ choice for that job as well as a number of others because they had not been considered loyal to Trump prior to his election.","At one point, the situation became so bad that Mattis reportedly gave the White House an ultimatum: Either Ricardel had to leave or he would.","Eventually, Ricardel received a high-level position at the Department of Commerce, where she remained until Bolton named her to her new position in a Friday evening news release.","“I look forward to her joining our team and working together to ensure President Trump’s foreign policy agenda is executed,” Bolton wrote.","Bolton did not respond to a HuffPost request for comment, and Ricardel could not be reached."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ade3ff01800002800e883a5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Matt Smith Speaks Out About 'The Crown' Pay Gap","authors":"Alanna Vagianos","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/matt-smith-the-crown-pay-gap_us_5ade3102e4b0df502a4e8894","short_description":"\"We need to strive to make this a better and more even playing field for everyone involved.\"","date":"2018-04-23"},"articleContent":["Actor Matt Smith said “we all should be paid equally and fairly” when asked over the weekend about Claire Foy, his co-star on “The Crown,” being paid less than him.","“Going forward, I think we should all bear in mind, and we need to strive to make this a better and more even playing field for everyone involved,” he said Sunday at the Tribeca Film Festival, according to Vanity Fair. “But not just in our industry ― in all industries.”","Producers of the Netflix series admitted more than a month ago that Foy, who plays Queen Elizabeth II in the show, was paid less than Smith, who plays her on-screen husband, Prince Phillip.

Rand Paul (R-Ky.) announced Monday that he would support Mike Pompeo to be secretary of state, a change in position that allowed the CIA chief to be recommended favorably out of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee after all.","Paul, a libertarian-leaning critic of U.S. military intervention abroad, has spoken out against Pompeo for weeks, citing concerns with his support for the Iraq War. Last month, in a news conference announcing his position, Paul said he was “perplexed” by Pompeo’s nomination and even called him “the wrong fit for America.”","“It goes against most of the things President Trump campaigned on, that the unintended consequences of regime change in Iraq led to instability in the Middle East,” Paul said then.","But on Monday, shortly before the committee was expected to vote, Paul tweeted that he’d received assurances from President Donald Trump that Pompeo agrees with him that “Iraq was a mistake, that regime change has destabilized the region, and that we must end our involvement with Afghanistan.”","Explaining his changed position in remarks before the committee, Paul said Pompeo had sufficiently “incorporated” the idea that the Iraq War was a mistake into his worldview. But the senator added that he wished the CIA director would say so publicly.","“Time will tell if those assurances are true or not,” Paul said before the vote on Monday, “but I do take him at his word.”","Paul also pointed to recent talks he’s had with Trump about surveillance policy as another factor in his decision to support Pompeo’s appointment.","“I’ve been very concerned that the FBI’s allowed to look at Americans’ information without a warrant,” Paul said Tuesday during an appearance on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.”","“I’ve had some discussions with [Trump] over whether or not we could actually have an executive order from the president that simply says from now on we’re going to obey the Fourth Amendment and that FBI agents will have to get a warrant to look at these foreign surveillance databases,” he continued. “That’s a big step forward for me, too.”","During a White House event Monday with French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump thanked Paul for coming around to his nominee. Trump said the senator “never let us down” and called him “a good man.”","In a tweet earlier Monday when Pompeo’s prospects didn’t look as good, Trump had blasted Democrats for being “obstructionists.”","Pompeo, a former Republican congressman from Kansas, is well-known for his militaristic foreign policy stances. He has pushed for regime change in Iran and openly mused about the U.S. overthrowing North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, whom he recently met during a secret trip. He also supported ending the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran, the U.S. and five other countries. But he reversed or walked back many of those positions during his confirmation hearing earlier this month.","Democrats, meanwhile, grilled Pompeo about his ties to an anti-Muslim conspiracy theorist during his confirmation hearing and questioned him about his past homophobic remarks. Pompeo said he would treat “every individual, regardless of their sexual orientation,” with respect despite his personal belief that same-sex couples should not have the right to marry.","Although 15 members of the Democratic caucus voted to confirm Pompeo to run the CIA last year, many of those same senators have opposed his nomination to be secretary of state this year, expressing concern that he is ill-suited to be the nation’s top diplomat.","Earlier Monday, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) joined Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.), another vulnerable Democrat up for re-election this year, in announcing his support for Pompeo, whom Manchin praised for his “exemplary career in public service.”","This story has been updated with Sen.

Combined, the two groups include more than 100 million adults, the pollsters note.","The top reasons unregistered voters gave for not voting were that they doubted their vote would make a difference (15 percent), they were uninterested (12 percent) or they were too busy (8 percent).","Among registered voters who were unlikely to cast a ballot, reasons they cited most were that they weren’t familiar with the candidates (11 percent), they doubted their votes would make a difference (9 percent) and their participation would depend on the candidates involved (9 percent).","Of course, people are notoriously bad at predicting their own voting behavior, especially this far out from Election Day. As a particularly striking case in point, 13 percent “who began the survey declaring they would not vote changed their minds during the course of the questioning,” according to the pollsters.","But their responses suggest a deep and possibly growing mistrust of American politics as a whole. About two-thirds of the unregistered and unlikely voters agreed with the statement that “I don’t pay much attention to politics because it is so corrupt,” up from 54 percent who said the same in 2012. More than 60 percent in the recent poll agreed that they tuned out because politics is “a bunch of empty promises.”","“I don’t trust them any more as far as the promises that are made, because the follow-through is very minimal and because Congress doesn’t act,” 68-year-old Belinda Santana told USA Today. “Throughout the years you’re being told your vote counts — no it doesn’t.”","A 55 percent majority of the nonvoters and unlikely voters polled said they viewed President Donald Trump unfavorably, similar to the share of likely voters who said they disliked the president in another recent Suffolk poll. A third said they backed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election, while 28 percent supported Trump and 6 percent chose another candidate. About 30 percent said they didn’t vote.","Voter turnout regularly drops in midterm elections. As previous polling has shown, nonvoters and those who skipped the 2014 midterms were less politically engaged than consistent voters, less convinced that voting was integral to being a good citizen and less likely to believe their individual vote could make a difference.","Democrats’ midterm prospects this year hinge at least partly on boosting turnout among a younger, more diverse segment of the public that leans toward the party but isn’t always as likely to cast ballots. Consistent voters tend to be older and more white than those who don’t regularly make it to the polls, but some early elections this cycle suggested a pattern of unusually high turnout among those without a history of regularly voting.","The Suffolk/USA Today survey polled 800 adults between April 2 and 18, using live interviewers to reach both landlines and cellphones."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ade386e1a00004900533dca.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Kid Golfer With One Arm Shows Off His Drive On 'Little Big Shots'","authors":"Ron Dicker","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tommy-morrissey-little-big-shots_us_5addd261e4b075b631e7fedf","short_description":"Tommy Morrissey adorably schools Steve Harvey.","date":"2018-04-23"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Andrew Cuomo Faces A Big Test On Climate Change.

Andrew Cuomo (D) is just starting to feel the heat.","On Friday, Cynthia Nixon, the activist and actor whose progressive primary challenge to Cuomo’s bid for a third term is garnering surging support, unveiled one of the most ambitious climate platforms in the nation, calling for 100 percent renewable energy, a ban on all new fossil fuel infrastructure and penalties for polluters.","And on Monday, 19 buses carrying more than 1,500 activists from across the state converged on the state capital to protest Cuomo’s failure to do more about climate change in his eight years in office, and make demands that looked identical to Nixon’s platform. It was the largest environmental protest against Cuomo since anti-fracking activists staged demonstrations in 2014.","The protest started in a historically black neighborhood on Albany’s Sheridan Avenue. The state plans to build a 16-megawatt gas-fired power station there in the same location where, until 1994, a trash incinerator plant had showered the neighborhood with soot. Nixon joined the activists shortly after noon, and though she didn’t formally address the crowd, she took photos with activists and spoke to reporters.","The neighborhood “has a really terrible racist history of environmental pollution,” Nixon said, and reiterated her call to move the state to 100 percent renewable energy. “Fracked gas is not a bridge to a cleaner energy economy.”","After a few speeches, the protesters marched about a mile under a blistering sun to the state capitol, chanting, “Heyo Cuomo, walk the talk, the power of the people cannot be stopped” to a tune similar to Queen’s “We Will Rock You.”","To some, Cuomo’s status as a climate pariah may be surprising. In 2014, he put a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, for natural gas in the state. In 2015, Al Gore joined the governor as he announced plans to cut the state’s greenhouse gases emissions 40 percent by 2030. Last June, Cuomo loudly rejected President Donald Trump’s move to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord, ramping up New York’s pledge to produce half its electricity from renewables by 2030 and forging a new alliance with the governors of Washington and California to stick to the goals agreed to by former President Barack Obama. “Climate change is a reality, and not to address it is gross negligence by government,” said Cuomo, according to a new page on the state website with the banner: “Environment Leadership.”","But Cuomo’s policies still fail to meet even the baseline targets scientists say are needed to make a difference on global warming. His reduction targets focus exclusively on power plants, ignoring the majority of the state’s emissions that come from buildings and vehicles. He has no plan to get the state to 100 percent renewable electricity, and has offered little to protect low-income communities and neighborhoods of color that suffer most from the impacts of climate change. The state’s pension funds remain invested in fossil fuels, and polluters face no penalties in the form of fines on climate-linked damage or taxes on emissions.","Cuomo’s press office did not respond to a request for comment.","As Nixon gains in the polls and lands magazine covers, Cuomo is scrambling to act on long-neglected progressive demands. Three weeks ago, over coffee and cookies at a Manhattan steakhouse, the governor made a deal to disband the Independent Democratic Conference, known as the IDC. The group of eight breakaway Democrats in the state Senate caucused with Republicans, guaranteeing a conservative majority in the chamber ― now only one holdout, Brooklyn Democrat Simcha Felder, has left Republicans with a flimsy one-vote majority.","Cuomo also signed an executive order last week restoring voting rights to felons on parole and voiced support for legalizing recreational marijuana, a policy Nixon made a platform issue in her campaign. On Friday, almost simultaneous to the release of Nixon’s climate platform, Cuomo denied a water quality permit to a new natural gas pipeline environmentalists have protested for months, and announced a new energy efficiency initiative that would account for one-third of the emissions cuts required to meet his 2030 target.","On Monday, Cuomo announced plans to introduce a state ban on plastic bags, despite signing a moratorium to block New York City from putting a 5-cent fee on plastic bags last year.","But Cuomo’s next big test on climate change is one he has already failed twice. For the third time in as many years, the state assembly is slated to vote this week on the latest version of the New York State Climate and Community Protection Act, known as the CCPA. The bill is widely considered the most ambitious and egalitarian climate legislation introduced anywhere in the nation. Heather McGhee, president of the left-leaning think tank Demos, and the economist Robert Reich called it “the most progressive climate-equity policy we’ve seen.”","The legislation, first introduced in 2016, calls for 100 percent renewable energy statewide by 2050 and orders state agencies to draft plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, buildings and vehicles. It requires 40 percent of state energy funding to go to the low-income neighborhoods and communities of color most vulnerable to sea level rise and extreme weather, and includes wage standards backed by labor unions for all state-funded green energy projects. If enacted, the bill’s proponents say it would create more than 100,000 jobs.","Cuomo has never come out in support of the CCPA. He refused for years to crack down on the IDC, which has until now blocked the bill from ever coming to a vote in the Senate.","“So far it’s been a failure of leadership,” said Dan Sherrell, campaign coordinator at the nonprofit New York Renews. “The governor has remained deafeningly silent on it.”","Sherrell said state legislators plan to introduce a bill to levy penalties on corporate polluters “before the end of the session,” but declined to comment on which lawmakers with whom New York Renews was in talks.","For Assemblyman Steve Englebright, the Long Island Democrat who first introduced the CCPA, the bill is 20 years overdue. The 71-year-old lawmaker from Setauket, a coastal hamlet on Long Island Sound, started warning about the threat of runaway global warming two decades ago. He has since sponsored several bills to support solar and wind production, at least three of which became laws. In 2016, he became chairman of the Assembly Committee on Environmental Conservation and moved swiftly to draft and introduce the CCPA.","Now, on his third attempt, he has more than two dozen co-sponsors and support from Nixon, who pledged in her platform to fight to pass the bill.","“There needs to be some adjustments made in the perception of how important this bill is to bring it into the executive chamber, ready for the governor’s signature,” Englebright said Friday. “If we can get it onto his desk, he’ll have no choice but to sign it.”","Enacting legislation like the CCPA should prove popular. New York is among the most progressive states in the country on climate change according to polling data.","Seventy-seven percent of New Yorkers understand global warming is happening, according to 2016 survey data from Yale University’s Program on Climate Change Communication, putting the state second only to Hawaii. Eighty-six percent of New Yorkers backed funding research into renewable energy, 81 percent supported regulating carbon dioxide as a pollutant, and 79 percent called for strict emission limits on coal-fired power plants.","New Yorkers overwhelmingly support environmental regulations even at an economic cost. Seventy-one percent of New Yorkers support expanding renewable energy generation even if it raises electricity prices, compared to 61 percent nationwide, according to Cooperative Congressional Election Study’s 2016 survey results analyzed for HuffPost by Data for Progress, a left-leaning think tank. That support cuts across demographics, including 75 percent of people aged 18 to 29 and 67 percent of people 65 years and older; 73 percent of urban dwellers and 67 percent of rural New Yorkers; and 74 percent of black people and 69 percent of whites.","Sixty-seven percent of New Yorkers support strengthening enforcement of clean air and water regulations even if it costs U.S. jobs, compared to 58 percent nationwide. The support breaks down similarly across the state, with 73 percent of people aged 18 to 29 and 61 percent of people 65 and older; 71 percent of urbanites and 60 percent of rural people; and 75 percent of black people and 64 percent of whites.","“Cuomo is fundamentally a safe governor, and a safe governor should support this,” said Sean McElwee, the New York-based political analyst and co-founder Data for Progress. “He’s an anti-progressive, and he’s someone who reflexively despises and tries to undo any progressive policy.”","Cuomo has faced criticism over other environmental issues, notably his administration’s shortcomings in dealing with a toxic drinking water in two northern New York municipalities. In February, the City of Newburgh, an impoverished community of color in the Hudson Valley, announced plans to sue the governor to force the state to clean up the site where a cancer-causing chemical spilled into a stream feeding its aquifer.","The protest Monday put a spotlight on a bribery scandal that has dogged Cuomo for the past year. A former top aide stands accused of taking $287,000 in bribes from Competitive Power Ventures, a Maryland-based company bidding to build a natural gas plant in Orange County, in New York’s Hudson Valley. The firm made more than $94,000 in donations to Cuomo’s campaign, plus another $50,000 to the state Democratic Committee in 2013. Signs reading “Stop CPV” and “No Fracking Gas Power Plants!” bristled from the crowd as the protesters marched.","But Cuomo’s penchant for emissions-heavy travel may be the most damning indictment of his climate record. In 2011, Cuomo’s regular use of government aircraft to fly between Albany and his home in Westchester cost the state about $13,000 at a time when the governor was cutting the budget. He took an average of 10 flights per month in his first four and half years in office, and sent a State Police helicopter to bring actor Robert De Niro to a tourism promotion event in the Catskills, according to a Politico report published in 2016.","That could come back to haunt Cuomo a time when embattled Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt, considered the vanguard of Trump’s rollback of climate policies, is under fire for taking frequent flights and costly airfare."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ade2ad91a00002800533dbf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Michael Bloomberg Contributes $4.5 Million For Paris Climate Deal After Trump Bails","authors":"Nick Visser","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bloomberg-us-paris-climate-deal_us_5add798fe4b089e33c898983","short_description":"\"America made a commitment.\"","date":"2018-04-23"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson Welcomes Second Child With Girlfriend Lauren Hashian","authors":"Elyse Wanshel","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dwayne-the-rock-johnson-welcomes-second-child-with-girlfriend-lauren-hashian_us_5ade24e2e4b036e7aeb55e94","short_description":"“Blessed and proud to bring another strong girl into this world,” the actor wrote on Instagram.","date":"2018-04-23"},"articleContent":["Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson has a new baby girl named Tiana Gia Johnson.","The actor, 45, announced the birth of his second daughter with girlfriend Lauren Hashian in an adorable photo posted to Instagram on Monday.","“Skin to skin.

You get the scripts and they’re incredibly dense and layered. I find myself going backwards and forwards a few times just to let it all sink in. Then, you let it all slide and enjoy watching the series so there’s some level of surprise for me, as well. The hardest part is talking about where those timelines fit in to what episode, because that’s when it all gets a little bit blurry. There is stuff that maybe gets jumbled around too in the editing process, which makes it extra-especially hard to remember when is what.","It does seem Stubbs will have a bit more to do this season.","He does.

That unfolds and it’s something that has been unfolding for Series 1 and Series 2, that he’s just a guy who actually doesn’t like to see people suffer and he’s trying to figure out his place in the world and where he’s headed. Yeah, there’s a few things to tackle there.","Let’s talk about the brain capsules that seem to be residing in these hosts’ heads. What did you think about that reveal?","I can’t remember when it came up, but there was some discussion about what exactly their operating program was or how their inner systems function and what they look like. The fact that it was a pearl or some sort of spherical device which contained all their memory and coding and everything. But I remember being pretty grossed out by that scene. [Laughs]","Yeah, it was nasty.","It was really nasty. I think Fares had a pretty good time digging around in the brain and throwing pieces of goo and flinging it at everyone, so it was good. It’s interesting. I can’t remember where I read this, but this may be the way technology is heading, this kind of device.","Oh, lovely. Well, it appears Bernard may have damaged his brain when he shot himself last season. He’s losing it ― questioning the nature of his reality. Meanwhile, Dolores is very aware of her reality, and is on a killing spree. Were you surprised to see that switch in their characters?","I think the nature of progression is that we’re always learning and we should be questioning the nature of our reality. I don’t think any of the characters are ever satisfied with where they are ― they’re constantly trying to find a place where they fit and find the answers. When you get dropped a bombshell like Bernard did in terms of finding out you’re not human, what do you do? And I think that’s one of the show’s strong points is it asks the question, “Are you asking the right questions?” What questions do you ask? And where do you need to head? What do you need to accomplish to find those answers? We ask a lot more questions than we probably answer on this show, and the answers are probably a little darker than we’d really like.","Yes, it’s a show full of questions, and the one we are left with at the end of Episode 1 is huge. We see a sea of water that didn’t previously exist in the park, and in this water are many dead hosts. One of those hosts is Teddy. Then, Bernard says he killed them all. Whoa! What do you think happened?","[Laughs] What do I think happened … I don’t know. Maybe there’s a part of the park that’s like Noah’s Ark park, and the floodgates have been opened, and the hosts failed to get on two-by-two, you know? I don’t know. Again, what I think happened and what I know happened are [laughs] ... hard to convey.","You know the truth!","I know the truth, yeah.","Did the truth surprise you?","I don’t think there’s an episode that goes by that I’m not surprised and excited by. There’s so much depth. Once you start pulling back those layers of skin and bone and hair, so to speak, the rabbit hole is deep. I think in this season it gets deeper and deeper and deeper. I’m amazed.","I really am amazed at the direction the writers choose and the surprises. We’re constantly being surprised as actors as well, day in and day out. It’s hard to convey just how good of an experience that is, because it’s an experience like no other. We’re growing as actors and writers, all together. Each one of us informs the other. I know myself, I’m just trying to do my best in this amazing situation that I’m given. There are so many people behind the scenes who are putting far more hours in than we do, and they definitely make our job a lot easier. And I hope we sort of do the set decorators and the costume department and the rest of the crew a little bit of justice, and that their work is recognized as the brilliance that it is. I’m blown away by it.","There was a grueling six-month shoot for Season 2. But how does it feel to be on board a project that allows you to play a bit in terms of budget and scale?","I approach the work the same way. I try to go as deep as I can into what I need to do. The beauty is when you have all those sets that are real, in those incredible locations with real landscapes, 300 extras, a lot of your work is done for you. You can focus on the specifics and the moment and the beat, and block all of the other craziness that is happening in the world outside. From an actor’s point of view, it feels the same, the process is the same, it’s just a lot bigger. But I think it still has to be truthful, it has to be real. There has to be meaning to it. With the material as good as it is, then it’s a no-brainer.","Do you at least rub this in your brothers’ faces, that you’re on one of TV’s biggest shows? I mean, we now have “Thor” vs. “Hunger Games” vs. “Westworld.”","I don’t think any of us rub it in each other’s faces. We’re all very supportive, and I think that part of our lives is something we all share with great enthusiasm with each other. I think every other part of our lives we will be competitive, and I’ll rub it in their faces but, no, I think to rub this in their faces would be to cheapen it and cheapen their work. They’re both doing an incredible job and I’m very proud of them.","Wow, you’re such a sweet big brother. I was expecting you to dig in there, and that was really touching.","[Laughs]","So, you made it out of Westworld alive, so far. But did you and Matt Damon make it out of Asgard in “Thor: Ragnarok”?","[Laughs] Yeah! Of course we did. I think there’s room for an Actor Thor and an Actor Loki spinoff. That’s what I’m gunning for. I want to get on the phone with Kevin Feige and be like, “So, here’s my pitch: Actor Loki, Actor Thor save the planet. They don’t mean to, but you know. Maybe with a little bit of help from Thor and the others.” We need to weave these two legends into the story because they really are the every-men of Asgard.","Well Chris’ contract is up soon. He’ll be hanging up his Thor costume and moving on. Now’s your time to step in.","[Laughs] I think Actor Thor needs his own spinoff. I’d like to see him maybe head off in his own spaceship with a little merry band of Shakespearean travelers, putting on shows across the universe.","“Westworld” airs Sundays at 9 p.m. on HBO."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ada1c831e0000fb077b2151.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"SPORTS","headline":"McKayla Maroney Says She Told Olympic Coach Of Nassar Abuse In 2011","authors":"Alanna Vagianos","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mckayla-maroney-says-she-reported-nassar-abuse-to-olympic-coach-in-2011_us_5addcf40e4b089e33c8a4f62","short_description":"Maroney told \"Dateline\" she reported the abuse to John Geddert during the 2011 World Championships, but he did nothing.","date":"2018-04-23"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"White Americans Say The Starbucks Arrests Were An Isolated Incident.

A 40 percent plurality said Starbucks was doing about the right amount to respond to the controversy, with about a quarter saying it was doing too much, and 18 percent that it was doing too little. Responses were about evenly split on whether closing stores for anti-bias training would be effective or not.","Black and white Americans gave Starbucks nearly identical approval ratings for their overall handling of the incident.

A 69 percent majority of Hillary Clinton voters who’d heard about the Starbucks story said it represents a broader societal pattern, while just 9 percent of President Donald Trump’s supporters said the same. Slightly more than half of Trump voters, and just a tenth of Clinton voters, thought Starbucks was doing too much in response.

Hannity had said last week that he was not a client of Cohen’s but had sought his advice on real estate. Among the documents the FBI seized from Cohen were details on the real estate investments.","In his statement, Hannity said that he did not “individually select, control or know the details about” the real estate investments that he made but that they were going to communities that he said “badly need such investment.”","Properties linked to Hannity, which were disclosed by The Guardian, include more than 870 homes that were purchased in seven states over the last decade. Their value totals at least $90 million.","Hannity, whose salary from Fox News is estimated by Forbes to be $36 million annually, acknowledged in his statement that he received loans from HUD to invest in properties during President Barack Obama’s administration.","Those mortgage loans, which, according to the Guardian, were acquired through HUD’s National Housing Act, offered investors protection against loan defaults when purchasing rental properties. There were larger loan guarantees given to buyers who offered housing to low-income tenants. Two of the most expensive properties reportedly purchased by Hannity in Georgia used $17.9 million that he acquired through HUD’s program.","After Ben Carson took over as secretary of HUD under Trump, Hannity’s loan portfolio increased by $5 million, The Guardian reported.","Hannity argued that he never discussed his original loans obtained during Obama’s administration with anyone at HUD. But he also didn’t disclose them to his viewers, including while interviewing Carson on his program last year and praising Carson’s work. Hannity also did not disclose his connection to Cohen, despite defending him on his program.","Journalists, as part of a code of ethics, are expected to recuse themselves from reporting on a subject that involves a personal connection or, at the least, disclose those connections. Hannity has argued that he is not a journalist, despite the fact that he covers national news and interviews high-profile guests on “Hannity.” Last week he identified himself as “an opinion journalist or advocacy journalist” instead.","In a twist, while he was reportedly buying up discounted homes, Hannity criticized Obama and blamed him for Americans’ struggles to own their own homes amid the nation’s housing crisis. On his program in 2016, he said Obama has failed to turn talk into action when it came to helping “every American get ahead.”","“The rate of those who own a home has now dropped several percentage points.

And Bill” is HuffPost’s weekly recap where we look at the craziest thing you may have missed on “Westworld.” This week: Season 2, Episode 1, “Journey Into Night.”","When “Westworld” brought itself back online Sunday night, we immediately stopped and shouted, “Whoa, baby!”","Namely because of the title sequence for Season 2, which is reminiscent of Season 1′s layout with a few new additions ― including a baby.","To get the inside scoop, we talked to the creative director behind the titles, Patrick Clair. But first, let’s discuss a popular and relevant “Westworld” theory:","The next step in the hosts’ evolution is, well, robot babies.","A “Westworld” fan theory that’s been around since the first season supposes that androids could eventually make babies ― children we’ll affectionately refer to as robotots.","“Robot babies?!” was Luke Hemsworth’s reaction when we spoke to him about the opening credits this month. The actor, who plays security officer Ashley Stubbs on “Westworld,” said he saw the Season 2 premiere for the first time in Los Angeles on Monday and insisted he didn’t remember the “little robot babies.”\n\nWell, Stubbs, we’re here to fill you in.\n\nRobot reproduction makes a whole lot of sense, and it could be the next logical step in the androids’ quest to become the superior race. There was even speculation in Season 1 that procreation was the final step of the ever-confusing maze. After all, there’s a little dot under the figure in the maze drawing (conveniently located on a scalp below). Could it possibly represent new life?","The reproduction angle didn’t happen in Season 1, and the maze turned out to be about the robots finding true consciousness, but there are subtle hints that it’s still a lingering possibility.","For example, one of the Season 2 trailers used Nirvana’s “Heart-Shaped Box” as a backing track ― you know, the song from their album “In Utero.” If that doesn’t scream robotots, what does?","Furthermore: those title sequences we were talking about. In the latest season premiere, we get a glimpse of a mother and child in the opening credits. The vignette replaced Season 1′s scene of two robot lovers.\n\nThe sequence’s designer, Clair, didn’t outright confirm robotots are on the way, but he did say the titles might hint at what’s to come. While reflecting on the mother and child scene, Clair told us, “What really affected me most watching Season 1 was the bond between parent and child, and mother and baby, and I think led us to be like, what could we do that has the emotional resonance of the lovers but goes in a new direction of where the story has been, where the story is going?”\n\n“I think there will be some real rewards for people as the season plays out,” he added. “They’ll start to really be able to realize what that means and its place within the titles.”\n\nSo ... robotots confirmed?\n\nAt least Hemsworth is into the idea.","Though he missed the baby in the opening sequence, he told HuffPost, “Would I be surprised if something like that happens? It’s an interesting direction, for sure,” he laughed, continuing, “It’s very scary but I think it’s on par with the innovation of the show. Whether we see anything like that anytime soon, I don’t know. Once robots can have babies, I think the outlook for the human race is probably pretty bleak.”","All we’re saying is: why not? There are so many advantages. You can put your baby in sleep mode whenever you want, and they probably have a Wifi connection. Who wouldn’t want a hot spot in their robotot?","While we’re waiting for more on that possible reveal, Clair was also kind enough to walk us through the other additions to the updated opening credits.","The buffalo hints at the theme.","On the falling buffalo, Clair said, “This was how buffalo or bison could be hunted back in time where they could kind of be cajoled into diving off cliffs, and you have this tragic moment of them falling to their deaths. [It’s] tragic for the beast, but obviously they’re generating food and feeding the circle of life, and I think for us, that became an interesting theme because so much of the ‘Westworld’ titles are about the circle of life.”","The brains are like a visual search engine.","″[In the first season], we use the iris of the hosts ... to reflect the landscapes, so when we were looking for something that could do the same thing as the iris you kind of realize there’s this quite beautiful object ― we call it the pearl. It’s the brain of the host, so we sort of went about imagining how that could look in extreme close up.”","He told us the idea was “visualizing neural networks like the ones search engines use, like the ones that image recognition uses, and then imagine how that could work in a more complicated three-dimensional space.”","The hat is sinking. The hosts are rising.","Season 1 titles end with a host sinking back into liquid. Clair wanted to insinuate a sense of progression in Season 2′s opening, so he based the image of the host on photographs looking up from water into the sky.","“We got this imagery of this mysterious black hat drifting into the abyss while the host is actually emerging from this dark liquid. Having that host be a female host ... there are so many empowered characters from Season 1. [There] are amazing badass female robots, so this felt like a slightly more empowered way to kick off the episodes of Season 2.”","The mother and child are the perfect setup.","The image of the baby was a personal experience for Clair, who has a 5-year-old son of his own.","“Realizing that you’re bringing this very sacred thing into the world, bringing a mind into the world, that’s everything that ‘Westworld’ is about. It’s about the sacred mysterious responsibilities of giving rise to conscious minds. It’s something that all of us have experience of from a child’s perspective, and so many of us have experience from a parent’s perspective, and I think any imagery there can kind of evoke that from the start of this story is a good kind of setup for where it’s gonna go.”","If you find yourself unsettled by the figures, that’s on purpose.","“I think if you saw the lovers or the mother and child in full light, you would be horrified. It would give you nightmares. Those beings, the way we designed them, is based on where the light falls on them. Where the light falls on them, they’re fairly complete.”","To create the figures of the lovers and the mother and child, the design team started with anatomical models and then peeled back layers until they are “deeply grotesque.” Those parts of the characters remain in the shadows.","“Being very careful with the light, hopefully, you don’t see that, but you get a sense of that there. Maybe one day we’ll show everyone what it looks like if you actually turn the lights on in that room.”\n\nTo read more of HuffPost’s “Westworld” coverage, head here."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5add31021a00002800533c63.png?cache=AaothMhuka&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"SCIENCE","headline":"NASA Aircraft Spots Mysterious Circles In Remote Arctic Sea Ice","authors":"Ed Mazza","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sea-ice-mystery-circles_us_5add84b5e4b075b631e73c9e","short_description":"Scientists say they haven't seen these features before.","date":"2018-04-23"},"articleContent":["NASA scientists are working to solve a mystery in the Arctic ice.","Operation IceBridge is a project that sends flights over both polar regions to photograph and map land and sea ice.

Some people think all the dead characters are coming back, while others speculate that all the past villains could make an appearance.","But in the lead-up to the new movie, one theory has risen above the rest: The name of the main villain, Thanos, has been secretly revealing the locations of the infinity stones.","There are six infinity stones. There are six letters in Thanos’ name. Thanos is after the infinity stones. It just makes sense.","It even seems to line up, as Nerdist laid out:","T is for Tesseract, the Space Stone\nA is for Aether, the Reality Stone\nN is for Necklace, the Time Stone\nO is for Orb, the Power Stone\nS is for Loki’s Scepter, the Mind Stone","Fans have been using this theory to try to figure out the location of the final missing infinity stone, the soul stone. The popular guesses are that the H may stand for Idris Elba’s character, Heimdall, or that N stands for Nebula rather than Necklace. Nebula is one of Thanos’ daughters, a character who plays a big role in the “Infinity Gauntlet” comic that served as an inspiration for the movie.","HuffPost’s Leigh Blickley asked Karen Gillan, who plays Nebula, for her thoughts over the weekend, and she was intriguingly vague.","“I can’t say whether that’s going to happen,” Gillan said of the theory. “Nebula has a significant role and has a lot of stuff to do because her father is Thanos, who is the villain of the movies. She has some serious daddy issues with him, so she has a lot to confront.”","That made it sound to us like the theory might be right. But then I talked to “Avengers: Infinity War” writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely on Sunday.","While reflecting on the wildest theories he has heard, McFeely settled on one that was “obviously crazy.” You guessed it: spelling out T-H-A-N-O-S to reveal the locations of the stones.","And just like that, the theory was O-V-E-R.","“That seems fairly random,” McFeely said.","“I don’t think that’s how you go about writing a good script,” Markus added.","“It really isn’t,” McFeely agreed, laughing and imagining what that writing process would look like. ”‘You know, it’d be great to put the soul stone here but it’s not an O,’ or whatever the hell it is.”","“We need an O planet,” Markus joked.","Look, Nebula could still have something to do with the soul stone. After all, Gillan confirmed she has a “significant” role. But it won’t have anything to do with spelling out her dad’s name.","The writers also set us straight on some other rumors and theories.","There won’t be a Sherlock Holmes joke.","It doesn’t take a detective to figure out there was the opportunity for a great Sherlock Holmes joke in “Infinity War”: Robert Downey Jr. and Benedict Cumberbatch appear together in scenes, and both actors have played popular versions of the character in recent years.","Unfortunately, we’re not going to see that in “Infinity War.”","“I don’t want to ruin people’s fun, but the idea is that that’s a meta joke, right?” McFeely said. “That’s a joke that those two guys are actors and have careers outside of these movies. For our purposes, they’re not actors, and they don’t have careers outside of these movies.”","“Now both Watsons [Martin Freeman and Jude Law] are in the MCU too, so it’s still some sort of situation,” Markus added, referring to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.","Could Ant-Man secretly be in other Marvel movies? Maybe.","Another theory that’s been floating around is that Ant-Man has possibly secretly been in all the Marvel movies from the start, just miniaturized.","“Even if I could confirm or deny it, how could I confirm or deny it?” McFeely joked.","Both Markus and McFeely speculated that even if Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) was originally out there as Ant-Man, he still isn’t old enough to be in “Captain America: The First Avenger.”","So it’s possible Ant-Man has made appearances, but maybe he hasn’t been in all the movies.","Loki probably didn’t intentionally lose in the first “Avengers.”","One theory says Loki (Tom Hiddleston) may have intentionally failed in his plan to take over Earth in the first “Avengers” movie.","The idea is that Loki always wanted to take over Asgard. Failing on Earth was his way to be taken back there by his brother. He eventually takes over at the end of “Thor: The Dark World.”","The writers were skeptical about that theory, too.","“It sounds like a long and inefficient plan,” Markus said. “He could’ve just gone to Asgard.”","Sure, maybe. But Loki is all about theatrics, and we wouldn’t have had scenes like this if he went straight to Asgard:","He may not get a crown, but Loki at least deserves an Oscar.","Leigh Blickley contributed reporting."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5addd67018000041003844f4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"WORLD NEWS","headline":"Suicide Bomber Kills Dozens Outside Voter Registration Center In Kabul","authors":"Qadir Sediqi and Sayed Hassib, Reuters","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/suicide-bomber-kills-dozens-outside-voter-registration-center-in-kabul_us_5adc75f6e4b009869bfa259a","short_description":"The blast came after repeated warnings that militants could try to disrupt the country's election process.","date":"2018-04-22"},"articleContent":["By Qadir Sediqi and Sayed Hassib","KABUL (Reuters) - A suicide bomber blew himself up outside a voter registration center in the Afghan capital Kabul on Sunday, killing at least 57 people and injuring more than 100, in the most serious attack yet on preparations for elections scheduled for October.","Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack on a project of key importance to the credibility of President Ashraf Ghani’s government, which has been under international pressure to ensure long-delayed parliamentary polls take place this year.","Interior Ministry spokesman Najib Danesh said a bomber on foot approached the center where officials were issuing identity cards as part of the registration process for around 10 million voters across Afghanistan. Registration began this month.","President Ghani issued a statement condemning the attack and said it “cannot divert us from our aims or weaken this national democratic process”.","A spokesman for the ministry of public health said at least 57 people, including eight children, were confirmed dead and 119 wounded, but the total could still rise.","The explosion destroyed cars and shattered windows in nearby buildings, leaving rubble strewn across the blood-stained street.","It was the deadliest blast in Kabul since about 100 people were killed in January by a bomb concealed in an ambulance and it came after repeated warnings that militants could try to disrupt the election process.","Tadamichi Yamamoto, the senior United Nations official in Afghanistan, issued a statement condemning the attack.","“Compounding the callous disregard for the lives of civilians, the killing appears to be part of a wholly unacceptable effort by extremists to deter Afghan citizens from carrying out their constitutional right to take part in elections,” he said.","After weeks of relative calm, the blast took place in Dasht-e Barchi, an area of western Kabul inhabited by many members of the mainly Shi’ite Hazara minority, which has been repeatedly hit by attacks claimed by Islamic State.","“There were women, children.

At the same time, the app’s developers hope it will fill a long-existing void as a legitimate dating app focused exclusively on transgender users and trans-attracted people.","The app, which launched last month and is currently available for free, operates in a similar fashion to predecessors Tinder and Grindr. Users can swipe right or left on a profile depending on their level of interest, and if both users swipe right— indicating mutual interest — they can communicate with each other. There’s also a search feature that allows users to narrow their preferences.","Transdr’s co-founder Sean Kennedy described the app as “a new place for trans people who are looking for serious relationships.”","As noble as Transdr’s aims may be, however, some of the app’s marketing relies on language many interpret as transphobic. After this story was first published, HuffPost readers flagged that the app included several derogatory terms such as “tranny” and “shemale” on its Apple Store landing page and its website.","A representative for Transdr told HuffPost in an email that such words were used “to improve the search ranking.”","“Those terms … were used for SEO purposes because a lot of people search [for] them every day,” the representative said. “We didn’t mean to offend people who care about this.”","The company is looking at updating its Apple Store description to remove the offending terms, they added, but the process may take some time since Apple needs to approve any changes.","Interestingly, Transdr arrives at a time when previously existing apps have already expanded their services to include trans users.

It follows a gay character (played by Matthew Wilkas) who, on the surface, has it all: chiseled good looks, an active lifestyle and a lively social media presence.","Far from the gaze of Instagram, however, Wilkas’ character struggles to fill an emotional void. He finds a temporary escape from his depression through a night of drugs and casual sex with a stranger (adult film star Tegan Zayne). At the video’s conclusion, he locks eyes with Vogel in an empty Manhattan nightclub, and the two men share a moment of solidarity.","Released March 29, “Brown Rice” arrives at a prolific time for Vogel who, until now, had been known primarily on New York’s indie music circuit, with performances at the Brooklyn Museum and National Sawdust. The video is the third to be released from his six-track debut EP, “Serving Body,” and had racked up more than 40,000 views as of Sunday afternoon. (By comparison, the clip for the catchy second single, “I Don’t Want To Find The One,” had received just over 1,100.)","Much of the buzz on “Brown Rice” has focused on Wilkas’ presence. The actor, whose credits include 2012’s “Gayby” and HBO’s “Looking,” has become a media fixture in recent weeks due in part to his relationship with Olympic freeskier Gus Kenworthy. Footage of the two men sharing a kiss during the Winter Games made global headlines and received praise from LGBTQ rights advocates.","Though grateful that Wilkas’ rising star has boosted interest in “Brown Rice,” Vogel is hopeful that discerning viewers will see the video as an “unfiltered and uncompressed” portrait of the queer “emotional experience” rather than simply a serving of beefcake.","“I want the general audience to feel the desperation of needing to be approved of and to question the lengths they are willing to go to gain that approval at the expense of whatever it is that might make them amazing to begin with,” the singer told HuffPost. He added that he wrote the song about “a super-athletic, super-arrogant ex I never felt good enough for.”","“I want audiences to actively yearn for whatever parts of themselves that they’ve been suppressing,” he said.","To help execute his vision, Vogel tapped director Eamon Foley, a veteran Broadway performer and choreographer who recently co-founded a production company called Grind Arts.","Calling Vogel’s song “haunting and gorgeous,” Foley aimed to paint a picture of “a man chasing a thrill or some sort of climax, but falling short of satisfaction.” Still, he stressed that “Brown Rice” isn’t meant to “judge a certain subset of gay men or cast a shameful light on certain actions.”","“I wanted everyone to be able to find themselves in this character, and question if what consumes them is leading them towards happiness,” he said. “Even the man who looks like he has it all with his 100K followers and free underwear feels inadequate ... [Many] gay men are organizing their lives around an unachievable ideal that won’t take care of them in their old age.”","Ultimately, Vogel said he hopes to portray other aspects of queer life in his work, noting, “It’s important that we not tone our truth down for anyone.”","“I felt the story for years emotionally, as I think most of us gay men have, and we just had to express it artistically,” he said. “We’ve been pressured, threatened, forced, advised to do that our whole lives and it hasn’t worked ― it’s left us with a ton of anxiety and loneliness.”","Listen to “Serving Body” below."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5add019f180000270038442c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Mitt Romney Fails To Secure Utah Senate GOP Nomination, Will Face Primary","authors":"Igor Bobic","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mitt-romney-primary_us_5adc8cabe4b089e33c88e78e","short_description":"Romney fell short of getting the nod at the state's Republican Convention.","date":"2018-04-22"},"articleContent":["Mitt Romney failed to secure the Utah Senate Republican nomination outright at a party gathering over the weekend and must run in a June 26 primary.","The 2012 GOP presidential nominee, who has been endorsed by President Donald Trump to replace retiring Republican Sen.

The Republican Party’s brightest idea for how to fix it? Make health insurance worse.","Here’s what the GOP has in mind: Weakened protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Skimpier benefits that leave out coverage for important medical needs. Less protection from financial harm due to illness. And a number of actions designed to make the Affordable Care Act’s exchanges less stable for the millions of Americans who use them.","GOP officials at the federal and state levels have proposed and undertaken a variety of new policies they say will make health insurance more affordable. During the seven-plus years between President Barack Obama’s signing of the health care reform law in 2010 and the collapse of the repeal attempt last year, President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans also promised over and over that they would repeal and replace the federal law with something better.","They didn’t. It turns out that’s not because they didn’t have any ideas. It’s because their best idea is … crappier health insurance.","If the only goal is to reduce monthly premiums, the GOP measures might sort of work for some people. Selling insurance products that are cheaper because they exclude the sick and leave policyholders with huge coverage gaps isn’t a very impressive trick. It’s kind of like promising to make cars cheaper by selling them without transmissions and then declaring you’ve solved the problem of auto affordability.","It’s true that some people could potentially access less-expensive insurance under the Trump administration’s deregulatory agenda. But those gains come with risks for the consumers. If you qualify for a health plan that screens based on pre-existing conditions or buy a policy with huge gaps in coverage, you might be left in the lurch when you really need care.","The risks are even greater for those who won’t have access to less-regulated insurance policies. People with illnesses or pre-existing conditions will face higher costs because they’ll be shut out of the cheaper options.","Moreover, segmenting the health insurance market between the healthy and the sick undermines the entire notion of insurance. Changing the rules to let insurers sell one set of policies to healthy people and another to those with pre-existing conditions and ongoing health care needs inevitably leads to the latter policies becoming costlier. And that’s not just a problem for those who are currently sick because everyone gets sick eventually, be it today or decades from now.","Here are nine ways Republicans in Washington and across the country are working together to make health insurance even worse.","1. Inaugural Executive Order","On his first day in office, Trump issued an executive order instructing the federal agencies responsible for the Affordable Care Act to find ways around it. This didn’t have much impact in and of itself, but it set the stage for much of what’s come after.","2. Inessential Health Benefits","The Affordable Care Act requires health insurance plans to include 10 categories of benefits, including hospitalization, prescription drugs, maternity care and emergency-room services. Each state chooses an existing policy in its market as a “benchmark” for these benefits.","This month, the Trump administration proposed a regulation that would let states select plans from other states as benchmarks or pick and choose elements of plans in another state ― say, prescription coverage ― and make those part of their own benchmark.","This is wonky stuff, but the notion behind it is to let states with a deregulatory bent allow the sale of plans with skimpier benefits and less financial protection than what’s on their local market now.","3. Not-So-Short Short-Term Plans","Health insurance plans intended to cover gaps in coverage ― for example, when you start a new job but your health benefits don’t kick in right away ― have been around for a long time. Most of the Affordable Care Act’s rules about benefits don’t apply to them, and they don’t have to cover pre-existing conditions. Typically, these policies had to be short-term, lasting only a few months. So the Trump administration came up with an idea: Let the bare-bones plans cover 364 days, essentially making them an alternative to yearlong policies.","The result will be a parallel insurance market for healthy people to buy bad coverage. And, again, the more healthy people not using the insurance exchanges, the worse it will be for everyone who still must, for they will see their premiums rise.","4. Associate Decree","Association health plans allow employers in the same field to band together to get a better deal on benefits for their workers. Think small companies that belong to the same trade group. That’s all pretty reasonable, and this type of plan has existed for a while.","After the Affordable Care Act became law, the Obama administration determined that association health plans had to follow the same rules on benefits and pre-existing conditions as other types of insurance. Trump proposed a regulation this year to reverse that and let these plans ignore some of the law’s consumer protection standards.","Under Trump’s proposal, these plans could leave out a lot of key benefits, making their premiums lower. That’s appealing to those who need coverage the least and unappealing to people who have to have medical care.","Still, cheaper insurance gets a lot more expensive if you try to use it and find out it doesn’t cover what you need. Oh, and there’s a long track record of association health plans not paying claims and even defrauding their customers.","5. Idah-Oh-No","In January, Idaho Gov. C.L. “Butch” Otter (R) devised an interesting approach to the Affordable Care Act: Pretend it doesn’t exist.","Otter issued an executive order inviting insurance companies to design health plans that, among other things, could charge people different rates based on their medical histories. This was so obviously a violation of the Affordable Care Act that even the Trump administration had to tell Idaho they couldn’t do it. But in its rejection, the administration reminded state officials that its own efforts to undermine Obamacare made the Idaho plan redundant.","6. Iowanna Follow The Affordable Care Act","Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds (R) signed a law this month allowing insurance companies to sell policies through the Iowa Farm Bureau that also totally disregard the Affordable Care Act. How is Iowa ignoring the federal statute? It simply declared that this insurance is not insurance. No, really.","These farm bureau policies will be permitted to reject people with pre-existing conditions or at least charge them higher premiums. They won’t have to follow federal law governing what benefits must be covered. And insurers will once again be allowed to set hard-dollar limits on how much they’ll cover in a year or over a patient’s lifetime. All of that is illegal under the Affordable Care Act.","7. Extra #Liberty","Congress passed a huge tax bill last year that, among other things, repealed the individual mandate, a central component of the Affordable Care Act that required most U.S. residents to obtain health coverage or face tax penalties. Starting in 2019, those penalties won’t exist anymore.","The mandate has always been unpopular ― even 2008 presidential candidate Obama opposed it before taking office and changing his position ― and it won’t be mourned by anyone but health insurance companies and some health care policy nerds.","But even though the mandate didn’t work as well as the law’s authors expected, it served a purpose by nudging healthier people into buying insurance. That meant more money coming into the system to cover the costs of the less healthy. There’s now one less reason for people to get covered. Combine that with the availability of those other types of plans that cater to the healthy, and it spells a sicker, more expensive mix of people on the exchanges. That will lead to higher costs for them.","8. The Check Isn’t In The Mail","Trump threatened for months last year to cut off payments that the federal government owed insurance companies serving low-income Obamacare customers and, in October, he finally did it.","The Affordable Care Act requires insurers to provide discounts on out-of-pocket costs, like deductibles and copayments, to exchange customers with incomes below 250 percent of the federal poverty level, which amounts to about $30,000 for a single person. The government is supposed to pay the insurers back. Trump won’t.","This looked like it would throw the exchange markets into turmoil as insurers worried about financial losses would look to recoup them through enormous premium increases or even stop selling this kind of insurance at all.","Fortunately, that didn’t happen because insurance companies and state regulators figured out a clever way to increase premiums only on subsidized products in most states. Because the value of the government subsidies rises with the price of the insurance, those consumers were mostly shielded from the higher premiums. But people who didn’t qualify for financial assistance had to bear the full brunt. Plus, those higher subsidies cost the federal government a lot of money.","Still, it worked out better than many expected. So naturally, the administration is considering a ban on the solution that insurers and states came up with to protect subsidized consumers.","9. Listen All Y’all, It’s A Sabotage","The open enrollment period for exchange customers last November and December was the first over which the Trump team had total control. They took advantage.","They cut the sign-up period in half. They cut the budget for enrollment assistance by 40 percent. They cut the advertising and outreach budget by 90 percent. They forbade federal employees from participating in local enrollment efforts. The Department of Health and Human Services even used money intended to promote enrollment on a public relations campaign advocating Affordable Care Act repeal.","It’s remarkable that this mix of less effort and higher costs didn’t cause enrollment to plummet. Sign-ups did fall this year to 11.8 million, about 400,000 less than for 2017. But it’s telling that the decline occurred almost entirely in the 39 states where the federal government runs the exchanges. Enrollment was flat in state-run exchanges in 11 states and the District of Columbia because they weren’t affected by Trump’s budget cuts and because most held longer enrollment periods."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ada304318000042003842b1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"SCIENCE","headline":"NASA Releases Astounding Video Of The Lagoon Nebula To Celebrate Hubble's Birthday","authors":"Mary Papenfuss","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nasa-lagoon-nebula-hubble-video_us_5adbcceae4b075b631e65bce","short_description":"The nebula is a \"raucous star nursery full of birth and destruction,\" NASA says.","date":"2018-04-22"},"articleContent":["Ever wanted to zoom near that central bulge in the Milky Way in the Sagittarius constellation where stars are born? NASA has almost made it possible thanks to the Earth-orbiting Hubble Space Telescope. As a kind of a 28th Hubble birthday gift for all of us, the space agency has posted astounding videos and photos of what’s known as the Lagoon Nebula.","The main video takes viewers from far away into the very heart of the massive, colorful nebula, what NASA calls a “raucous star nursery full of birth and destruction,” 4,000 light-years away from Earth.","At the Lagoon Nebula’s heart is a massive “young” star (the million-year-old Hershel 36), 200,000 times brighter and eight times hotter than Earth’s sun. It roils the region with ultraviolet radiation and winds carving out an exploding, undulating “fantasy landscape of ridges, cavities, and mountains of gas and dust,” gushes NASA.","The space agency has also released a video that dissolves to an infrared version that cuts through gas and dust to reveal a multitude of stars:","This is an imagined three-dimensional flight across the core of the Lagoon Nebula using images from Hubble:","Hubble was launched April 24, 1990, aboard the space shuttle Discovery and was a joint project of NASA and the European Space Agency. Once a year the telescope takes a break from its assigned observations to take a detailed image of a particular spot of the cosmos.","The Hubble “has offered a new view of the universe and has reached and surpassed all expectations for a remarkable 28 years,” said NASA and the ESA.

The rest of the time, it is a too-big-to-fail bank, and improperly relieving its customers of their automobiles is just one of a few “unfair acts and practices” to which it neither admitted nor denied when it agreed to settle a federal investigation on Friday.","But the bank will pay a very high price for these alleged misdeeds ― $1 billion, the highest the CFPB has ever imposed against a financial institution.","The CFPB’s description of Wells Fargo’s behavior is breathtaking. The company “forcibly placed duplicative or unnecessary insurance on hundreds of thousands” of vehicles owned by customers who had taken out a car loan with the bank. This not only resulted in a typical charge of “over $1,000” to which these customers had never agreed, but “for at least 27,000 customers,” the bureau wrote, “the additional costs of the Force-Placed Insurance could have contributed to a default that resulted in the repossession of their vehicle.”","In a better world, the Federal Reserve would prevent serial offender banks like Wells Fargo from existing, and the Department of Justice would prosecute mass car theft as a crime. But it is at least good that a federal regulator exists to levy fines against these outrages and give restitution to wronged families. The CFPB has only been around a few years, but prior to the Wells Fargo settlement, it had returned about $12 billion in ill-gotten gains to American consumers ― a figure that is considerably higher after its biggest-ever settlement.","The bureau is a creation of the Democratic Party, signed into law by President Barack Obama and designed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). Yet some congressional Democrats are joining Republicans supporting legislation that consumer advocates say would strip the CFPB of the power to bring cases like the one it just settled with Wells Fargo.","The bill, authored by one of the bureau’s most ferocious critics, Rep. Sean Duffy (R-Wis.), has the backing of self-styled progressives, such as Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Wis.) and Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), along with six more conservative House Democrats and Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.).","The legislation would deny the CFPB jurisdiction over companies that are subject to state insurance regulation that also engage in “offering or providing a consumer financial product or service.” For such firms, which include essentially every major bank, the bureau would lose its authority “to the extent such [company] is engaged in the business of insurance.” State insurance regulators, which have a much weaker record of consumer protection enforcement, would replace the CFPB.","In January, the progressive advocacy group Americans for Financial Reform sent a sharply worded letter to members of Congress warning that the bill ”strikes a major blow against CFPB regulatory authority over large financial services firms” that “would have called into question the CFPB’s ability to investigate and punish the Wells Fargo scheme to sell unnecessary insurance to its auto credit customers.”","A month earlier, 20 organizations, including the National Fair Housing Alliance, the National Consumer Law Center and the Consumer Federation of America, cited the Wells Fargo case as they brought their concerns to Duffy. Not only do state regulators have a weak record of enforcement, many states simply do not have effective consumer protection laws on the books.","“In the weeks before the disclosure that Wells Fargo had falsely placed 800,000 lender-placed auto policies, state insurance regulators ... [claimed] there were purportedly no problems in that market,” the groups wrote.","Manchin and Moore have a long history of supporting bank-friendly legislation at the expense of American families, and both declined to comment for this article. A Baldwin spokesperson insisted that the bill doesn’t actually do anything.","“This legislation does not strip or change the agency’s authority to enforce compliance when an insurer offers CFPB-covered products,” Baldwin’s staffer said. “The bill simply clarifies that the CFPB’s role is to enforce consumer protection laws and also reaffirms existing law on state-based regulation of insurance by State Insurance Offices and Commissioners. CFPB retains the oversight authority being used in its enforcement action against Wells Fargo, which Senator Baldwin has strongly supported.”","Robert Hunter, director of insurance at the Consumer Federation of America, doesn’t agree. He describes the language as “very expansive,” with the potential to undermine enforcement against a vast array of abuses perpetrated by financial conglomerates. Birnie Birnbaum, executive director of the Center for Economic Justice, called the bill “outrageous.”","”With the exception of a few states, the record of state regulators on this is terrible,” Birnbaum told HuffPost. “Wells Fargo force-placed some 800,000 policies erroneously. No insurance regulator caught that.”","The language of the bill is broad and vague, leaving a tremendous amount of activity susceptible to court challenge if the CFPB were to act against insurance providers. And it includes a provision stating that, when in doubt, “the enforcement of this title shall be broadly construed in favor of the authority of a state insurance regulator” over the CFPB.","The bill passed the House Financial Services Committee in January by a vote of 37 to 18, with seven Democrats voting in favor: David Scott (Ga.); Emanuel Cleaver (Mo.); Gwen Moore (Wis.); Ed Perlmutter (Colo.); Kyrsten Sinema (Ariz.); Joyce Beatty (Ohio); and Josh Gottheimer (N.J.). It has yet to receive a floor vote in either chamber.","Clarification: One reference in this story has been amended to accurately indicate the total number of Democrats who backed the bill in question."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ada5ec21800004800e880c4.jpeg?cache=MtP7OdtLwC&ops=crop_18_194_3276_1324%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Trump Celebrates Earth Day By Praising Rollback Of Environmental Protections","authors":"Hayley Miller","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-earth-day-2018_us_5adcac66e4b009869bfa472d","short_description":"The president's dubious logic on conservation is being called out on Twitter.","date":"2018-04-22"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Iran's Top Diplomat Says 'All Options Are On The Table' If U.S. Pulls Out Of Nuclear Deal","authors":"Amanda Terkel","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/iran-deal-trump-may-deadline_us_5adc9088e4b075b631e695a6","short_description":"President Donald Trump set a May 12 deadline to decide what to do on the nuclear agreement.","date":"2018-04-22"},"articleContent":["Iran’s top diplomat warned President Donald Trump to not pull out of the 2015 nuclear agreement, saying the United States would suffer extremely negative consequences if it did so.","“If the decision comes from President Trump to officially withdraw from the deal, then Iran will take decisions that have been provided for under the [agreement] ... as the United States has a habit of saying, ‘all options are on the table,’” The country’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said in an interviews on CBS’s “Face the Nation” Sunday.","The Iran nuclear deal was President Barack Obama’s signature foreign policy achievement and is therefore, not surprisingly, reviled by Trump. During the presidential campaign, he called it “the highest level of incompetence.”","Trump, so far, has not pulled out of the deal, but he has given himself a May 12 deadline to either waive sanctions against Iran, as outlined in the deal, or to leave it. Five other countries ― the U.K., Russia, France, China and Germany ― are also parties to the agreement.","Zarif said the United States would suffer a serious blow to its international standing if it doesn’t hold up its end of the bargain because it would show that the country can’t be trusted.","“It will lead to U.S. isolation in the international community,” Zarif said. “The reason that President Trump has not withdrawn from the deal over the past 15 months, in spite of the fact that he did not like the deal, has been the fact that everybody has advised the administration that this is not a bilateral agreement between Iran and the United States, and withdrawing from it would be seen by the international community as an indication that the United States is not a reliable partner.”","“It would not be pleasant for the United States ― the reaction of the international community, and as I said Iran has many options and those options are not pleasant,” he added.”","Providing relief for Iran from crippling economic sanctions is central to the deal. In return, Iran promised to halt its nuclear program. But Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said that even if Trump refuses to waive the sanctions for Iran next month, that somehow doesn’t necessarily mean the deal will collapse.","Another option, as Trump sees it, is to renegotiate the terms of the deal. The administration may try to get its European allies to at least commit to changing the deal over the time, in return for the United States sticking with it.","Britain, France and Germany are looking at imposing new European sanctions on Iran over its ballistic missiles program and its role in the Syrian conflict in an attempt to keep Trump from pulling out.","On Sunday, Zarif said that any such side agreement between the other nations would be unacceptable to Iran.","“What is important is for the Europeans to bring the United States into compliance because Iran has been in compliance with the deal,” he said. “It’s been the United States that has failed to comply ... President Trump has made it very clear that it is trying to dissuade our economic partners from engaging with Iran and that’s a clear violation of the deal.”","Trump recently nominated Mike Pompeo, who was serving as his CIA director, to be his new secretary of state. Pompeo is expected to be more in line with Trump on Iran than was his predecessor, Rex Tillerson. He recently said he wanted to “fix” the nuclear agreement.","International experts, as well as U.S. national security officials, have said Iran is complying with the deal ― even though it continues to pursue other policies that the U.S. administration believes pose a threat.","Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), chair of the Foreign Relations Committee, said he expects that Trump will pull out of the deal, unless something changes.","“I do think if nothing changes with the three European members we’re dealing with right now on a framework,” Corker said on ABC’s “This Week” Sunday, “I do think he will move away from the agreement on May 12.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5adc928e1800004700e881de.jpeg?cache=SuXYF4PowA&ops=crop_0_226_4675_2883%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"QUEER VOICES","headline":"Pennsylvania Lawmaker Slammed As 'Lying Homosexual' By Colleague","authors":"Curtis M.

A powerhouse in the ring, Johnson rose in fame and wealth throughout his career ― even at a time when vicious violence against African Americans was the norm.","The boxer’s image was controversially smeared when he was convicted of violating the Mann Act, which banned traveling with a woman across state lines for an “immoral purpose.” Johnson fled the country, continuing his boxing career overseas for years before he eventually surrendered to federal authorities and served time in prison.","In 1946, he died in a car crash.","Officials had initially refused to give Johnson a chance at the heavyweight title (African Americans were not allowed to participate at the time) until 1908, when Johnson faced off with champion Canadian Tommy Burns, according to “The Boxing Register: International Boxing Hall of Fame Official Record Book.”","Johnson won against Burns with a technical knockout in the 14th round, becoming the first black heavyweight champion. His fame, however, still didn’t earn him respect from his white peers.","Lawmakers, including Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), have asked past presidents to posthumously pardon Johnson for years.

King urged Trump to absolve Johnson on Saturday, tweeting, “Obama wouldn’t do it. Trump ... now considering it. Would correct a terrible injustice.”","In an interview with the Los Angeles Times earlier this year, Johnson’s great-great niece Linda E.

It’s the latest home game that tiny South London soccer team Dulwich Hamlet has been forced to play away from Champion Hill, the ground it’s called home since 1912.","The mid-April match, against Thurrock F.C., takes place at the home field of local rivals Tooting and Mitcham and is some nine miles from Dulwich.","The club’s displacement is due to a rift between Southwark, the local council, and a multinational property development firm Meadow Residential, an affiliate of New York City-based property fund Meadow Partners, which owns Champion Hill and wishes to knock down the current stadium to build apartments.","At the start of March, when Southwark Council rejected Meadow Residential’s proposal for a $112 million-plus apartment development on the site ― partly for its failure to meet rules on providing a set percentage of affordable housing ― the company evicted the 125-year-old club. One of Meadow Residential’s subsidiaries even went as far as to trademark “Dulwich Hamlet” and send a letter to the club demanding it cease to use its own name (the company has since withdrawn the demand).","Meadow has filed new proposals that include building a new stadium for the club on public land next to the development, but the club says it would be much smaller and not fit for a soccer team that regularly draws crowds of 1,500.","Yet Dulwich Hamlet, despite its size, has refused to capitulate, mounting an unprecedented fight back that’s won mainstream media support, the backing of leading British politicians and even garnered interest from ex-England international star Rio Ferdinand. Strong community ties and the unique network of personalities that make up its team and supporters are keeping Dulwich Hamlet alive.","The club’s manager, Gavin Rose, played for Dulwich Hamlet 16 years ago and returned as a manager nine seasons ago after working at a handful of other clubs. He has tried to protect his players from the club’s difficulties, but media attention and moving grounds have made that difficult. “There are a lot of boys who have come through the academy at various times, so they’ve got a lot of trust in us,” he explained.","Thurrock F.C., Dulwich Hamlet’s opponents, will cease to exist at the end of the season due to its chairman’s ill health, and Dulwich Hamlet has offered the visiting fans free entry to the game. Club closures are not unusual in the world of non-league soccer – which floats below the big money top leagues in the U.K. and is a mixture of amateur and semi-professional soccer – a sad fact that makes Dulwich Hamlet’s resolve all the more impressive.","Rose attributed the club’s resilience to its place within the community, specifically its initiatives to reach the “forgotten parts of society,” as he put it. “That sort of spirit is probably what has stood us in good stead when we’ve had our own battles to face.”","Mishi Morath, who has supported Dulwich Hamlet since 1974, is the club’s community officer, and responsible for many of these initiatives. Growing up in a public housing block behind the ground, he was 7 years old when he watched his first game. “Once you pick your local team, you’re stuck with them,” he shrugged, masking his affection.","Under his watch, the club has worked with local schools and youth groups, run trade union days, raised funds towards the Syrian refugee crisis, organized collections for local food banks, supported local living wage campaigns and played a landmark friendly against Stonewall FC, Britain’s premier gay football team, with all money from ticket sales going to the Elton John Aids Foundation. However, these efforts have come to a halt due to the team’s current challenges.","“Not being at [our ground] means we haven’t got a community, our community has got to travel to us,” Morath stewed, one eye on the game. “Not just that, but East Dulwich [the local neighborhood] is feeling it as well. Without the crowds we’ve built up over recent years, the local pubs have had to lay off staff on Saturdays.” He attributed Meadow Residential’s conduct to pure pettiness ― “the kid in the playground taking the football away so nobody else can play.”","Meadow Residential did not respond to HuffPost’s emails or calls asking for comment. The company’s website says it has supported Dulwich Hamlet to the tune of just over $1 million, but has been “unable to financially support the Club” while the dispute with Southwark Council over the development continues.","Tom Cullen ― a content producer and social media strategist ― came to the club in 2013. After taking over Dulwich Hamlet’s online presence in 2016, he was soon invited to become a committee member, going on to become the director the following year. It was during his tenure that relations with Meadow Residential broke down. He’s spent the past six months working pro bono, alongside Rose and fellow board member Liam Hickey, to keep Dulwich Hamlet afloat.","Cullen sees the fight as an opportunity for Dulwich Hamlet to set a political precedent. “This isn’t just about us,” he insisted. “We want to spearhead change to legislation so that other clubs know what to do.”","The Save Dulwich Hamlet campaign has attracted the attention of London Mayor Sadiq Khan, along with Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn. Cullen credits the club’s unique following for its continued survival.","“[Meadow] could have picked any other club in the country at our level or below and gotten away with it, frankly,” Cullen said. He is optimistic that a corner has been turned in the battle to save Champion Hill ― with heavyweight political backing, he believes Dulwich Hamlet will be back home within two years.","It’s a sentiment shared by Hugo Greenhalgh and Ben Sibley ― the faces behind “Forward the Hamlet,” an irreverent podcast and Twitter account.","Greenhalgh and Sibley also sense a sea-change in the club’s fortunes, pinpointing a recent Friday when Helen Hayes, member of Parliament for Dulwich and West Norwood, raised the club’s plight in the House of Commons ― a motion that resulted in Tracey Crouch, the minister for sport, promising the involvement of an independent mediator should negotiations with Meadow Residential fail. “[Hayes] finished this powerful speech by saying ’Forward the Hamlet,’” Greenhalgh explained, beaming.","“I lost my shit,” Sibley added.","Greenhalgh and Sibley represent the new wave of fans contributing to the club’s boom in popularity in recent years ― young creatives drawn to a different sort of football in the capital. This has led some to write off Dulwich Hamlet as a “hipster club,” but it’s a caricature that fails to recognize its rich heritage.","During the match, we’re introduced to people who have been with the club for decades, like volunteer turnstile operator Paul Griffin and Jack McInroy, unofficial club historian, who leans on the far corner pitch barrier to share his personal collection of old shirts and newspaper clippings. Dulwich Hamlet’s roots are deep and speak to the vacuum that would be left in its absence.","In the seats of the main terrace sits 98-year-old Bill Kirby. He’s supported the Hamlet since 1932, and has always lived within a mile of Champion Hill. His memories of the team’s interwar heyday are vivid. He recalls average crowds of 10,000, special trains to ferry supporters to local derbies in Wimbledon or Kingston, and drinking shandy from the amateur cup in 1937. “To be honest, I wasn’t 18,” he whispers, confessing he hadn’t reached the legal drinking age, “but I went home pissed that night.”","In its match against a dogged Thurrock F.C. on April 14, Dulwich Hamlet scraped its way to a 2-1 victory, keeping the team in the mix for promotion at the end of the season.

CNN just went there.”","Conway accused Bash of trying to “harass and embarrass” her before cryptically commenting on what constitutes a “difference of opinion” between spouses.","“By definition, spouses have a difference of opinion when adultery is happening,” Conway said. “By definition, spouses have a difference of opinion when one is, I don’t know, draining the joint bank account to support things that maybe the other disagrees with. So this is a fascinating ‘cross the Rubicon’ moment.”","The tense exchange went on for nearly five minutes, with Bash noting that Trump attacked former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, who was fired last month, because his wife received campaign contributions from groups tied to an ally of Hillary Clinton.","Still, Conway suggested she faces a “different standard” than have past presidential aides and slammed Bash for bringing up her marriage.","“Kellyanne, here was my whole point of this, is that you are a professional working for the president of the United States and your husband is a very well-respected lawyer,” Bash said, “and my point is that we don’t often see ― in fact, I don’t remember the last time we saw ― somebody working for the president in a high-profile position when their spouse is saying critical things about them. That is all.”","Conway dismissed Bash’s statement, claiming other family members of Trump administration officials “certainly don’t support the president privately and publicly.”","She continued to rail against Bash hours later, tweeting that the question regarding her husband was “cheap & irrelevant.”","George Conway’s tweets last month chiding his wife’s boss caught the eye of many political and media pundits. On March 23, he retweeted CNN reporter Kaitlan Collins’ tweet accusing Trump of repeatedly undermining his aides.","George Conway, who Trump once considered nominating as solicitor general, has since deleted the tweet, as well as several others that were critical of Trump’s legal issues.","A representative for the White House did not immediately return HuffPost’s request for clarification regarding Conway’s “adultery” and “joint bank account” comments.

They demanded the protesters remove their masks or face arrest. The officers — who wore bulletproof vests and helmets, and carried semi-automatic rifles — cornered the anti-fascist protesters, then grabbed those who were still masked, tossing them to the ground and handcuffing them.","At one point, an officer pointed what seemed to be a modified AR-15 at the faces of counterprotesters, none of whom appeared to be armed.","The lead officer in the arrests said the counterprotesters were breaking a state law regarding masks, likely referring to a seldom-enforced 1951 law originally aimed at combating hooded Ku Klux Klan members. Anti-fascist protesters ― many belonging to chapters of antifa groups, known for sometimes violently confronting white supremacists ― often wear masks to avoid being identified by both law enforcement and neo-Nazis.","“The irony of enforcing masking laws to prosecute leftists is just incredible,” said Molly, a counterprotester from Charlottesville, Virginia, who traveled to Georgia to protest neo-Nazis. She asked that her last name not be published for fear of retribution. “Those are anti-Klan statutes.”","“And to be roughing up anti-Nazi protesters while handling literal Nazis with kid gloves... it’s absurd,” added Molly, who said she saw one of her friends get arrested Saturday.","The rally in Newnan was the latest, and one of the most pitifully attended, neo-Nazi events to be held in the South since the deadly “Unite The Right” rally in Charlottesville last August, when a neo-Nazi drove his car into a crowd of anti-fascist protesters, killing one person and injuring 19 others.","Certain seemingly innocuous items, including balloons, were not allowed at the rally. But Georgia has an open carry gun law, so people could bring their weapons; HuffPost saw one neo-Nazi and one anti-fascist protester carrying semi-automatic rifles.","The Newnan rally was organized by the National Socialist Movement, an older neo-Nazi group that favors explicit Third Reich iconography over the more coded racist memes of the so-called alt-right. Fewer than 30 NSM members, along with a small contingent of the white supremacist group League of the South, showed up for the event.","The city granted NSM a permit to hold the rally at Greenville Street Park, and security and police presence for the event is expected to cost taxpayers thousands of dollars.","NSM members arrived about an hour late for their rally. Then they stood on a stage in the park, looking out over hundreds of counterprotesters yelling from behind a fence some 100 yards away as police helicopters and drones circled overhead.","Jeff Schoep, the so-called commander of the NSM, rambled about the need to keep Confederate statues. He referred to himself and his companions as “Alpha males” and complained about men who look like “homosexuals” by wearing skinny jeans. He also lashed out against the “Zionist media” for portraying NSM as a hate group.","NSM members flanking him threw up Nazi salutes.","Schoep then left the stage to address a gaggle of reporters. When asked by HuffPost about NSM members throwing up Nazi salutes, Schoep claimed they were actually “Roman salutes.” He then threatened to have HuffPost removed from the park for being “disrespectful.”","At 5 p.m. local time, less than an hour after the rally had started, police appeared to pull the plug on the sound system. An officer speaking into a megaphone issued a dispersal order, warning the neo-Nazis that they would be arrested if they didn’t leave the park. They left without incident.","The paltry NSM showing was indicative of the gradually diminishing strength of the so-called alt-right since the Charlottesville rally last year. That rally, the largest of its kind of over a decade, was attended by upwards of 1,000 white supremacists.","Since then, alt-right figurehead Richard Spencer canceled a planned campus speaking tour after being humiliated by anti-fascist protesters at the University of Florida and Michigan State University. Last month, a domestic dispute precipitated the collapse of neo-Nazi group the Traditionalist Workers Party. Infighting has also severely fractured the rest of the alt-right.","NSM and League of the South now appear to be the white supremacist groups most willing to hold rallies. On Friday night, they held a meeting at a bar in Bremen, Georgia. The annual gathering is typically held on or near April 20, the birthday of Adolf Hitler.","There were times on Saturday when Newnan looked as if it was under military occupation. Armored vehicles and heavily armed officers, some in military fatigues, patrolled the streets.","Ahead of the event, Newnan Police Chief D.L. “Buster” Meadows appeared to draw an equivalency between the racist and anti-Semitic neo-Nazis — who argue for creating a white ethnostate in America — and the anti-fascists showing up to protest them.","“Neither one of these groups represent who we are and what we stand for,” he told local news outlet The Newnan Times-Herald.","It was a sentiment shared by some of the other 39,000 residents of Newnan, a town whose city square is home to two monuments exalting the Confederate Army.","Jeff Nelms, a Newnan resident who works as a millwright, went to a friend’s gun shop Saturday to make sure no one vandalized the store during the day’s chaos. He called both the neo-Nazis and the anti-fascists “scum.”","Julio Gilgorri, 26, who has lived in Newnan for five years, had a different take on the anti-fascists arriving to drown out the neo-Nazis. Gilgorri was among hundreds of residents who attended a festival in the city square on Friday night, at which local businesses, churches and charities handed out #NewnanStrong T-shirts. Children drew chalk hearts and rainbows on the sidewalks, while adults wrote messages like “Nazis suck.”","“Newnan has taken me in as a Hispanic American and someone who’s looking for a new home. I felt accepted since the moment I stepped foot here,” Gilgorri said. “If we shut up and stay quiet and allow these guys to rally without any opposition, my opportunity might not happen for other people down the line.”","“I’m absolutely glad that people are coming to be heard because, at the end of the day, there truly are more voices on our side than theirs,” he added. “History has already shown who’s right here.”","America does not do a good job of tracking incidents of hate and bias.

Some demonstrations began peacefully, with protesters waving placards and chanting, “Viva Nicaragua libre!” (“Long live a free Nicaragua!”)","But in some areas, pro-government forces clashed with protesters, police lobbed tear gas and fired rubber bullets from behind shields, and buildings were set afire. A police officer and protester were fatally shot on Thursday in Nicaragua’s capital, Managua, where thousands took to the streets, and another protester was shot dead in Tipitapa, northeast of the capital, the Red Cross told Reuters.","AP reported that two protesting university students were killed on Friday.","One eyewitness reported on Twitter that five buildings, among them the National Lottery in León and the student center at the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua, were burning Friday afternoon. Protests had reportedly spread to at least 10 cities.","Lisseth Guido, a spokeswoman for the Red Cross of Nicaragua, told Reuters on Friday that 48 people were treated for various injuries.","The government shut down most main news sources other than La Prensa, a protester who asked her name to be withheld told HuffPost. La Prensa was reporting that police were switching from rubber bullets to live ammunition.","The United Nations’ human rights office urged the government in a statement to “fulfill its international obligations to ensure people can freely exercise their rights to freedom of expression and freedom of peaceful gathering and association.”","The protester, who works for a local nongovernmental organization, said that demonstrations began peacefully but violence erupted in clashes with pro-government protesters and security forces. She said the protests have been “flashing” across the country and are largely organized on social media.","“This is spread nationwide ... it’s young people going out to the street protesting, especially students, protesting against these reforms. And each time it’s been a peaceful protest. [But when] they’ve been met with the pro-government movement, they have been violent,” she said.","The protester told HuffPost she was protesting with a group Friday in Nindiri, outside of Masaya in western Nicaragua, when a group of pro-government protesters appeared armed with flash or stun grenades and confronted them. When a leader of the protest against the social security changes declared “It’s our right to protest peacefully,” someone “came up and pushed this guy on the ground, and he hit his head and started to bleed,” she recounted.","Security forces have seized vehicles carrying provisions for protesters, and invaded an area near Managua’s Metropolitan Cathedral where the church had been collecting donations.","The protests are the largest to hit Nicaragua in the 11-year presidency of onetime Sandinista guerrilla Daniel Ortega, who was also president in the 1980s. The country erupted in the wake of the new law, which the government insists is necessary to protect the survival of the social security system. Ortega has yet to comment on the protests, La Prensa reported.","Though the change in the social security law was the trigger for the protests, discontent has been growing over a variety of issues. Critics complain that Ortega has betrayed the Sandinista principles with a power grab and crackdown on dissidents, and blamed government ineptness and even alleged corruption for the failure to effectively fight a massive fire in a protected tropical forest earlier this month.","“The protests are a consequence of years of unsatisfied demands and growing repression and censorship to dissident groups,” Manuel Orozco, senior fellow at the Inter-American Dialogue think tank in Washington, D.C., told The New York Times.","The protester said that “people are just wanting to be heard” and they want social program changes to “be repealed and evaluated to be more equitable.”","On a “deeper level, [we want] government change, but we don’t even have a proper opposition,” she said. “It’s just individual people coming out on the street. I come from a Sandinista family, my friends come from Sandinista families; we no longer consider ourselves part of the party. It doesn’t matter what party people are from, they just want change.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ada9d4f1800002800e880d9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Donald Trump Rips New York Times Reporter, Denies Michael Cohen Will 'Flip'","authors":"Lee Moran","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-new-york-times-michael-cohen_us_5adb31d8e4b009869bf9b5d4","short_description":"\"Sorry, I don’t see Michael doing that despite the horrible Witch Hunt and the dishonest media!\"","date":"2018-04-21"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Matt LeBlanc Has The Grossest Story About Rachel's Meat Trifle In 'Friends'","authors":"Lee Moran","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/matt-leblanc-friends-meat-trifle_us_5adb05b6e4b089e33c885726","short_description":"Not so \"goooooood.\"","date":"2018-04-21"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"R.

Each sign lists the name of a local member of Congress and how much money they’ve received from the gun lobby group.","The campaign is meant to highlight the influence of the gun lobby on lawmakers and put pressure on members of Congress to cut ties with the NRA and pass gun control legislation.","The NRA spends millions each year on lobbying and campaigns in an effort to get pro-gun lawmakers elected and gun control legislation blocked. In 2016, the NRA invested $30 million in Trump’s presidential campaign and at least $20 million in GOP Senate campaigns, according to an audit obtained by the Center for Responsive Politics.","“Many Americans really don’t understand how the NRA works and controls politicians. People ask how come they won’t stand up and do something. Well, because the NRA is in their pockets,” said Survivors Empowered founder Sandy Phillips, whose 24-year-old daughter was killed in the 2012 mass shooting in a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado.","“We’re not afraid of the NRA,” she added. “What can they take from us?

Will it work now?","date":"2018-04-21"},"articleContent":["WASHINGTON ― Democrats are looking back to the last time they took control of the House for lessons on what may work this year, and they’re starting to narrow in on a major theme: the Republican “culture of corruption, cronyism and incompetence.”","In 2006, Democrats won majorities in both the House and Senate, breaking the hold Republicans had on Congress for more than a decade.","“In Iraq and here at home, Americans have made clear they are tired of the failures of the last six years,” Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada (D-Nev.), who became the majority leader in the new Congress, said at the time.","There’s no doubt that deep dissatisfaction with then-President George W. Bush ― from his handling of Hurricane Katrina to the Iraq War ― created a tough atmosphere for Republicans. Getting out of Iraq, in particular, was a rallying cry for a growing progressive base that mobilized and organized in a way that’s similar to what has happened with the resistance movement on the left in the wake of President Donald Trump’s win.","But in the House, a number of scandals besieged Republicans.","“Choking your mistress. Touching little boys. Taking money from the Russians. Questionable business dealings. You name it, we had it. On and on, never ended,” said a GOP strategist who worked at the National Republican Congressional Committee in 2006 and requested anonymity to speak openly.","Democrats seized on these issues and created a “culture of corruption” refrain that another former NRCC operative said was extremely effective. In many ways, it pulled from what former Georgia Rep. Newt Gingrich (R) did in the 1980s, when he portrayed Congress as a corrupt institution and hammered various internal scandals. It led to the downfall of the Democratic speaker, Jim Wright, and eventually installed a Republican majority in the House with Gingrich as the new guy in charge.","In 2006, the scandals dripped out bit by bit. Republicans watched them pile up, but still thought they might be able to keep the House ― until September when the Mark Foley scandal broke. The news that the GOP congressman from Florida had been sending sexually explicit text messages to teenage boys was the final nail in the coffin.","“Literally overnight, everybody’s polling data went down 20 points. I’ve never seen anything like it since,” said one of the former NRCC aides.","House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is bringing back her 2006 refrain for this cycle. It first appeared in an April 6 statement calling for the resignation of Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt, saying he was “a part of the Trump Administration’s culture of corruption, cronyism and incompetence.”","It then popped up later that day in one of her press releases, and then three days later in a letter to her colleagues about their priorities in the coming months.","In her weekly press conference the following day, she used the phrase twice, reminding reporters of that earlier election: “Some may recall that in 2005, 2006, one of our mantras during the campaign was to drain the swamp, to end the Republican culture of cronyism, corruption and incompetence, and that is exactly what we did. The president has misappropriated that term of art, ‘drain the swamp,’ and what does he do but have an administration that is wallowing in it.”","Other Democrats say that the message has been talked about in strategy meetings as something they want to do more of.","The targets in Congress aren’t as obvious as they were last time, with many of the men who were caught up in recent sexual harassment scandals quickly resigning on their own. But there’s plenty of material for them to work with in the Trump administration, including abuses that the Republican leadership in Congress has been unwilling to speak up against. Also expect Democrats to go after Republicans for how they, or their corporate donors, benefitted from the tax cut law.","Of course, many of the Democrats’ gains were short-lived. In 2010, the next midterm cycle, Republicans swept back into office in dramatic fashion, buoyed by the momentum of the tea party. They retook the House and picked up seats in the Senate.","In particular, the 2010 elections all but wiped out many of the more conservative Democrats who won in redder districts.","“It was a great short-term strategy,” one of the former NRCC aides said. “It allowed them to pass Obamacare. But the joke was up four years later.”","With Democrats competitive in more seats than usual this year, there’s concern that they could see their gains wiped out in cycles where the progressive base is less energized.","But Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster at Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research, notes that the expanded map this year is different than it was in 2006. Democrats then won a bunch of seats “that they had no business winning” because they were such long shots ― Republican districts that Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) had won in the presidential race in 2008.","This year, however, Democrats are trying to pick up seats in districts that Hillary Clinton won in 2016. Take Texas’ 7th Congressional District, for example. Republican Mitt Romney won it by 21 points in 2012, but Clinton then won it by two points last year.","“Massive shifts in these districts,” Greenberg said. “I think those changes are enduring because this is built on an actual trend that is happening around college-educated voters becoming more Democratic, and they’re much more likely to live in these suburban areas. I don’t necessarily see a radical swing back to the norm like we did in 2010.”","Karin Johanson, the executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in the 2006 cycle, and she said she had no idea this far out that they had a chance to retake the House.","“The most anybody saw was that we were going to pick up some seats,” she said. “By March, we still didn’t know we could take the House back. It always seemed really really hard, the number of seats we’d need.”","There also wasn’t the same grassroots energy that is present this time, Johanson said. Groups like MoveOn, Americans Against Escalation In Iraq and VoteVets mobilized people around the war and helped turn the tide of public opinion toward withdrawal. That movement sparked a generation of activists who are still in politics today. But online organizing was still relatively new and while effective, didn’t happen on the scale of 2018. Democratic candidates have said they’ve never seen anything like what’s happening in the resistance now.","“There is no one single figurehead to take on the president, and that gives us an opportunity for new leadership to arise naturally from the grassroots standpoint,” said Jon Soltz, the co-founder of VoteVets. “That’s the sort of momentum you’re seeing.”","But this time, Republicans have more warning signs, which is helping them prepare. Scott Walker, the Republican governor of Wisconsin, has urged his party to take all the recent Democratic wins in special elections seriously ― otherwise the party will be drowned in a blue wave in November."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ad8e0d02000002d00eb5291.jpeg?cache=P3VJL2rRMK&ops=crop_0_49_4795_3086%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"WORLD NEWS","headline":"Democrats Sue Russia And Trump Campaign, Alleging Conspiracy In 2016 Election","authors":"Mark Hosenball and David Alexander, Reuters","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-sue-russia-trump-conspiracy_us_5ada66eae4b009869bf96537","short_description":"The party alleged that top officials in Trump’s campaign conspired with Russia to hurt Hillary Clinton .","date":"2018-04-20"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"BLACK VOICES","headline":"Ellen On Shootings Of Unarmed Black Men: 'As A White Person, I'm Ashamed'","authors":"Hilary Hanson","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ellen_us_5adb6f8ae4b009869bf9e01f","short_description":"Ellen Degeneres and Van Jones had a talk about racism and police violence on \"The Ellen Show.\"","date":"2018-04-21"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Trump Presidency Is Taking The Luster Off Trump Tower","authors":"S.V.

For one man, it became a fire trap, too.","date":"2018-04-21"},"articleContent":["NEW YORK ― It’s been almost two decades, but Jerome Rose still remembers his one and only brush with Donald Trump like it was yesterday.","A fire in Rose’s South Park Tower apartment building had just killed four of his neighbors. He was visiting the owners of the Upper West Side high-rise to invite them to a memorial service for the victims when the phone rang.","“I overheard that Trump was on the line,” Rose said recently.","Trump then was one of the most influential voices in the New York City real estate community. The law at the time did not require sprinklers in residential high-rises, and Trump wanted to keep it that way.","“Twenty years later, I’m still angry,” said Rose, who at age 79 continues his work as a concert pianist. “He was calling the owners to get them to join with him…. He was lobbying that the law shouldn’t be changed. He could not afford to put sprinklers in his Trump Tower.”","Trump scored only a partial victory that year. New residential high-rises in New York had to include sprinklers, but older structures ― such as Trump’s eponymous Midtown tower ― were not required to go back and install them.","That partial victory in 1999, though, likely sealed the fate of a Trump Tower apartment owner earlier this month. What officials have since determined was an electrical fire caused by overloaded power strips quickly spread throughout Todd Brassner’s unit. The 67-year-old was taken to a hospital but died later that night.","Had the unit contained sprinklers, they might well have saved him.","“It’s so sad,” said his longtime friend Rachael Caine. “Todd could have lived. I don’t think he had to die.”","Trump, now the nation’s president, has had little to say about any of it. He sent out a tweet thanking the firefighters and boasting of his building’s design before the fire was even extinguished. He has not commented publicly on it since then.","According to Caine, Brassner never liked Trump and was appalled when he won first the Republican nomination and then the presidency. He had come to hate living in a building with Trump’s name on it and the hassle of the protests, the roadblocks, the constant Secret Service presence. He had considered selling and leaving, she said, but couldn’t afford to because too many of his neighbors also wanted to dump their units and too few buyers were interested. The result has been a soft market and falling values.","“The number of properties on the market at Trump Tower has doubled in the past year,” said Wendy Maitland, a broker of high-end real estate with the firm Brown Harris Stevens.","There are currently 22 on the market, eight with recently reduced prices.","“There are many buyers who just won’t go anywhere near it,” Maitland said. “I guess they may not want to be associated with the Trump brand.”","Meaning that Trump’s iconic skyscraper, which served as backdrop and set for the “Apprentice” reality show that made him a household name, has now come to mirror his presidency: its falling real estate values reflecting his falling popularity in Manhattan and beyond.","Trump himself has escaped all of this for the White House. When he does visit his hometown ― as he did last summer for several days ― the roads are closed off for the passage of his motorcade, and he is whisked in and out without delay.","For Brassner, an art dealer and vintage guitar collector who had fallen upon financial and health woes, escape was impossible. His money trap eventually also proved a fire trap.","“It’s almost like Todd versus Trump Tower, and being trapped in this horrible life,” Caine said. “I can’t believe this has happened to him.”","Towering Risks","The public entrance to Trump Tower is right on Fifth Avenue, sandwiched between Tiffany’s and Gucci, and it opens onto a five-story atrium. Toward the rear are escalators ― made famous by Trump’s presidential candidacy announcement ― that lead up to a Starbucks on the mezzanine level. Tourists from all over the world stream in and out all day, despite the Secret Service screening in the lobby.","Above the public space are 13 floors of offices, including the Trump Organization, the Trump campaign headquarters, a venture capital firm and, taking up the entire ninth floor, the Chinese government through its Industrial and Commercial Bank of China.","The private entrance around the corner on 56 Street, the one used by residents of the apartments that take up floors 19 through 57, exudes a different feel ― more of an old-fashioned hotel. The foyer is dark and leads past a concierge to a bank of high-speed elevators, operated by men in the Trump Tower livery of tailcoats and small white “Trump” buttons on their lapels.","Over the years, the residents have included Johnny Carson, Andrew Lloyd Webber, Michael Jackson and Bruce Willis ― along with an assortment of felons convicted of crimes ranging from bank fraud to illegal gambling.","Of course, like so much else about Trump, his signature building in Manhattan embodies an exaggeration.","While the elevator buttons say his penthouse apartment occupies floors 66, 67 and 68, that is not actually correct. Floors 6 through 13 do not exist in the building. Nor do floors 27, 28 or 29. The unusual numbering was done so Trump could boast that his building is taller than it is. Trump’s penthouse triplex, in reality, is on floors 55 through 57.","But whether a building has 68 floors or only 57 makes little difference when a fire is involved. Ladders on firetrucks can reach only the seventh or eighth floor, at most. Beyond that, water to extinguish a blaze needs to come from the building itself, through standpipes that carry hydrant-pressure water to the top floors.","To make use of that water, though, firefighters must climb up stairwells to reach the affected floor and run hoses from there ― all of which can take time when they are laden with air tanks and protective gear.","To keep fires from spreading until firefighters can arrive, and to tamp down toxic smoke and fumes, many cities have long required that residential high-rises have sprinkler systems in the hallways or even the units. New York was not among those cities in December 1998, at the time of the South Park Tower fire. And thanks to the efforts by Trump and his fellow building owners then, residential structures already built or approved by 1999 were not required to be retrofitted with sprinkler systems.","At the time, Trump argued that sprinklers were unattractive and that residents did not like them. Besides, he said, installing them in his building would cost $4 per square foot ― or $6,000 for a 1,500-square-foot apartment.","Concert pianist Rose, who moved out of South Park Tower shortly after the fire, became something of a fire sprinkler activist as the city government debated what to do.","“Why is New York the only major city that does not have sprinklers in high-rise apartment buildings?” he asked in testimony to the New York City Housing and Buildings Committee in January 1999. “Why does it take a tragedy to bring this to the public’s attention?”","Rose and his allies were not successful. In the end, the new ordinance required sprinklers in all residential high-rise projects going forward but did not require owners of existing structures to go back and install them.","Builders successfully argued that construction standards already made apartments “fireproof” and that fires therefore could not spread into neighboring units or hallways. The city fire department’s guidelines continued to advise high-rise residents to “shelter in place” within their units with the doors closed until told to do otherwise by fire personnel.","Effects Of The Fire","That plan was put to the test most recently in the Trump Tower fire, with mixed results.","By the time firefighters got to Brassner’s unit, it was engulfed in flames. Six firefighters were treated for injuries they suffered that afternoon.","A resident in an apartment directly below Brassner’s reported smoke coming in through his vents and decided to climb down 37 flights of stairs to escape. Another did not realize there was a fire until he received a text from Trump’s personal lawyer Michael Cohen, who happened to be a childhood friend.","Joan Sbarro heard sirens blaring for several minutes before deciding to take her dog and head down the stairwell from her apartment seven stories above the fire. She made it down four flights when a Trump Tower maintenance worker helped her down the remaining 41.","“I think it was handled very professionally,” said Sbarro, who is 74 and a daughter-in-law of the founders of the Italian food chain. “They saved everybody’s life.”","Everybody, that is, except for Brassner.","It was on the “50th floor” (38 stories above street level) that Todd Brassner had lived since 1996. He had been a friend of Andy Warhol and an aficionado of electric guitars. He had bought the 1,100-square-foot apartment in Trump Tower because it was a Manhattan thing to do, said Caine, who met him 15 years ago at a Jimi Hendrix tribute concert where she had been performing.","Brassner had had run-ins with Trump over the years and had never liked him, Caine said, but he became truly unhappy after the election when living there meant navigating a heavily guarded fortress.","Even residents must be swept by Secret Service before entering. If they want to arrive or leave by car, it has to be searched before being permitted to pass a security checkpoint. When Trump is actually staying at his New York City home, security measures become all the more stringent.","“He was so frustrated with the conditions of living there,” Caine said.","Many of the building’s wealthiest residents have simply taken to spending more of their time in their other homes. “Of course, if you live here, it’s a disaster,” said Dutch software tycoon Jan Mol, who said he spends most of his time in Amsterdam and London.","For Brassner, who was cashed-strapped and in declining health, there was no second or third home to live in instead, Caine said.","“He was quite depressed about it. And I can understand why,” she said.","Not everyone, of course, is unhappy with life at Trump Tower. While some two dozen units are on the market, more than 200 are not.","Sbarro, who has lived in hers since 1990, sees all the extra security measures that have come with the Trump presidency as an added feature for an already wonderful place to live.","“They have taken care of me like at a five-star hotel. A six-star hotel, actually,” she said, calling the Secret Service checkpoints and the closed-off roads “a small inconvenience for the amount of security we have. I think it’s worth it.”","And for those who disagree?","“They don’t like it, they can move,” she said.","Moving To Safety","Jerome Rose refuses to live in an upper floor again. Today he has a ground-floor unit, right beside the fire exit. He had just finished up an event with several other pianists two Saturdays ago when he turned on the evening news to see images of smoke pouring out Trump Tower windows.","“My wife and I said to each other that night: ‘I bet they did not have sprinklers in the Trump Tower,’” Rose said.","He is no longer the sprinkler activist that he was but is still upset that the city has refused to do anything in the intervening years to safeguard residents of older high-rises. “The people who live in these high-rises, like Trump Tower, are not protected at all. Residents should remain in their quote fireproof apartments. And what happens when the smoke is pouring through your vents, under your door? What are you supposed to do? Stay in your apartment? After 9/11, no one will be staying in a high-rise burning building.”","Shane Ray, a former firefighter and now the president of the National Fire Sprinkler Association trade group, said sprinklers in Brassner’s unit would “absolutely” have saved him. What’s more, Trump’s complaint two decades ago that sprinklers were ugly is not true today, Ray said. “Our industry has invested a vast amount of resources to make our products aesthetically pleasing while remaining effective. It’s all made for the survivability of the occupant.”","Sprinklers installed in the commercial floors of Trump Tower, which under New York City code have required them from the time it was built in 1983, reflect this. Rather than the old-fashioned nozzles sticking out of the ceiling, they are metallic disks, flush with the ceiling and barely noticeable.","Brassner’s friend Caine said she wonders if Trump appreciates the peril he has left for the residents of his building. “Did he even realize what a truly dangerous place it is?” she said, adding that it bothers her that Trump has not acknowledged Brassner’s death.","“He’s tweeting all these tweets and not one mention of Todd. Certainly he could make a tweet about Todd, to his friends and family. But of course he didn’t. Because he doesn’t care about anybody,” she said. “I’m just hoping that Todd doesn’t just go down as this nameless person who died in the Trump Tower fire.”","Rose, who did not know Brassner, said Trump’s seeming lack of empathy no longer surprises him. “The psychologists and the psychiatrists will be writing about this man for years. In the end, his character will destroy him.”","He said he remembers the day 19 years ago when the police tape came off the burned-out apartment at South Park Tower: “I knocked on the door. The father opened the door ― I’m still tearing up over it ― and he said, “Did you know my daughter?’ and he fell in my arms.”","Rose said his thoughts immediately turned to Trump and that phone conversation he overheard.","“I thought to myself, you bastard, how much of your fortune would you spend to protect your daughter’s life? And, Mr. Trump, don’t you think you should retrofit your Trump Tower with sprinklers to protect your family in the future?” Rose said. “And that is the message I would give to Mr. Trump.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ad112891e00003b137b17a0.jpeg?cache=PmhLXruDIU&ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Meeting Mr. Wright","authors":"Leigh Blickley","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jeffrey-wright-westworld-hbo_us_5ad7b9bae4b03c426daaf38d","short_description":"He’s “that guy” in every HBO series — and \"that android\" in “Westworld” — but chances are, you don't know anything about the real Jeffrey Wright.","date":"2018-04-21"},"articleContent":["When Jeffrey Wright arrived back on set six months after shooting the pilot for HBO’s sci-fi series “Westworld,” he came armed with a heavy secret.","He’d recently learned that his character Bernard Lowe, the reserved head of Westworld’s programming division and guardian of all robots contained within the futuristic Wild-West amusement park, was an android. Like the subjects he’d be monitoring throughout the series’ first season, Bernard was not, in fact, as human as fans had been led to believe. Rather, he’d been designed by Westworld mastermind Dr. Robert Ford (Anthony Hopkins) and modeled to appear like his late business partner, Arnold Weber.","This colorful secret informed every morsel of Wright’s performance in Season 1, unbeknownst to his colleagues. In an early scene with Evan Rachel Wood, who plays Westworld’s oldest robotic host, Dolores Abernathy, for example, a suited-up Wright calmly asks her, “Do you remember our last conversation, Dolores?” She looks at him sweetly, responding, “Yes, of course.” At the time, Wood assumed this was a typical programming exchange between her character and Bernard. By the end of the season, however, the actress realized she’d been acting across multiple timelines ― that Wright had at times been playing Bernard and at other times Arnold. Slight shifts in Wright’s personality and wardrobe, and each scene’s setting, artfully camouflaged the reveal.","“No one knew until they got the script of the seventh episode, and then texts were flying my way,” a bearded Wright told me during the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, earlier this year. “People had their wigs blown off that I held this from them for the many months that we were working on it.”","“I texted him, ’You! You! How did you do that? How did you keep that from everyone?’” co-star Luke Hemsworth, who plays security officer Ashley Stubbs, expressively told me. “There are all these little cookies and Easter eggs where you go, ‘Oh, that’s what that is’ or ‘That’s why Jeffrey’s doing that!’ ... There’s not a gesture or an eye movement that doesn’t make sense when you go back and watch it again.”","“I’d been working with Jeffrey for half a season and I find this out, and I’m like, ‘Did you know?!’” Wood reiterated. “You find out these people who you love, who you work with every day, are holding these secrets from you!”","Wright is good at stoking mystery. Before I met him, I associated the actor with the broody, bookish characters he’s played on TV and film ― like Bernard, who lives in suit vests and laboratories. On the day of our interview, Wright was nothing like Bernard. He was dressed casually in a baseball cap and unzipped jacket, puffing from a vape pen in between laughs. We’d just escaped the snow-covered sidewalks of Park City and landed comfortably inside a pop-up vodka lounge, where he was smirking at the thought of his colleagues’ “Bernarnold” ignorance. As we sat across from each other, he took his time crafting answers to my questions, hitting each beat with a sort of temperate ease.","Off-screen, it was easy to see why he’s HBO’s go-to guy, the kind of player who can pop in and out of any thematic narrative, molding himself into an array of dense supporting characters.","“Westworld” is Wright’s sixth project with the premium cable juggernaut, which has become the artist’s de facto television home. He first appeared on the network as Martin Luther King Jr. in 2002’s “Boycott,” which won a Peabody Award “for refusing to allow history to slip into the past.” Since then, HBO has refused to let Wright out of its clutches. Over the past 16 years, he’s starred in the “Angels in America” adaptation (2003), the R&B-fueled “Lackawanna Blues” (2005), the Prohibition-era drama series “Boardwalk Empire” (2013) and the Anita Hill biopic “Confirmation” (2016).","“He’s a world-class actor,” HBO Programming Chief Casey Bloys said. “Just on our network alone he’s played MLK, he’s played a gangster and he’s played an empathetic robot. I don’t know many actors who would be able to pull that range, not only of characters but also of tones of shows and movies. He brings this depth and humanity to his characters, and I think that’s why we continue to go back to him and why he’s so in demand.”","Now he’s the glue holding “Westworld” together. And maybe, after all this time, HBO, too. On screen, Wright is the kind of performer who captures your gaze the minute he enters a frame, his deep, gravelly voice entrancing viewers into a meditative-like state. His affectations are subtle yet deliberate, like the creaking of an old wooden floor in a suspenseful thriller. Wright is, as Bloys and others have said, a first-rate actor.","“Jeffrey has this real intensity,” his “Angels in America” co-star Mary-Louise Parker told me. “I have not talked to him about it, but I feel like it’s largely inspired by his intellect. And he’s not putting it on. He doesn’t come in with a whole lot of need, which is really,” Parker paused, gathering her words, “I don’t know, it’s kind of hot,” she giggled over the phone.","“He’s a super sexy guy, obviously, but you don’t feel like he needs a lot from you, and he doesn’t. He doesn’t. But he has a bucket-load to offer both from his life experience and from his ideas.”","That sex appeal might be hard to comprehend if you’re a fan of the Jeffrey Wright who’s played Bill Murray’s mystery-obsessed neighbor in “Broken Flowers,” electricity wiz Beetee in “The Hunger Games” franchise or Bond’s CIA operative pal Felix Leiter in “Casino Royale” and “Quantum of Solace.” The beauty of Wright, though, is his chameleon-like qualities, which allow him to be cast as a nerd in one project and a well-worn prison inmate in another. It’s why, according to him, Wright no longer auditions for parts.","“I look at it this way: I’ve been doing this for 30 years now. If a director can’t figure out what they might get from me or whether he or she wants to work with me based on what I’ve done, then I can’t tell them anything more than what they don’t know already.”","Another thing I learned about Wright during our Park City encounter: He’s a certified jock. He played lacrosse in college (there’s even a U.S. Lacrosse Magazine story to his name), surfs often (with a Hemsworth brother, no less) and does what most celebrities are too busy red-carpeting to do: skis when he’s in Utah.","“I skied yesterday,” he told me, “with a woman who lives out here who’s a stunt woman on ‘Westworld’ ... she dragged me across the mountain like a rag doll.” Wright went on to bemoan his 52-year-old knee and praise his ski partner’s ability to eviscerate the slopes, but a quick glance at Wright’s Instagram proves his deprecation is another element of illusion.","“It was a big surprise to me that he surfed,” Luke Hemsworth said, “but then I got to know him and learned he used to be a big skater. He’s like a 12-year-old grommet when he’s in the surf. He’s so amped and wants to go surfing every single day, whether it’s big, small, wind sideways ― it’s an infectious energy.”","Wright was at Sundance for the premiere of his film “Monster,” in which he plays the father of a teen named Steve Harmon (Kelvin Harrison Jr.), who’s wrongfully accused of a deadly crime in a Harlem bodega. The film immediately hit home for Wright, “as the father of a 16-year-old brown-skinned boy in New York City, in America.” The actor, whom Parker calls “a great father,” has two children with his ex-wife, British actress Carmen Ejogo ― son Elijah and daughter Juno. Their home base is Brooklyn, New York.","“When we shot the film, there was what seemed like a much more productive conversation around policing and police-community relationships or justice reform or bipartisan conversation, so it was timely. But I think it’s even more urgent now, because that conversation has been overshadowed by retrogressive political thinking and action, particularly through the [Department of Justice] and the attorney general,” he said.","Wright is comfortable speaking about the current administration. He grew up in Washington, D.C., in the 1960s and ’70s with a mother who served as a lawyer for U.S. customs for 30-plus years. (His father died when Wright was a young child.)","“Her responsibility at headquarters was processing and assigning penalties to certain cases. If I’m not mistaken, she actually was the first black woman and second or third overall woman working for the U.S. Customs Service,” Wright explained during a phone call earlier this month. He happened to be with his mother at the time of our follow-up chat.","He spent many hours in the hallways of her office, he recalled, doing homework and waiting for her shift to end. He became familiar with the inner workings of a government, one that he said functioned far differently than the oft-lambasted administration of today.","“The conversation around the nature of those who work in government has been so poisoned of late by bad-acting politicians who are actually the ones who are far more likely to be corrupt and corrupted than those who make it their life’s work to serve the government of the United States,” he explained. “I’m not saying that across the board, but it was my experience growing up.”","Wright was a staunch supporter of Barack Obama, and he campaigned for Hillary Clinton in the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election. So one doesn’t have to assume what he and his mother think of the current president.","“I can tell you this, having been in law enforcement and within the federal government for all those years, [my mom’s] antennas have been up for many, many months,” he stated. “The more we learn, the more, in my case, it seems Mom is often right.”","For a long time, Wright assumed he’d venture into politics, too. Theater, however, became a childhood fixation more interesting than the outside of his mom’s office.","“My mom used to take me to the theater to see the tours that would come through D.C., and I loved it. I loved it,” Wright remembered. “I was absolutely enthralled by the theater and by that world.","“I think that informed me later, but I was afraid, in some ways, to act on it until it was too late and I couldn’t resist anymore.”","At Amherst College, Wright majored in political science and organized rallies against apartheid in South Africa. But by his third year, he’d joined a theater group. After graduating with his bachelor’s degree, Wright earned a scholarship to attend the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University. He dropped out after two months, but not for lack of interest. He simply realized he didn’t need a teacher to tell him what he already knew.","“I took a class in college... I think we were reading some short Chekhov plays, and I knew the first day of the class that I was going to be an actor. It was just the bizarrest thing, but it just felt like home.”","The project that would become the spur of Wright’s career landed in his lap a few years later. After working in theater “to build an understanding of the craft,” he was cast in the 1993 stage production of Tony Kushner’s Pulitzer Prize-winning play “Angels in America” as charming nurse Norman “Belize” Arriaga and Mr. Lies. Wright seared onstage. Even then, he knew it was a role that would change the course of his life.","“It was the ideal work for me. It was the work that I think I aspire to do and that was work that was timely and smart, that was topical and fierce, and deeply, unabashedly political. So it was the merger of these two seemingly competing interests that I’d had growing up: theater and politics.","“It was also pretty damn good,” he added with a laugh.","The complex, allegorical show about AIDS and gay culture in America during the Reagan administration is back on Broadway today, with stars Andrew Garfield, Nathan Lane, Denise Gough and Nathan Stewart-Jarrett, among others. Wright has yet to see it, but he’s looking forward to catching the two-part production in a different light.","“I perceived the play, up until very recently, as being almost archival,” he said. “But it has perhaps as great a resonance now as it did 25 years ago when we first performed it on Broadway, and that speaks to two things: It speaks to the power of Tony’s writing and his mind, but it also speaks to the unfortunate nature of the political climate that we currently find ourselves in.”","Although Wright remains unaware of any criticism lobbed at the play back in ’93, he understood even then that the subject matter could incite opposition.","“As far as the politics [of the play] go, yeah, I’m sure there were some conservatives on the right who took issue with it. I hope they did, because it was definitely right to the jaw of the complacency and absence of empathy that the Reagan administration and conservatives applied to his response to Americans who were dying at an alarming rate from this horrible disease,” he said.","“What I remember is being onstage at the curtain call, taking a bow with my fellow cast mates and feeling this response from people in the audience. I remember clearly on many nights standing there and thinking to myself that I was exactly where I was supposed to be in my life … and it was perfection. So, any criticism, any resistance meant nothing to me because we were doing what we were to be doing, and I didn’t give a shit what anybody had to say about it. “","Wright went on to win the Tony Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Play and in 2003 reprised the role of Belize in Mike Nichols’ HBO adaptation. The HBO show, co-starring Parker, Meryl Streep, Al Pacino, Patrick Wilson and Emma Thompson, earned Wright an Emmy for Best Supporting Actor.","The miniseries aired a year before Bloys joined HBO, first as the director of development for independent productions. “It’s one of the reasons why I and a lot of people wanted to work here,” Bloys said of Wright’s performance in “Angels in America,” to be a part of “that sort of groundbreaking television.”","“When I think back on the work that I’ve been able to do and the work in my career of the highest quality, a huge portion of that has been on HBO,” Wright told me. “That didn’t happen by accident.”","No, it makes sense. The type of acting he sought to do ― “timely and smart … topical and fierce … deeply, unabashedly political” ― required the kind of high-altitude budget and cable chutzpah HBO was willing to throw behind projects. But HBO profited, too. When it came time to cast recent tentpole programming ― first the lavish period piece “Boardwalk Empire” and then the hopeful “Game of Thrones” replacement, “Westworld” ― the network turned to one of its most valuable players. If anyone was going to carry the wildly expensive, $100 million series to success, it’d be Wright.","And the actor was eager to do it. He’d keep the show’s secrets in exchange for the opportunity to work alongside Wood, Hopkins and Thandie Newton. “It’s,” he paused, inhaling his e-cigarette, “deeply gratifying stuff.... It’s grueling, brutal. It’s intensely challenging, complicated but alive and fresh, and exists on the horizon of things that I have done in the past. So it’s really where I want to be right now.”","Back in January, Wright had just wrapped the “seriously ambitious” six-month shoot for “Westworld” Season 2, which he said was equivalent to filming six feature-length films. The days were long, the content intricate and the schedule unrelenting. At times, he said, the production team had four units shooting at once (“on average we have two units shooting at once”), barrelling their way through 15- and 16-hour days (“sometimes 19- to 20-hour days”).","“We’re really trying to expand what’s possible in this type of storytelling, doing it on a scale that’s epic and all on film,” Wright said. “If anyone has the impression that it’s a luxurious, glamorous process that goes into putting these things together, they’re wildly mistaken.”","The show’s subject matter alone would scare some performers off. Here we have a futuristic theme park that functions as a source of expensive entertainment for guests who want to escape the real world and perhaps kill, befriend or romance a couple of robots ― robots who are reaching levels of self-realization. There are graphic shootouts, metaphorical mindfucks, and, of course, HBO’s typical quota of nudity. It’s thrilling yet complicated, confusing yet enlightening.","Wood describes “Westworld” as “intense and violent” but capable of displaying these “incredible moments of humanity.” It’s those moments of humanity ― the show’s ability to be a “meditation on many things” ― that keep Wright coming back. In fact, according to Wood, Wright describes their scenes as “dual meditation,” in which they embrace the rhythm and the tone of the content ― content that, if he had to distill it down to its essence, is about “personal self-examination. It’s about personal awareness. It’s about our relationship to freedom or to restriction.”","Season 2 will certainly tackle this idea of freedom and what it means to discover your personal potential. When we last left Westworld, the robots had revolted and were out for blood. In new episodes, Bernard continues to struggle with his dual identity while Dolores rallies her fellow androids for revolution. As Wood explained, “I had some [secrets] of my own this season, and the tables have turned for Jeffrey.”","“In some ways, the first season was really the table of contents — you understand who, what, where, when, when and when,” Wright said. “But the second season makes the first season look like a kitchen drama,” he added, letting out a hearty laugh.","Don’t be fooled: There’s much more to Wright than prestige TV. This year, in possibly his first leading film role since playing American artist Jean-Michel Basquiat in 1996’s “Basquiat,” Wright stars in “O.G.” as maximum-security inmate Louis, who, 24 years after committing a violent crime as a young man, finds himself on the cusp of release. His involvement with a new prisoner weeks before his departure, however, stirs up some unneeded trouble for the remorseful offender.","The film, directed by Madeleine Sackler, will make its debut at this month’s Tribeca Film Festival. Wright is also set to appear in the highly anticipated film adaptation of Donna Tartt’s The Goldfinch as Hobie alongside the likes of Nicole Kidman, Ansel Elgort, Luke Wilson and Sarah Paulson. (The John Crowley movie is expected to be released in October 2019.) Although he’s extremely comfortable as an ensemble character at the top of HBO’s roster, his star-turning role on “Westworld” has certainly opened new doors for Wright, doors he can’t even believe ever opened.","“I remember I used to imagine the world beyond the stage – backstage ― in my little 7- or 8-year-old head,” Wright said. “Now, I realize I’ve been working as an actor for 30 years .... It’s gratifying stuff.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ad7ba401e000008087b1e39.jpeg?cache=FHlEH29a7G&ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Jim Carrey Turns Paintbrush On Rudy Giuliani With Ghoulish New Portrait","authors":"Lee Moran","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jim-carrey-rudy-giuliani-portrait-trump_us_5adade10e4b089e33c8842b2","short_description":"“Ghouliani: Finally a face we can trust.\"","date":"2018-04-21"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"SPORTS","headline":"Colin Kaepernick Receives Amnesty International's Highest Honor For Activism","authors":"Sara Boboltz","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/colin-kaepernick-receives-amnesty-internationals-highest-honor-for-activism_us_5adb89b0e4b009869bf9eef2","short_description":"The NFL quarterback took a knee during the national anthem to protest police brutality and inequality, stirring a wave of activism in pro sports.","date":"2018-04-21"},"articleContent":["Amnesty International on Saturday named former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick its 2018 Ambassador of Conscience for his kneeling protests against racial injustice.","The award, given to Kaepernick in an Amsterdam ceremony, is handed out each year to “individuals and groups who speak out for justice,” Amnesty says on its website, with an aim to “create debate, encourage public action and raise awareness of human rights issues.” Past recipients include Nelson Mandela, Malala Yousafzai and U2.","Kaepernick famously caused a stir by taking a knee during the national anthem at NFL games to protest racial inequality, and by refusing to stop. Other players later joined his protests.","No team has picked him up after he became a free agent after the 2016 season ― although an Adidas executive recently said the company is interested in sponsoring Kaepernick if he is signed. A large number of NFL managers reportedly “generally hate” Kaepernick for his activism, and he publicly earned the scorn of President Donald Trump.","Kaepernick operates a charity, the Colin Kaepernick Foundation, which marked a milestone in January when it finished donating $1 million to organizations that help underprivileged communities ― a pledge he made in 2016.","“The Ambassador of Conscience award celebrates the spirit of activism and exceptional courage, as embodied by Colin Kaepernick. He is an athlete who is now widely recognized for his activism because of his refusal to ignore or accept racial discrimination,” Salil Shetty, secretary general of Amnesty International, said in a statement.","In a speech at the award ceremony, Kaepernick touched on the death of Tamir Rice, the 12-year-old shot by police in Ohio, along with what motivates him and other social activists.","“We protest because we love ourselves and our people,” he said.","He echoed the sentiments in a statement issued by Amnesty: “While taking a knee is a physical display that challenges the merits of who is excluded from the notion of freedom, liberty, and justice for all, the protest is also rooted in a convergence of my moralistic beliefs, and my love for the people.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5adb8bc71800004700e88159.jpeg?cache=09BGyvEfVM&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Montana Democrat Rips Sinclair Broadcasting In Ad On Sinclair Stations","authors":"Daniel Marans","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/montana-democrat-john-heenan-ad-blasting-sinclair_us_5adb877ae4b009869bf9ee5f","short_description":"Congressional candidate John Heenan says the local news giant is abusing its power and taking advantage of journalists.","date":"2018-04-21"},"articleContent":["Montana Democrat John Heenan is blasting Sinclair Broadcast Group for “using its power to take advantage of journalists” in paid advertisements on local TV stations owned by Sinclair.","Heenan, a consumer rights attorney and restaurant owner from Billings, is one of four Democrats challenging incumbent Rep. Greg Gianforte (R).","The 30-second spot highlights Heenan’s populist bona fides, potentially providing a model for other Democrats trying to exploit grassroots’ anger over Sinclair’s support for President Donald Trump’s agenda. Sinclair, which owns or operates more TV stations than any other company, drew fire earlier this month when it emerged that it had forced news anchors at all of its stations to read an identical message denouncing “fake news,” which Trump has used to characterize coverage he dislikes.","“This station is owned by Sinclair Broadcasting, a powerful corporation that forces its journalists to read corporate talking points on the air,” Heenan says in the advertisement. “A corporation using its power to take advantage of journalists, our democracy and the people of Montana? Not on my watch.”","The ad is due to air on the three Sinclair-owned NBC affiliates in western and south central Montana, reaching viewers in the cities of Missoula, Butte and Kalispell. Heenan’s campaign has made a four-figure buy that will run the spot during the “Today” show on Monday and Tuesday mornings, as well as during the evening and late-night news blocs on those days.","Tammy Wegman, general manager of KECI, one of three Sinclair-owned NBC affiliates, told The Associated Press that the station would air the ad, because its executives “don’t turn away candidate ads.”","Earlier this month, the liberal group Allied Progress succeeded in buying airtime for an ad on at least one Sinclair station, attacking the company’s coordinated “fake news” scripts and encouraging the Federal Communications Commission to deny Sinclair’s proposed acquisition of 40 additional TV stations. Sinclair, which says it now operates 193 TV stations in 89 markets, would control stations that reach more than 70 percent of the country’s homes if the acquisition wins approval.","But Sinclair bookended the 30-second Allied Progress spot with 15-second disclaimers noting that the “ad was purchased by a group known for its liberal bias and we hope you won’t buy into the hysteria and hype.”","Wegman did not immediately respond to a question on whether Sinclair stations would show Heenan’s ad with similar disclaimers.","Since the 2016 election, Sinclair has joined Fox News and conservative talk radio as a media bogeyman for Democrats and liberals. Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner revealed in December that the Trump campaign had brokered an agreement with Sinclair to provide greater access to Trump and the campaign if the company’s channels aired uninterrupted interviews with Trump.","After Trump’s election, Sinclair hired former Trump adviser Boris Epshteyn as a political commentator. The company requires its local TV stations to air Epshteyn’s pro-Trump analysis nine times a week.","What distinguishes Sinclair from the overtly conservative Fox News, however, is that it claims to be an objective local news provider.","“All of us thought that local media was off limits,” Heenan told HuffPost in an interview.","Heenan said the goal of his ad is to educate voters about the issue of corporate interference in media and give voice to concerns that some Sinclair employees have expressed. He decided not to mention Trump in the ad, because he believes that the issue would be the same if it were top-down corporate pressure on behalf of a Democrat. (Omitting Trump offers potential political benefits too: Trump won Montana by 20 percentage points in 2016.)","“Does it bother me that local newscasters here were forced to read these talking points? Yeah,” Heenan said. “But whether it was Donald Trump talking points or frankly, Barack Obama points, the thing that bothers me is corporate media forcing reporters to say political talking points instead of honest, straightforward news.”","For Heenan, who successfully sued the country’s five largest banks for fraudulently foreclosing on Montana homeowners, the issue of corporate power in media fits nicely into his campaign themes.","Heenan has made the corrupting influence of corporate money in politics a key plank of his campaign, claiming that the “system is rigged” against ordinary people.","And in Gianforte, Heenan has the perfect foil for a debate over journalism and corporate influence. Gianforte won the Montana seat despite body-slamming a reporter the day before the special election. Frederick Smith, vice president and director of Sinclair, donated $1,000 to Gianforte’s campaign the day after the attack. Smith’s brother and fellow Sinclair owner, Robert, has donated over $10,000 to Gianforte in the past two years.","Heenan is running on a platform of fighting for ordinary people against big corporations, including by championing a Medicare-for-all system in which the federal government would provide health insurance to all Americans. It’s one of several stances that won Heenan the endorsement of Justice Democrats, a group that backs left-wing candidates in congressional Democratic primaries.","Heenan dismissed the idea that his support for Medicare-for-all could prove a political liability in a general election fight with Gianforte.","He noted that Gianforte had lost his gubernatorial bid to Democrat Steve Bullock in the same election as Trump’s landslide, a fact that complicates the notion that Montana is a uniformly red state.","And Heenan, who has sued health insurers on behalf of clients and managed health care-related personal bankruptcies, maintains that Medicare-for-all is an idea that has the capacity to appeal to Republican and independent voters as well.","“What I see is a health care system set up to protect insurance company and pharmaceutical company profit margins instead of serving the people,” Heenan said. “Protecting those profits is not a conservative value.”","“Everyone’s frustrated with the Affordable Care Act. The worst platform to run on in is, ‘Vote for me and I’ll tweak the ACA,’” he added.","Asked whether he plans to vote for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to become House speaker, in the event that he is elected, Heenan said that it was unlikely.","“I want to know what my choices are. I would say at this point no,” Heenan said. “I would hope to have someone who’s better reflective of what the folks in Montana want.”","Heenan has a large fundraising lead over his three Democratic rivals: oil industry geologist-turned-land conservationist Grant Kier; former state Rep. Kathleen Williams; and former Department of Justice attorney Jared Pettinato.","The Montana Democratic primary is scheduled for June 5."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5adb89141a00004800533b92.jpeg?cache=V7nM6rHU6V&ops=crop_0_22_959_817%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"CRIME","headline":"Felony Charges For Father Of Toddler Who Shot Pregnant Mom","authors":"David Moye","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/menzo-brazier-toddler-shot-mom_us_5ada67cde4b075b631e5c63a","short_description":"The father allegedly told his daughter, “What did you do?

The union determined that “Tronc has underpaid women and journalists of color by thousands of dollars a year at the Los Angeles Times, suggesting systemic salary gaps by race and gender.”","The release of the report led to widespread frustration within the newsroom.","“People are angry, rightfully so,” said one newsroom source, who added that many employees felt “abused and taken advantage of.”","Just who will end up fixing the newsroom’s pay structure ― if anyone ― remains unclear. In February, less than a month after the newsroom voted to form a union, Tronc agreed to sell the Times to health care mogul and billionaire Patrick Soon-Shiong for $500 million. The sale has yet to be finalized.","In a separate email sent Friday to Times Deputy Managing Editor Colin Crawford and cc’ed to Soon-Shiong, a union representative said that any ambiguity related to ownership was no excuse not to start discussions over the pay gaps. “If the Employer believes its authority to negotiate over this issue may be limited because of the impending sale, we stand ready to discuss such limitations when we meet,” the email read in part.","A Tronc spokesperson said, “We at the Los Angeles Times strive to pay our employees fairly and competitively in the context of our dynamic media business. Many legitimate factors weigh into the salaries for our professional journalists, who each bring individualized talents, experiences and contributions to our news operations. We plan to evaluate the Guild’s assessment of generalized pay differences in light of the realities of our news operation.”","Times Editor-in-Chief Jim Kirk did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","“The leadership of the LA Times, be it current owners or future, need to fix this as soon as possible,” said the newsroom source, adding, “This newsroom is yet again in revolt.”","Here is the full email sent out to newsroom staffers on Friday:","Colleagues,\n\nIn the wake of our pay equity study, many of you have expressed concerns that you are a victim of pay discrimination under the California Fair Pay Act. Many of you have asked for both individual guidance on how to proceed as well as a plan of action from the Los Angeles Times Guild to rapidly address these illegal pay disparities.\n\nWe held an open meeting with our attorney and our Guild representative on Wednesday, and settled on the following plan of action:\n\n1. Bargaining\n\nThe L.A. Times Guild has asked the company to bargain over the issue. Our goal is to quickly achieve raises and seek back pay for affected employees. We sent that request to bargain earlier today, which you can find attached to this email.\n\nTo be clear: this will be a separate track from our negotiations over our main collective bargaining agreement, which we have not yet begun because of the pending sale of the paper.\n\nOur immediate concern is fully addressing illegal pay disparities on an individual basis. Contract proposals to help prevent this problem from recurring (such as pay minimums or step increases) will come later. The Diversity & Equity committee ... will be in touch about those proposals.\n\n2. Legal action\n\nWe are preparing a class action lawsuit, as a second option, with assistance from the law firm that also represents the Guild. The potential class action would be filed by a named plaintiff or plaintiffs in coordination with the Guild’s efforts to get the company to negotiate a timely and satisfactory agreement to address pay disparities. We will provide more information as this process develops.\n\nIf you would like to determine whether you would be covered by a class action under the California Fair Pay Act (should it be filed), or have other questions about the potential lawsuit, reach out to [union officers]. ...\n\nPlease be aware that this is an intensive process and that we are juggling dozens of requests, so we will do our best to get back to you in a timely manner.\n\nQuestions & Answers\n\nQ: Should I retain my own attorney or file an individual lawsuit or wage claim?\n\nA: That is your right. However, we feel strongly the best way to address this issue is for the affected employees to stick together and pursue our plan as a unified group. The only way to ensure we fully correct the problem is to work as a group, not reach a series of individual agreements.\n\nQ: My manager has asked me to write a memo describing my accomplishments and asking for a raise. How should I proceed?\n\nA: We strongly advise you to avoid writing a memo or asking for a raise individually if you are a victim of pay discrimination. The best way to address this issue is as a group. But beyond that, we think it’s highly problematic for managers to frame illegal pay discrimination — a systemic problem in our newsroom and in society — in terms of merit. You should never have to describe your achievements and qualifications in order to make the same as men or white people who do similar work as you. The exercise is offensive on its face and we should not participate.\n\nQ: What if I already submitted a memo?\n\nA: Here’s some language we recommend sending to your manager: “The wage inequities identified by the Guild pay study show issues based on a systemic problem, not due to merit. Any merit increase would be on top of addressing such inequity. We ask that the Employer respond to the union’s request to negotiate so these issues can be addressed for everyone.”\n\nQ: Does the union think we should wipe out merit-based pay?\n\nA: Not at all. Pay equity and merit-based compensation are two separate issues. To be clear, the union is never opposed to management giving employees better compensation on the basis of merit.\n\nQ: Are there any records I should retain?\n\nA: Yes, if you have time you should download all of your information from Workday before the sale of the paper closes. Critical records include past performance reviews and salary history. You should also save copies of any communication with management or human resources about your salary or performance.\n\nQ: What if I am a victim of another form of pay discrimination, such as age?\n\nA: We’re not leaving you behind, and we intend to investigate and address any claims of discrimination. Age discrimination is covered by a different law with a different standard of proof, so this will have to be considered separately. If you have concerns, please get in touch with us. ...\n\nThank you all for your strength and your resilience. Together, we will work to resolve this issue as quickly as possible.\n\n— The Los Angeles Times Guild Officers & Bargaining Committee"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ada530a18000027003842d7.jpeg?cache=ng2qU2uI2m&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Daniel Craig And Rachel Weisz Expecting First Child Together","authors":"Cole Delbyck","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/daniel-craig-and-rachel-weiss-expecting-first-child-together_us_5ad9e87ae4b029ebe0237169","short_description":"007 is going to be a dad again.","date":"2018-04-20"},"articleContent":["James Bond star Daniel Craig and wife actress Rachel Weisz are expecting a “little human.”","The two are preparing to welcome their first child together, Weisz revealed in a New York Times interview about her upcoming film “Disobedience” with Rachel McAdams, who reportedly gave birth to a baby of her own recently.","“I’ll be showing soon,” she said “Daniel and I are so happy.

It’s not a task for her, it feels personal. She cares for patients at her part-time job at the Nebraska Medicine’s Buffett Cancer Center with both sharp knowledge and deep compassion — traits of a skilled third-year nursing student at the College of Saint Mary who will soon take the state’s nursing license exams and move on to a doctorate of nursing program.","She’s part of the future of nursing in eastern Nebraska. She was also brought to this country illegally in 2003 when she was 6 years old.","Up until two years ago, Cervantes Ayala, who is from Mexico, would not have been allowed to become a nurse in her state because of her immigration status. In Nebraska she, along with nearly 3,400 other “Dreamers” — named after the DREAM Act, which never passed in Congress — could not apply for or receive professional or commercial licenses. That changed with the enacting of a 2016 state law, and has since led to a wave of young people becoming lawyers, nurses, cosmetologists, accountants and dozens of other licensed professionals.","“I’m finally comfortable in my own skin,” said Cervantes Ayala, who often looks back on her parents’ perilous journey across the border. “It’s like everything that we have worked hard for is finally paying off. We’re out of the shadows.”","Nebraska is one of 10 states that allow certain immigrants — such as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients, legal immigrants and unauthorized immigrants — to apply for professional licenses, which often require Social Security numbers. In many of those states, the door is only open for specific professions, such as for teachers in Nevada and lawyers in Florida.","Last month, Indiana lawmakers enacted a law similar to Nebraska’s, becoming the latest state to give young undocumented immigrants a chance at an advanced career in a country they’ve always called home. Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb said the state’s DACA recipients should be allowed “to skill up and work here in Indiana.”","Nebraska, like Indiana, is a conservative state. But the debate two years ago defied partisan norms on immigration and already has had an impact on DACA recipients.","The Long Fight in Nebraska","Alejandra Ayotitla’s voice still quivers when the Dreamer, who crossed the Mexican border as a 9-year-old in 2004, thinks back to the moment Nebraska enacted a law that would allow her to one day pursue a legal career.","A week before the measure became law in 2016, Pete Ricketts, the state’s Republican governor, vetoed the bill supported overwhelmingly by lawmakers of his own party, citing a concern it was unfair to immigrants who came to the country legally. The chamber of the unicameral Legislature was silent as senators cast the final vote to override the governor’s veto.","When the votes were in, the bill had 31 supporters — one more than was needed to override the veto. As someone in the chamber gallery full of Dreamers erupted in applause, most of the senators turned, stood up and returned applause back to the dozens of young people they had gotten to know over the many years it took to get to this moment.","“It was really powerful,” Ayotitla said. “I have no words to describe it.”","The enthusiastic passage of the Nebraska law that gave undocumented immigrants with work authorization, including DACA recipients, a chance at getting professional licenses is a far cry from some of the anti-immigrant measures state leaders enacted just seven years earlier.","In 2009, the state enacted a law that took away many public benefits, including professional, commercial and driver’s licenses, from undocumented immigrants. Then-Gov. Dave Heineman said the law would ensure “that state and local benefits go to those who truly qualify.”","Three years later, Heineman, a Republican, spoke vehemently against the Obama administration’s DACA program, which allowed those who were brought to the country illegally as children to work legally, while members of the Legislature tried to pass an Arizona-style “show me your papers” bill.","But as that was happening, support for changes to immigration policy was building in the state — not just among activists, but also among business leaders.","Dreamers Won the Argument","That support continues. Nebraska needs workers, said Jennifer Creager, the senior director of public policy for the Greater Omaha Chamber, in an interview. Like many rural states, Nebraska is exporting too many of its young people to sustain a statewide workforce, she said. With an unemployment rate of 2.8 percent and some 50,000 job openings across the state, immigration is a “pure workforce issue” for Creager and other business people. The new law could allow more Nebraska Dreamers to help fill the gap.","“It makes absolutely no sense to educate kids here, to put state resources into them with public schools and higher education, to basically train them to work, and then say we don’t want them to work here or pay taxes here,” she said. “Not only do we want you. We need you.”","Those same economic arguments are what drove business leaders such as Jim Partington, the executive director of the Nebraska Restaurant Association, to form a coalition to study immigration in Nebraska, a state with an aging and declining population. Between 2011 and 2015, nearly 12,000 Nebraskans 25 and older with at least a bachelor’s degree were leaving the state every year. Meanwhile, Nebraskans 65 and older are expected to increase by 75 percent between 2010 and 2030, according to the AARP.","The restaurant group, along with the Nebraska Cattlemen’s Association and other industry groups, soon became some of the loudest voices pushing the state Legislature to remove barriers for immigrants in state law. Those barriers, such as being the last state in the country to not allow DACA recipients to receive driver’s licenses, were in direct conflict with state officials’ economic goals, Partington said. (The Legislature gave DACA recipients the ability to get driver’s licenses after overriding a Ricketts veto in 2015.)","“I don’t think you can meet these people and then take a position that we want to deport them,” Partington said. “They’re so valuable to have here. They’re teachers. They’re accountants. Some of them are studying to become lawyers. They’ve got a great future ahead of them.”","Ultimately, it was meeting students such as Ayotitla that inspired lawmakers to make a final push, said Darcy Tromanhauser, the director of the immigrants and communities program at Nebraska Appleseed, a Lincoln-based advocacy group. Many of the DACA recipients grew up in small, rural communities across the state, such as the majority-Latino towns of Schuyler and Lexington, and the young people wanted to give back and become the next generation of skilled professionals in those areas.","“Senators felt like they got to know youth, and care personally,” Tromanhauser said. “There’s a lot more community support that is playing out that is wildly different than the national dialogue would make you think.”","Since the law was enacted, advocates at Nebraska Appleseed said they are unaware of any snags in its implementation, and they have not heard of any applicants being denied because of their status as DACA recipients. Administrative offices across the state were prepped and ready for new DACA applicants the day after the policy went into effect, Tromanhauser said.","Officials at the Nebraska Department of Labor said they do not track the number of DACA recipients who have applied for professional and commercial licenses. To be sure, Tromanhauser and other advocates said there is no easy way of measuring how many DACA recipients have taken advantage of the new policy, but countless stories of Dreamers applying for new licenses continue to pour into their offices.","According to the Migration Policy Institute, across the country, 9,000 DACA recipients are teachers, 14,000 are health care practitioners and in health care support roles, and 2,200 are financial specialists — roles that may require the Dreamers to hold a professional license.","In New York, one of the states that allows teachers to receive certifications, around 700 DACA recipients are in the education field, according to MPI.","Many more DACA recipients are studying to become skilled workers. Almost 17 percent of DACA recipients are pursuing an advanced degree, according to a 2015 survey by the National Immigration Law Center and the Center for American Progress. Further, more than 50 medical schools now consider applications from DACA recipients nationwide, according to the law center.","Ayotitla even decided to change her career path from becoming a school psychologist to becoming a lawyer because of this fight. She starts at the Nebraska College of Law in the fall.","Confusion Around DACA","More than 80 state organizations and local leaders — from chambers of commerce to mayors — have publicly supported the deferred action program since the license law was enacted, said Omaid Zabih, the federal policy director at Nebraska Appleseed. Just after President Donald Trump was inaugurated, the state Legislature passed a resolution in support of the program.","“I look at it as one very powerful moment in an ongoing movement,” Zabih said of the license law. “That didn’t happen in a vacuum. It built momentum for what we want, which is common sense immigration reform.”","Ricketts, however, has publicly agreed with Trump’s decision to end the “unconstitutional” program.","Still, Washington’s confusion over whether DACA recipients, who have only temporary protection from deportation, have a future in the country, including congressional inaction, remains a worry for young Nebraskans like Armando Becerril.","Becerril came to the country flying through the air. When he and his family got to a fence at the U.S. border in 1997 in the pouring rain, soaked and muddy with only the clothes on their backs, his uncle threw the then-4-year-old over the barrier into California. His mother, father and uncle hopped the fence too.","Over the next two decades, Becerril and his family settled in and created a life here. When people ask him where he’s from, he always says York, Nebraska — the town of 8,000 where his father worked as a meatpacker. Growing up, he excelled at school, and numbers especially came naturally to him. “They were my thing,” he said.","When college rolled around, Becerril received both undergraduate and graduate degrees in accounting at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. He still doesn’t miss a Husker football game.","Now working at the Omaha office of prestigious international tax and auditing firm KPMG, the DACA recipient is six months away from finishing his certified public accountant exams. Two years ago, he couldn’t have become a CPA in Nebraska.","But he may soon lose his protected status, as Congress and Trump have failed to come to an agreement on the program that expired in March, but has continued indefinitely while a federal court considers its legality.","“I don’t know how things are going to unfold with DACA,” he said. “We’re talking about everything I worked for for years. It could have been a waste.”","Unlike other DACA recipients in Nebraska, however, Becerril has options. His firm, knowing his status, has offered to employ him in the company’s Mexico City office if he is deported. He says he’s luckier than most. But he still wants to live in his home state.","“We’re positive, contributing members of this society,” Becerril said. “If we’re forced to leave, this country is going to lose a lot more than if they provide us this opportunity that we earned.”","Stateline home page","Sign up for exclusive state policy reporting and research"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ad9fff31f0000180016db57.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Lawmaker Who Blamed Storm On Jewish Bankers Takes Bizarre Trip To Holocaust Museum","authors":"Ed Mazza","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trayon-white-holocaust-museum_us_5ad964dee4b03c426dacd8d0","short_description":"Trayon White Sr. once claimed \"the Rothschilds\" were \"controlling the climate.\"","date":"2018-04-20"},"articleContent":["A Democratic lawmaker in Washington, D.C., who once blamed a winter storm on Jewish bankers visited the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum on Thursday.","It didn’t go well.","According to The Washington Post, Trayon White Sr., a member of the D.C.

If enacted, the bill would make “advertising, offering to engage in, or engaging in sexual orientation change efforts” to the list of fraudulent business practices already banned in California.","Assemblyman Evan Low, a leader of the legislature’s LGBT Caucus, proposed the bill.","“This is a very personal issue to me,” Low said before the vote on the Assembly floor. “This notion that we would accept as a legal practice that conversion therapy works is antithetical to my very existence in this body.”","Major mental health associations have thoroughly discredited conversion therapy. The American Psychological Association has said that attempts to change sexual orientation through therapy have “serious potential to harm young people.”","A 2012 law already bars mental health providers from attempting conversion therapy on minors, The Associated Press reported.

They cited the ability of churches to sell books about conversion therapy, for example, or invite a therapist to speak about the subject at a church event.","“This is a bill that would be overturned by a higher court on the grounds of the First Amendment,” Assemblyman Matthew Harper, a Republican, said.","Low said that the bill is limited to conversion therapy offered as a service in exchange for monetary compensation.

She is chastising him for being “lazy” and straightening up his things when she blurs into the background of his living room, her gentle gospel humming melding smoothly into the jagged sound of his phone vibrating.","Earn has called to check in on the aspiring rapper to sign some paperwork and check in on him — a task he shrugs off before hanging up and tossing his phone on the table. It’s unclear how soon or long after the call it takes Paper Boi to rise from the couch, throw on fresh clothes, walk out of his dark home and into the sun to greet Sierra, an Instagram-famous woman the rapper either wants to sleep with or ask to be his girlfriend.","The latest installment of “Atlanta” begins slowly and with a surreal haze that hangs over the episode as Al drudges through a series of incredibly unfortunate events. Paper Boi spends his day being berated by Sierra for his desire to stay real before storming out of their dual pedicure appointment. He starts his long walk home but, on the way, he’s robbed at gunpoint by three unnamed teenagers who scoff at his realness before busting his lip and snatching his jewelry and wallet. A dash into the nearby woods — a nod to the episode’s title (“Woods”) and a metaphor for his mental state — to avoid being shot leads Paper Boi to an old man, another likely apparition. The man violently forces him to “make the decision”: Is he going to accept his celebrity and alter his life accordingly or is he going to die trying to maintain his sense of regularity?","On this week’s “Run That Back,” Taryn Finley and Julia Craven discuss Paper Boi’s awakening, how losing a degree of realness is a means of economic survival for black folks, and the internal wars that force us all to confront our ghosts.","Sierra drives past the strip club where she used to dance and wonders aloud if she and Paper Boi had ever encountered each other before they became famous. If they did, she’s sure that she’d have brushed him off as a “broke ass nigga,” and he agrees. He probably thought she was a “stuck up ho with too many stretch marks.” She laughs off the comment, and begins a spiel about how she likes hanging with him because he gets what it’s like to be famous. It’s the first hint at an interesting dynamic between the two — she’s Paper Boi’s biggest cheerleader but also his unwelcome life coach, who knows how to work the online fame machine in her favor in a way he doesn’t. She insists he care more about his money and, most importantly, the celebrity that has come along with it. But he doesn’t take her wisdom well and abruptly ends the day by storming out of a nail salon where they’re getting pedicures. The impetus: she snapped a photo of him without asking.","Taryn: Paper Boi. Al. The nigga that kept getting got this episode. Let’s discuss.","Julia: I pray I never have a day as bad as Paper Boi’s Tuesday afternoon was. Don’t ask me how I know it was a Tuesday, I just feel that it was in my spirit.","Taryn: I keep telling folks that Tuesday is the worst day of the week. You could also tell it was Tuesday cause the nail salon wasn’t packed, but we’ll get there in a minute.","Julia: Wow, that’s how I knew it was Tuesday. That empty salon looked familiar.","Taryn: HELLO! I knew I wasn’t alone on that one. This episode was a damn doozy from jump.","Julia: It was. Paper Boi just wanted to hang out with Sierra, an Instagram-famous woman he was considering sleeping with, and it took an ugly turn. But let’s start with him lying on the couch and his mama cussing him out.","To me, that opening scene of him laying on the couch, sleeping all day, the house is dirty, he’s being short when people ask how he is, etc. ― Paper Boi is depressed. Incredibly so. And I know this because WHEW HAVE I BEEN THERE.","Taryn: That was so triggering. You know how many mornings I’ve woken up to getting cussed out about not cleaning?","And that’s a really good point that confirms my belief that his mom really wasn’t there. He was either dreaming or imagining his mom because that’s how she probably used to talk to him in the mornings when he was younger, living with her, when times were simpler and he didn’t have to make these complicated, messy decisions about how he was gonna take control of his life/career.","Julia: I don’t think his mom was really there either. I think she was an apparition ― the first of two this episode, but we’ll get to that later.","Taryn: Oh, we sure will get there. This episode also reminded me of his past interactions at the streaming company and at Clark County’s studio. His primary concern was “keeping it real” while “being all about that paper, boy.” Those two can rarely exist together unless you’re Cardi B, like you told me last night. Sierra tried to tell him that, but he thought she was just blowing smoke. He’s too busy trying to “keep it real” that he’s removed himself from the reality of how he’s perceived and the direction his career is going.","I was really excited when we saw Sierra. I thought they were about to be my new favorite hood couple when she picked him up in the big boy truck. That’s the hood bitch shit I live for!","Julia: I, too, live for that hood bitch shit. And Sierra, tbh, is the only person we’ve seen this season who gets him and who gets that you can’t keep it real and be famous. Fame, which we got into last episode, is all about the aesthetics and the perception. It’s like ole girl said, “It’s a simulation, Van. It’s all fake.”","Paper Boi has to understand that very few people are going to care that he’s Al and even less are going to care about his privacy. They care about Paper Boi. Just like people love Cardi B, but they don’t care about Belcalis. (Except us. We care.)","Taryn: We care so much about Belcalis. ❤️","Sierra was all about helping Paper Boi level up, which in turn, would help her level up. Her comments at the shoe shop about him getting new clothes ’cause no one wants to fan over a nigga in a loose-collar ass Polo, telling him he needs a new manager that knows how to make money moves, taking his crusty-toe ass to the nail salon, telling him to post more on IG. Sierra, though imperfect, moves with purpose, something Paper Boi doesn’t give a damn about. (See: Al blowing off Earn telling him to get those papers signed earlier in the episode.) Al thinks he’s about that paper, but Sierra is about that paper.","Julia: Exactly, and to be about the money is to lose a degree of your realness. It just is. Think about black people who infiltrate corporate America. How many of us are actually not gutta af? Black folks in all walks of life have to conform to the demands of white-dominated industries — at least initially. And, also, Al isn’t as interesting as Paper Boi. He’s not as compelling. He’s just a nigga in a Polo and cargo shorts. Is that fine? Yeah, for somebody who isn’t famous. And it’s like that kid said — with a mean “we bout to get this nigga” chuckle — before they robbed him, “Oh, so you keeping it real?” Keeping it real doesn’t get you anything in the public, except robbed twice in one season. Does that say A LOT about our society? Yes. But at the end of the day, GET MONEY BITCH (Khia voice).","TL;DR ― Be real at home.","Taryn: That part. He got so frustrated with Sierra telling him what’s really real about this money game that he ended up on his ass eating Krystal in a parking lot with a broken heart and wet socks. His pride wouldn’t even let him call an Uber cause he was that big mad. Shit, I’d be surprised if Paper Boi even had the app since he wanna be so damn real.","Also, special shoutout to Sierra for this line: “Everybody wanna be a black girl, but the black girls ain’t making money from it.”","Julia: Give her a fucking Emmy. Another Emmy-winning line: “Permission? Nigga, you famous.” I was shouting, “LET HIM KNOW!”","Taryn: She may be rude af to people with service jobs, but she gets everything else!","Julia: She’s incredibly rude, which ... I don’t understand the relevance of her being rude, but I know for a fact that she had to be rude, because I know women like her and they’re just rude!","Taryn: Yea, I chalked it up to the same thing.","Julia: Yeah, so let’s not get into nail shop politics, when people speak their native language and how black people react. I’ll just say people should be able to speak whatever language they feel most comfortable speaking and Sierra was on 10. And now let’s move on to the Krystal parking lot.","After storming out of the nail salon, Paper Boi stops at Krystal — a Southern staple — to grab a burger. He gets a text from an unsaved number saying they’re thinking about him, another check-in he shrugs off. He continues on his walk home and encounters three teens who are discussing the latest “Star Wars” movie. Their demeanor is a little odd. They don’t seem genuinely enthused to see Paper Boi — which differs vastly from other encounters with fans this season — and the scene feels as though the trio were waiting on his arrival. They inquire why he’s alone with no car and Al, nervously, counters with his own question of whether he’s allowed to walk. The teens inch closer to him with one saying through a cartoonish smile, in an unprovoked reference to his conversation with Sierra, “Oh, you keeping it real? That’s what’s up!” They slowly surround him, smiling, before one throws ice in his face as the other sucker punches him and the third pulls out a gun. The rapper fights off the kids who make off with his watch and his chain. He headbutts the one holding the gun before dashing into the woods to avoid getting shot.","Julia: Have you ever had a Krystal burger? They so good that one time, when I was visiting my parents in Georgia, me and my stepdad went and didn’t tell my mom. And she KIRKED. We tried to sneak the bag in the house but it didn’t work. We got busted.","Taryn: See. Y’all wrong af for that. You know Krystal is too damn good.","Julia: She should’ve rode out with us! We asked her if she wanted anything. She said no, so we assumed that meant Krystal as well.","But after he had his Krystal burger, Paper Boi kept walking and ran into some teenagers. And got his watch snatched. And his chain. And he almost got shot. Like you said last night, this is when keeping it real went wrong.","I also think Sierra set him up.","Taryn: Do tell. 👁","Julia: So, this is my conspiracy theory. When Paper Boi walks up on the trio of teens, something about it feels off. It’s like they aren’t genuinely excited to see him as his fans usually are. Their body language is weird and they’re talking like bad actors, like they rehearsed this or something. It wasn’t a natural encounter. But the tip was when ole boy with the gun says, “Oh, you keeping it real?” completely unprovoked. How would he know that Paper Boi walking was an attempt to keep it real, which is what he told Sierra basically, if she didn’t set him up?! And it’s not like she wasn’t acting cartoonish herself throughout their day.\n","Or, alternatively, when the other teen said, “I can’t wait to tell my brother about this!” maybe his brother recognized dickhead out walking alone and tipped them off. Either way, SOMEBODY SET HIM UP!","Taryn: Yea, their behavior definitely felt off from jump. I just wonder if it was Sierra’s doing or not. I’m leaning toward his brother ― or someone else ― but I wouldn’t put it past Sierra cause she’s strategic as hell. I also think he might’ve said, “Oh, you keeping it real?” on his own just thinking about the Glover brothers’ method of threading things together by way of repetition via different vessels. Like the humming from his mom, then late, from the old man. Or Teddy Perkins slamming his hand on the piano as his father did in the home video a couple episodes ago. Might be a reach, but I feel like they might be making a larger point about what happens when you don’t listen to the universe. Facing fucked-up shit is cyclical and not always from the same source.","Julia: That makes more sense than my conspiracy.\n","Taryn: LMAO I have a deep appreciation for a good conspiracy theory, though.\n","Julia: Thank you. I feel seen.","Taryn: But that young boy saying, “Oh you keeping it real? That’s what’s up.” was like him saying “Bet, you just like any other nigga? So we bout to rob your ass as soon as the Marta passes.” Though I’ve never gotten robbed at gunpoint as the train goes by, the scene felt so familiar, and so triggering. My heart rate was UP.","Julia: When they asked if he was by himself I knew he was about to get robbed at gunpoint. But Paper Boi, in true real nigga form, grabbed the gun. I was impressed tbh because I just would’ve ran them my shit. I’m not dying over a chain, a phone, money. Nah.","“Give me your phone.” hands over phone, which is the bane of my existence anyway so thanks for the favor lowkey, don’t shoot me.","I’m gonna get a new iPhone next year anyway so Midas Whale just turn it over. Shoutout to the upgrade-every-year plan.","Taryn: CHILE! Stressing me OUT. That struggle with the gun had me shook. I guess I get it cause he’d been robbed earlier in the season and he’s a big nigga so maybe he thought he could take them on. It just wouldn’t have been me. Then I couldn’t take him running into the woods for his life. And we begin to see this recurring horror trope this season has been fond of using.","Julia: Him grabbing the gun, to me, was symbolic of his priorities. Paper Boi cares deeply about respect (as many ppl from the hood do because it’s understood that disrespecting someone can get you hurt). He cared enough about his chain, his watch and his pride to grab the gun, headbutt the kid, then go looking for them once he collected himself in the woods. But he doesn’t care enough to do what’s required to protect himself and his fame and prevent this from happening? He doesn’t care enough to accept that this will keep happening unless he levels up and accepts the perceptions of him and his fame? OK, Paper Boi. You got it, sis.","And the horror trope. They are really killing it. it’s such an effective way to explore the mind states of black Americans.","Taryn: HELLO! Also, when I saw this episode was entitled “Woods,” I surely thought it was gonna be about Backwoods. That’s the black in me, though.","Julia: I’m honestly speechless, Taryn. But, never change.","Taryn: I wouldn’t have been keeping it real if I didn’t admit that.","Julia: ljhsDGFDEFCJDSHFC. Can someone sucker-punch me? I’m so fed up. I’ll just hand over my phone.","Taryn: Unlike Al, however, I know how real to keep it while still getting to this check. And THAT’S what’s really real.","Julia: I love that meme of Rihanna so much it hurts.","Taryn: Girl, you know it stays on deck in this here iPhone.","In the woods, Paper Boi encounters an old man humming a gospel tune. The old man could be homeless, lost or a figment of Al’s imagination. Al tells the guy that he’s just passing through and he doesn’t want any trouble. But the old man follows Al through the woods, taunting him, asking him if he wants some money or some ChapStick and, at one point, apologizing for being high. In one instance, Al grabs the old man and tells him to back off, to which the man responds with a deep look of concern in his eyes, “You is just like your mama.” Fear invades Al’s face leaving us to wonder if he knows this old man from somewhere — or if it’s a clear nod to the old man’s status as an apparition — though the old man just laughs it off. Eventually, Al takes a seat and says he needs a moment to think. The old man tells Al that thinking is an impossible task causing Al to lash out and ask, again, to be left the fuck alone. The old man, baffled at the disrespect, puts a box cutter to Al’s neck, delivers a mean word of wisdom about making critical decisions and gives Al 30 seconds to get out of the woods before he hurts the rapper.","Taryn: That old man was the realest character in this episode, tbh. We’re introduced to him by his humming at first. I didn’t get the significance of the negro spiritual hum until I went back and rewatched it and saw that Al’s mom was humming in the opening scene. The man in the woods represented so much: his mom’s wisdom, the guiding light necessary for his internal conflict and his mental health.","I’d even argue that he represents the ancestors. We see the dead deer (another “Get Out” reference) that wasn’t able to make it out of the woods for whatever reason. If Al wants to survive, he has to learn from those who came before him and stop being so damn stubborn, like the old man told him.","Julia: The humming of the same (or at least similar) tune is what led me to believe the old man was an apparition along with a mumbled line from him I missed on my first watch: “Don’t think you can out-slip me.” He represented Al’s internal conflict with accepting his fame just like the woods represented the direness of this transitional moment Al is in. And when Al passed the dead deer again, I realized that he was walking in circles — just like he was in his life — and that refusal to push forward out of the woods would kill him one way or another.","I found this line really telling as well: “Make the decision. Keep standing still, you gone boy. You wasting time and the only people who got time are dead. And if you dead, I’m gon’ take them shoes. And your wallet. And that shirt.”","And the fact that Al ran straight out of the woods once the man started his countdown tells me that the answer was always straight in front of him. No circles required.","Taryn: Yes! Literally lost and he didn’t know it until that point. My mom always says that the answers are always in front of you, you just gotta stop being so damn stubborn and see it. It took a long day of getting dumped, robbed at gunpoint, lost in the woods and almost getting his throat slit to get him to realize it, but he finally did. He finally made “the decision” that I’m sure had been lingering in his head for forever. He just chose to ignore it. He finds himself in the gas station and runs into a fan who recognizes him. He asks if he wants a selfie and, alas, we have the awakening of Paper Boi.","I just wonder a) when he’s gonna try to get back with Sierra and b) when he’s gonna fire Earn and get a new manager.","Julia: Yes. He finally accepts that Al and Paper Boi are the same nigga. And, oh yeah, this episode confirmed that he is absolutely going to fire Earn. He can’t be Paper Boi and have Earn as his manager. Earn is Al’s manager.","Taryn: Exactly! I just hope he doesn’t switch up on Darius. I also hope that after this long-ass day, Darius saved him some of that toe jam tortellini he made cause I know that burger didn’t hold him over burning all them calories in the woods all day.","Julia: Nah that lil Krystal burger gone.","Taryn: Also, I wanna give another special shoutout to the old man in the woods for humming the “Golden Girls” theme song while drinking a Mad Dog. And for offering Paper Boi ChapStick but telling him not to put his lips on it. Those moments made me smile through the stress.","Julia: My granddaddy used to drink Mad Dog, the red one, which was incredibly comforting.","One last thing. I read in Vulture that all the older black men this season have been ghosts in some way: “Ghosts of themselves, as with Teddy Perkins. Ghosts of their children, as with Darius. Ghosts of what they could’ve been, as Earn notes of his uncle. And now, Al has come into contact with his own ghost — although what he’s a conduit for, specifically, no one can say. All we know for certain is that Al wants nothing to do with him.”","It’s kind of wild that everyone this season is dealing with a ghost. Something is following all of them and I’m interested to see how this all ties together in the end (or if it does).","Taryn: Wow. That makes so much sense. The same thing that you let haunt you will rob you if you don’t take control. Everyone is looking for that control, but no one really knows how to achieve it because they haven’t addressed what’s haunting them. Shit, that blows my mind.","Julia: The gag is that that’s life. Real or fake, that’s life.","Taryn: Whew!"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ada366e1a00004900533aa7.jpeg?cache=owWThFDMJp&ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Natalie Portman Backs Out Of Israel Award Over 'Recent Events'","authors":"Ron Dicker","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/natalie-portman-genesis-prize_us_5ad9ad4ae4b029ebe022eace","short_description":"\"She cannot in good conscience move forward with the ceremony.\"","date":"2018-04-20"},"articleContent":["Actress Natalie Portman has pulled out of accepting a prestigious award in Israel because she said her conscience prevented her from doing so, the Genesis Prize Foundation said.","The Jerusalem-born “Black Swan” actress was scheduled to accept the Genesis Prize, a so-called Jewish Nobel, in June, but the Genesis Prize Foundation said in a news release on Thursday that a rep for Portman explained the Oscar winner would not attend because of “recent events in Israel.”","The foundation quoted Portman’s rep as saying that “recent events in Israel have been extremely distressing” to the actress, and that “she cannot in good conscience move forward with the ceremony.”","Portman later posted her own statement:","The prize was established in 2013 to honor those who inspire Jewish values.

States have a responsibility to protect inmates and prison staff—and well-funded, properly staffed prisons can and do prevent widespread inmate violence or stop it swiftly when it occurs, prison experts say.","Lee Correctional Institution, the high-security prison where inmate fights broke out on April 15, houses violent offenders with longer sentences, as well as people with behavioral issues. The incidents started around 7:15 p.m., but a large emergency response team didn’t enter the first of three dorms until 11:30 p.m., officials said. The team entered the last dorm hours later.","CBS News obtained leaked video (not independently verified) that shows what McMaster apparently finds unsurprising: An eerie dystopia featuring an inmate smearing blood against a white wall and another roaming shirtless with a weapon that resembles a kitchen knife.","This is not a typical prison scene. As far as the death toll goes, the most recent comparable event was an 11-day riot—in which inmates took multiple hostages—that left nine inmates and one officer dead in an Ohio prison way back in 1993.","Prison violence “shouldn’t be an expectation,” said Robert Ayers, who worked at California’s San Quentin State Prison from 1968 to 1987 and went on to serve as the warden at four California prisons. “It’s almost, ‘well, seven people died, but they were just inmates, and these are violent guys anyway ... so it’s no big loss to society.’ That’s extrapolating a lot, but I think there’s an undercurrent out there that believes that.”","People need to be asking questions of the governor’s office and the legislature, said Anthony Newland, a former warden of California State Prison Solano and former chief compliance officer for that state prison system. “It’s no surprise that this kind of problem can happen — when there isn’t enough money to run the system,” Newland argued. “These things are preventable in prisons,” he added.","Prisons need to have enough staff to keep inmates and officers safe","Lee Correctional Institution has an understaffing problem. Security staff numbers continued to “lag behind the authorized strength [like officers],” according to a FY2017 South Carolina Department of Corrections report. On April 1, 2017, there were 90 vacancies for frontline security positions at Lee — approximately half the facility’s authorized positions, a state DOC spokesman told HuffPost. Those numbers have improved due to recruitment and retention efforts—the number of vacancies was down to 52 as of April 1, 2018.","But a former Lee employee, who worked there from 2004 to 2012 and declined to be named due to pending litigation, said he still found those staffing numbers concerning. “You have to have a certain number of bodies in a certain number of places or you can’t operate normally,” the former employee said.","Crises are the result of an inadequately funded prison system, one Democratic lawmaker argued. “Yes, stuff happens — stuff happens because you neglect things, you underfund them, and you put people in danger,” said state Rep. Todd Rutherford (D). He said that he doesn’t blame the current DOC director, who’s been “sounding the alarm bells about how understaffed and underfunded he is, how bad the prisons are, how hard his correctional officers are working.”","South Carolina has had a large number of violent inmate deaths in recent years compared to other states. When there aren’t enough officers—or people like mental health professionals and maintenance staff—staff may fear for their safety, and that in turn can allow violence to flourish. “I don’t blame the officers for what happened,” the mother of a Lee inmate told the Anderson Independent Mail. “My son says the gang members do what they want to. That they will pull out shanks right in front of the guards.”","It’s impossible to talk about understaffing without mentioning the nationwide push to reform mandatory minimum sentences and end mass incarceration in the U.S., issues that contribute to spiraling, problematic prison systems that disproportionately impact people of color.","McMaster’s office did not respond to HuffPost requests for comment. But “the governor is committed to continuing to fund raises at the agency and will continue to do that as long as the agency is in need,” a spokesman for the governor told NBC News. (South Carolina’s average starting salary for officers this year was $33,289, according to NBC.)","Cellphones: Potentially a symptom of a bigger problem","Officials have blamed the violence on gang conflicts over territory and contraband, particularly cellphones, which can be used to coordinate illegal activity. Officials are using the incident to push for signal-jamming at prisons.","But contraband is not a new issue, nor unique to South Carolina. And cellphones can be a symptom of wider security problems, prison experts say. (A prison can be fully staffed and still have security problems, though substantial understaffing makes things worse.) When staff can’t adequately sweep for forbidden items, an economy can spring up that includes weapons. Some inmates may also feel like they need gang protection because they don’t feel safe in the facility.","“Cellphones did not stab people,” said Justin Bamberg, a state representative and attorney who represents the family of an inmate killed in a different state prison on New Year’s Eve. “What did were some of those [multi]-inch blades.”","When there’s severe understaffing, you’re “not going to enforce simple rules and regulations, much less more serious stuff,” the former Lee employee said. “You’re going to stay somewhere it’s safe, which is like a staff area in the middle of the unit, where you don’t see and you don’t hear. And who can blame them?”","Staff “routinely” search correctional institutions for contraband, the South Carolina DOC spokesman told HuffPost, though he declined to provide more information about routines, citing security. The agency is installing netting at certain facilities to thwart people from throwing over contraband, he said.","This photo shows a man covered in blood sitting against a wall as another man approaches him during the prison riot.","Why did it take hours to get control of the dorms?","Lee conducts monthly emergency training, the DOC spokesman said, and there are three teams with specialized training that assisted in responding to the violence. Lee is located in a rural area, about an hour from Columbia, which may have increased the time it took to gather sufficient numbers of staff to respond to the crisis.","But experts have wondered how the violence was able to spread unchecked to multiple dorms, rather than the facility being swiftly secured. It’s also concerning how long it reportedly took an emergency team to re-enter and take control of the areas under siege, Jeffrey Schwartz, a consultant who has worked with correctional agencies and law enforcement for more than 30 years, told HuffPost. “Whether it’s staff or inmates,” he said, “your commitment to saving life has to be the same.”","And that’s why prison reform advocates find the governor’s statement so troubling— it suggests prison is supposed to be a violent place.","The incident is “more than just a tragedy,” a group of state Democratic lawmakers wrote to McMaster on Thursday. “We are concerned it is indicative of much bigger problems within correctional facilities in South Carolina.”","“I was hurt. I wept. Because these were lives that were snuffed out,” James Murray, a former inmate who now is a chaplain for South Carolina prisoners, told local news station ABC Columbia.","“We’ve been tough on crime,” he added. “But actually, we’ve been tough on people.”","One inmate’s brother reflected on the violence at Lee in an op-ed for the Charlotte Observer. “Small indignities add up,” Issac Bailey wrote. “Yet some officials feign surprise when those treated inhumanely behave in inhumane ways.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ada49ec1800004700e880b0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"5 Of The Wildest Revelations In The Comey Memos","authors":"Willa Frej","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/comey-memos-wildest-revelations_us_5ad9c15ae4b029ebe0231c0a","short_description":"Trump was obsessed with finding leakers and protecting his reputation.","date":"2018-04-20"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"COMEDY","headline":"Trevor Noah Unloads On Gun Owners' Stupid Accidents","authors":"Lee Moran","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trevor-noah-gun-fails_us_5ad99a6ce4b029ebe022be36","short_description":"Introducing... \"A Series of Gunfortunate Events.\"","date":"2018-04-20"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Exclusive: 'Everyday Guy' Describes How He Brought Down An American Terrorist Cell","authors":"Ryan J.

Five weeks into the trial, jurors deliberated for less than a full day before finding Kansas militiamen Patrick Stein, Curtis Allen and Gavin Wright guilty on all charges.","But it wasn’t just the trio on trial.","So too was Dan Day, the FBI informant whose hours of recordings ― which featured vile discussions of planned violence against Muslims, who the men called “cockroaches” ― were the centerpiece of the federal government’s case against a group that dubbed themselves “The Crusaders.”","Day’s testimony was at the center of the trial. Federal prosecutors would not have had a case without him. Defense attorneys said the plot would never have moved forward were it not for Day pushing the group to action.","The two sides offered up competing portraits of the 49-year-old Day in court. The government portrayed him as an “everyday guy,” a patriot and a hero who risked his life and stepped up to prevent a looming attack that would have killed countless men, women and children because of their faith, race and national origin. Defense attorneys said Day was an unemployed wannabe who jumped at the chance to become an undercover FBI informant and was willing to do whatever the federal government needed for a check.","In an exclusive interview with HuffPost, Day said it’s a relief to put this experience behind him. “It’s just so hard to believe this actually happened,” he said. He’s glad “justice was served” in the case, and thinks divine intervention led to his involvement, he added.","“I felt like it was a calling from God, honestly,” Day said of taking the risk of becoming an informant. “I’m not an over-religious person, but I believe in God and I believe he put me there at the right time, the right place, if that makes any sense.”","The father of two high school-age children and the youngest of 14 kids, Day grew up in Garden City, Kansas, home to the apartment complex the defendants ultimately targeted. Up until a few years ago, he worked as a probation officer and in juvenile detention before that.","His path to becoming an informant for the FBI is completely unique.","It began in July of 2015 with a trip to the local library with his son. He saw what he considered an anti-Israel poster, which featured a Palestinian flag and described the situation in Israel as apartheid. He tore it down.","“They have the right to put that up, and I have the right to take that down, in my opinion, so I did,” Day said of the incident.","Then he passed along a photo of the poster to a friend who eventually posted about it on Facebook. The post went viral.","Day was soon invited to a cookout attended by a number of members of a militia group in Kansas. Somewhere along the line the story got mixed up, and people in the militia believed that Day had found an ISIS recruiting poster. That wasn’t the case at all.","But the FBI, which was looking into rumors of the ISIS poster, interviewed Day and ended up being interested in him because of his connection to the militia. It wasn’t long before Day was working on the bureau’s behalf, giving the federal government an inside look at the larger militia group.","Then Day met the defendants. The difference between them and the larger group, federal prosecutors said, was that the defendants weren’t just talking ― they were ready to take action.","Kansas-based Assistant U.S. Attorney Tony Mattivi, who prosecuted the case alongside two prosecutors from the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, told jurors that Day was an “average guy” who stepped up at the right moment to stop men who wanted to “blow up a bomb, flatten the building and murder every single man, woman and child inside.”","Day could have walked away, like the other members of the larger militia group who knew a plan was in motion but did nothing to stop it, Mattivi said. “That guy’s a patriot. He’s a hero,” he added.","Defense attorneys saw it differently. They accused the federal government of overreaching and said the case wouldn’t have gone anywhere if it hadn’t been for Day’s involvement. They frequently mentioned that Day was working for the FBI before he ever came into contact with the defendants.","“The FBI owns Dan Day and they own the words that he said,” argued Melody Brannon, the top federal public defender in Kansas who was representing Allen.","Day said the defense’s attacks on him were unfair and only happened because defense attorneys couldn’t dispute what the defendants said in the tapes he recorded. “They had to attack me, and they had to attack the FBI,” he said. “I put my whole life out there so they could knock me down.’”","But Day said he was also uncomfortable with the prosecution’s glowing depiction of his role. “I’m no hero, man, believe me,” he said. “I’m not a perfect person, but I’m truthful.”","Working in remote areas of Kansas, there was no backup team standing by when Day attended meetings with the militiamen. He had a phone that was constantly recording in the background that even he couldn’t turn off.","It was scary at times, Day said. He noted he was armed, and “would’ve did what [he] had to do” if he was discovered.","Being undercover, observing and participating as the men spewed Islamophobic rhetoric, Day said the defense attorneys and the media overplayed the influence that President Donald Trump’s anti-Muslim remarks had on the defendants. He called it a “Trump card” used as an excuse for the militia’s behavior.","“These guys had a hate in their heart towards all Muslims, long before Trump came along in the picture,” said Day, who described himself as “anti-Hillary” and said he would have voted for Trump had he not been preoccupied with the case right before the 2016 election.","Still, Day said he would have liked Trump to have toned down some of his more extreme rhetoric about Muslims.\n","“Trump should not have ever said those things. I don’t agree with him saying that, you know?” he said. “Regular Muslims, if they come over and they’re vetted, that’s our country, man. That’s a free country. That’s how my grandparents got here.”","Day, like a lot of Americans, said he personally hasn’t had much interaction with Muslims. He said he had concerns about radical Islam, but said he “never had a bad view” of Muslims as a whole.\n","It’s rare for the federal government to deploy informants and undercover officers in terrorism stings against non-Muslim defendants. The Intercept’s Trial and Terror project identified 310 terrorism sting operations that involved international terrorism, meaning groups like the self-described Islamic State.","Most of the high-profile cases typically involved young Muslim men who became the focus of FBI investigations because of what they’d written online. Those cases primarily resulted in material support charges unavailable in cases against domestic extremists.","Day said he doesn’t know what’s next for him. As defense attorneys noted, he’ll probably get a conviction bonus from the FBI for his work on the case, in addition to the more than $30,000 he has already received. He would’ve made more money working a regular job, he said, and he’ll start looking for one soon.\n","He said he found some of the defense’s comments in closing arguments to be laughable. Stein was compared to a “child playing at war” who had a “willingness to believe the fantastical” and an “inflated sense of self.” Wright was portrayed as someone who just wanted to fit in and thought Day was his friend.","Day said it was particularly ridiculous that Wright’s attorney brought up the defendant’s parents’ divorce more than 35 years ago, when Wright was 14.","“Come on, man,” Day said. “Give him a puppy, I don’t know.”","Day added that he doesn’t want to sound like he’s overly happy about what happened to the defendants and that he’s particularly conscious of the effect their convictions will have on their families. But he doesn’t have much sympathy for the defendants themselves, who he said had plenty of opportunities to back away from the plot.","“I’d tell them fuck off,” Day said. “They made their choices.”","Ryan Reilly is HuffPost’s senior justice reporter, covering the Justice Department, federal law enforcement, criminal justice and legal affairs.

When the 40-year-old was found dead in his apartment shortly afterward, his death was labeled “accidental,” despite compelling evidence suggesting foul play.","The issue with the revised death classification is that “undetermined” still encompasses accidental, natural or homicide. It basically means there is no one theory that outweighs the others regarding the cause and manner of a person’s death.","A homicide classification would have required only that the coroner’s office find that Arthur’s death resulted from a deliberate act by another person, not necessarily with an intent to kill.","Berry’s account, along with other evidence uncovered by HuffPost and two private investigators working for the Arthur family – Michelle Gomez and Jane Holmes – was among the materials examined last week by the Jefferson Parish Coroner’s Office. The evidence, which prompted the involvement of federal authorities, shows how Berry and Schenck allegedly targeted men on dating apps in at least six states. Berry estimated that she and her partner, who are behind bars in Georgia in connection with another case, victimized up to 100 men.","Dr. Marianna Eserman, the forensic pathologist who performed the original autopsy, and other members of the coroner’s office were among those to sit down and review the Arthur case last week. The Arthur family’s attorney, Michael Kennedy, said he was not permitted to attend the meeting.","In a Tuesday statement to Kennedy, Eserman said the review of the case was complete and it was determined that Arthur’s death did not meet the criteria to be ruled a homicide. The pathologist said that while Berry had admitted to drugging men, she’d never said that “she remembers Shawn Arthur or his apartment.”","Yet prior to the meeting, Kennedy had provided Eserman with copies of three interviews in which Berry discussed the Arthur case. Among them was a Feb. 27 interview with HuffPost, in which Berry acknowledged going to Arthur’s apartment.","“I just called him and went to his house,” Berry said of her interactions with Arthur after they connected on a dating app.","Berry not only admitted drugging Arthur, but also claimed she was at his apartment when he passed out.","“He was snoring very loudly,” she recalled.","Kennedy said he is “outright angry” that the coroner’s office is claiming they cannot place Berry at the crime scene ― especially since police already have.","“Her fucking fingerprint was found there, so she was obviously there,” Kennedy told HuffPost.","Eserman gave HuffPost a different explanation as to why the case could not be reclassified a homicide. “We have no definitive proof under what circumstances Mr. Arthur ingested medications and alcohol,” she said in a Thursday email.","Eserman said Berry’s interviews were reviewed, but she did not respond to a follow-up email that pointed to specific statements Berry had made about drugging Arthur.","In her interview with HuffPost, Berry said she’d first attempted to drug Arthur by mixing a cocktail of prescription drugs with liquor. She said that attempt failed when the drugs did not completely dissolve and wound up stuck to the bottom of the glass.","“He didn’t drink it because there was like the ones that was still stuck in the cup,” Berry said.","The sheriff’s report indicates a shot glass with an unknown substance was found during a search of Arthur’s apartment.","In a Feb. 15 interview with Holmes, one of the private investigators, Berry said she found it was easier to mix the drugs with beer. Empty beer bottles were found in Arthur’s apartment, along with several pill capsules in which Berry had allegedly concealed the drugs.","“Of course, I drugged him,” Berry told Holmes. “I gave him two capsules of pills, then I took him to the bed, laid him down, massaged him and relaxed him, and he fell asleep.”","Berry told HuffPost that generally after drugging a victim, she’d encourage the individual to consume large quantities of alcohol.","“When they drink half a bottle of beer, that’s when you put the pill in because it won’t fizz over,” she said. “Then I’ll do like a chug game or something like that.”","Several alleged victims of Berry and Schenck told HuffPost that they have no memory of what happened from the time they consumed an allegedly spiked drink until they woke up hours later, with a bad hangover.","Dr. Gerry Cvitanovich, the Jefferson Parish coroner, did not respond to a request for comment Thursday as to whether Eserman, who is married to a detective who worked on the case, should have performed the autopsy and been involved in the case review.","The relationship between the pathologist and the detective should have been disclosed to his family, Bob Arthur contends. He said he was unaware of it until he reviewed the investigative documents.","“Mrs. Eserman should have never been the person leading on the response regarding the new information on the case,” Bob Arthur said. “There is clearly a conflict of interest on her part along with her husband, Sgt. Travis Eserman. There is always a possibility that Mrs. Eserman’s response was written to protect her husband and the other detectives for their shoddy investigation.”","The Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office, which reopened the investigation into Shawn Arthur’s death after HuffPost started raising questions, did not respond to a request for comment.","Whether the reclassification of Arthur’s death will have any impact on the Jefferson Parish District Attorney’s Office is yet to be seen. A spokesman for the office declined to comment on the case.","Kennedy said he plans to reach out to each of the relevant agencies to raise questions about the reclassification of Arthur’s death.","“We feel strongly that this is a homicide and will be working to provide additional information to the coroner to have that change made,” Kennedy said. “In the meantime, it is our hope the Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office will take notice and look more closely at the case, so we can get justice for Shawn.”","Send David Lohr an email or follow him on Facebook and Twitter."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ad8ee041f00002d0016d9ec.jpeg?cache=ERjHIOoFrN&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Michelle Williams Gives The Kookiest Performance Of Her Career In 'I Feel Pretty'","authors":"Matthew Jacobs","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/michelle-williams-i-feel-pretty_us_5ad64e9ce4b0edca2cbeb5f7","short_description":"How a baby-doll voice, NPR, a puppy dress and Ivanka Trump's hair led to this tour de force.","date":"2018-04-20"},"articleContent":["At one point in “I Feel Pretty,” after the newly emboldened protagonist, Renee Bennett (Amy Schumer), has landed her dream job as a receptionist at a haughty cosmetics company, she is in the cafeteria when the couture-clad CEO, Avery LeClair (Michelle Williams), spots her. Bosses at bustling beauty enterprises are, the average story goes, bloodthirsty. Avery, on other hand, is thirsty for an understanding of how normal people ― ones whose grandmothers aren’t the namesake of an imperious brand ― live their lives.","Naturally, that’s something of a struggle for someone whose privilege butts up against her eccentricities. “I thought I smelled animal products,” she meows upon seeing Renee.","If an actor is fortunate, at some point she’ll give a performance so unlike anything we’ve ever seen her do that it’s downright startling. This week, Michelle Williams is that actor. Even though Williams’ first lead in a movie was playing an airheaded teenager who inadvertently exposes Richard Nixon’s Watergate break-in in the 1999 satire “Dick,” she’s since matured into a so-called serious actress with indie clout and four Oscar nominations to her name ― a fact that makes her bonkers work in “I Feel Pretty” all the more delicious. It’s the type of role that’s only memorable coming from an established performer, especially one known for dramatic heft like “Brokeback Mountain,” “Blue Valentine” and “Manchester by the Sea.”","Maybe your jaw will drop as low as mine did upon first hearing Williams speak in “I Feel Pretty,” which opens this weekend. Instead of the velvety innocence that usually accents her on-screen persona, Williams speaks with what co-directors Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein call “high-pitched vocal fry.” It’s an odd confluence of Valley Girl lilt, enunciated baby-speak and spacey stonerisms, further underscored because the character actually fits none of those attributes. Avery, we learn, has an MBA from Wharton and clerked for a Supreme Court justice before taking a leadership post at Lily LeClair.","Coupled with the bamboozled but relentlessly relaxed aura Williams brings to the film, Avery’s flat cadence skirts the dragon-lady stereotype that defines the high-powered fashionistas portrayed by Meryl Streep in “The Devil Wears Prada” and Tilda Swinton in “Trainwreck.” She carries herself with the weight of a feather, gliding along as if oblivious to her surroundings at all times.","Kohn and SIlverstein, longtime creative partners who also penned “Never Been Kissed” and “He’s Just Not That Into You,” had written Avery’s intonation into their script, but they had no idea what Williams would do with it until a couple of weeks before she arrived on set. Williams sent Kohn and Silverstein an NPR story from 2015 about a woman incapable of feeling fear. The woman’s speech, which sounds almost identical to the voice Jenny Slate created for the adorable stop-motion creation Marcel the Shell, was Williams’ inspiration, though the results were still a work in progress when she tested it for Kohn and Silverstein over the phone. They didn’t hear the final version until they went to Williams’ trailer on her first day shooting the movie.","“Truthfully, the thing she did for us on the day in the trailer was not like anything we’d talked about before,” Silverstein said. “It was so much better.”","“We were like, ‘Can you sustain it? How is it to do a voice like that?’” Kohn recalled. “She was like, ’Yes, I got it. I can do it. It’s part of the whole thing.’”","Avery’s wardrobe completes the “whole thing.” Costume designer Debra McGuire, who was attracted to “I Feel Pretty” because its empowerment message works in opposition to the “tight, sexy” clothing she felt obligated to use while working on “Friends” in the ’90s, based Avery’s grandmother (Lauren Hutton) on a cosmetics guru she once knew who dressed head to toe in Chanel. With that in mind, McGuire wanted Avery to put a “fun” twist on high-end fashion, bringing a California ease to the office’s cutthroat New York setting.","Furthermore, Avery and the self-effacing Renee needed to work as complements, not foils à la Streep and Anne Hathaway in “The Devil Wears Prada.” When Renee falls off a SoulCycle bike and knocks her head, her feelings of unworthiness vanish. Convinced she is suddenly thinner and more conventionally beautiful ― “Modeling is an option for me,” she later tells Avery and her colleague (Naomi Campbell) ― Renee encounters a series of contrivances that ultimately lead her to realize she got the job (and a boyfriend) without actually shapeshifting or altering her appearance.","Normally, McGuire would have designed Avery’s attire from scratch. But she didn’t have access to Williams during pre-production, as the actress was filming another movie in Europe (presumably “All the Money in the World,” which Williams shot in Rome immediately before “Pretty”). Instead, McGuire scouted Tom Ford, Dolce & Gabbana and Gucci boutiques. Knowing that Kohn and Silverstein didn’t want Williams to wear the same sort of regalia she dons in real life, McGuire sought an “au current” metropolitan sensibility accentuated by straight, flowing blond locks. “There was an Ivanka Trump vibe going on there,” she said half-jokingly.","That dichotomy ― corporate gloss meets puerile squeal ― is best evidenced in a baby-blue dress Avery wears with pink flowers and golden retrievers all over. A Dolce & Gabanna original that McGuire said was inspired by the designers’ own dogs, the blithe garment reflects Avery’s lifelong struggle to cultivate a personality despite the fact that no one takes her seriously. The movie’s producers first balked at the canine frock, thinking it might be too distracting, but McGuire, who had the directors’ support, wasn’t budging. “That dress was going to be on camera even if I had to stomp over anybody who didn’t want it,” she said. “I felt this was just a perfect place to show part of who this character is because there’s a snobby vibe to the Lily LeClair aesthetic. To come to work in a puppy dress, you’ve gotta be some kind of woman to do that.”","Avery’s accouterments and wispiness mask a crippling insecurity. “I sound like a freaking moron,” she moans in an uncharacteristically candid moment, listing the line items on her astoundingly intellectual biography to prove how belittled she is because of her voice. In the same way that Schumer learns to value her body by the movie’s end, Avery is meant to better understand her place in the class-conscious, image-obsessed world. She is the face of Lily LeClair, but it’s her inability to muster the confidence needed to excel that encourages her to extend the brand to reach more than just snobby rich women. That arc is baked into Williams’ oddities.","“On the first day, she did this one thing where she, like, leaned on her hands together like she was posing for a picture while she was talking,” Silverstein said. “Avery has seen human behavior and tries to emulate it in ways that are not right: ‘Oh, this is what a person would do right now. They would lean on this table as they talk.’ [Williams] really got into that. This is the story of a person of privilege, yet someone who’s grown up with a lot of obstacles in her way and maybe without a lot of personal connections and without a lot of real human interaction. It’s just a really fun thing to watch her do this and find the line.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ad8af452000007d06eb523c.jpeg?cache=2cQQu2iWVs&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"'Glee' Star Kevin McHale Comes Out By The Power Of Ariana Grande","authors":"Cole Delbyck","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/glee-star-kevin-mchale-comes-out-with-a-little-help-from-ariana-grande_us_5ada18a1e4b03c426dae1d4e","short_description":"He's rumored to be dating \"When We Rise\" co-star Austin McKenzie.","date":"2018-04-20"},"articleContent":["“Glee” star Kevin McHale declared that the newly released Ariana Grande song is “gayer” than he is.","The actor, who starred on the musical series as Artie Abrams for six seasons, publicly addressed his sexuality for the first time amid rumors that he’s dating actor Austin McKenzie.","″#NoTearsLeftToCry is gayer than me and I ACCEPT.

Support for the bill was a no-brainer ― it passed unanimously, on a voice vote ― and it made badly needed updates, like banning sexual relationships between members of Congress and their staffers. It also eliminates a requirement that House staffers go through a 30-day counseling and mediation period before filing a workplace complaint.","But the bill has gone nowhere in the Senate since February, and nobody can say when or if similar legislation will move forward. The reason? Some senators don’t like the bill’s requirement that they would have to pay out of pocket if they are found personally liable for harassing or discriminating against employees.","Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), who chairs the rules committee and is involved in negotiations on the bill, said Tuesday that the panel is “trying to come to a conclusion” on the bill.","Asked why it’s been so delayed, he carefully considered his words. “I think anytime you’re dealing with members’ personal liability, you ought to be sure that the members understand what they’re asked to vote on,” he said.","It speaks volumes about the Senate that it’s struggling to pass a bill to make it easier for Capitol Hill victims of sexual harassment or discrimination to file a complaint ― and that it’s because anonymous senators don’t want to have to personally pay for misconduct claims when they are found liable.","The Senate’s inaction comes after a string of lawmakers resigned over allegations of sexual misconduct, including Reps. John Conyers (D-Mich.), Trent Franks (R-Ariz.) and Blake Farenthold (R-Texas), and Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.). Rep. Patrick Meehan (R-Pa.) said in January that he won’t seek re-election after a former female aide said he lashed out at her after she rejected his romantic advances. Meehan called the aide his “soul mate.”","Congress clearly needs to deal with this. Four out of 10 female congressional aides believe sexual harassment is a problem on Capitol Hill, according to a 2016 CQ Roll Call survey. The same survey found that 1 in 6 said they had been personally victimized.","Supporters of the Hill harassment bill thought the Senate would just tuck it into last month’s must-pass omnibus spending package and be done with it. But according to two senior Democratic aides familiar with negotiations on that package, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) refused to roll the harassment bill into it unless they stripped out its provision requiring lawmakers to be personally liable.","“He wanted to do that in order to put it into the omnibus,” said one of the aides. “But [House Minority Leader Nancy] Pelosi and [California Democratic Rep. Jackie] Speier objected to the change.”","McConnell spokesman Don Stewart denied that it was McConnell himself who had problems with that provision. He pointed to a statement previously issued by another McConnell spokesman, David Popp, who said, “Sen. McConnell supports members being personally, financially liable for sexual misconduct in which they have engaged.”","It’s unclear who, exactly, is opposed to this provision. But the Senate’s inaction is infuriating lawmakers in both parties who believe this should not be difficult.","Last month, all 22 female senators of both parties ripped McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) for not making the bill a priority. On Thursday, every male Democratic senator ― plus Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who co-authored the Senate’s version of the harassment bill ― wrote to McConnell demanding action on the issue.","Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), who is the ranking Democrat on the rules committee and involved in negotiations on the bill, expressed optimism that senators would get some version of the bill out the door.","“We are continuing to push on this,” Klobuchar told HuffPost this week. “The letter that we had with all the women senators … I think that was really significant. Let’s just say, it got noticed.”","She said she’s hopeful a bill will be ready “in the next month or two.”","But the longer this bill hangs out there, the less clear it becomes what must-pass bill it can be attached to. And as it gets closer to the November elections, action in the Senate will significantly slow down. That could mean the bill gets delayed even further, or possibly lost in the shuffle of other matters.","Speier, the sponsor of the House bill, said if McConnell truly supports lawmakers paying out of pocket when they harass or discriminate against their staff, it makes no sense why he won’t give her bill a vote now.","“Stop giving us lip service and pass the bill,” Speier said."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ada168a1f0000260616db83.jpeg?cache=DQn3gl3dRK&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"WEIRD NEWS","headline":"Conspiracy Theory Believers Are The Most Skeptical And The Most Gullible People","authors":"Lee Moran","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/reddit-shower-thoughts-april-22-2018_us_5ad9da1de4b029ebe023495b","short_description":"The 25 most profound “Shower Thoughts” on Reddit from the last week.","date":"2018-04-20"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Here Are The Redacted Copies Of The Comey Memos","authors":"Nick Visser","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/comey-memos-released_us_5ad93952e4b0e4d0715ecc05","short_description":"\"He said he was grateful for the conversation, said more nice things about me and how he looks forward to working with me,\" Comey wrote of meeting with Trump.","date":"2018-04-20"},"articleContent":["The Department of Justice released copies of the so-called Comey memos to congressional leaders on Thursday.

I decided it would not be productive to push the subject further.)”","Comey also notes that Trump frequently complimented Comey on his work at the FBI in the early days of his administration, noting that the president at times said “he thought very highly of me” and had “heard I’m doing great.”","At one point, Comey wrote that Trump said he had “serious reservations” about Flynn. “In telling the story, the President pointed his [fingers] at his head and said ‘the guy has serious judgment issues,’” Comey wrote.","Many statements in Comey’s memo are similar to his remarks during the press tour for his recent book, A Higher Loyalty, including that Trump insisted Comey disprove allegations about Russian prostitutes in the Steele dossier.","“The President brought up the ‘Golden Showers thing’ and said it really bothered [him] if his wife had any doubt about it,” Comey recounts in one memo, dated Feb. 8, 2017. “The President said ‘the hookers thing’ is nonsense but that Putin had told him ‘we have some of the most beautiful hookers in the world.’”","Comey also recounted the moment Trump allegedly asked him to drop any investigation into Flynn.","The memos were released just days after House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) threatened to subpoena the DOJ to obtain them. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein had asked for more time to “evaluate the consequences” of their release on Monday.","On Thursday, Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd told lawmakers the DOJ had “consulted the relevant parties and concluded that the release of the memoranda to Congress at this time would not adversely impact any ongoing investigation.”","Read redacted copies of the documents below:"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ad94a3f1e0000741b7b200e.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"CRIME","headline":"'Smallville' Actress Allison Mack Is Charged With Sex Trafficking","authors":"David Moye","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/allison-mack-sex-trafficking_us_5ada4793e4b01c279db44806","short_description":"The actress is accused of recruiting women who were forced to engage in sex with a cult leader.","date":"2018-04-20"},"articleContent":["Actress Allison Mack was charged with sex trafficking on Friday in connection with her alleged involvement in a secret cult in upstate New York.","The FBI arrested Mack in Brooklyn.

The laws date back to 1945, when Allied forces in power after World War II banned the swastika. Even denying the Holocaust is punishable in Germany.","A representative of the public prosecutor’s office told The New York Times that, although they received many complaints and launched an initial probe, the office declined to investigate further since the situation was “clearly covered” and protected under artistic expression laws.","The theater will go ahead with its production of the farce “Mein Kampf,” written by Hungarian dramatist George Tabori in 1987, as planned on Friday ― Hitler’s birthday. Directed by well-known political satirist Serdar Somuncu, the show “begins with the ticket purchase,” according to the production’s website. Those who pay full price have the option to wear a Star of David “as a sign of solidarity with the victims of National Socialist tyranny.”","Those who opt for a free ticket must wear an armband with a swastika during the performance. The armbands will be given out at the entrance to the auditorium and must be returned after the show.","Daniel Morgenroth, spokesman for the theater, said in an interview that the ticket offer was meant to show the fragility of people’s convictions.","“This artistic impulse seeks to show how easily people are corrupted and can be made to wear the symbol of millionfold suffering for saving a few euros,” Morgenroth said.","“Art, if it wants to be relevant, has to be controversial sometimes,” he added.","Members of the Jewish Community of Konstanz argued the show is misusing Nazi symbols to prompt a political discussion, when such conversations could easily start without using the swastika. Group members also are offended the play is planned for Hitler’s birthday. The group has called for a boycott of the show, and asks that the Nazi symbols be removed and that the director engage in talks with the local Jewish community.","“We don’t believe the play or the theater or Serdar Somuncu are anti-Semitic. We just think what they did was not thought through thoroughly,” Arthur Bondarev, vice chairman of the Jewish Community of Konstanz, said in an interview. ″The people who this play concerns were not involved. Holocaust survivors, or at least the Jewish community, were not involved at all.”","The satire on Hitler’s attempts to make it as a young artist in Vienna has been in production since the late 1980s. No previous presentation of the play has included the use of swastika armbands or Stars of David.","“Now, no one is interested in the play, they are only concentrating on the ticket sale gimmick,” Bondarev said. “The only picture that will live on from the production will be of people wearing swastikas.”","The play occurs as anti-Semitism is growing in Germany and other parts of Europe. “Even though they didn’t intend it, they enhance these anti-Semitic structures when they misuse the symbol in this way,” Bondarev said.","Leaders in post-World War II Germany enacted laws banning Nazism and its corresponding symbols. The country also passed measures to safeguard freedoms that the dictator undermined, particularly artistic expression.","In addition to the well-documented Holocaust that is the hallmark of World War II, the Nazis confiscated roughly 16,000 pieces of what they deemed “degenerate art.” In July 1937, the party hosted two art shows in Munich ― one to exhibit art Hitler found acceptable, and another to show the works he deemed immoral. Many of the “degenerate” works were modern and abstract pieces. Works by Jewish artists were also considered “degenerate,” and many of the pieces from the show were burned.","Today, freedom of artistic expression is highly protected in Germany, while symbols of the Nazi era are strictly prohibited.","Still, critics argue that in spite of the legalities, using Nazi symbols in art is unjustified.","“It was always a taboo to use Nazi symbols in an artistic way,” Bondarev said. “Now, the production, of course, kind of broke this taboo. It’s kind of an irony ... but you always had the mutual understanding that you don’t misuse these symbols for artistic reasons ― without further discussion or showing the idea behind it.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ad7c5811e000008087b1e43.jpeg?cache=Ll7H8ZnDFG&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"WORLD NEWS","headline":"Germany Confronts Rising Anti-Semitism After Rap Duo With Holocaust Lyrics Wins Award","authors":"Willa Frej","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/germany-anti-semitic-rap-album-award_us_5ad876c8e4b03c426dabb382","short_description":"The country has experienced an uptick in anti-Semitic incidents in recent months.","date":"2018-04-19"},"articleContent":["Mainstream manifestations of anti-Semitism are causing Germans to take a harder look at what is permissible in the name of artistic expression, after a rap duo whose lyrics some have interpreted as denigratory toward Holocaust victims won a major music award.","Farid Bang and Kollegah’s latest album, “Young, Brutal, Good Looking 3,” won an Echo award, Germany’s equivalent of the Grammys, on April 12 for best hip-hop album.

Several gymnasts claimed that Nassar, who’s been accused of sexually abusing over 260 young athletes under the guise of medical treatment, abused them at the Karolyi Ranch in Hunstville, Texas.","“Any child who was violated by Nassar, it’s a crime and it’s so sad,” Martha Karolyi said, adding that it’s simply “awful.”","This is the first time the couple is speaking out since USA Gymnastics cut ties with the training facility in January. The Karolyi Ranch served as USA Gymnastics’ national team training center since 2001, and was the home for many elite American gymnasts including Aly Raisman, Maggie Nichols and Simone Biles. All three gymnasts, and several others, say Nassar sexually abused them at the training center.","“I heard during the testimonies that some of the parents were in the therapy room with their own child and Larry Nassar was performing this, and the parent couldn’t see,” Martha Karolyi said. “How I could see?”","Some parents did testify during Nassar’s sentencing hearings that they were in the room while the now-disgraced doctor abused their child. Nassar would often position himself in between the parent and child while he sexually abused them. Many also pointed to the institutional giants Nassar worked for, including USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University, as the reason many parents blindly trusted him.","Bela Karolyi added his thoughts during the short segment, telling Guthrie: “The whole thing is just like an explosion, a bomb exploding. Boom.”","While it’s still unclear whether the Karolyis knew of Nassar’s abuse, dozens of athletes allege other forms of abuse took place at the ranch including verbal and emotional abuse, and limiting food intake of athletes during arduous training sessions.","National gymnastics champion and Nassar survivor Mattie Larson explained in her January victim impact statement how the isolation of the Karoyli Ranch fostered a culture that enabled a predator like Nassar.","“The complete detachment from the outside world, on top of careless and neglectful adults, made the ranch the perfect environment for abusers and molesters to thrive,” Larson said.","She later called out Martha: “Martha, did you keep Larry around because he was a good doctor? Or did you really keep him around because he let us compete when we were injured and was willing to keep your secrets?”","Larson described the grueling seven-hour practices six days a week that she and her teammates endured at the ranch, saying she spiraled into a deep depression and a “destructive” eating disorder at 15.

Rising temperatures in 2016 “cooked” swathes of corals, the scientists found, causing the catastrophic die-off of almost 30 percent of the world’s largest coral reef system.","Global warming has already radically — and possibly permanently — transformed the reef’s ecology, according to the study, published Wednesday in the journal Nature. If action is not taken promptly and comprehensively to curb warming, it could be “game over” for the reef, scientists warned.","“It’s catastrophic,” Sarah Perkins-Kirkpatrick, a New South Wales-based climate researcher who was not involved in the new study, told Australia’s ABC News after reviewing the research. “There might have been a glimmer of hope that it wasn’t as bad or might recover faster than we thought. But this paper made the reality very present. The bleaching will forever change the Barrier Reef.”","The extent of the coral die-offs in 2016 — and another severe bleaching event in 2017 — had already been known to scientists, but the new research chronicled specifically how rising temperatures had affected different reef species and the reef’s ecological health at large.","The study’s authors said they were alarmed by their findings.","Though some coral species proved more resilient to rising temperatures, some died much more rapidly than expected.","“The conventional thinking is that after bleaching, corals died slowly of ... starvation. That’s not what we found. We were surprised that about half of the mortality we measured occurred very quickly,” Terry Hughes, the author’s lead author, told The Guardian.","Hughes said some corals, such as branching staghorn corals and table corals, had essentially been “cooked” to death by rising temperatures and had suffered staggering rates of mortality.","“There’s a small number of species that are very robust to heat stress and they’ve survived quite well. On the other hand, the so-called losers [had] mortality rates of 90 percent or more in the worst-affected portion of the reef,” Hughes told ABC News.","With coral bleaching events expected to become ever more frequent as global temperatures rise, populations of these “losers” could struggle to recover and continue to perish en masse. That could prove devastating to reef ecosystems, researchers said.","“Diverse coral communities are needed to have diverse fish and shrimp and crab and worms and all of the other species that live on reefs,” Mark Eakin, one of the study’s authors, told NPR. “So as these events continue into the future, we’re going to see much simpler coral reefs ... and if we don’t take care of the problem of human-caused climate change we’re going to lose a lot of the world’s coral reefs.”","As it stands, the makeup and mix of species of the Great Barrier Reef have already started to change. “That transition is already well underway,” said Hughes.","The study comes as the International Union for Conservation of Nature develops its new Red List of Ecosystems. Hughes said the new research should allow the Great Barrier Reef to be assessed by the IUCN. He said the reef as a whole would likely be classified as “endangered” under the new IUCN framework. This classification could help guide future conservation and governance efforts.","Composed of thousands of individual reefs, the Great Barrier Reef is the world’s largest living structure. Estimated to be 20 million years old, the ancient reef is greater in size than the United Kingdom, Holland and Switzerland combined ― and can be seen from space."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56efbabe1e0000c600710bc5.jpeg?cache=lSCrDo6gOr&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"WOMEN","headline":"The 20 Funniest Tweets From Women This Week","authors":"Hollis Miller","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-20-funniest-tweets-from-women-this-week_us_5ad90bfae4b029ebe02276e9","short_description":"\"Running shoes?

(Spoiler alert!) Instead of simply acting out King’s familiar finale, the teens witness an actual murder when a student is stabbed multiple times on stage unbeknownst to the audience. Leave it to “Riverdale” to turn up the camp and the crazy for a musical episode unlike any we’ve seen before.","The episode came to life thanks to series creator Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, the man who once staged an unauthorized production of the gold-standard “Buffy” musical episode as a Yale drama student. Aguirre-Sacasa actually envisioned “Riverdale” as a musical series in the beginning stages of development. He’s been angling to do a full-blown production ever since.","“Originally, we always thought that there would be a stronger musical element and the kids would do school musicals, but as the show developed, it became more of a crime and noir show,” he told HuffPost. “But, by this point, even the superhero shows had done musical episodes, so I think the network was, like, if we’re letting these shows do it, we better let the show about high school kids do musicals, too.”","Musical episodes on television, much like the high school musicals of real life, have indeed become something of a rite of passage. What was once a set-your-DVR-or-regret-it event is now an increasingly regular milestone for shows including “Buffy the Vampire Slayer,” “Scrubs” and “The Flash.” (Not to mention “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,” which gifts the world with a mini-musical every week.) As a result, it’s never been harder to stand out.","Of course, “Riverdale” slips easily into its new skin as Archie (K.J. Apa), Betty (Lili Reinhart), Veronica (Camila Mendes) and Cheryl (Madelaine Pestch) get in touch with their inner theater kids. The town’s resident fire-starter, Cheryl, takes on the role of Carrie White, a socially ostracized, telekinetic girl repressed by her religious fanatic mother. Betty, naturally, plays good girl Sue Snell, who initially bullies Carrie but succumbs to remorse. Veronica embodies the titular teen’s tormenter, Chris Hargensen. Finally, Archie fits nicely into the boy-next-door slot as Tommy Ross, Carrie’s ill-fated prom date.","Dressed in peak ’70s garb, the musically inclined actors belt their way through 11 songs from the musical, gathering for an especially impressive opening group number, “In,” that requires each of the cast members to show off their singing chops and some serious choreography. Meanwhile, Jughead, not exactly the song-and-dance type, films a behind-the-scenes documentary after actor Cole Sprouse took a hard pass on any musical moments.","“He’s a Broadway Scrooge,” Casey Cott, who plays the musical’s director, Kevin Keller, joked. “I’ve seen him do karaoke, and I’ve seen him dancing on the dance floor. That kid can move.”","Back in 1988, when “Carrie: The Musical” first opened more than a decade after the Brian De Palma film hit theaters, the production closed after a handful of performances due to scathing reviews. ”‘Carrie’ expires with fireworks like the Hindenberg,” a New York Times theater critic wrote in a particularly savage takedown at the time. The show, however, found its audience years later, amassing a cult following that flocked to see revivals in London and Los Angeles.","That audience included Aguirre-Sacasa, a self-professed mega-fan of the “Carrie” story who wrote the screenplay for a tepidly received 2013 movie remake starring Chloë Grace Moretz, which he described as a “very fraught” ordeal.","“It was not the most artistically satisfying or pleasant experience in my career,” he said. “I’ll save you the gory details. It sort of soured me to ‘Carrie.’ I really feel like this musical has allowed me to take it back as something I love and feel good about after years of not feeling good about it.”","Before landing on “Carrie,” Aguirre-Sacasa’s team considered staging other productions, like “Little Shop of Horrors” and “Sweeney Todd.” He even contemplated using songs from an original musical based on Archie Comics characters that he wrote before he was brought on as the company’s chief creative officer in 2014.","“It never got produced, but it has really good songs. I briefly thought if we can’t get the rights to ‘Carrie’ we’ll do ‘Archie: The Musical,’” he said.","But the disastrous prom saga seemed almost tailor-made for the series, which is why Aguirre-Sacasa stuck primarily to script, save for the addition of a few distinctively “Riverdale” flourishes ― mainly that twist ending that revives the mystery of the Black Hood, the town’s believed-to-be-dead serial killer.","The musical is “literally about a girl who goes crazy and kills everybody with blood all down her face,” Cott said. “Cheryl does that, and no one is surprised.”","Overall, the musical feels expertly suited to highlight the series’ biggest draw: the core four characters. In a season paced at break-neck speed, the lion’s share of the “Riverdale” plot has been dedicated to a whirlwind of murder mysteries, mayoral races, long-lost siblings and corruption scandals. This episode gives the series a much-needed chance to breathe by finding crucial moments to revisit some of the relationships that made the show a success in the first place.","In one of the episode’s most inspired plot diversions, Betty sings “You Shine,” a love song featured in the original musical, to Veronica instead of her onstage paramour as a peace offering after a particularly nasty fight.","“Even though there’s this big shocking ending, the musical allows us to focus more exclusively on the friendships, which we don’t always get to do because we are so frantically telling other stories,” Aguirre-Sacasa said.","As “Riverdale” rockets off toward the season finale, perhaps that’s the lesson it should take to heart ahead of Season 3. (Netflix recently picked up two seasons of a “Sabrina the Teenage Witch” spinoff, too.) Sure, the show thrives on crazy plot twists (remember: the town was founded on maple syrup blood money, after all), but how it builds upon the iconic characters of comic book lore in new and interesting ways will always be its lifeblood.","And should the musical experiment prove to be a success, the powers that be have every intention of making this a tradition for the show that has no incentive to stick to form.","“Every week ‘Riverdale’ is something different,” Aguirre-Sacasa said. “One week, it’s a serial killer show or ‘The Godfather’ in a small town and the next it’s a political thriller or a homage to ‘The Wrestler.’”","“The show is naturalistic, but it also exists in this weird area where the musical episode comes in and makes total sense,” Cott added. “It’s not all ‘Glee’ or flashy. It’s actually really weird and such a ‘Riverdale’ story.”","As for who might take the reins the next time around, Cott has some suggestions: “One day we’ll get Cole into a musical episode. In Season 3, he can be the lead.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ad78fcb1e000008087b1e03.jpeg?cache=bGRYlt402m&ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Why Kris Kobach Was Found In Contempt For Not Clarifying To People That They Could Vote","authors":"Sam Levine","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kris-kobach-contempt_us_5ad8d5fce4b03c426dac6519","short_description":"A federal judge said the Kansas secretary of state didn't do what he was ordered to do to make sure people knew they were eligible.","date":"2018-04-19"},"articleContent":["Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R) was found in contempt of court on Wednesday for not following a court order to fully inform thousands of Kansans that they were eligible to vote.","U.S. District Judge Julie Robinson, a George W. Bush appointee, rebuked Kobach ― who is running for Kansas governor and was in charge of President Donald Trump’s voter fraud commission ― in her finding and demanded he pay attorneys fees associated with the motion to hold him in contempt. The finding also underscores how Kobach wrought confusion in the state and neglected to make sure that thousands of eligible voters knew they were allowed to cast a ballot.","This confusion affected people like Tad Stricker, who wanted to make sure his Kansas voter registration was valid ahead of the 2016 presidential election. He had registered in the state two years earlier but was humiliated when he went to vote in the 2014 elections and was told he needed to cast a provisional ballot because he wasn’t on the voter rolls. Kansas law in 2014 required people to bring proof of citizenship when they registered to vote, and state officials said Stricker failed to do so when he registered at the Department of Motor Vehicles that year.","Robinson blocked that law in 2016. She ordered Kobach to make sure that the approximately 18,000 people whose registration status was uncertain were fully registered and allowed to vote. Robinson also told Kobach that affected voters should be sent postcards confirming their eligibility to vote and telling them their polling places.","But Kobach also didn’t update the state’s election manual to reflect that people didn’t have to prove their citizenship to register to vote, leaving state election officials without clear guidance to inform confused constituents.","Stricker says he called his local election office in Sedgwick County before the 2016 election and asked to confirm that he was fully registered, but that the person on the other end of the phone told him his status was unclear. Stricker says he was told there were a lot of legal issues up in the air.","Stricker and his fellow plaintiffs, who are represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, say the Kansas law that was put on hold in 2016 violates the National Voter Registration Act. The law says state motor vehicle agencies must offer people a chance to register to vote and can only ask them for the minimum amount of information necessary to do so.","At a trial held about the issue in March, Kobach argued the law was necessary to prevent noncitizens from voting. He presented 129 cases of noncitizens trying to vote since 2000 but has said there could be thousands of them on the rolls. Several studies have shown voter fraud is not a widespread problem.","Plaintiffs argued that Kobach could have assuaged confusion after the 2016 order by updating the state elections manual to reflect that people did not need to prove their citizenship when they went to register at the DMV. Instead, he took down the document altogether, saying that Robinson’s order did not amount to final law and that the manual was continuously informally updated. Bryan Caskey, the state’s election director and a Kobach staffer, also testified that he was “too busy” to update the document.","Robinson fired back at that rationale, noting that Kobach had amended the document in 2012 to reflect the proof of citizenship law.","“This publication is the policy and training Bible for the 105 county election officials,” she wrote. “Given that the Court’s preliminary injunction was issued almost two years ago in May 2016, four years after the last revision, the Court does not find credible Defendant’s rationale for not amending the document.”","Local Kansas election officials are responsible for sending out the postcards to registered voters, and different counties have different practices for how they send them out. But Kobach is responsible for making sure that all the officials are complying with the law.","Kansans rely on these postcards to confirm they’re registered to vote and to tell them where they’re registered.","“The postcard is considered by traditional in Kansas to be the way you know you’re fully registered to vote,” Margaret Ahrens, the former president of the Kansas League of Women Voters, testified during the trial. “It’s because it’s traditional. ... That is the way we think about being fully registered in Kansas. The postcard is significant.”","Kansas had previously sent letters to anyone who failed to prove their citizenship when registering to vote, informing them that their registration was incomplete. But after the order, Kobach was required to send affected voters a new notice to let them know they could disregard any previous notices telling them they weren’t fully registered and that they could look up their polling place online.","This meant that thousands of voters who thought they had registered in the state received two official letters telling them completely contradictory information.

Brown demanded that his state’s troops focus solely on fighting criminal gangs, human trafficking and the smuggling of drugs and firearms. He turned down the administration’s initial terms for deploying the National Guard, Trump administration officials said Monday.","Brown said on Wednesday that the federal government had agreed to fund his plan for the troop deployment, and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen tweeted her thanks to the governor that evening.

California is home to the nation’s largest population of undocumented immigrants, and has a so-called “sanctuary” law that limits police cooperation with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, although police do turn individuals over to the federal government in certain instances.","The president ordered the border deployment of National Guard troops earlier this month in response to an uptick in apprehensions at the boundary.

Carver County Attorney Mark Metz said the drug was contained within counterfeit Vicodin pills found around the singer’s Paisley Park compound outside Minneapolis.","Authorities could not determine who provided Prince with the deadly pills.","“In all likelihood, Prince had no idea he was taking a counterfeit pill that could kill him,” Metz said. No suspect emerged, he said, during the “painstaking and thorough” investigation by the Carver County Sheriff’s Office, which was coordinated with “several federal, state and local agencies.”","Prince had been addicted to pain medication for years and was dealing with it privately, according to Metz. The county attorney stated that Prince’s doctor, Michael Schulenberg, had prescribed him the painkiller Percocet, but that medication does not contain fentanyl, the substance that ultimately killed the singer.","Schulenberg’s lawyer has challenged the claim that he ever prescribed opioids ― a classification that includes Percocet ― to Prince or “to any other person with the intent that they would be given to Prince.”","Authorities found a “significant number” of pain pills hidden all over Paisley Park in bottles other than their original pharmacy containers, Metz confirmed.","“Prince’s death is a tragic example that prescription opioid addictions and deaths do not discriminate,” he said.","On April 21, 2016, the singer was found unresponsive in an elevator at Paisley Park, where he maintained an elaborate recording studio.

Tammy Duckworth and her new baby. What about the millions of women still waiting for help?","date":"2018-04-19"},"articleContent":["After years of failing to do anything to help new mothers in this country, the U.S. Senate finally got it together to help one woman on Wednesday ― a fellow senator.","Legislators voted unanimously to allow infants on the Senate floor during votes. The measure was crafted for Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), who recently had a baby, becoming the first senator to give birth while in office. Duckworth isn’t officially taking a maternity leave, she said, because that would mean she’d be prohibited from voting during her time off. She wanted to figure out a way to be present for important work and still breastfeed. Her colleagues made it happen. There were some ridiculous grumblings, but many lawmakers appear quite proud of the new rule.","“Being a parent is a difficult job, and the Senate rules shouldn’t make it any harder,” said Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), chairman of the Rules Committee.","It was a rare female-friendly move from a deliberative body dominated by men ― and it was hard not to delight in the sight of Duckworth bringing her newborn to the Senate floor on Thursday. After all, it wasn’t long ago that the women of the Senate didn’t even have a place to pee.","Still, forgive me for not wildly cheering.","While these senators snapped into action to solve a work-family issue for one of their peers, they’ve left millions of American families twisting in the wind for years. The United States is the only developed country that does not offer paid maternity leave to new mothers; we’re one of only a handful of nations on the planet that offers new moms essentially bupkis.","It’s cool that the Senate made something happen in this instance. Duckworth herself spoke of “leading by example.” But the nation’s women are still waiting for their turn.","“Great that the Senate has unanimously agreed to stop banning babies from the floor,” said Ellen Bravo, the director of Family Values @ Work, a nonprofit coalition of groups pushing for paid parental and sick leave in the U.S. “Surely now a majority can agree to paid family and medical leave insurance for all working families, so no one has to face financial disaster for being a good caregiver.”","Many high-income women can access paid leave through their jobs, but women at the lower end of the pay scale are less lucky. And the lack of leave is brutally punishing.","Far too many women must return to work quickly after giving birth, and the consequences are devastating. Women who go back to work too soon are more likely to experience depression, and less likely to breastfeed. Their babies can also suffer. Researchers have even found an inverse correlation between the amount of leave a woman takes and infant mortality rates.","Almost no one, of course, is letting women bring their infants to work with them. That’s just not going to fly. Imagine your Starbucks barista snuggling an infant while she makes a latte. Not feasible.","Many of these new mothers are stuck running out to the car with a breast pump on their breaks, or giving up on breastfeeding altogether, running on far too little sleep and fumes of empathy from their equally overworked colleagues.","Some women can’t go back to work quickly, since giving birth often comes with complications. And some lose their jobs simply because they’ve had a baby. Many workers do get job protection through the federal Family and Medical Leave Act ― the law that Congress begrudgingly passed 25 years ago that offers unpaid time off to new parents and caregivers. But the law doesn’t cover all workers. This means many women, out of work, are forced onto public benefits simply because they’ve had a child.","Lack of leave doesn’t just hurt individuals. The whole economy suffers because women are forced out of the labor market. It’s no coincidence that the percentage of women who participate in the U.S. labor market is among the lowest of all democratic countries. Motherhood also helps drive the wage gap between men and women in this country.","It’s not like the Senate lacks for ideas on how to fix this. There are a couple of bills floating around, from legislators on both sides of the aisle, that address the issue.","Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) is looking at a proposal that would basically have new parents tap into Social Security money to float leave. It’s a bad idea that would weaken the social safety net, according to a report released Wednesday from the Urban Institute. However, it is a flashing sign that even conservatives who deplore government spending want to do something. Even President Donald Trump ― hardly known for his feminist agenda ― has mentioned the need for paid leave twice in major speeches.","On the Democratic side, most legislators are into the FAMILY Act, which Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) first proposed in 2013, and which would fund leave for new parents, as well as those who need to care for a sick relative or handle their own illness, through a small payroll tax.","Paid leave is not controversial. Most Americans want this. According to a Pew study from last year, 82 percent of Americans say mothers should receive paid time off after the birth or adoption of a child. Sixty-nine percent want leave for fathers, too.","Increasingly, states and cities are taking the lead on leave. California, New Jersey and Rhode Island have laws that look a lot like Gillibrand’s FAMILY Act. My home state, New York, just started offering paid time off to new parents. And twice a month, the state takes a small amount out of our paychecks to make that happen ― about $1 a week, on average. The amount deducted depends on your income.","Hardly a punishing tax increase, particularly considering the Senate just gave most of the country a big tax cut."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ad8e37a2000001311eb5294.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Will Smith Does A Bonkers Impression Of Michael Jackson","authors":"Ron Dicker","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/will-smith-michael-jackson-impression_us_5ad85d94e4b0e4d0715d7fc6","short_description":"The actor recalled his bizarre meeting in a closet with the King of Pop.","date":"2018-04-19"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"QUEER VOICES","headline":"Teacher Says Series Of Homophobic Threats Drove Him To Quit His Job","authors":"Curtis M.

Hill posted images of the three letters, all of which were sent anonymously, to his Facebook page on Tuesday.","“Homosexuals should not be teaching our kids, in fact I don’t believe they should be teachers at all they are perverts and predators. ... You need to be fired and you can take your gay ideas with you,” one letter reads.","Another says, “Queers will burn and so will you. Don’t think my friends and I still ain’t after you.”","Hill, who is a Kansas native and father of two, announced his resignation and move to Palm Springs, California, in the same Facebook post, which had received more than 2,700 shares as of Thursday afternoon.","Hill, who had taught in the school district since 2009, told HuffPost that he took the first letter to the administration “immediately” after receiving it. “Initially I felt supported,” he said. “But that support waned as time wore on.”","The teacher said the second and third letters ― both of which mentioned his work as a teacher ― were sent to his home address, after which he contacted local law enforcement. Although Hill called their response “a bit lackluster,” he acknowledged, “I understand that there was not much to go on due to the anonymity of the letters with no return address. It was more of an incident report.”","A culprit or culprits in the alleged incidents have not been identified, according to The Topeka Capital-Journal.","In January, after he said he’d received the second letter, Hill began seven weeks of unpaid medical leave, which he said was “related to the threats and stress created by the situation.”","When the third letter arrived while he was on leave, he said, “I knew it was time to go. I couldn’t continue to stay in a situation that was causing me so much stress and anxiety.”","Darrel Kohlman, superintendent of the Nemaha Central Unified School District 115, told HuffPost that Hill’s resignation was “a loss” for the school. Still, he stressed there was “no indication” that the letters came from a student, a staff member or anyone else with direct ties to Nemaha Central High.","“Michael was, and is, a very good art teacher. This, by no means, was something that we wanted to happen,” Kohlman said.","“Any incidents that we thought had any connection to the school, we did address, and would’ve continued to had Michael come back and completed the year,” the superintendent continued. Noting that Nemaha Central aims to “teach our students about tolerance,” he added, “We felt like we were supporting him in doing what we could do.”","Hill, however, disputes this. “I think there were options put forth to the administration and school board that would have been agreeable and not costly to the district, but they chose not to go that route,” he said. Weighing what he could do ― “return to the school knowing full well that the perpetrator had not been identified, be terminated for failing to complete my contract, or resign” ― he said he decided to leave.","LGBTQ advocacy group Equality Kansas shared Hill’s Facebook post to its page on Thursday. The group said his case served to emphasize the fact that Kansas has no anti-discrimination laws that cover sexual orientation and gender identity.","“This is why we fight,” Equality Kansas wrote. “This is the environment created by lawmakers and others who see us as second-class citizens ― or less.”","Now happily in California, Hill said he hopes his story will make people “think about the way they treat other people.”","“The LGBTQ community is facing a backlash from a sector in our country and we can’t stop fighting for equality,” he said. “If my story can help in the fight or help encourage one person to be true to themselves, it’s a story worth telling.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ad8faa12000007d06eb52bd.jpeg?cache=vCLjwNdnom&ops=crop_0_52_526_470%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Here's The First Look At 'Crazy Rich Asians' And It's Pure Gold","authors":"Kimberly Yam","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/heres-the-first-look-at-crazy-rich-asians-movie-and-its-pure-gold_us_5ad8c2cee4b03c426dac4a72","short_description":"👑👑👑","date":"2018-04-19"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"SCIENCE","headline":"SpaceX Rocket Blasts Off Carrying NASA's New Planet-Hunting Telescope","authors":"Joey Roullette, Reuters","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/spacex-launch-tess-satellite_us_5ad83219e4b03c426dab4e24","short_description":"The telescope is designed to detect worlds beyond our solar system that might be capable of harboring life.","date":"2018-04-19"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"QUEER VOICES","headline":"Doctor Dismisses British Man's Claims That Medication Made Him Gay","authors":"Curtis M.

Now some urban","date":"2018-04-19"},"articleContent":["Small rural school districts have long sought to save money and attract teachers by dropping a school day. Now some urban districts are making the switch.","By Sophie Quinton","The public school in Campo, Colorado, hasn’t required all its students to come to class on Fridays for nearly two decades. The 44-student district dropped a weekday to boost attendance and better attract teachers to a town so deep in farm country that the nearest grocery store is more than 20 miles away.","“I think the four-day week helped us, initially, in recruiting teachers,” the superintendent, Nikki Johnson, said. “Now that so many districts are on four-day, that’s not much of an incentive.”","No national database tracks the number of public schools that cram instructional hours into four days. But the schedule — long popular in rural Western communities — is becoming more common elsewhere as school leaders search for ways to both attract teachers and save money.","In Oklahoma, for instance, where teachers recently staged a walkout to demand more school funding, cash-strapped districts have been using four-day weeks to cope with a teacher shortage and state budget cuts. Last school year, 97 districts of 513 ran on the compressed schedule, nearly twice as many as the previous year.","Shorter school weeks are generally popular among families, students and teachers, and many school districts say the change saves money and makes it easier to recruit teachers. But the research is inconclusive: Shorter school weeks save only a little, according to education policy researchers. The impact on staffing hasn’t been well studied, and results are mixed on whether cramming a week’s worth of learning into four days helps or hurts students’ learning.","And the changes aren’t universally popular. Critics say four-day weeks hurt working families who have to scramble to find child care and could prevent children from accessing free or low-cost meals five days a week. A recent study found that juvenile crime rates were higher in parts of Colorado where schools didn’t meet on Fridays.","Still, over half of Colorado’s public school districts have permission from the state to compress their schedule. Most such districts are small and rural, but that’s changing. A suburban district near Denver and an urban district in Pueblo have recently grabbed headlines by announcing that they plan to switch to four-day weeks in the fall.","Little is known about how urban districts will adapt to the new schedule. But rural districts that make the switch rarely go back, said Georgia Heyward, a research analyst for the Center on Reinventing Public Education at the University of Washington Bothell who has studied four-day school weeks in rural areas.","Once parents, students and teachers adjust to the new schedule, they tend to like it — and the community adjusts around it. “Once a couple of the districts start to go to the four-day week, then there’s pressure, not only not to go back, but for neighboring districts to adopt the schedule as well,” Heyward said.","More Districts Drop a School Day","In some districts, schools have been meeting four days a week for decades. The schedule gained fresh popularity in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, when districts responded to budget cuts by shedding a day.","Today school districts in parts of 22 states use a four-day week, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. For districts to do so, states need to enact legislation that allows schools to count instructional time by the hour, rather than by the week. States west of the Mississippi are more likely to have schools on a four-day schedule.","The state legislatures group estimates that close to 300 school districts nationwide are using the shorter weeks, but Heyward puts the number higher, at 470 districts or more. There are more than 13,500 U.S. school districts.","In Colorado, more than twice as many districts have state approval to hold a four-day week, compared to two decades ago. The typical district with state permission to create an alternate schedule for all its schools has fewer than 250 students, according to a Stateline analysis of state data.","To deliver the required number of instructional hours in four days, schools in the state typically add an hour and a half to each remaining day, according to Colorado’s latest information manual on four-day school weeks. Some districts only use the compressed schedule in the winter.","Chris Fiedler, the superintendent of Denver-area School District 27J, has said that he first thought of dropping a school day while crunching budget numbers. The district recently announced that it will not hold classes on Mondays next year.","The average district can save up to 5 percent of its budget by dropping a school day, according to a 2011 report from the Education Commission of the States, a Denver-based policy research organization.","But the switch doesn’t put a dent in districts’ largest line item: teacher pay and benefits. And, the report found, while four-day weeks can save money on operational expenses, such as heating and cooling, in many cases districts don’t save as much as they could because they keep schools open on the fifth day to host sporting events, tutoring programs, and teacher professional development workshops.","District 27J could save up to $1 million a year with its new schedule, said the district’s public information officer, Tracy Rudnick, in an email — that’s less than 1 percent of its budget. But the district has other reasons for making the switch. “Cost savings were never our number one goal. It is about retaining high-quality teachers and creating a clean, clear and concise schedule.”","The district is among the lowest-funded in the Denver area, with the lowest teacher salaries, said Kathey Ruybal, president of the Brighton Education Association, the local teachers union. “We get a lot of new teachers here and there, but we tend to lose them to our neighbor districts.” School leaders hope three-day weekends could convince more teachers to stay.","The new schedule will make teachers’ lives easier in other ways, Ruybal said. They’ll have more time to plan lessons over the weekend and more time to collaborate during the school day. “We’re really hoping that it’s going to improve our teaching, improve our student achievement scores,” she said.","Surveys generally show support for four-day weeks among parents and teachers, according to districts, states and education researchers who have asked adults about the schedule. In rural communities, where students travel long distances for sports games, academic competitions and doctors appointments, it can be efficient to set aside a weekday for extracurricular and family activities, according to the Colorado four-day week information manual.","Some businesses love the schedule, too. In the 1980s, one Colorado resort pushed the local school district to drop a day so teenagers would be able to work on Fridays, said Antonio Parés, a partner at the Colorado-based Donnell-Kay Foundation, which focuses on improving public education in the state.","Learning Outcomes Aren’t Clear","Dropping a school day can create new challenges for communities, however, and it’s not clear whether students benefit. Since District 27J announced its plan to drop Monday classes, parents have crowded information sessions with questions and flooded social media with comments.","“Worst idea ever,” one mother commented on 27J’s Facebook post announcing the change. She said it would be hard to get her three young children — one of whom has autism — to school at the new, earlier start time, and she’s worried the longer days will leave them exhausted. Other parents praised the new schedule.","So many parents expressed concerns about finding child care on Mondays that 27J has announced a child care program that will cost $30 for the day. Seven hundred children have pre-registered, Ruybal said.","In most Colorado communities with four-day schools, however, “the issue of baby-sitting seems to be a wash,” the state information manual says. That’s because with the longer school day, children get home closer to when their parents do. Parents may find it no more difficult to find child care for a full day than for a few hours every afternoon, the manual says.","Some studies find that the compressed schedule has no effect on test scores. Others find a positive effect. “We don’t really know how much academic outcomes are impacted,” Heyward said.","She said districts may improve their outcomes after a schedule change because teachers have to rethink instruction. Teachers have more time to plan on the weekends and more time to lead students through hands-on activities during longer weekday class blocks.","In Oklahoma, the superintendent of public instruction, Joy Hofmeister, backed legislation that would have required districts to explain to the state why they need a four-day schedule before adopting one. With advance notice, the state could better help districts plan for the change, for instance by making sure they still complied with special education requirements, she told the Tulsa World at the time. The bill didn’t pass.","And in California, 2013 legislation revokes a school’s authority to operate on a four-day schedule if test scores fail to meet targets. Washington and Minnesota have similar laws on the books, Heyward said.","A shorter schedule might have a different effect in urban districts than in rural ones. While most Pueblo teachers support the district’s decision to drop Friday classes, according to the teachers union, the Pueblo Education Association, some worry the change might harm their students from mostly low-income, Hispanic families.","Will Robinson, a teacher at a middle school on the east side of the city, said his students live in neighborhoods plagued by gang violence. His school has state permission to meet for longer school days and a longer school year in a bid to improve test scores and keep students safe. “We can work around it,” he said of the district’s plan to switch to a four-day schedule. “We just worry about where our students are going on Fridays.”","Another concern is how to make sure students are fed on Fridays, said Suzanne Ethredge, the head of the Pueblo Education Association. Almost 4 out of 5 students in the district qualify for free or subsidized school meals. Schools might continue to offer lunch services on Fridays, or community groups — such as a library that offers lunch to children during the summer — might step in to make sure students are fed, she said. The district is still working out the details.","Some districts on a four-day schedule have found creative ways to occupy students on the fifth day. Heyward said that she’s come across districts that help high school students by setting up internships, providing extra tutoring, or encouraging enrollment in community college classes.","This year the Campo School District is using a Donnell-Kay Foundation grant to pilot “Fab Fridays,” a full day of optional art, music, dance, cooking and theater activities led by teachers and members of the community, such as the local Elvis impersonator and his wife, who taught students to line dance.","Teachers who work the extra day are getting stipends to compensate them for their time, though superintendent Johnson said many of them would be happy to help without the extra money.","Fifth-day activities, like after-school activities, can offer students a rich set of learning experiences, Heyward said. The question is whether districts on a four-day schedule can afford them. “These are all districts that are struggling financially, or they wouldn’t even consider moving to this schedule,” she said.","Stateline home page","Sign up for exclusive state policy reporting and research"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ad7522f1f00002a0616d78f.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Marco Rubio Had An Odd Explanation For Changing His Position On A Trump Nominee","authors":"Igor Bobic","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/marco-rubio-nominations-bridenstine_us_5ad8d0fde4b029ebe0221370","short_description":"The senator voted to confirm a NASA administrator he initially opposed.","date":"2018-04-19"},"articleContent":["WASHINGTON ― Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) offered a curious explanation for his vote to confirm Rep. Jim Bridenstine as the next NASA chief after initially opposing Bridenstine’s nomination.","The Oklahoma Republican narrowly won confirmation Thursday after having served on the House Science, Space and Technology subcommittee that oversees the agency. But Bridenstine’s nomination by President Donald Trump last year generated bipartisan opposition because of his partisan reputation and his lack of a scientific background.","Rubio at the time expressed concern that the congressman’s “political baggage” would weigh him down and tar an admired organization that has traditionally “been free of politics.”","But on Thursday the senator changed his tune. Addressing the flip, Rubio argued that NASA couldn’t afford a prolonged vacancy if the Senate was unable to act this week ― a fair enough concern.","But then the senator launched into another explanation. Opening with a spiel about the Senate’s constitutional power of advice and consent, Rubio then landed on this:","It is my view that the more important the job, the more discretion the president deserves. That’s why I decided to support [Rex] Tillerson. ... And it’s what led me to decide to support Congressman Bridenstine despite my reservations.","It’s an odd position for someone in a co-equal branch of government to take. Not only does the opposite seem true ― the more important a nomination, the more scrutiny it deserves from the Senate ― but Rubio himself took the contrary position on... Rex Tillerson.","“My view is that the president deserves wide latitude in our nominations. But the more important the position is, the less latitude they have,” Rubio told reporters last January, after grilling Tillerson during his confirmation hearing to be secretary of state.","“It’s like a cone,” Rubio added. “It’s really wide in some positions — as it gets higher and higher, the discretion becomes more limited and our scrutiny should become higher. And I consider [secretary of state] the highest of them all.”","By that standard, Rubio would have felt less compelled to confirm Tillerson, whose post ranked far higher than the one Bridenstine is assuming. But he ended up voting for both.","The topic of nominations has been politically divisive in recent years, with members of both parties taking advantage of the rights of the minority to stymie and block a president’s Cabinet and judicial picks. In 2013, then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) had to force a change in filibuster rules in order to approve President Barack Obama’s executive and judicial nominees after years of unified GOP obstruction ― including to the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Labor, the National Labor Relations Board and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.","Republicans, including Trump, are now accusing Democrats of similarly slow-walking executive and judicial nominations ― even though the threshold for those is now only 50 votes.","Sarah Binder, a professor of political science at George Washington University, said that while both parties have engaged in the politics of obstruction, one party deserved more blame than the other.","“Any norm of deference to the president for executive branch nominees (‘his team’) was nearly shredded by Republicans during the Obama years,” she said. “Past GOP presidents have faced difficulty at times getting their nominees confirmed (John Bolton comes to mind). But by sheer numbers, past GOP presidents have faced far less obstruction of their ‘teams’ than past Democratic presidents.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ad900761f0000260616d9f9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Obama Profiles Parkland Survivors For TIME's '100 Most Influential' List","authors":"Hayley Miller","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obama-parkland-survivors_us_5ad8aed2e4b029ebe021cadd","short_description":"The high school students \"are shaking us out of our complacency.”","date":"2018-04-19"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Missouri Gov.

In an apparently unrelated case, Hawley has called for Greitens to resign amid allegations of sexual misconduct.","On Tuesday, the attorney general said that his office had uncovered “evidence of potential criminal acts of wrongdoing” stemming from Greitens’ acquisition of an electronic donor list. Hawley suggested there was reason to think Greitens had unlawfully used that list, which he obtained from a Missouri nonprofit called The Mission Continues, to raise funds for his own political purposes.","“[Greitens] did all of this without permission of The Mission Continues,” Hawley said at a Tuesday morning press conference. “This is known as computer tampering.

Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.) for previously renting a condo from campaign donors who are executives at a defense contractor that lobbies the federal government.","The complaint, a copy of which HuffPost obtained Wednesday, also alleges that DeSantis paid “well below” fair market value to stay at the condo, though that appears inaccurate.","Attorney Richard Ruben of Miami filed the complaint with the Office of Congressional Ethics on April 6. Here’s a copy:","The complaint comes after Kent Stermon and Matt Connell, both executives at defense contractor Total Military Management, rented out a condo to DeSantis for five months in 2016.","The two of them and a political action committee tied to their company have given more than $53,000 to DeSantis’ congressional campaigns, according to campaign finance records.","It certainly doesn’t seem appropriate for a member of Congress to rent a condo from top campaign donors who lobby the federal government. Total Military Management has spent between $50,000 and $190,000 per year lobbying Congress on defense-related issues over the past six years. DeSantis is the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Relations Committee’s subcommittee on national security, which oversees the Defense Department, among other things.","But it’s not clear to HuffPost that DeSantis violated any House rules.","Lawmakers are not allowed to accept “gifts,” and Ruben says DeSantis may have broken this rule by paying $2,000 a month to stay at the Florida condo. Ruben claims he talked to a realtor in the area who told him the cost to rent similar condos is $2,500 to $2,800.","“I am troubled that Rep. DeSantis was potentially gifted, by a close campaign contributor and lobbyist, a condominium to reside in, at well below fair market value,” reads the complaint. “I, as well as all of Rep. DeSantis’s past, current and future constituents, are led to question what exactly Rep. DeSantis promised these campaign contributors and lobbyists in exchange for receiving such a sweetheart deal.”","But it does not appear that DeSantis paid less than he should have. Zillow’s estimate for renting that condo is $2,000 a month. Another similar condo in the building is listed at $1,695 a month.","DeSantis is currently running for governor, and his spokesman says Ruben’s complaint is “a politically motivated smear tactic.”","“This should really be a story about how people use the ethics complaint system to unfairly attack office holders and then use bogus complaints that they know won’t go anywhere in campaign advertising,” said DeSantis campaign manager Brad Herold.","It’s not clear who Ruben filed the complaint on behalf of, or if he filed it on behalf of himself. Reached by HuffPost, he would not answer any questions.","“I can’t talk about it,” Ruben said before hanging up the phone. “I’m sorry.”","Herold speculated that Ruben could be filing the complaint on behalf of a right-wing group called Uncle Sam’s Misguided Children, which describes itself as “community founded by United States Marine Veterans to bring awareness of the lame stream media.” The group has made absurd and false claims about DeSantis’ voting record on immigrants and food stamps.","Herold also said that DeSantis was friends with Connell before he entered politics and that Total Military Management “has never lobbied DeSantis or his office on any issue.”","Reached by HuffPost, Stermon, too, said he and Connell have been friends with DeSantis “for a long time” and that neither of them is a lobbyist.","“Ron DeSantis has never involved himself on a single issue impacting our business,” Stermon said in an email. “We have intentionally always just tried to be nothing but a friend to Ron in an atmosphere where it is hard to have true friends.”","That may be true.

The Jackson Public School District was experiencing a shortage of certified teachers and there was a desperate need for qualified former instructors.","“I hadn’t thought about returning to the classroom, but when I heard they needed certified teachers that badly, I had to help,” said Thompson, who won numerous awards during her career as an English, speech and drama teacher in Mississippi and Wisconsin. “I called and got the information and a few weeks later I was back in the classroom.”","Thompson, 70, is among a small cadre of retired educators who returned to Jackson classrooms for the 2017-18 school year to teach science, math and English, the courses for which the school district has the direst need. She is currently teaching 11th grade English at Jackson’s historic Lanier High School, marking the first time the school has had a licensed 11th grade English teacher in four and a half years, she said. Thompson teaches three 90-minute periods per day — equal to six classes.","Freddrick Murray, who has been serving as Jackson Public Schools’ interim superintendent since November 2016, said he issued the call for retired teachers because the school district has had difficulty attracting adequate numbers of certified instructors. The problem is so significant, educators said, that many of Jackson’s schools depend on long-term uncertified substitutes to augment the teacher rolls. The school district has 58 schools, 1,800 teachers and about 26,000 students. There are 184 long-term subs working in Jackson schools this year, according to JPS spokesman Sherwin Johnson.","“Even with the retirees coming in, there is still a serious shortage,” said Bishop Ronnie Crudup, senior pastor of New Horizon Church International of Jackson and a member of the Better Together Commission, a group formed to spur school improvements in Jackson. “It’s a huge challenge and there doesn’t seem to be an end in sight.”","Forty-eight retired educators are working in the schools this school year, according to Johnson. The school district wants to hire dozens of teachers.","Rural school districts across Mississippi and around the country are facing similar staffing challenges, often made more difficult by their remoteness. Alvin Thornton, former chair of the Maryland Commission on Education Finance, Equity, and Excellence, said bringing back retired teachers may be a good temporary fix for urban and rural districts alike, but it should not be considered a solution. The Maryland group, known as the Thornton Commission, was created to equalize educational opportunities and funding for students in Maryland’s 25 public school districts.","“What states have to do is invest in more well-funded teacher colleges,” he said. “There need to be incentive programs that offer people who go teach in low-income or rural areas inducements starting with [free] tuition and subsidization of expenses such as housing, etc.”","He added public school districts also need to get back to the basics that will make them successful: well-paid teachers who live in the communities where they work, small classes and parents and community members who are involved in children’s education.","In Jackson, Geraldine Bender, president of the Mississippi chapter of the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), said the district loses teachers to better-paying neighboring school districts and nearby states such as Texas, Georgia and Tennessee.","Among the reasons why pay is not competitive, she said, is a state legislature that “does not care a whole lot about funding inner city schools.” Suburban school districts are growing as Jackson families leave the city, in part because of concern about the underfunded schools, she added.","Murray, the interim superintendent, said JPS has been underfunded for years. According to JPS spokesman Sherwin Johnson, “the current [Mississippi Adequate Education Program] formula uses a base student cost of $5,381.52; at the current funding level … our actual funding is at $4,882.77 base student cost” — a difference that puts the district $498.75 in the hole for every student enrolled, a deficit that runs into the millions.","The shortage negatively impacts students and teachers alike, said Bender, of the AFT.","“For the students, it’s a situation of ‘Am I getting the best education because I have a sub in the classroom instead of a certified teacher?’” Bender said. “For the teachers, it’s class overload. You are working without an assistant and you have 35 students in a classroom, for example a French class or a math class or a science class. You are expected to reach each of those 35 students every class period. That’s an awesome task.”","JPS has recruited retirees by increasing financial incentives. The district pays them $225 per day, up from $125 per day previously. But hiring retirees is an imperfect solution to the district’s staffing woes; some retired teachers can only work for half a year or they’ll lose their retirement benefits. Others, like Hymethia Thompson, came out of retirement to teach, trading their retirement pay for a regular salary based on their education level and years of experience.","That’s why Murray said Jackson is also stepping up efforts to hire new teachers by increasing starting pay and offering curriculum support and professional development opportunities. The school district offered a signing bonus of $2,500 for teachers who were hired this school year, he said. School district officials are also attending job fairs and aggressively pursuing students coming out of college education programs, he added.","The teacher shortage resulted, in part, from the retirement of a number of teachers in recent years, Murray said. At the same time, the number of new college grads with degrees in education has been declining, so many positions are left unstaffed when veteran teachers leave. About 1,000 of the district’s 1,800 teachers have worked in classrooms for three years or less, Murray said.","Crudup, of the Better Together Commission, said he is eager for the teacher shortage to be resolved. “I believe one of our tasks will be to create a better environment that will be more attractive for people to want to come to Jackson and be part of the public schools,” he said.","In the interim, the district has conducted a multi-media blitz to entice retired teachers back to the classroom. Officials took their campaign to the public, doing interviews with local print and broadcast news outlets, purchasing billboards, advertising and spreading the word any way they could.","Murray even made phone calls to retired teachers he knew, asking if they were interested in coming back and requesting names of other retirees who might want to work with students again.","“It was a major priority for us,” Murray said. “We found that the pool of retired teachers was extensive.”","Viola Owens is one of the retired teachers who came out of retirement to help. She taught English for 33 years — 14 of them in Jackson Public Schools — before retiring in 2014 to take care of her disabled son. She was widowed in 2013, and lost her son in 2015. At loose ends after this double loss, she looked for volunteer work, donating her time to local police and other groups.","So, when she heard veteran teachers were needed, going back to school seemed ideal. Like Thompson, she teaches full time on a salary. A former educator of the year in Canton, Mississippi, who retired from Jackson Public Schools, Owens now works at Provine High School teaching three classes of 10th grade English per day, with one planning period.","“I like helping the young people,” she said. “Some of them need so much help and guidance. Things have changed quite a bit since I started teaching. A lot of the kids are behind socially and educationally.”","Indeed, the Jackson Public Schools serve many students with great needs, and many are behind academically. Many of the students hail from economically disadvantaged households; 78 percent of the students in the school system qualify for free or reduced meals. Just over 20 percent of JPS students scored proficient in reading, and only 16.9 percent were proficient in math based on assessments for grades three through eight.","Even though it’s not easy, Owens said she has been “delighted” to see some of the students she taught at John Powell Middle School before she retired.","“They know that means they are going to have to work!” she said.","Eric Knapp, is one of those teachers deeply embedded in his community that Alvin Thornton, of the Maryland Commission on Education Finance, Equity, and Excellence, suggests districts should be trying to attract. He taught Language Arts in Jackson for 29 years before retiring in 2009. He returned to Jackson schools as a substitute three years ago. “I guess after working with children, walking away was kind of boring,” he said. “I made the decision to go back to help out.”","Knapp said he’s had a positive response from students and parents since he joined the faculty of Brinkley Middle School in northwest Jackson as a retire/rehire. The best part is “seeing the smiles on their faces” when students master a task.","“Teachers are generally concerned about kids and that calling never leaves you,” Knapp said. “So, you go when there is a need.”","Shimelle Mayers, principal at Brinkley Middle School said having retired teachers in the building has been a positive experience all around. She has two retired/rehired teachers among 38 staffers teaching the school’s 465 students.","“Good tactics stand the test of time,” she said. “They are good at looking at the diverse needs of the students, their strengths and weaknesses, and working with them to address those needs.”","She said the retired teachers also bring “structure, order and discipline” that beginning teachers may not have mastered.","Mayers said the veterans and beginners learn from each other. The retired teachers share their knowledge of classroom management while the younger teachers help them understand new technology.","Retired Jackson Public Schools teacher Anne Johnson, who now teaches students at her church and volunteers for the Jackson chapter of the NAACP, said the educators who have returned are committed to education in a school system in which good teachers have the potential to make a big difference in children’s lives.","“Teaching is a ministry,” said Johnson. “You teach because you are interested in helping children be the best they can be. Sometimes it’s not something that you can just put down, especially when you know there is a need. You have spent years helping children to learn and thrive. It’s difficult not to respond when you hear there is such a significant need.”","Also from The Hechinger Report:","How one Mississippi college is trying to tackle teacher shortages\nA ‘civil rights camp’ teaches kids a history they’re not learning in school\nLarge Mississippi district handed over to public-private partnership\nHow one Mississippi elementary school improved to an A rating\nPoll finds southern voters want more education spending\nCan online learning level the AP playing field for rural kids?","This story was produced by The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education.

Why hasn’t it arrived?","date":"2018-04-19"},"articleContent":["He glows in the spotlight, cameras flashing, millions of fans screaming and crying as he’s crowned “America’s Next Drag Superstar.” He’s not clad in a gown and pumps like all of the previous titleholders, though. Instead, he sports a brightly colored, perfectly tailored suit. Admirers of his chameleonic style span the entire gender spectrum. From his glimmering glitter beard to his smooth dance moves, he is magnetic and magnanimous, cool and congenial, the life of the party. He’s the first-ever drag king to win.","Is this a recap of last season’s “RuPaul’s Drag Race” finale? Of course not! In no uncertain terms, the show has specified that its competition is for queens and queens only, and a particular type at that: assigned male at birth (AMAB), pre-op if male-to-female trans, and willing to (mostly) present at a particular femme frequency.","Instead, the aforementioned scene imagines a future in which kings explode onto our own televised platform and, with a smile and a wink, flamboyantly challenge the toxic masculinity that pervades mainstream culture.","According to Dr. Ruth C. White, a mental health expert and activist, the term toxic masculinity “refers to the social expectations that men, and thus also boys, should be sexually aggressive, physically violent, unemotional, homophobic and should also devalue women… It is also the type of behavior that emphasizes competition based on physical power, risk-taking and sexual prowess and promiscuity.”","Many people who perform as drag kings have experienced the firsthand effects of toxic masculinity. While kings (myself included) do not always identify as women outside of drag and may find ourselves elsewhere on the gender spectrum, the majority of us are assigned female at birth (AFAB). As a result, we’re often particularly attuned to the far-reaching cultural consequences of strict definitions of masculinity.","“I’ve experienced a number of close encounters with men attempting to dominate my physical space, inappropriately touching me and asking personal or revolting questions,” said Adam All, a London-based king. All’s stories are too familiar, and if I were to quote them in their entirety plus list my own, I’d need to up this article’s word count by several thousand.","Brooklyn-based king K.James, who identifies as transmasculine, initially had a difficult time finding a community that wasn’t replicating toxic masculinity “by conforming to certain masculine ideals that are in conflict with feminism and respecting women and femmes.” For K.James, “becoming a drag king and part of the drag community opened up the definition of masculinity for me as I navigated my trans identity ― one that is queerer and less strictly defined.”","I’ve heard many of my fellow drag artists and industry peers characterize drag king performance as an embodiment or critique of masculinity. But by definition, what we always perform is maleness. We are called male impersonators, not masculinity impersonators, and we do not all parody or embody stereotypical alpha-male masculinity; we demonstrate variety in our portrayals.","“I try to bring three completely different characters and expressions to every show that I do,” said Damien D’Luxe, a Minneapolis-based king known for his elaborate makeup and costuming. All describes himself as “a man who embraces bright colours, emotions, vulnerability and positivity, offering a warm and gentle persona utterly void of toxicity or aggression, though still presenting maleness.” According to K.James, his “queer, campy drag style is influenced by iconic masculine images. … My goal isn’t impersonation ― it’s about taking these elements and remixing them and showing that these masculine ideals can belong to anybody and any body. It deconstructs the idea that masculinity only belongs to cis men.”","This multiplicity is innately at odds with the toxic version of masculinity, which thrives on conformity. That drag kings can transmute the lived trauma of having experienced gender-based oppression and emerge onstage as the men of our dreams (or satirically presented nightmares) is a revolutionary act. A “Drag Race”-style show could showcase us, and our maleness, in all of our variety. It could pay homage to the attributes of various masculinities while lambasting their destructive sides.","K.James and Vigor Mortis, both members of the legendary Brooklyn drag collective Switch N’ Play, perform a brilliant fan-favorite piece that perfectly exemplifies the paradigm shift that we kings can facilitate with our art. The number is their take on a classic “Saturday Night Live” skit in which Adrian (Patrick Swayze) and Barney (Chris Farley) duked it out for a job stripping at Chippendales. With K.James as Adrian and Mortis as Barney, the kings replicate the start of the original skit with tear-away tuxes and plenty of sass, charmingly and cheesily shaking it to Loverboy’s “Working for the Weekend.” Eventually, the judges name the muscular Adrian as the one who gets the gig.","Whereas the old skit then descended into fat-phobic humor, the kings have a fresh spin. Robyn’s “Dancing on My Own” sashays gaily into the mix, spurring impassioned lip-synching, hand-clasping and collaboration between the two performers. When dialogue from Raven and Jujubee’s famous tie episode on Season 2 of “Drag Race” bursts forth, punctuated by “shantay, you BOTH stay,” the kings eschew competition for the throes of queer bromance, enveloped by the deafening cheers of the audience.","Drag kings have been climbing toward a certain apex of recognition over the past few years. Media attention (including from the likes of Vogue, Elle and BuzzFeed) has been rolling in, we have performers in our ranks with tens of thousands of followers on social media, we tour internationally, a number of documentaries about us are currently in post-production, and we regularly share the stage with the world’s most famous queens. There’s no point in wondering why we aren’t “there” yet, if “there” is defined as being national-TV-level household names. We are doing the damn thing. “There” is nearer than ever before, and we’re ready for our close-up.","“I absolutely think there should be a “Drag Race”-style national TV show for kings,” D’Luxe said. “Drag kings deserve to have the same amount of exposure and visibility as drag queens in the industry.” All agrees that exposure is “essential to our growth as performers and as a community,” although he “would want a focus on collaboration and encouragement more than competition.” While we may not have a unifying vision of what our hit TV show should look like, I have yet to encounter another king who thinks that more visibility would be a bad thing.","But back to the parallel universe of our king-centric drag race: Here, we’re still cheering on our regal king, who’s basking in all of his newfound glory. And then, suddenly, another spotlight appears illuminating another king. And then another, and another, until the whole stage is awash with glittering kings. In a shocking plot twist, they are all winners! The show has not only cemented a new spot for kings in the annals of pop culture; it’s exploded the assumption that only one of us deserves to win.","What queer art has always done is render the seemingly impossible possible, taking the lemons that society has thrown at us and serving up the most heavenly, haute lemonade in bejeweled goblets that people of all persuasions can’t help but clamor for. Drag kings are one of the cornerstones of this movement, and it’s high time that we claim our crowns."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ad8ba5e1e0000771b7b1f8d.jpeg?cache=wteJXJnaMT&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Democratic Lawmakers Ask Trump How It Was Legal To Bomb Syria","authors":"Jennifer Bendery","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/syria-military-action-trump-congress-authorization_us_5ad8eaa6e4b0e4d0715e8096","short_description":"“We reiterate that your Administration must provide a legal basis for both the 2017 and 2018 strikes.”","date":"2018-04-19"},"articleContent":["WASHINGTON ― Two Democratic lawmakers asked President Donald Trump on Thursday to explain how it was legal for him to bomb Syria last week without first getting congressional authorization.","“We share your outrage and disgust at the horrific use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime,” reads a letter from Sen. Tim Kaine (Va.) and Rep. Adam Schiff (Calif.). “However, the legality of military action is not a secondary consideration ― it is a central question of vital importance under our Constitution and our system of checks and balances.”","Here’s a copy of their letter:","The two also pushed for Trump to release a memo that is apparently floating around within the administration that lays out a detailed legal justification for taking military action in Syria. The problem with not releasing that memo, they argued, is that it could be used as precedent for the Trump administration to take additional military action against other countries without Congress’ approval.","Kaine and Schiff wrote a similar letter to Trump a year ago, asking how it was legal for him to launch 59 Tomahawk missiles on a Syrian government airfield in April 2017 ― the first-ever direct military strike by the U.S. against President Bashar Assad’s regime. They never got a reply.","It’s not just Democrats insisting that the president has to come to Congress before taking military action against Assad’s regime. Hours before Trump bombed Syria on Friday, dozens of lawmakers in both parties said he needed to get signoff from them.","Congress is constitutionally required to authorize any sustained military action. A president can only use his or her authority as commander in chief to order U.S. forces into military action if the safety or strategic interests of the United States are threatened. Neither was the case last week, nor last year.","Republican Hill leaders, who really don’t want to deal with a war authorization debate, insist Trump is legally justified in taking military action against Assad. Yet they can’t explain why. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said Trump can lean on a sweeping 2001 authorization for use of military force against al Qaeda, which has nothing to do with Assad’s regime. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said the administration believes it is on “firm footing,” so it’s probably fine.","The White House did provide Congress with a vague legal explanation for its actions in an April 15 letter. It says the president acted “in the vital national security and foreign policy interests of the United States” under his authority as commander in chief.","Kaine and Schiff say that explains nothing.","“This is not sufficient information for the American public to understand what limits, if any, you and your Administration believes constrains you as the President from taking military action anywhere in the world for any purpose ‘to defend important U.S. national interests,’” they said. “We reiterate that your Administration must provide a legal basis for both the 2017 and 2018 strikes.”","Asked for comment, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told HuffPost that Defense Secretary James Mattis “has addressed this.”","Sanders did not clarify when. Presumably she meant Mattis’ testimony to the House Armed Services Committee last week, before the strikes occurred, when he was asked directly by Rep. John Garamendi (D-Calif.) about the legal justification for Trump to attack Assad without Congress’ authorization.","Mattis said only that Trump has the right “under Article II,” which lays out the authority of the commander in chief. But he couldn’t say why.","“I’ll have the lawyers get back to you for the broader issue,” he said."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ad8eadf1e0000fb077b1fcd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Senate Confirms Climate Change Denier To Lead NASA","authors":"Chris D'Angelo","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jim-bridenstine-nasa-confirmation_us_5ad8aab7e4b03c426dac081c","short_description":"Rep.

Jim Bridenstine (R-Okla.), a former Navy pilot with no scientific credentials and who doesn’t believe humans are primarily to blame for the global climate crisis, to lead NASA.","Bridenstine will become the first elected official to hold the NASA administrator job. He joins a Cabinet already loaded with people who question the near-universal scientific consensus that climate change is real and that human activity is the primary cause.","The final vote ― which was 50-49 along party lines ― came one day after the Senate narrowly advanced Bridenstine’s nomination, thanks to an about-face from Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and a key vote from Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.). Rubio, who in September told Politico that he worried about Bridenstine’s nomination “could be devastating for the space program,” said in a statement Wednesday that he decided to support the nominee in order to avoid “a gaping leadership void” at NASA.","Much like the procedural vote on Wednesday, which was temporarily deadlocked at 49-49, Thursday’s confirmation ultimately hinged on Flake, who voted in favor only after a bit of drama that included a long discussion with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and stepping out for a phone call, as CNN’s Manu Raju reports.","Bridenstine will replace Robert Lightfoot Jr., who has been serving as acting administrator since previous NASA administrator, Charles Bolden Jr., resigned from his post in January.","In a statement following Thursday’s vote, Bridenstine said he is humbled by the opportunity. “I look forward to working with the outstanding team at NASA to achieve the President’s vision for American leadership in space,” he said.","The Senate confirmation comes more than seven months after President Donald Trump tapped Bridenstine for the post. Democrats skewered Bridenstine during the confirmation process, pegging him as “extreme” and unqualified to oversee a scientific agency with an annual budget of more than $18 billion.","Echoing previous statements, Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) said on the Senate floor Wednesday that he finds Bridenstine’s behavior in Congress “as divisive as any in Washington.” And he called Bridenstine’s previous comments about climate change “troubling.”","Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) said before Thursday’s vote that it is “downright dangerous” to put someone without the appropriate expertise in charge of NASA.","“And quite frankly it is even more frightening to have a leader who has made a career out of ignoring scientific expertise,” he said.","In a June 2013 speech, Bridenstine peddled a debunked argument made by climate change skeptics, claiming that global temperatures “stopped rising 10 years ago.” He said “the people of Oklahoma are ready to accept” an apology from then-President Barack Obama for what Bridenstine called a “gross misallocation” of funds for climate change research instead of weather forecasting.","Critics have also pointed to Bridenstine’s history of opposing equal rights for same-sex couples ― in 2013, he suggested LGBTQ people are sexually immoral ― and voiced concern about his ability to manage an agency of more than 17,000 employees. Bridenstine has no formal background in science or engineering.","The former Navy Reserve pilot previously served as executive director of the Air and Space Museum & Planetarium in Tulsa, Oklahoma. During his tenure, the nonprofit suffered financial losses, and an investigation by the Project On Government Oversight found that Bridenstine used the nonprofit’s resources to benefit a company he co-owned, according to a report from The Daily Beast this week.","Republican lawmakers, including Sens. Ted Cruz (Texas) and James Inhofe (Okla.), have flocked to Bridenstine’s defense.","On Wednesday, Cruz called Bridenstine a “strong leader” and said he could think of few people more inspirational or qualified.

But don’t let that moment blind you.","Responding to the suggestion, made by Trump’s newly appointed economic adviser Larry Kudlow, that there was “confusion” about the White House plan for Russian sanctions, Haley shot back.","“With all due respect, I don’t get confused,” she said in a statement to Fox News’ Dana Perino, who read the comment during her Tuesday show.","It was the rare power move made by the rarest of creatures ― an actual woman (of color!) in the Trump administration. Kudlow even apologized later that day, though that doesn’t mitigate the fact that Haley was left out of critical decision-making and made to look like a dupe.","Haley’s words were enough to charm CNN chief political correspondent Dana Bash, who tweeted that the line “should go down as one of the best by a female leader. Ever. Said so much, with so few words.”","Indeed, it was hard not to feel a little bit heartened by Haley in that moment. While a strong woman standing up for herself isn’t exactly novel in the Me Too era, spotting one in the male wilds of the White House is definitely a noteworthy occasion.","But a tossed-off strong comeback doesn’t let Haley off the hook. She still works for ― and consistently defends ― a notorious misogynist accused by more than a dozen women of sexual misconduct.","The Trump administration, Haley’s team, has worked relentlessly to curtail women’s rights, beginning in its earliest days when, surrounded by men, the president signed the so-called global gag rule that bars international health organizations from receiving funding if they mention abortion as a family planning option and may lead to a rise in maternal deaths around the world.","The administration is also working tirelessly to roll back reproductive rights in the U.S., has killed reforms that would have helped close the gender wage gap and has made it more difficult for women to report sexual discrimination.","Still, even if you vehemently object to those policies, Haley does hold an allure. Particularly compared to the handful of women in Trump’s Cabinet, the most male group of secretaries since the Reagan era. She is clearly an intelligent woman who knows what she’s talking about. It’s a low bar, but one Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has had trouble clearing. Haley also hasn’t vanished into obscurity like Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao or Small Business Administrator Linda McMahon. (The fifth woman in the Cabinet is Kirstjen Nielsen, who runs the Department of Homeland Security and recently said she wasn’t sure if Norway is predominantly white to deflect racist comments made by her boss.)","Haley is also clearly better than White House senior adviser Ivanka Trump when it comes to playing the strong, confident female leader in the press ― even as she backs the administration in its role curbing women’s rights. Indeed she is strong-willed, competent and principled enough that she seems to now be in danger of losing her job. The New York Times reported on Wednesday that Trump is unhappy with Haley and she may be in line to take a Tillerson-like fall.","Still, Haley is out there defending the White House. She argued in favor of the global gag rule just this week in an interview with Marie Claire. Haley smoothly responded to a question about a possible rise in unsafe abortions, a likely result of the Trump policy, by talking about women’s rights.","“I think the only thing you’re seeing is, instead of us funding and supporting abortions, what we’ve tried to do is fund and support clean facilities where mothers give birth,” she said, adding that, though there may be disagreement on abortion, “we should never disagree on the fact that we want the strongest, healthiest, most educated women we can have out there.”","It was an artful dodge that obscures the harm being done to women by the rule, which human rights groups say is putting millions of women in peril by cutting off access to birth control and crucial health care.","Haley also deflected a question about what it’s like to be a woman in an administration with a “challenging record on women” by saying she always tells Trump the truth. “Whether it’s the #MeToo Movement, whether it’s the rumors, whether it’s facing any other challenges that come along the way, I just try to be as honest as I can,” she said.","Haley, who was the first woman ever elected governor in South Carolina, wasn’t always so clearly on team Trump. She first became known nationally when she pushed to remove the Confederate flag from the South Carolina statehouse ― not exactly a Trumpian move.","And it’s worth noting that back in 2016 Haley was a fairly vocal critic of Trump, specifically calling him out on his rhetoric around Muslims and once even saying Trump was everything a governor wouldn’t want in a president. They even had the requisite Twitter spat, with Trump calling her an embarrassment to the state and Haley hitting back with a classic Southern put-down:","But those days seem long ago.","To Marie Claire, Haley also spoke about often being the only woman in the room. Indeed, there is a definite dearth of women in politics, particularly in the Republican Party.","“I push just as hard whether it’s women or men in the room. I’m not intimidated by men at all,” she said. “Do I wish there were more women? Always. I would love to have more girlfriends all around me. But until that happens I’m going to keep trying to represent. What I try to do every day is show it’s doable.”","It’s inspiring until you think about the rooms she is operating in now, with a president who’s making a mockery of our democracy on the world stage and who has at every turn humiliated and undermined women (and men, too).","Sometimes there are no women in the room because the room is a bad place to be."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ad7bffd1e0000fb077b1e3f.jpeg?cache=GHTAELArLi&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"COMEDY","headline":"Stephen Colbert Thinks He Has Proof That Trump Watches His Show","authors":"Ed Mazza","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/stephen-colbert-trump-watches-late-show_us_5ad7f3a7e4b029ebe020d303","short_description":"\"Late Show\" host finds hidden meaning in a Trump tweet.","date":"2018-04-19"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"COMEDY","headline":"3rd-Grader Gives Donald Trump A Lesson In Fake News: 'It's Not What You Think'","authors":"Lee Moran","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/3rd-grader-gives-donald-trump-a-lesson-in-fake-news-its-not-what-you-think_us_5ad85b4ee4b029ebe02137d7","short_description":"Using words the president may understand.","date":"2018-04-19"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Former NYC Mayor Rudy Giuliani Is Joining Trump's Legal Team","authors":"Ryan Grenoble","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rudy-giuliani-trump-special-counsel_us_5ad905a1e4b03c426dacb83e","short_description":"The former prosecutor said he hopes to negotiate an end to the special counsel investigation.","date":"2018-04-19"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Here Is Prince’s Original Version Of ‘Nothing Compares 2 U’","authors":"Elyse Wanshel","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/heres-princes-original-version-of-nothing-compares-2-u_us_5ad8ee90e4b029ebe022465c","short_description":"The Purple One’s estate released the song and previously unseen footage on Thursday.","date":"2018-04-19"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Ellen Burstyn Predicts The Future: 'We'll Be The Dogs Of The Robots'","authors":"Matthew Jacobs","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ellen-burstyn-predicts-the-future_us_5ad4f476e4b016a07e9f6999","short_description":"The 85-year-old Oscar winner has a lot to say about the singularity, dark energy and humanity's place in the universe.","date":"2018-04-19"},"articleContent":["Ellen Burstyn is good at talking.","Seated in her living room overlooking Central Park on a brisk February afternoon, a wire-haired pooch perched at her feet, Burstyn registers as thoughtful, engaged and exceedingly well-read. Cluttered bookshelves line the walls. Crystals garnish the windowsill near our armchairs. A white piano sits across the room. Art from all corners of the globe hangs throughout her apartment, evincing an 85-year-old life full of adventures.","As quickly as we delve into the annals of her career ― from an auspicious Broadway debut to defining roles in “The Last Picture Show,” “Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore,” “The Exorcist,” “Requiem for a Dream,” “Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood,” “Interstellar” and “House of Cards” ― the conversation shifts to Burstyn’s spiritual fortification. She’s as infatuated with the cosmos and metaphysical ideology as she is anything to do with Hollywood, where she has gone from primo leading lady to venerated elder stateswoman.","In the next several weeks, Burstyn will appear in two movies: “The House of Tomorrow” (opening April 27) and “The Tale” (premiering May 26 on HBO). In the former, she’s an environmentally conscious grandmother obsessed with Buckminster Fuller, an architect and theorist who popularized the term “Spaceship Earth” (and a real-life friend of Burstyn’s; more on that later). In the latter, which was one of the most renowned films at Sundance this year, she’s a mother whose globetrotting daughter (Laura Dern) is reinvestigating a sexually abusive episode from her childhood. Onscreen, Burstyn has always had a crisp elocution that wobbles only to reveal characters’ vulnerability ― a trait seen in both “The House of Tomorrow” and “The Tale.”","For an hour, Burstyn and I had a conversation so articulate and wide-ranging we must have solved at least some of the world’s problems. We discussed the state of American politics, her Vietnam War protests in the 1970s, the injury she sustained on “The Exorcist,” the evolution of Hollywood and, yes, the mysteries of the universe.","“The Tale,” which I saw at Sundance, is going to be a big conversation starter about sexual abuse. It’s a weird movie to love because it’s so difficult to process, but it’s really remarkable, especially because it’s autobiographical.","I think so, too. I think the way [director Jennifer Fox] mixed the two — documentary and narrative — is so unusual and innovative. It’s a lot of things. It’s an exploration of memory and it’s an expose of the seduction of children and young people. I think we always have an idea of an abuser as being ugly. I mean, when I met [Fox], she was still referring to [the predator seen in the movie] as her first boyfriend. So it was the whole process of investigating it and reawakening the memory when she started to think about it. I immediately liked her. Have you seen her?","Oh yes, I saw her speak at the Sundance premiere.","You know, I got in such trouble for that remark.","For speaking out against Trump during the Q&A afterward? What kind of trouble?","Oh, just Twitter outrage.","Oh, of course. Do you pay attention to all of that?","I’ve never experienced anything like that before. My remark just came out because I was so unsettled by the film. It’s a little elusive.","How does social media fodder get filtered to you? How do you find out people are saying certain things about you in certain contexts?","People tell me.","People being —","My family. My son. I try not to get into that too much. I just say, “OK.”","Not that you’re someone who’s stoked a lot of outrage throughout your career, but do you have a more zen approach to that now than you did in the past?","Probably. Probably I would have been more upset when people say bad things about me, but I have learned over the years how to separate it — not taking it personally, necessarily, not letting the knife go in, just saying, “That’s them. OK.” I probably shouldn’t have said anything.","From where I was sitting, it seemed invigorating. The audience certainly responded to it.","Well, the thing is, I always forget that what I say in a room is going to leave the room. If I had been on TV, I probably wouldn’t have said it. But I was with like-minded people, so I didn’t censor myself. But no, I should know that lesson by now. It always gets out somehow. Whatever.","Was there a time in your career when you didn’t handle criticism as well?","Oh yeah, when I first started out, I started with a lead on Broadway [in “Fair Game”]. In my first interview for a newspaper, I had lunch and I talked. And then when I read it, I went, “Oh my god.” I had to learn that what you say actually gets into print. It’s easy to forget.","Before that Broadway debut, you’d been a nightclub dancer and a model. Did you feel welcomed among the serious theater crowd?","Well, I auditioned and I got the part. It was the part of a model, so there was some reasonable decision-making. And Moss Hart was there. He was the one that told me I got the part, so if it’s OK with Moss Hart, it should be OK with everyone else. And then when I did the play, there were people in the play — one guy in particular — who were very resentful of me doing a lead on Broadway when I hadn’t studied or anything. There was resentment, but that was my journey and that was how it started. What are you going to do?","You’ve talked about deciding you weren’t ready to be a lead actress while making “Goodbye Charlie” in 1964. But fast-forward a decade and you were one of, if not the, primo actresses of the ’70s.","Well, I had that moment when I auditioned for “Fair Game.” I said, “OK, I’ve decided to be an actress. I’m going to do a Broadway play this fall. Does anybody know how I get an audition?” It was that moment. The thing with “Goodbye Charlie,” I was on the set and I had that thought, OK, next step is I play Debbie Reynolds’ part. And then this voice in my head that speaks to me every once in a while said [in a low, guttural tone], “I don’t want it.” I was shocked. I mean, when that voice speaks, I don’t budge.","What does that voice sound like?","It doesn’t sound like my voice, or a male or a female voice. It’s just a voice, and it’s always flat. Just, boom. When it speaks, I don’t have any doubt that that’s the truth. Sometimes I think of it as an inner teacher, but I don’t know if that’s really what it is. I don’t know what it is. So that was the moment when I left Hollywood and went back to New York and studied with Lee Strasberg. That’s what it meant to me: I didn’t want that career when I saw I was on that track. I wanted to learn how to really act.","Studying was the reaction to the voice?","Investigating the art form, as opposed to doing what comes naturally and getting by on whatever comes without really knowing.","Or chasing the fame, knowing that a lead role in a Hollywood production often equates some level of fame. You never set that as a goal. The fame followed the craft.","That’s a good way to say it.","The New York Times did once say you were the most honored and respected actress of the 1970s. Did you feel that at the time?","No. Somebody asked me once, “Well, what was it like to be working in the golden age of Hollywood?” I said, “Nobody told me it was the golden age.” I was on the jury of the Cannes Film Festival, and I was reading about the festival in a newspaper, and they were writing about the jurors. They said, “Ellen Burstyn, considered the most intelligent actress in Hollywood.” I said, “I am?! I didn’t know that! Why doesn’t somebody tell me these things?” I don’t know, it’s weird.","And who is on the committee that lines up every actress and ranks her according to intelligence?","Right, exactly. Who considers? And how did you hear about that?","What did you do with your first big paycheck?","What comes to mind is my piano. That was in Detroit. I was very happy to be able to buy a piano. I took it with me. When I went to New York, it came with me. When I went to California, it came with me. I finally sold it. I think my son was 2, and I’d finally let go of this piano.","At 85, do you find yourself yearning for anything?","You know, I yearn for things. I’d like to understand the cosmos better. I spend a lot of time thinking about, “What is dark energy? What could be it be? What could it mean that we know it’s there but we don’t know what it is? And if we don’t know what it is, then maybe it’s an alternate universe.” So I spend a lot of time out there. I’m yearning to know, I’m yearning to understand.","And religion is important to you.","Spirituality.","How has that evolved over the years? How would you have answered the question “What does spirituality mean to you” in 1970 compared to how you answer it today?","Well, I was brought up Catholic, and I rejected that around 17. For a few years, I just read about science. I wasn’t religious at all, but I felt this yearning. It felt like something was missing. So then I started reading various kinds of spiritual books, and then I came upon — have you ever heard of Gurdjieff? Gurdjieff was a teacher who came from the Caucasus between the two wars in Europe. He had a school, and people went there and did work on themselves. And I read his books and books by other people who studied with him, and I got interested in that work because it was really work on getting conscious.","And then I found out that he was a Sufi, and then I got interested in Sufism. And then I found a Sufi teacher — an Englishman — and I went to Europe and studied with him for a while, and then I met somebody he was associated with, and he became my teacher. Now, Sufis traditionally are Islamic, but my teacher wasn’t. He welcomed all, so there were Jewish Sufis and Catholic Sufis, and it was spiritual work without being identified with a religion. I notice that on the internet they say I’m Islamic. I’m not. I’ve never been, nor do I want to be, associated with any one religion. I’m interested in all of the various approaches to the divine, to the sacred ground, whatever that is.","I want to understand the whole thing. I want to understand what it’s all about.","And where has that led you today?","Right now I’m reading an ecotheologian. His name is Thomas Berry. I was introduced to him by a woman who’s a professor at Yale University. He’s into the sacred connectedness to nature, or in nature, as opposed to separate from nature. Because we’re separate from it, that’s why the earth is suffering so much. That’s why we can abuse it so badly. I’m just into exploring all these realms, being open to them and not saying, “This is what I believe and everything else is wrong.”","Maybe you don’t think about it this concretely, but how much do you think that spiritual quest has informed you a storyteller, as an actress inhabiting others’ lives, in terms of both the roles you’ve chosen over the years and how you piece those roles together?","Well, I’ve never thought about it, but thank you for asking that question. I think it would have to. You know, empathy is such a large part of an actor’s work — feeling into the character and into other human beings. Empathy seems to me to be one of the virtues that we’re blessed with. I think it’s a large part of my work. Now, how that connects with the spiritual explorations, I’m not sure — except that I do feel compassion for my characters, whatever their story is. I try to offer that up. I do think whatever makes us deeper as human beings makes us richer as artists.","Thinking back to the Twitter outrage from the Sundance premiere, how are you working through the current political turmoil and what led us to a Trump presidency, in light of having educated yourself about larger forces influencing the world?","You know, my first Sufi teacher used to say, “Everything manifests in reverse.” So we achieved the first black president, and this is the reaction. It’s a pendulum swing. I trust that we will survive it and will get back to some center. It’s very painful.","When “Requiem for a Dream” opened in 2000, you talked about a conversation with a doctor friend of yours, saying you both felt like the state of medicine and other professions —","The standards were lower?","Yes. And then in August 2016, you said, “I don’t believe Trump’s going to win. I don’t believe the universe will allow it.” We all said that around August 2016. But those two ideas seem to work hand in hand: the degradation of professional standards and Trump’s ability to become president. Do you think there’s a connection there?","Probably. When I think about my childhood, we didn’t lock the doors when I was in Detroit. So in the years that I’ve spent on the planet, there’s been a huge change. Social media has made it possible for the alt-right to speak to other alt-right people on the other side of the country that they didn’t know were there. They’re more organized, there are more of them. There are a lot of things that, as we developed technology, have advanced us in many ways, but at the same time the reverse goes along with it. So how we handle it and get out of it and grow with it, I don’t know. It’s very scary and we’re in the midst of it.","When there was the Industrial Revolution, that was such a huge change in the culture. We’re in that kind of revolution — social revolution — and we don’t know how it’s going to come out.","Do you know — oh, what’s that word? The moment where technology advances to the point where it takes over. I lose this word a lot. The singularity! And when we get there — we’ve never been there in the history of the planet — we have no idea what’s going to happen. Somebody has suggested that possibly we will become pets to the technology, however it’s manifesting. We’ll be the dogs of the robots. We have no idea what we’re in for.","Did you consider yourself politically active in the ’70s?","Well, don’t forget there was the Vietnam War. I was very active during that. I was in the streets in Los Angeles. At the first Women Strike for Peace march, I was pushing my kid in a baby carriage. And I was with a group called STOP, Speakers and Talent Organize for Peace. We went out speaking to Rotary Clubs against the war. I was at the Democratic Convention in 1968. I was at a fundraiser for Eugene McCarthy when Martin Luther King was assassinated. We were supporting Martin Luther King, and we expected when Bobby Kennedy got California that he would get the nomination and we would then change our votes to Kennedy, and then he got assassinated. So I’ve always been political, and I’ve always been a Democrat.","How much do you think being around Hollywood at the time further galvanized your activism? Obviously Jane Fonda is a figurehead for celebrity politics in the ’70s, but the decade’s upheaval really defined Hollywood, on-screen and off.","I don’t know, it’s hard to say. I think, if I were still living in Detroit, I would have been against that war. We were in an unjust war, just like we are now in the Mideast. I think I just happened to live in Los Angeles at the time, but I think wherever I was that’s what I would have been doing: fighting.","Let’s talk about a few movies. Did you pay attention to the news about Uma Thurman’s injury on the set of “KiIl Bill”? Her lack of protection sounds similar to what happened to you on the set of “The Exorcist,” where you permanently injured your spine after being pulled to the ground for a stunt. You had asked your director, William Friedkin, to have the stuntman pull you more gently, but he didn’t listen.","Well, I wasn’t talked into doing it. I was telling him, “No, he’s pulling me too hard.” I was aware that I was in danger, and I said it. [Friedkin] went behind my back. So I didn’t agree to it. I think finally Uma did — I don’t know that for a fact, but from what I understand, she got talked into it. One does have to finally be able to say no, which I did. I mean, people have died making movies, especially stunt people. So one has to really learn how to protect oneself. I wouldn’t ever be in that position again.","Did you ever have any experiences like that again, where you were taken advantage of on a set?","No.","Do you think it’s because that experience firmed you up?","Maybe. Possibly. People don’t mess with me too much.","That’s good. You’ve talked many times over the years about having a hand in selecting a young Martin Scorsese to direct “Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore.” If that movie were being made today, there might be some sort of conversation about whether a woman should make it. I assume there were no women for you to lobby for at the time?","No. Absolutely not. Although I have to say, an executive did ask me to direct it, and I said I didn’t want to act and direct at the same time. That’s what I’m doing now [with the comedy “Bathing Flo”]. And I was right. It wouldn’t have been as good a movie.","There’s a scene in “House of Tomorrow” where your character watches footage of your younger self and processes her former life. It made me think about what it’s like for you to be interviewed. Is it cathartic to be asked to recall the details of your younger self? Is it redundant? Intrusive?","Well, I shot that footage and had it to offer to the director, which he didn’t know when he asked me to do the film. He didn’t know that I knew [architect and theorist Buckminster Fuller, who appears in the footage] and that I had shot the film with him. It was pretty serendipitous. When people ask me, “Well, why did you shoot that film?” I don’t know. I just did. I have no explanation for it. I shot that 40 years ago. Forty? Thirty anyway. Between 30 and 40. And of course I don’t know if everybody knows it’s real when they see it.","It was wonderful to be able to offer it to the director when he offered me the part not knowing I was friends with Bucky. He was an amazing man. I was really grateful to know him. He was a great mind. Have you ever read any of his books?","I haven’t.","He’s a very strange writer. He makes up languages. He combines words into new words. I’ll show you. [Burstyn rises from the seat and retrieves a well-worn hardback book from a bookshelf.]","I have a lot of his books, most of them. Well, no. He wrote 30 books, and I don’t have 30. This one is actually autographed to me by him. [She opens to a passage called “Intuition: Metaphysical Mosaic,” written in verse, and hands me the book.] Read this.","[I proceed to read the two-page passage, which concludes with the line “This is why consciousness identified the basic increment of time as being a second.”]","That’s the way he writes. And by the way, that’s his definition of God: the a priori mystery, the mystery that exists before anything. He defines “universe” as a series of partially overlapping, simultaneous events. That’s the way his thinking is multidimensional. With his writing, I’m like, “What, Bucky?! What are you saying?”","How did you meet him?","I was interested in Margaret Fuller, who was an associate of Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau. I thought she was a great 19th-century woman writer and editor of their newspaper, The Dial. I was thinking about her and reading about her — I had many books — and I was also reading about him. He gave a lecture at Carnegie Hall while I was shooting “The Exorcist.” I went to the lecture, and while I was sitting there, I went, “Margaret Fuller, Buckminster Fuller, Boston.” I made the connection, and I wrote to him and told him I was interested in talking to him about his aunt. His secretary called back and said, “You can have two hours in the Boston airport at this date, or you can have five hours in the Chicago airport on this date.” So I picked the Chicago airport and flew there, and we had five hours together. Then we became friends. He was an amazing man.","You mentioned earlier not knowing the ’70s were a golden age. Today when we talk about the ’70s, we talk about the decade’s movies in very political terms. They were responses to the Vietnam War and social change and second-wave feminism and so forth. In thinking about “The House of Tomorrow” and “The Tale,” as well as the other movies you’ve made in recent years, do you think today’s movies, or more specifically today’s studios —","[Burstyn shakes her head.]","OK, maybe not the studios. Let’s say today’s filmmakers. Do you think the type of filmmakers you’re involved with — the type whose movies premiere at festivals, for example — are making movies that respond to today’s political and social mores the way we say movies in the ’70s did?","Well, “Mudbound” did. “Get Out” did. “Shape of Water” kind of does. “Florida Project” did. “Three Billboards,” kind of. “The Post.” So I think the answer’s yes.","We both shook our heads when I mentioned studios. But most of the movies you named are not getting the type of attention that “Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore” got when Warner Brothers released it in ’74.","No. No. No, the studios are doing “Spider-Man 12.” That’s the brand. The filmmakers are in the independent film world. It’s a different business.","You had an Oscar nomination in 1981 and then a gap until your next, for “Requiem” in 2001. By that point, Oscar campaigning had ballooned into an entire industry. Did you notice that shift?","Well, I know, for instance, with “Requiem,” that we didn’t have money for a campaign, and that made a huge difference. I still have people go by me on the street and go, “You were robbed.” I’ve had that experience more than once. And it wasn’t originally a problem not to have money for a campaign.","It hurt the movie’s chances in a way that it might not have 20 years earlier.","Right. I think. Not to take anything away from Julia Roberts, who was wonderful in “Erin Brockovich.” But they had a wonderful campaign, and we didn’t. It’s not reasonable to think you can get by without a campaign, not anymore.","I recently watched the pilot of “The Ellen Burstyn Show,” which only lasted 13 episodes. What happened with that show?","You know, I was put together with a partner who was the head writer, and we never saw eye-to-eye. We were making two different shows, or trying to. And it just didn’t work. It was a bad marriage is what it was. It just couldn’t work with him.","It’s such a good cast: you, Elaine Stritch, Megan Mullally. Writer drama aside, just on name recognition alone, how could that show have flown by?","I gave Megan her first job on that show, and Elaine playing my mother was a hoot.

These things were intertwined, the album and the baby, if not in reality then in the hyperreality Cardi B inhabits. Both were treated by certain corners of the public as bits of creative output to be consumed and judged, and last week on the ”Ebro in the Morning” radio show on New York’s Hot 97, Cardi B seemed annoyed with this arrangement.","It’s just like, you know what? I’m a grown woman. I’m 25 years old. I’m going to say this in the most humblest way: I’m a millionaire. And I’m prepared for this.","She went on a little later:","I see a lot of women online like, ’Oh, I feel sorry for you, oh your career is over.′ And it’s like, why can’t I have both? As a woman, why can’t I have both? Why do I gotta choose a career or a baby? Like, why can’t I have both? I want both.","Cardi’s frustration is understandable, but so, too, is the public preoccupation with her rise to fame. For the first time there was tension in what had been an unprecedentedly sunny relationship between Cardi and her fans, and it told us something about stardom based the sort of authenticity Cardi embodies. People cherish authenticity in a celebrity, it seems, until the celebrity is too authentically a person of her own.","The affection for Cardi isn’t hard to understand. Everybody loves an underdog story. In fact, there’s a science behind our need to root for the underdog, the unlikely hero, the rags-to-riches story. Psychological studies exploring this phenomenon, specifically in sports, have found that people are more likely to root for teams they perceive to be putting in “more effort with less ability,” because it creates a compelling narrative.","Cardi B is the ultimate underdog. She is, by her own description, just a “regular degular girl from the Bronx,” a former stripper who leveraged her charisma and humor and authenticity on social media into a rap career.","Throughout a three-year trajectory, from Instagram star to reality TV star to hip-hop princess, Cardi surmounted obstacles. She was dismissed as a rapper because she is a woman and a former sex worker. She was too unapologetically ratchet ever to win over the respectability crowd. She was too Dominican and too 161st Street ever to be taken seriously by the country at large. Classism, racism, misogyny — she seemed to fly directly into all the usual cultural headwinds and wound up a superstar anyway.","But having her own life constantly served up for the purposes of vicarious identification brought its own set of problems, as evidenced by the conversation about Cardi’s pregnancy. On blogs like The Shade Room and Industry on Blast, indeed in the comment sections of her own Instagram, people reacted with pity, confusion, even downright disdain toward Cardi’s pregnancy. The comments have come from haters and fans alike.","The give and take of fame is always tricky, especially in the age of social media. Cardi gained popularity, after all, by sharing nearly every aspect of her life on the ’Gram, something she’s always been proud of. On the song “Best Life” from her new album, she raps, “Never been afraid to show y’all the real me/hair when it’s fucked up/crib when it’s filthy.”","Part of Cardi’s charm is how transparent she’s been about her past, about the fact that she is, essentially, winging this fame thing. This quality is also what makes “Invasion of Privacy” such a great record ― an album that hops from thot anthems like “Bickenhead” to confessional ballads like “Be Careful” in which Cardi admits that Offset, her (allegedly) cheating fiancé, has ”got me trippin’/got me lookin’ in the mirror different/Thinkin’ I’m flawed because you inconsistent...”","But she gives so much of herself that it has created a sense of ownership for her fans, not just over her work but over her personal choices. This has always been an aspect of the transaction of fame, but it has been intensified in the digital era, in which people mistake what they are shown or indeed what they share for actual intimacy.","Cardi’s life itself is seen now as a performance in which her fans have a stake. This is how we wound up with people evaluating Cardi’s pregnancy as if it were a new album — as if it were something about which aesthetic objections could be made.","The misogyny of criticizing Cardi’s decision to have a child should go without saying, as should the misogyny of the double standard whereby some people question how she will juggle a baby and a career, but never ask the same of her fiancé, Offset, who already has three children from previous relationships. There’s an irony in this. She has soared beyond the sexism of the champagne room and the recording studio, only to find some of her own fans throwing it back at her in the comments of her own Instagram.","Cardi’s crime was undermining other people’s illusions. She had conjured a fantasy for people — anyone can make it on one’s own terms; anyone can find fame and fortune without losing oneself. And now the very real obligations of a child had intruded on that illusion. An unplanned pregnancy? That was too messily commonplace for anyone’s vicarious daydreaming. Fans want Cardi to be authentic, sure, but not to herself. They want her to be authentic to their fantasy.","And how does Cardi B feel about all this? During her performance at Coachella on Sunday, she wore all-white, her hair swept up and out in a style reminiscent of the late Lisa “Left Eye” Lopes. She was visibly, heavily pregnant. As rapper YG paced the Coachella stage beside her, chanting at the crowd, “Dat ass, dat ass, dat ass, dat ass,” Cardi dropped down low, twerked, flipped over and, holding herself up by her arms and bent knees, humped the air. If this wasn’t a declaration of “I don’t care what you think,” nothing is. It was a “fuck you,” authentically so."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ad8b5341e0000fb077b1f82.jpeg?cache=VTk8mVlMXW&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"MEDIA","headline":"Laura Ingraham's Guest Mocks Her On Live TV For Losing Advertisers","authors":"Ed Mazza","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/laura-ingraham_us_5ad82393e4b03c426dab4120","short_description":"\"A high school kid shut you down!\"","date":"2018-04-19"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"SPORTS","headline":"The NBA Shows Its Love For Gregg Popovich After Wife's Death","authors":"Ron Dicker","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gregg-popovich-wife-erin-death-nba_us_5ad88f80e4b03c426dabe254","short_description":"\"It's bigger than winning and losing,\" Warriors star Kevin Durant said.","date":"2018-04-19"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"WOMEN","headline":"Let's Not Give Alleged Harassers A Comeback Narrative","authors":"Marina Fang","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/me-too-redemption-career-comeback_us_5ad7a7fce4b029ebe020978b","short_description":"A spate of recent stories wonder if men exposed by Me Too can return to the spotlight.

He’s now serving three concurrent prison sentences of up to 175 years for sexual assault and child pornography.","Maroney told Guthrie that Nassar groomed her by bringing her food ― a show of affection in a sport that consistently starves its athletes.","“I would’ve starved at the Olympics if I didn’t have him bring me food,” Maroney said, adding that Nassar bought her a loaf of bread. “Your coaches are just always watching you and wanting to keep you skinny. There’s just other things about the culture that are also messed up that he used against us.”","Maroney signed a confidentiality settlement with USA Gymnastics in December 2016 barring her from sharing her story.

We need the wall. We have to have the wall. The Democrats don’t want to approve the wall because they think it’s good politically, but it’s not.”","He continued: “If you look at what’s happening in California with sanctuary cities — people are really going the opposite way. They don’t want sanctuary cities. There’s a little bit of a revolution going on in California. Human trafficking is worse than it’s ever been in the history of the world.”","Though Trump did not clarify what metric he was using or whether he had accounted for world population growth, human trafficking is a critical issue today. According to the International Labor Organization, there are an estimated 24.9 million people around the world who are trapped in forced labor. Of those, 16 million are exploited for labor in the private sector, 4.8 million are sexually exploited, and 4.1 million forced into state-imposed labor.","Most victims of forced labor or sexual exploitation are in the Asia and Pacific regions. More relevant to Trump’s border wall, though, is human trafficking in the Americas, which accounts for roughly 1 percent of forced labor and 4 percent of sexual exploitation in the world, according to the ILO.","But the president’s conflation of immigration with human trafficking serves an agenda. He has warned of “caravans” threatening to shuttle waves of dangerous immigrants across the U.S.-Mexico border ― a fear-mongering tactic that echoes racist and derogatory comments he made on the campaign trail and in the first year of his presidency.","His comment also did not appear to address one of the most glaring historical examples of human trafficking: the centuries-long trans-Atlantic slave trade, during which over 10 million people were forcibly shipped from parts of Africa to North America, the Caribbean, and Central and South America.","The president has previously emphasized his commitment to fighting human trafficking, including in comments he made to law enforcement officials in Long Island, New York, last year.","“Human traffickers. This is a term that’s been going on from the beginning of time, and they say it’s worse now than it ever was,” he said, according to CNN. “You go back 1,000 years, where you think of human trafficking, you go back 500 years, 200 years, 100 years, human trafficking, they say ― think of it, what they do ― human trafficking is worse now, maybe, than it’s ever been in the history of this world.”","Under the Trump administration, there were over 8,500 U.S. cases of human trafficking reported in 2017 ― an increase of almost 1,000 reported incidents from the previous year, according to the National Human Trafficking Hotline.","CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated a statistic from the ILO about forced labor. The organization estimates 24.9 million people are trapped in forced labor, but more are trapped in “modern-day slavery.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ad8d5831f00002d0016d9c1.jpeg?cache=OHfxw59t4y&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"WEIRD NEWS","headline":"Terrifying Tumbleweeds Take Over California City, Trapping Residents Inside Homes","authors":"Ed Mazza","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tumbleweed-invasion_us_5ad81de3e4b0e4d0715d375d","short_description":"\"It’s a nasty nightmare.”","date":"2018-04-19"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Sandy Hook Father To Alex Jones: 'I'm Not Backing Down'","authors":"Sebastian Murdock","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sandy-hook-father-to-alex-jones-im-not-backing-down_us_5ad8d925e4b029ebe0221e59","short_description":"Neil Heslin said he is prepared for a  \"knock-down, drag-out fight\" in court.","date":"2018-04-19"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"5 Netflix Things To Watch If You Can't Wait For The Royal Wedding","authors":"Todd Van Luling","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/netflix-royal-wedding_us_5ad7d347e4b0e4d0715d0978","short_description":"If the upcoming royal wedding is very much your thing, this is for you.","date":"2018-04-19"},"articleContent":["You won’t be able to watch the upcoming royal wedding on Netflix. But you can watch tons of related royal content to help you make it until May 19, when Prince Harry and Meghan Markle get married on the grounds of an actual castle.","In my opinion, the only royal wedding that ever truly mattered was the beautiful bond shared between Shrek and Princess Fiona, but I guess this one is a big deal too. So, you may want to binge-watch the best royal shows, movies and documentaries on Netflix in anticipation.","The list compiled here mostly focuses on projects directly about the Windsors (aka Harry’s family), but there’s also a decent movie starring Emily Blunt that seemed relevant because the movie features a royal wedding. “The Crown,” which focuses on Prince Harry’s grandma and grandpa, is obviously on this list.","And if you want shows that are just vaguely like “The Crown,” but not specifically about royals, I recommended a few shows that have similar appeal earlier this year. If you want shows that are mostly about royal families fighting, then maybe you’ll like this list of shows on Netflix that are similar to “Game of Thrones.”","Watch the trailers for the shows below. And, if you want to stay informed on what shows are coming to Netflix every week, be sure to subscribe to the Streamline newsletter.","This is part of Streamline, HuffPost’s weekly recommendation service for streaming shows and movies. Every Saturday, Streamline ranks the best shows to watch online, including a specific focus on Netflix.","“The Crown”","Show","Initial Release Year: 2016","Runtime: 20 episodes of approx. 55 minutes","What is this and is it any good? As you probably already know, “The Crown” is one of the most popular Netflix Original shows at the moment. This is by far the most obvious choice on the list given it’s a well-known, well-done show that focuses on the grandparents of Prince Harry.","To nitpick, “The Crown” can be a bit boring and seem a bit pointless. But with an extremely expensive budget and a great cast, the show never fails to at least look amazing. Kind of like the real royal family.","Here’s the trailer...","“The Royal House of Windsor”","Docuseries","Initial Release Year: 2017","Runtime: 6 episodes of approx. 47 minutes","What is this and is it any good? A made-for-television look into the current ruling family of the United Kingdom. If you just want a relatively brief primer into the family dynamics behind the cast of characters in this upcoming royal wedding, this is fairly worth your time.","It should be noted that this does feel like propaganda and only focuses on the positives of the Windsor family. Many viewers have also pointed out that in later episodes, this show bashes Princess Diana undeservedly. That alone might make this a hard pass.","(No available trailer.)","“Elizabeth at 90: A Family Tribute”","Documentary","Initial Release Year: 2016","Runtime: 1 hour, 10 minutes","What is this and is it any good? A glowing look back at Queen Elizabeth II’s life, based on archival footage and interviews with relatives.","If you’re just in an “I LOVE THE ROYAL FAMILY!” mood, this is a perfectly sappy tribute. Much like the show right above this on the list, you’ll be disappointed if you’re looking for an unbiased history lesson. But for the casual viewer, this is fine.","Here’s the trailer...","“The Young Victoria”","Movie","Initial Release Year: 2009","Runtime: 1 hour, 45 minutes","What is this and is it any good? This is sort of like “The Crown” before there was “The Crown.” It stars Emily Blunt.","Reviews from the time were mostly positive, but like “The Crown,” this also is a bit too boring. The thing about royals is that they aren’t allowed to do too much on a day-to-day basis. The lavish costumes are inherently compelling, but it seems difficult to wring action out of these characters. In any case, this is probably your best bet for a short, but relatively competent and fun, watch.","Here’s the trailer...","“The Royals”","Docuseries","Initial Release Year: 2013","Runtime: 6 episodes of approx. 45 minutes","What is this and is it any good? Another collection of interviews and archival footage focusing on the current ruling family. This one draws more from journalist and historian interviews.","Again, this has a propaganda-esque tone, with negatives about the royal family being ignored or glossed over. It’s also probably the least compelling project on this list since the star power of the people who give interviews is very low. This one is only for those who really can’t get enough royals content right now.","(No available trailer)","BONUS: “A Christmas Prince”","Movie","Initial Release Year: 2017","Runtime: 1 hour, 32 minutes","What is this and is it any good? This was Netflix’s big romantic comedy last Christmas season. It’s extremely bad, but in a fun way. It also seems to have become pretty popular.","As the upcoming royal wedding is all about a prince marrying an American outside of royal bloodlines, it seemed fitting to include a movie about that specifically. It’s only a bonus here because, again, this is a truly terrible movie. But “A Christmas Prince” is also going to be your most enjoyable watch on this list. It’s certainly the best option to watch with a group and make fun of together.","Here’s the trailer..."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ad7d6631e0000fb077b1e4c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Cynthia Nixon Would 'Rather Be The Good Nixon Than The Bad Cuomo'","authors":"Jenna Amatulli","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cynthia-nixon-would-rather-be-the-good-nixon-than-the-bad-cuomo_us_5ad8aca6e4b0e4d0715e094f","short_description":"The \"Sex and the City\" star did some campaigning on \"The Late Show.\"","date":"2018-04-19"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"WORLD NEWS","headline":"South Korean Actress Who Was Kidnapped And Forced To Make North Korean Films Dies At 92","authors":"Kimberly Yam","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/choi-eun-hee-dies-at-92_us_5ad64154e4b077c89ced6bdc","short_description":"“All of a sudden a guy grabbed me by the arms.

Choi was 92 years old.","The actress, who cemented her icon status in a series of roles in the 1960s and ’70s, also gained international attention after it was revealed she’d been kidnapped by North Korea and forced to make movies for the country in 1978.","Choi, along with her ex-husband Shin Sang-ok, who’d also been abducted, would spend eight years imprisoned by then-heir apparent of the North Korean leadership, Kim Jong Il.","The actress was born in the South Korean town of Gwangju on Nov. 20, 1926. She ran away from home as a teenager and married an abusive husband, according to author Paul Fischer, who wrote a book about the kidnapping. Before becoming an acclaimed actress, Choi had been enlisted by both North and South Korea during the Korean War and had survived rape. She divorced her first husband before meeting Shin.","With Shin as the director, Choi was featured in about 130 movies and won several awards for her performances. The pair’s artistic relationship was severed after Choi discovered Shin had a secret second family, leading the couple to divorce in 1976. Two years later, the film star was lured to Hong Kong with a promise of a starring role. However, the meeting took a terrifying turn.","“There was a speedboat with three or four strong men,” Choi said in the documentary “The Lovers and the Despot.” “All of a sudden a guy grabbed me by the arms. Before I knew it, I was onboard. All the blood drained from my head to my toes.”","Choi’s ex-husband Shin would be captured as well, and he was imprisoned by North Korea for several years. The two were eventually reunited and remarried in 1983.","Kim Jong Il, who’d orchestrated the abductions, had been a huge admirer of Western cinema and put pressure on the prolific couple to change his country’s film industry.","“Why do all of our films have the same ideological plots?” the late dictator can be heard saying in a tape secretly recorded by Choi, lamenting the North Korean film industry. “There’s nothing new about them. Why are there so many crying scenes? All of our films have crying scenes. This isn’t a funeral, is it?”","The actress noted in the documentary that she went on to make North Korea’s first love story. The reunited couple made nearly 20 films for the country, and Choi won best actress at the 1985 Moscow Film Festival during her imprisonment. Kim was pleased with the pair’s work and allowed the two to travel overseas to a number of film festivals. During one such event in Vienna, the pair escaped.","The two lived in the U.S. for 10 years following their defection and returned to South Korea for their remaining years. Shin died in 2006, and Choi’s health began declining soon after, Yonhap noted.","Though Choi says she “understood [Kim’s] desire to develop the North Korean movie industry, she never forgot the trauma of the kidnapping.","“I still have nightmares about being chased by North Korean agents,” she said in 2015, according to Korea Joongang Daily. “It feels like somebody is always chasing me. People who haven’t experienced this will never know the feeling.”","While she lived through a tumultuous career, Choi maintained that acting was a profession of immense pride and was meant for a “great person.”","“That is because an actor needs to be able to sympathize with the feelings of others in order to act well,” she said, according to Korea Joongang Daily. “I believe a kind heart, looks, speech, skills and the ability to write are the five qualifications of a good actor.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ad654a61e00008e0b7b1c88.jpeg?cache=92xoV8cK6b&ops=crop_521_334_1867_1074%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"WORLD NEWS","headline":"Here's The Truth About The Caravan Of Migrants Trump Keeps Going On About","authors":"Maya Averbuch and Sarah Kinosian","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/migrant-caravan-honduras-trump_us_5ad68870e4b03c426da93a2c","short_description":"“If I could offer something to my kids in Honduras, don’t you think I would be there?” one migrant said.","date":"2018-04-18"},"articleContent":["SAN PEDRO SULA, Honduras ― For the past two weeks, President Donald Trump and Fox News have taken turns warning Americans of a “big Caravan of People from Honduras” headed for the United States. As the “refugee caravan” makes its way through Mexico, Trump has insinuated the group will pour into the U.S. unchecked, bringing in drugs and crime, and he called for the National Guard to reinforce the border.","Trump’s warnings are detached from reality. Here’s the real story: The caravans have been organized since about 2008 to help migrants from Central America find refuge in the United States or Mexico. Eighty percent of the people who joined this year came from Honduras. And as chronic violence and a deep political crisis roil their home country, Trump’s harsh rhetoric and U.S. policy in the region have done little to deter them from seeking safety.","On March 25, the refugee caravan set off from southern Mexico with more than 1,000 migrants. On Friday, about 600 people embarked on the last leg of the trip, from Mexico City to the U.S. border.","Corruption, unrelenting violence and rampant inequality have long driven Hondurans to leave. But last year’s contested presidential election has eroded the little confidence Hondurans had in their government even more.","“Honduras was on fire and the election crisis threw gasoline on it,” said Joaquin Mejía, a Honduran security expert and human rights lawyer. “It unmasked the reality of the country ― our institutions are broken and the president, because of the elections, has no legitimacy.”","President Juán Orlando Hernández, a conservative U.S. ally, narrowly beat Salvador Nasralla, a sportscaster leading a left-wing coalition, on the Nov. 26 ballot. But amid reports of fraud and irregularities, thousands of Hondurans took to the streets. The Hernández government cracked down ruthlessly. The security forces, long marred by reports of extrajudicial killings, kidnapping and extortion, brutally put down the street protests. At least 22 civilians were killed amid the post-election protests.","Since the election, the government has intensified its crackdown on dissent. Security forces have detained protesters arbitrarily and intimidated members of the oppositions in their homes, human rights groups reported. Brenda Mejía, a lawyer for the human rights group ERIC, said her group has assisted 105 Hondurans fleeing political persecution in recent months.","As the government dealt with the uproar in the streets, the turmoil created an opening for the gangs. Criminal gangs have controlled large sections of Honduras since the 1990s, and their activities have contributed to making Honduras one of the deadliest places in the world. The homicide rate fell considerably under Hernández, from 88.5 murders per 100,000 inhabitants in 2011 to 43.6 per 100,000 in 2017, partly because of a fierce campaign from the Honduran security forces.","As the gangs stepped up their activities following the elections, the security forces responded in kind. In San Pedro Sula, a city in Honduras’ north where protests were most violent, citizens were caught in between.","“More people have been forced to leave because the gangs have reactivated in the chaos in the last few months to intensify recruitment and expand territory,” said Nahun Maldonado, who runs the San Padro Sula operations for World Vision, a nongovernmental organization that works with deportees.","“We are seeing kids who are also threatened and beaten by police, so they’re just leaving,” Maldonado continued. He added that the community has been worried by reports of youth disappearing after being picked up by police.","“We haven’t seen them since,” he said. “We don’t know if they were killed, or if the kids managed to flee to another country.”","Amid the worsening instability, chronic problems remain unresolved. Hernández’s first term was marred by allegations of human rights violations and corruption. State security agencies were involved in the murder of environmental activist Berta Caceres while Hernández’s 2013 campaign received funds from companies tied to the theft of millions from the country’s social security agency.","In the first months of Hernández’s second term, abuse and graft have continued unabated. In January, the National Congress moved to protect lawmakers from prosecution for embezzlement, after five of its own members were charged for lining their coffers with government funds for social programs in December.","Prior to the election, more than 60 percent of Hondurans remained unemployed or underemployed while over a quarter of youth ages 15-24 were not in schools or at jobs. Little has changed since. Reforms in education, health and infrastructure have remained elusive. To make matters worse, transportation shut down and exports were limited during the protests, leaving people who earned little income to scramble.","Amid the growing political instability and the disillusionment with the Hernández government, Mexico’s immigration agency reported a 168 percent jump in the number of Hondurans arriving from December to February; U.S. officials registered a 66 percent increase from December to March.","The stories of the Hondurans in this year’s refugee caravan ― families traveling with small children, single men with their few possessions stuffed in backpacks, teens who left their houses on their own ― drive home the severity of the crisis.","“If I could offer something to my kids in Honduras, don’t you think I would be there?” wondered Carlos Soto, 28, an appliance salesman from San Pedro Sula whose business closed. Soto spoke to HuffPost in early April from a soccer field in Matías Romero, Mexico, where the caravan stayed for nearly a week, while in negotiations with the Mexican government.","Esperánza, who is being identified by first name only to protect her identity, said gang members had kidnapped and raped her 18-year-old daughter after Esperánza was unable to pay the gangs the traditional “war tax” for her tortilla business. Even after leaving her home, in the manufacturing town of Choloma, the attacks on her family had continued.","“Eight days ago, they cut my nephew to pieces,” she told HuffPost as she walked down the highway on an early morning of the caravan.","Despite the reports of corruption and human rights violations, the United States continues to see Hernández as one of its closest allies in the region. The U.S. has provided millions of dollars in aid to the Hernández administration to stem violence, migrants and contraband. In 2017, on top of military aid, Honduras received a cut of a $655 million assistance package for Central America.","The Trump administration recognized Hernandez’s victory despite controversy over the vote and has stayed quiet on the growing instability in the country since. Two days after the contested election, the U.S. State Department certified Honduras had made progress on improving human rights and fighting corruption, paving the way for millions of dollars in aid to be released.","“While protesters were being shot dead in the street and the Organization of American States was calling out the Honduran government’s dirty tricks, the Trump administration chose to put its head in the sand and say there was nothing to see,” said Rep. Norma Torres (D-Calif.), the founder and co-chair of the Central America Caucus in the U.S. House.","Experts say the State Department thought its recognition of Hernández’s victory would bring some stability after a month of protests and no announced winner.","“Nobody thought there would be as much political violence afterward,” said Eric Olson, an expert on Central America at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, D.C.","Irineo Mujica, the director of Pueblo Sin Fronteras, the group that organizes the caravan, said the U.S. has turned a blind eye to the government’s role in the crisis and has failed to address “the roots of the problem.” Consistent arms sales continue to fuel violence from all sides, Mujica said, noting both the gangs and police use U.S. weapons. Due to lax U.S. gun laws, nearly 50 percent of weapons found and traced at crime scenes in Honduras originate from the United States. Mujica also criticized policy focusing on anti-trafficking initiatives instead of reducing demand for drugs in the U.S., which has yet to stem the flow of narcotics.","Trump has consistently conflated Central American migrants with members of gangs like MS-13, even though many Hondurans joined the caravan precisely to escape the gangs. And while migrants have a right under both international and U.S. law to seek asylum at the border, Trump has continuously voiced his opposition to their arrival. He urged Mexican authorities to prevent the caravan from reaching the United States, called for 4,000 members of the National Guard to be deployed to the border and urged U.S. lawmakers to vote for stricter immigration laws.","“I’m not a terrorist, not a Nazi, not anything of a sort. I’m just going to be one more person on American soil, but for Donald Trump that’s prohibited,” José, who is being identified by first name only to protect his identity, told HuffPost before boarding a series of trains and buses to the U.S.-Mexico border.","Sitting under a tree in a Mexican railroad town, pushing his brimmed hat back on his head to protect him from the sun, the lanky 18-year-old from San Pedro Sula told HuffPost four gang members cornered him in the door of a bus in January ― two in front of him and two behind. He recognized the sun tattoo on the arm of one, the image of the Virgin Mary on the arm of another. He remembered the exact words they used to threaten him: “If you don’t listen to us, we’re going to kill you. And you know that we’re in control wherever you go.”","The gang had tried to recruit him for months. They had promised him fancy clothes, new shoes and a more upscale lifestyle. When he refused, they beat him up, forcing him to move to a new school. As their stalking became more intense, he moved out of his mother’s neighborhood. They killed a cousin who worked on a transportation route and a man whom José considered to be like a grandfather. As far as he knows, the police never made arrests in either case.","The size of the caravan has dwindled in the past few weeks because many of the immigrants have ventured onward on their own. Many have decided to stay in Mexico, some with the intent of requesting a visa or refugee status there. On Friday, about 600 migrants continued the last part of the journey as a group, mainly by train.","José headed to the northern city of Ciudad Juárez, where he plans to save up money by working in house painting, car repair or construction, while living with other people he met through the caravan. He dreams of crossing into the United States, eventually: “I’m heading north, if God allows.”","Maya Averbuch reported from Matías Romero and Mexico City, Mexico.

Jude Harmon, founding pastor of The Vine, pointed to how Jesus used ordinary stories to preach the gospel ― parables about vineyards, day laborers, stewards, and other figures that would have been familiar to his audience. He said the upcoming Mass uses a familiar part of modern culture ― Beyoncé lyrics ― in the same way.","“Conservative Christians see a high wall separating the Church from the world; Progressive Christians do not,” Harmon told HuffPost in an email.","He said the Mass seeks to elevate the experiences of black women.","“The sad truth is that dominantly White churches, and even many traditional Black churches, have historically not done a good job of elevating and celebrating Black female voices,” Harmon said. “This isn’t just an oversight; in the language of our Christian faith, it’s a sin, and we’re called to repent.”","In recent years, Beyoncé has begun making more explicit references to female spirituality in her music and in her public persona. During her Grammy performance last year, she incorporated imagery from African, Hindu and Roman goddesses.","In July, Beyoncé ignited Instagram with a portrait of her holding her newborn twins, draped in a veil and flowing robes. The image provoked comparisons to the Virgin Mary, who for centuries has been represented as a white woman in Western art. Beyoncé’s portrait challenged the association of Mary, often seen as the ideal feminine figure, with whiteness.","Attendees at Grace Cathedral’s Beyoncé Mass will sing some of the performer’s top songs and hear Scripture read by women of color.

The 86-year-old has been grooming his vice president, 57-year-old Miguel Diaz-Canel, to take his place. Castro has said, however, that he intends to remain as head of the Communist Party.","On Wednesday, the Cuban General Assembly nominated Diaz-Canel, an engineer and former education minister, as the sole candidate to succeed Castro as president. The nomination will be voted on later Wednesday and formally announced Thursday, Reuters reports. Diaz-Canel is expected to be approved with almost total unanimity.","“To have someone without the family name or the same aura of revolutionary is a historic shift,” Geoff Thale of the Washington Office of Latin America told ABC News of the impending vote.","If elected, the new president will inherit a country in the throes of change and mired in financial troubles. Observers have questioned whether Diaz-Canel will be up to the challenge to continue the social and economic reforms initiated during his predecessor’s tenure, particularly without the clout of the Castro name. Some have wondered if he may even backtrack on some reforms.","“People in Cuba really haven’t processed yet what it means to have a government without Raúl or Fidel leading it,” Yassel Padron Kunakbaeva, a 27-year-old Marxist blogger, told The Associated Press this week. “We’re entering unknown territory.”","Cuban experts have described Diaz-Canel as a “party ideologue” and “pragmatist” who is not expected to push for dramatic political change. In fact, observers say, Diaz-Canel’s ideology appears, if anything, to have hardened in recent years. He recently spoke out against the historic detente between the U.S. and Cuba achieved during President Barack Obama’s tenure, calling it “a different way [for the U.S.] to try to reach its final objective to destroy the revolution.”","Diaz-Canel is “not there to break the china or disrupt the political system,” Thale told ABC. “But he is going to face serious economic problems and questions of his legitimacy.”","As president, Raúl Castro took steps to modernize Cuba’s centrally planned economy — an unfinished effort that’s yielded mixed results. The private sector was expanded, and fallow state-owned land was leased out to farmers, among other reforms.","Castro also oversaw the historic thaw in relations with the U.S. and introduced new — though still limited — social freedoms, such as expanding internet access and allowing Cubans to travel and own cellphones.","But the Cuban economy has remained sluggish, growing by just 2.4 percent per year on average over the past decade — well short of the 7 percent annual growth that government officials say is necessary for the country to develop, according to Reuters. The inefficient Soviet-style state economy still employs three out of every four Cuban workers, who earn an average of $30 a month.","Infrastructure is crumbling, foreign investment is lagging and any hope that Cubans may have pegged on a warmer relationship with the U.S. has faltered as renewed tensions have emerged under President Donald Trump. The state also continues to quash free expression and stifle dissent.","William Leogrande, a professor and Latin America expert at the American University School of Public Affairs, said Raul Castro’s legacy hinges on how well his successor is able to grow Cuba’s economy and continue his path of reform.","“If the updating fails, Raul will be remembered as just one more reform communist who couldn’t force the system to change despite his best efforts,” Leogrande told Reuters.","Castros have ruled Cuba since 1959, when Fidel Castro was first sworn in as prime minister.

Frederick said it was an “honor and privilege” to welcome Boseman back.","“His recent role in the blockbuster film ‘Black Panther’ reminds us of the excellence found in the African diaspora and how places like Howard are hidden, untapped gems producing the next generation of scientists, engineers and doctors,” Frederick said in the statement. “Mr. Boseman exemplifies the monumental heights and levels Howard graduates can achieve by using the skills and knowledge they acquired at the university.”","In February, while promoting “Black Panther,” Boseman told The Chicago Tribune that the essence of Wakanda, the film’s fictional black utopia, exists at the HBCU.","“It is a Wakanda to a certain degree. There is definitely a lot of T’Challa there,” he said. “If you have a blanketed idea of what it means to be of African descent and you go to Howard University, you’re meeting people from all over the diaspora — from the Caribbean, any country in Africa, in Europe. So you’re seeing people from all walks of life that look like you but they sound different.”","The university’s announcement comes just weeks after the HBCU dominated headlines because of a financial scandal. Shortly after a whistleblower posted a blog post accusing the school of mishandling student funds, Frederick announced that six university employees had been fired for allegedly misappropriating financial aid money. Student activists occupied the administration building for nine days before coming to an agreement with university officials.","The school’s commencement will take place on May 12."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ad89b7e1e0000fb077b1f41.jpeg?cache=O7ahw9V1C0&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Missouri Gov.

He obsessively checked Twitter accounts of alt-right figures and Fox News pundits.","The day after the attack, 27-year-old Bissonette told a police interrogator he committed one of Canada’s worst mass shootings in decades to stop refugees from resettling in the country. He believed they’d carry out terror attacks and kill his family.","Bissonnette is currently awaiting sentence in a Quebec court after pleading guilty to six counts of first-degree murder last month. Up until the release of his online history, the full extent of his infatuation with the radical right wasn’t known. Discussions of his motive were often muddied with characterizations of him as a nerdy and isolated young man.","But experts say the evidence that has emerged during the trial highlights how in Canada, both society and law enforcement treat Islamist and far-right attackers fundamentally differently ― a dynamic that downplays the danger of the far-right.","“If Bissonnette was a jihadist attacking a church and it was found out that he Googled Anwar al-Awlaki and he Googled ISIS, that would have been the end of any discussion about motive,” said Amarnath Amarasingam, a senior research fellow at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a counter-extremism think tank.","An Islamist-inspired attack in the U.S. or Canada is often followed by an instant public demand for information about the assailant’s links to terror groups, the media they viewed and any interactions they had with other extremists. But that’s not always the case when it comes to far-right attackers such as Bissonnette, whose actions are treated as anomalies that are the product of mental health issues.","“It’s not simply isolated cases of individuals who decide to do random things. Much like global jihadism, there is a global extreme-right movement that has its own network of writers and thinkers and activists and groups,” Amarasingam said. “It’s about time that we start thinking about these individual cases as part of that broader network as well, and see how these groups are impacting these kids.”","Despite ample evidence of Bissonnette’s political ideology and advance planning of the attack, prosecutors chose to not try him on terrorism charges. Media and the court proceedings have also heavily focused on Bissonnette’s mental health, after he claimed to be suicidal and suffering anxiety issues in his guilty plea.","A court-ordered psychiatric assessment of Bissonnette last month found him fit to stand trial. A prison social worker testified this week that rather than showing remorse, Bissonnette told her that he carried out the attack for “glory” and regretted not killing more people.","“In cases of extreme right-wing violence and terrorism, there is a stronger tendency in Western countries to look for mental health issues and an isolated individual as explanation,” said Daniel Koehler, director of the German Institute on Radicalization and De-Radicalization Studies.","Instead, experts say there should also be a focus on what kind of media and extremist networks contribute to a far-right terrorist’s radicalization. Chalking up far-right, predominately white, attackers as simply a product of isolation, bullying and mental health issues ignores important ideological factors that would be the focus in another kind of attack.","In Bissonnette’s case, it’s become clear that he feverishly sought out anti-Islam and anti-refugee viewpoints as well as information on how to commit acts of mass violence.","Along with Trump and alt-right Twitter accounts, Bissonnette looked up other mass shootings, including Dylann Roof’s 2015 killing of nine black churchgoers in South Carolina and Montreal’s 1985 École Polytechnique massacre, where Marc Lépine killed 14 women in an anti-feminist attack.","“It’s quite clear from his browser history, from all that’s been reported, that he was very much inspired and influenced by the Trump-esque rhetoric,” said Dr. Barbara Perry, professor in social science and humanities at University of Ontario Institute of Technology and expert on the far-right.","“We would be making arguments about the role of the internet in radicalization if we were looking at someone’s Islamist-inspired extremism,” Perry said. “That seems to be a little watered down in this particular case.”","Activist groups, including refugee support organizations, also said after the attack that Bissonnette was known online for harassing their members. He often also posted anti-feminist and anti-Islam views. But for years Bissonnette was written off as just another internet troll or isolated bigot, rather than someone who was potentially on a path toward extremism.","“In many respects Bissonnette’s views, not his actions obviously, are very in line with the history of Islamophobia nationally,” Perry said.","“It’s harder to point the finger at someone like Bissonnette, which is pointing the finger at ourselves.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ad64c5b1f0000260616d64d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"BLACK VOICES","headline":"Black Men Arrested At Starbucks Said They Were There For 2 Minutes Before 911 Call","authors":"Hayley Miller","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/black-men-speak-out-starbucks-arrest_us_5ad8809fe4b0e4d0715dc393","short_description":"\"We wasn’t read any rights ― nothing,” said Donte Robinson. \"Just double-lock handcuffs behind our backs and escorted out and put into a squad car.”","date":"2018-04-19"},"articleContent":["The two black men arrested at a Starbucks in Philadelphia last week while waiting for a friend spoke out publicly for the first time Thursday, revealing the store manager called 911 two minutes after they arrived.","Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson walked into the Starbucks on April 12 at approximately 4:35 p.m., they told ABC’s “Good Morning America.” Nelson said he immediately asked the store manager if he could use the bathroom, but was told restrooms were for paying customers only.","Nelson said he “left it at that” and joined Robinson at a table to wait for their friend to arrive for their scheduled 4:45 p.m. business meeting. The Starbucks manager then approached the men and asked if they wanted to order something, according to Robinson, and they declined.","At 4:37 p.m., approximately two minutes after they had arrived, the manager called 911.","″They can’t be here for us,” said Robinson, recalling his initial reaction when police officers entered the Starbucks a few minutes later.","“As soon as they approached us, they just said we had to leave,” Nelson said. “There was no question of, you know, ’Was there a problem here between you and the manager? [or] ‘What happened?’”","Police didn’t explain why they were being arrested, Robinson said.","“We wasn’t read any rights ― nothing,” Robinson said. “Just double-lock handcuffs behind our backs and escorted out and put into a squad car.”","Video showing the men’s arrests went viral over the weekend, sparking protests at the store and calls to boycott Starbucks.\n\n“The police were called because these men hadn’t ordered anything,” Melissa DePino, a writer who recorded the incident, tweeted last week. “They were waiting for a friend to show up, who did as they were taken out in handcuffs for doing nothing. All the other white ppl are wondering why it’s never happened to us when we do the same thing.”\n\nThe store manager who called 911 has since left the company, according to Starbucks. Company CEO Kevin Johnson has publicly apologized and vowed to “fix” the issue, in part with more training for store managers on company guidelines and unconscious bias.\n\nMore than 8,000 Starbucks locations will be closed next month so employees can receive racial bias training, the company announced Tuesday.","Nelson and Robinson spent hours in a jail cell after their arrests, The Associated Press reported. They were released around midnight after the district attorney declined to prosecute them for trespassing.\n\n“You go from being someone who’s just trying to be an entrepreneur, having your own dreams and aspirations, and then this happens,” Nelson told AP. “How do you handle it? Do you stand up? Do you fight? Do you sit down and just watch everyone else fight for you? Do you let it slide, like we let everything else slide with injustice?”\n\nThe two men are now involved in mediation with Starbucks, which they hope will lead to lasting change, such as requiring a customer bill of rights to be posted in stores and new policies for customer ejections and racial profiling.\n\n“This is something that has been going on for years and everyone’s blind to it, but they know what’s going on, if you get what I mean” Nelson said. He added that he and Robinson hope to “help people understand that it’s not just a black people thing ― it’s a people thing.

Andrew Cuomo (D) signed an executive order on Wednesday to restore voting rights to New York felons on parole.","New York and 47 other states strip people of the right to vote when they’re convicted of a felony. In the Empire State, felons can vote again once they’ve completed their sentence, which previously included any time on parole.","The governor’s office notes that there are currently about 35,000 people in New York who have been barred from voting while on parole following a felony conviction.","The governor announced the executive order during a speech at the National Action Network’s annual convention. Standing next to him was former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, who leads the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, a group focused on voting rights issues.","Cuomo said the state legislature had failed to make the change, so he would act alone.","“I’m unwilling to take no for an answer, I’m gonna make it law by executive order and I announce that here today,” the governor said to a standing ovation.","The executive order will apply to those currently on parole and those who will become eligible for it in the future. The state’s Department of Corrections and Community Supervision will begin by submitting a list of those now on parole to the governor’s office. Starting May 1, the department will produce a monthly list of those newly on parole. Those individuals will be reviewed to determine whether they will receive a conditional pardon restoring voting rights.","In the United States overall, there were more than 6.1 million people in 2016 who had been disenfranchised due to felony convictions, according to the Sentencing Project. The idea of stripping the right to vote from criminals dates back to ancient Greece and Rome. Several U.S. states began to adopt felon disenfranchisement laws around the Civil War as a way of targeting black voters. In 2016, 1 in every 13 African-Americans were disenfranchised, four times the rate of other Americans.","Cuomo’s decision comes as he faces a primary challenge from actress-activist Cynthia Nixon, who has positioned herself as more progressive than the governor. Some have criticized Cuomo for not doing enough to expand voting rights in New York.","Nixon issued a dismissive statement Wednesday afternoon, saying Cuomo’s executive order was long overdue.","“For eight years, Cuomo governed like a Republican ― handing control of our state to his ultra-rich donors and the party of Trump. Now he’s scared of communities all across New York who want to replace him with a real Democrat. We don’t buy the Governor’s new song-and-dance routine. Voter suppression in New York should have ended eight years ago, from the rights of parolees to access to early voting and automatic registration,” she said.","On Thursday, Cuomo spokeswoman Hazel Crampton-Hays said the governor’s office would immediately begin assessing the eligibility of people on parole for conditional pardons based on a “set of basic criteria.” Those individuals don’t have to apply to have their voting rights restored, she said, and those deemed eligible would automatically receive their pardons.","The story has been updated with statements from Cynthia Nixon and a Cuomo spokeswoman."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ad76dc9200000d30ceb50bf.jpeg?cache=oIQTxUzSZ3&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Trump Asks For Extension To File His 2017 Tax Return","authors":"Nick Visser","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-tax-returns-extension_us_5ad6ea79e4b03c426da95d48","short_description":"“He will file his tax return by the extension deadline.\"","date":"2018-04-18"},"articleContent":["President Donald Trump will not file his 2017 tax returns by the federal deadline and has requested an extension from the Internal Revenue Service, the White House announced on Tuesday.","“The president filed an extension for his 2017 tax return, as do many Americans with complex returns,” White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said. “He will file his tax return by the extension deadline of October 15, 2018.”","The White House did not disclose why Trump needed more time to prepare his returns.","The IRS extended the tax filing deadline an additional day after a glitch temporarily shut down its online payment system on Tuesday.","“This is the busiest tax day of the year, and the IRS apologizes for the inconvenience this system issue caused for taxpayers,” David Kautter, the agency’s acting commissioner, said in a statement. “The IRS appreciates everyone’s patience during this period.

Here's how he feels about that night, the gun debate and more.","date":"2018-04-18"},"articleContent":["You may call Jason Aldean his own worst critic.","The country star will often listen to his music over and over, or watch tapings of his performances.","“I pick all my stuff apart. I listen to it a lot. But I do that with everything,” Aldean told HuffPost. If we have a live performance on TV, I go back and watch it and go, ‘I should have done this different or that different. Or I should have done this here.’ I analyze everything.”\n","Aldean did that with his new album, “Rearview Town,” released on Friday. The title track, in particular, is one he analyzed a lot before releasing it. Though, now it appears he listens to it more for enjoyment that anything else. He likes its relatable premise about “leaving your hometown and putting the past behind you and moving on to something else down the road that maybe you couldn’t achieve in your hometown.”","For his eighth studio album, Aldean wanted to “push the envelope,” similar to what he did with his self-titled debut in 2005.","“Early on in my career when we would make records we had a little bit of an ‘anything goes’ mentality as far as songs, and finding songs that let us step outside the box — from what everybody else was doing,” he said. “I think on the last couple of albums we played it safe ... I just wanted to get back to finding and recording songs where people would never know what’s going to come next.”","The new set of 15 songs includes a mix of sounds ranging from country and blues to rock and hip-hop. It also features an appearance by Miranda Lambert on “Drowns the Whiskey.” The two previously collaborated on “Grown Woman” from Aldean’s 2007 sophomore effort. The trickiest part this time involved making sure he found the right track to introduce to Lambert.","“I actually sent her a song before I sent her ‘Drowns the Whiskey,’ and she just wasn’t loving it. She didn’t hate it. She didn’t love it. I told her if you’re going to sing on it, I want it to be something that you really like,” Aldean recalled.\n","Luckily, Lambert fell in love with “Drowns the Whiskey.” It’s a more traditional song ― something right in her wheelhouse, Aldean said.","“One thing a lot of people don’t know about her is that she’s a really great harmony singer. Like really good,” Aldean said. “She doesn’t necessarily sing it like if I brought in a background singer. But that’s what makes it cool. It’s very stylistic, and you can tell that it’s her. We had her come in and cranked her into the mix and it sounded great. Highlight of the record for sure.”","This album is Aldean’s first release since the Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas in October. Aldean was performing onstage at the country music fest when a gunman started shooting from a nearby hotel room, killing 58 people and injuring hundreds. It was the nation’s deadliest mass shooting in modern history.","Although the new songs were neither influenced nor inspired by Vegas (he completed them prior to Route 91), Aldean does mention the victims and survivors of the massacre in the liner notes; he doesn’t want people to forget what happened that night.","“I feel like a lot of times it becomes less and less of a headline as times goes on. For me, it was a way to acknowledge people that were there and let them know that a lot of time has passed now, but it’s still something I think about. I think about those people every day, and that night, I still think about all the time.”","In the days after the shooting, Aldean visited hospitals and met with survivors, something that impacts him to this day.","“I don’t think you can go through something like that and have it not change you. It’s a life-altering kind of thing. It made me view a lot of things differently,” he said. “I think going and talking to some of the victims and their families and seeing the spirit that those people had was pretty amazing to see. I was going through my own stuff in private and dealing with all of it. But to go talk to all the people and see the way they were dealing with it — that had been shot. They were in great spirits and just glad to be alive. I was like, ‘Oh man, maybe I’m looking at this all wrong.’ It really helped me have a different view on it. But it’s tough. I don’t know if you ever really get over it. Hopefully it gets better.”","Since the Vegas shooting, a lot of talk has surrounded gun control ― with eyes on the country music community. Aldean, a gun owner himself, recently said it’s too easy to get guns.","“When you can walk in somewhere and you can get one in five minutes, do a background check that takes five minutes, like how in-depth is that background check? Those are the issues I have. It’s not necessarily the guns themselves or that I don’t think people should have guns,” he told The Associated Press. “I have a lot of them.”","But when pressed on the hot-button gun debate during our interview, Aldean didn’t want to elaborate.","“I feel like it gets taken out of context, and the headline becomes that I speak out on gun control. ... I’m not saying that people should have their guns taken away,” he said. “Because I don’t think that. It’s just one of those things ― it’s like a no-win. For me, I’ve said my piece on that and people can take it for what they want to.”","With that, Aldean wants to focus on his new music and his return to the stage, with a major tour kicking off in May. Playing live is still where he feels most at ease.","“I know I’m not the best singer,” Aldean, ever the self-critic, said. “That’s my thing ― you put me onstage and you put me in front of people, that’s where I’m comfortable.”","Now, more than a decade into his career, Aldean continues to attract a large audience. Over the weekend, he returned to Las Vegas for the Academy of Country Music Awards, where he took home Entertainer of the Year for the third consecutive time.","“I feel like I’m able to pick songs that work for me,” he said about his success, adding, “and being able to work hard when you do get the opportunities and take advantage of things and be able to sustain it.”\n"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ad6551f1e000008087b1c89.jpeg?cache=GK85OzC7cs&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"IRS Extends Tax Filing Deadline An Additional Day After Site Glitch","authors":"Antonia Blumberg","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/irs-tax-filing-deadline-april-18_us_5ad67da0e4b029ebe01eea2a","short_description":"Good news for all you procrastinators.","date":"2018-04-18"},"articleContent":["The Internal Revenue Service is giving American taxpayers another day to file their taxes after a glitch temporarily shut down its online payment site on deadline day.","“This is the busiest tax day of the year, and the IRS apologizes for the inconvenience this system issue caused for taxpayers,” David Kautter, the agency’s acting commissioner, said in a statement. “The IRS appreciates everyone’s patience during this period.

But following their escape and eventual landing in the U.S., they were met with fierce anti-Chinese sentiment and strict immigration policies targeting those from China. The six were ultimately turned away at Ellis Island.","Their story is the subject of an upcoming documentary, “The Six,” to be released later this year. The film’s chief researcher, Steven Schwankert, told the South China Morning Post that his team hopes to set the record straight and address the attitudes that obscured the fate of the six travelers.","“Six Chinese guys made it off the Titanic alive and 24 hours later were written out of the story,” Schwankert said. “That wasn’t an accident. That was deliberate. It’s something that the culture of the time made happen.”","The passengers, who appeared to be from southern China, boarded the British ship in the English city of Southampton. In line with the way many ships handled third-class passengers a century ago, all eight of their names were written on a single ticket.","After the crash into an iceberg, four of the men escaped aboard the final lifeboat, according to news site Quartz. One made it onto another lifeboat while another, who was reportedly named Fang Lang, was picked up after being spotted floating in the wreckage. Records reveal that even that rescue was tinged with racism.","Officer Harold Lowe, who manned lifeboat 14, was said to have hesitated over saving the Chinese passenger, whom he called a “Jap,” a derogatory term used to describe individuals of Japanese descent.","“What’s the use?” Lowe said, according to lifeboat passenger Charlotte Collyer as reported in Encyclopedia Titanica. “He’s dead, likely, and if he isn’t, there’s others better worth saving than a Jap!”","But other passengers convinced Lowe to act. After he recovered his strength, Fang Lang proved to be a valuable member of the lifeboat and “worked like a hero,” rowing until they were rescued, Collyer later said. Lowe soon walked back his comments.","In part because most of the Chinese men survived the sinking of the Titanic ― even though women and children had been prioritized in the rush to the lifeboats ― their appearance in the U.S. was greatly scrutinized. A story in a 1912 issue of the Brooklyn Eagle offers a snapshot of the anti-Chinese bias aimed at the six men. Referring to them as “creatures” and “coolies,” the newspaper claimed that some of them were “found, wedged beneath the seats” of the lifeboats.","But documentary director Arthur Jones doesn’t believe that is accurate.","“We visited a large number of foreign archives and museums, worked with historians from the United States and China, searched and studied many [pieces of] evidence,” he told Xinhua News Agency. “There is no single [piece of] evidence to prove the Chinese survivors were stowaways [on the lifeboats]. I believe they did not do anything dishonorable.”","Other Western media outlets at the time also claimed that the Chinese passengers disguised themselves as women to escape the doomed ship ― another detail that the team producing “The Six” don’t buy.","“The press at the time labeled the Chinese survivors, referred to in places as ‘celestials,’ as cowards who dressed as women to sneak into lifeboats,” Schwankert told Quartz. “They had no basis for that, and we believe it’s just not true. … It’s time for these men to have their rightful place in history.”","Unlike the other passengers, these six survivors were ordered to leave the U.S. A century ago, American immigration policy was firmly set against the Chinese. The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 had initially barred all immigration of Chinese laborers for 10 years; the discriminatory policy was extended in 1892 by the Geary Act and made permanent in 1902 with even further restrictions. (The policy would not be ended until 1943 when China was a World War II ally.)","Little is known about the lives of the six men after their expulsion from the U.S. Their stories were mostly forgotten and if they were brought up in the press, “it was to say they did something dishonorable,” Jones told the South China Morning Post.","With the help of a social media campaign, however, the documentarians set out to track down their descendants. It was a difficult task, given that the survivors’ names have been recorded with varying spellings. But the team did make headway, according to the South China Morning Post. Their research led them from Wisconsin to the port city of Guangzhou.","Soon, the passengers will receive the treatment they deserve.","“We don’t accept the reports and the history as it is presented. The six Chinese men have been put into a position of injustice for more than a hundred years. We can finally tell their story rightly,” Schwankert told Xinhua.","For more on the film, head to the Facebook page for “The Six” here."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ad7a9e41e00008e0b7b1e25.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"QUEER VOICES","headline":"LGBTQ Advocates Hope Theresa May's 'Regret' Over Anti-Gay Laws Will Prompt Change","authors":"Meka Beresford, Reuters","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/theresa-may-lgbtq-laws_us_5ad75f76e4b0e4d0715c768a","short_description":"“It’s time to listen, learn, and heal.”","date":"2018-04-18"},"articleContent":["LONDON, April 17 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - LGBT campaigners were hopeful on Tuesday that a call by British Prime Minister Theresa May for Commonwealth countries to reform outdated anti-gay legislation would help to stop widespread persecution and discrimination.","Speaking as leaders of the 53 Commonwealth nations met in London, May said she “deeply” regretted the UK’s role in fuelling “discrimination, violence and even death” as nobody should be persecuted for “who they are or who they love.”","About 37 of the 53 mostly former British colonies still have colonial era laws which criminalize lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) identities with same sex sexual activity punishable by life imprisonment in nine of those countries.","LGBT campaigners have used the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) to call for Britain to apologise and push for change, launching a petition, a picket and lighting up the Houses of Parliament with a call for decriminalisation.","Activists said they hoped May’s comments would start to change the conversation in countries where LGBT people are treated as criminals and help to reverse the harm caused.","Jamaican activist Glenroy Murray said May’s comments were a “necessary step in acknowledging and expressing regret about a historical reality that has impacted LGBT people everywhere.”","Rosanna Flamer-Caldera, executive director of Sri Lankan LGBT organisation Equal Ground, said the speech “paves the way for making some positive change for the LGBT communities of the Commonwealth”, nations home to about 2.4 billion people.\n\n“I welcome this acknowledgement of the deep wounds left in our countries by bad colonial laws, wounds from which many of us are still bleeding today,” Malaysian activist Pang Khee Teik told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n\n“It’s time to listen, learn, and heal.”\n\nSome activists, however, did not think May’s comments would lead to permanent change even though she said Britain would support any country wanting reform.\n\n“I am all to aware that these laws were often put in place by my own country, They were wrong then and they are wrong now,” May said.\n\nFounder of NAZ Male Health Alliance in Pakistan, Qasim Iqbal, said May needed to create a policy on how the British government would help end discrimination.\n\n“The prime minister needs to now present an advocacy framework on what role the UK government will play in ensuring that the entire Commonwealth is a place where people have the freedom to love a person of their choice,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

In it, the three seemed perturbed by the proposal to place the sculpture near the Washington Monument for three months.","“Have you heard about this?” Callista Gingrich, now the U.S. ambassador to the Holy See, wrote to her husband. Newt Gingrich asked Christensen in an email later that day whether it was real.","“Unfortunately, yes it’s true,” Christensen responded. “Still needing approval and funding so nothing definitive yet.” She provided links to several news articles on the proposal.","Gingrich pinged Zinke a few hours later, passing along the email chain without comment. The subject: “Are you aware of this newt.”","The emails were released this week as part of a public information request.","Zinke forwarded Gingrich’s email to one of his staffers the following day, with the message: “Pls contact Mr Speaker and arrange for an office visit. I hour. The subj is monuments. I had ta ked (sic) to him at the WH. Late in the day would be preferred.”","It’s unclear if the two ever met — Gingrich is not listed on Zinke’s calendar between October and February — and if they did, whether the statue was part of that conversation. It’s possible that Gingrich’s email simply reminded Zinke to meet with Gingrich about national monuments; Gingrich later wrote a blog post on his website applauding Zinke and President Donald Trump for gutting Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments in Utah.","Three weeks after Gingrich’s email to Zinke, the National Park Service, which Zinke oversees, blocked a request from organizers of Catharsis on the Mall, a three-day art and music festival held in November, to install the 45-foot-tall statue. The group planned to keep the statue up for 91 days.","In a letter to the group on Oct. 25, the service’s acting regional director, Rick Obernesser, said the exhibit was “likely to significantly damage the underlying turf” and “have an adverse effect on the aesthetics, including the cultural identity, of the area.”","The sculpture, which debuted at the Burning Man festival in 2015, was slated to go up in front of the Washington Monument, facing the White House and the Capitol. The artist, Marco Cochrane, has said the piece is aimed at de-objectifying women and raising awareness about violence against women.","“What I see missing in the world is an appreciation and respect for feminine energy and power that results when women are free and safe,” Cochrane said in a statement about the piece. “It seems obvious to me that feminine energy is being suppressed and this must change.”","Contacted Wednesday, an Interior Department spokeswoman referred HuffPost to an official at the National Park Service, who forwarded along the agency’s October statement explaining its decision to grant a permit for the event but not allow the nude statue. The Interior spokeswoman did not answer questions about whether Zinke discussed the proposal with Gingrich or was involved in NPS’ final decision.","The Gingriches and Christensen did not respond to HuffPost’s requests for comment.","In an October release, organizers of Catharsis on the Mall blasted the park service for what it described as a “sudden last-minute retraction” and threatened legal action. In its letter to the group, the park service said its earlier approval of a height variance for the statue had been an “error.”","Event organizers ultimately improvised.

Jeff Merkley (Ore.) and Chris Murphy (Conn.) plan on Wednesday to introduce the “Choose Medicare Act,” which would launch a new, enhanced version of traditional Medicare. It would be available both to individual consumers buying their own coverage and employers who offer coverage to employees.","It’s possible to imagine Medicare Part E, as Merkley and Murphy propose to call the new program, someday absorbing most working-age people who don’t qualify for Medicaid. If that happened, the American health care system would more closely resemble the kind of “single-payer” system that exists in some countries abroad and many progressives would prefer to have in the United States.","Of course, whether Medicare Part E would really prove as attractive as Merkley and Murphy say ― and precisely what trade-offs the full legislation would entail ― remain very much open questions.","Medicare Part E would include two features of commercial insurance that traditional Medicare, which serves seniors, does not: a limit on out-of-pocket spending and coverage of pediatric services.","It would have to finance itself, with premiums from beneficiaries covering outlays, just like a private insurance plan would. Medicare Part E would benefit from some of Medicare’s efficiencies ― among other things, by paying less for services than commercial insurance typically does. Merkley and Murphy are counting on that differential to make Medicare Part E competitive on price and coverage.","Consumers who buy coverage on their own could get Medicare Part E through HealthCare.gov or one of the state-run exchanges, using federal tax credits if they qualify. The tax credits would actually be more generous, and available to people at higher incomes, than they are under the current law.","The legislation wouldn’t only help people who opt into Medicare E. People who buy coverage on the exchanges but prefer to stick with private insurance would also be eligible for the bigger, more widely available tax credits.","Seniors would also get something. The Merkley-Murphy bill gives traditional Medicare a cap on out-of-pocket expenses, something it currently lacks.","Bolstering the subsidies and traditional Medicare would require additional funds. And if history is any guide, making all of these numbers add up would prove difficult once the legislation is subject to more detailed analysis. As details of the plan became more clear, it would likely generate political opposition.","Doctors, hospitals, drugmakers and other health care industry actors would inevitably warn, rightly or wrongly, that less revenue will mean closures, layoffs and waits for services.","But the specifics of the proposal probably matter less than what they signal about the Democratic Party’s thinking these days, as leaders in the party talk less about defending the Affordable Care Act’s coverage gains and more about improving on them.","Back in 2009 and 2010, when President Barack Obama and his congressional allies wrote the law, the question was whether to include a public insurance plan as an option exclusively for people buying coverage on their own. Even an exceedingly modest version of the idea couldn’t get through the Senate.","But now, virtually all Democrats talk about creating new government-run insurance programs or expanding existing ones. The only question is how big they will be and what role they will play.","The most ambitious idea for these programs comes from Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent who caucuses with Democrats. He is a long-time advocate for creating a new, more comprehensive version of Medicare that would, within a few years, enroll everybody.","Merkley was among the 16 Democrats who co-sponsored the bill Sanders introduced this past September. “I am very supportive of the vision for Medicare-for-all and I want us to find a path to get there,” he said during a conference call with reporters on Tuesday.","Murphy, by contrast, did not co-sponsor the Sanders bill. He said on Tuesday that he preferred to make enrollment voluntary, although he fully expects a lot of volunteers.","“I think this is a way for the market to decide whether a Medicare plan or private sector plans are better for businesses and families,” Murphy said, adding that he expects most Americans “would choose to buy a Medicare plan” in the end."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ad7757b1e00003b137b1de9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Trump’s Latest Foreign Policy Chaos Further Diminishes U.S. Standing, Critics Worry","authors":"S.V.

In the grand scheme of things, it’s more important than the awesome power of our military, intelligence community, and diplomatic corps,” said Ned Price, a former CIA analyst and a National Security Council spokesman under President Barack Obama. “And President Trump has squandered any credibility he once had, both at home and abroad.”","Nicholas Burns, a top State Department official under President George W. Bush, said Trump’s careless talk is actively damaging the nation. “We’re living through a chaos presidency,” he said. “It’s destabilizing the country, and it’s hurting our foreign and military policy.”","White House officials did not respond to HuffPost’s queries on this topic. In the past, they have denied that Trump changes positions or, alternatively, have argued that his unpredictability makes him effective.","For an administration notorious for its inconstant policy choices, the reversals of the past week and a half have been noteworthy nevertheless:","On April 9, Trump vowed that Russia, Iran and anyone else involved with the Syrian government’s suspected use of chemical weapons days earlier would “pay a price.” In an April 11 tweet, Trump even taunted Russia: “Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria. Get ready Russia, because they will be coming, nice and new and ‘smart!’” Yet when U.S. missiles flew last Friday, the strike was similar to those launched a year ago in response to an earlier chemical weapons attack. Russian and Iranian troops and equipment were not targeted.\n\nOn Sunday, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley announced that the United States would be unveiling new sanctions against Russia because of its alliance with Syrian leader Bashar Assad. On Monday, Trump’s new economic adviser said that was not the case and claimed Haley was confused, to Haley’s consternation. The adviser later backtracked, saying Haley “was certainly not confused” but that “the policy was changed and she wasn’t told about it.”\n\nLast Thursday, Trump declared at a meeting with farm state senators that he wanted to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade agreement among North American, Latin American and East Asian nations that Trump campaigned against and withdrew from in his first days in office. On Tuesday morning ― just prior to hosting meetings with the leader of one of those nations, Japan ― Trump declared on Twitter that the U.S. wouldn’t be entering the TPP after all. “While Japan and South Korea would like us to go back into TPP, I don’t like the deal for the United States,” he wrote.","Sen. Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican and retiring chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he has become desensitized to Trump’s frequent reversals and zigzags. “Forget sanctions on Russia, I can name probably 10 other things where if one day we’re doing one thing, the next day we’re doing another,” he said Wednesday at a breakfast sponsored by The Christian Science Monitor.","The reason for the chaos, say those close to the White House, is Trump himself. He has little knowledge of issues important to the running of the nation, and little interest in acquiring it, they said. Despite this, he often has strong opinions on a variety of issues, which are prone to change with regularity.","“Just another day at the White House,” said one official on condition of anonymity.","On top of the ignorance, they add, is the mendacity ― the president’s willingness to say false things when he believes it suits his purpose.","“He lies as often as he breathes,” laughed one Republican close to the White House, also on condition of anonymity.","Trump last month bragged about his willingness to lie at a fundraising dinner. During a conversation with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Trump told Republican donors, he challenged one of Trudeau’s statements about the two countries’ trade balance. “I didn’t even know... I had no idea. I just said, ‘You’re wrong,’” he boasted.","Burns said that foreign officials who speak with him continue to express dismay about Trump’s behavior.","“People, even 15 months in, are still stunned that someone of such low character could have been elected president of the United States,” he said, adding that Trump seems not to understand or care that the entire planet, not just his voting base, is listening to and reading his words.","“His audience is not just his supporters. His audience is the Russian foreign minister. It’s the Chinese government,” Burns said. “He’s firing off tweets right and left, with little regard for facts and context.”","The result, for foreign policy officials both inside and outside the United States, is likely to be ongoing confusion about the country’s positions on a variety of issues, from trade to Syria.","Corker said the problem is not as bad as it might be, because actual U.S. policy is carried out by officials at the State Department and the Pentagon, in accordance with direction from Congress and in line with previous policy. Regarding sanctions against Russia, for instance, U.S. policy has been tougher than Trump seems to want. “I see the things we’re actually doing, and they’re pretty strong,” Corker said.","But Tom Nichols, a Russia scholar at the Naval War College, said the chasm between Trump and the rest of the U.S. government in so many areas is not healthy.","“In this administration, our allies can’t rely on the messages from the people they usually deal with, because they have no idea what will come out of the White House,” he said. “Usually, it doesn’t get as far as the split on Russian sanctions between Haley and the White House. That was pretty dramatic. Our allies, unfortunately, are now trying to navigate a world that is effectively devoid of American leadership.”","Akbar Shahid Ahmed contributed to this report.","CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the date of Trump’s tweet on the TPP and the date of the Christian Science Monitor breakfast."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ad7b0761e00003b137b1e30.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Staff At George Soros' Foundation Secures Union Contract","authors":"Dave Jamieson","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/staff-at-george-soros-foundation-secures-union-contract_us_5ad760c6e4b03c426daa7d95","short_description":"The group, a major donor to progressive movements, appears to be the first large U.S. private foundation to unionize.","date":"2018-04-18"},"articleContent":["The stated goal of the Open Society Foundations is to foster human rights and civil society around the world. So it’s only appropriate that the George Soros-funded grantmaking network is bringing some democracy to its own workplace, in the form of a union contract for its workers.","Staffers at the New York-based foundation last week ratified their first collective bargaining agreement, making salaries and work responsibilities more transparent and giving employees a new measure of job security. Despite the liberal policy leanings of some other private foundations, OSF appears to be the first in the U.S. whose workforce has union representation.","“It was kind of intuitive to form a union, since we support unions,” said Chris Thomas, a 28-year-old legal assistant based in New York who was active in the organizing campaign. “There was a huge desire to have some sort of commitment to internal equity.”","Plenty of left-leaning, non-profit advocacy groups such as the ACLU and Human Rights Watch are union shops, but the world of big-time private philanthropy is pretty much union-free, like the vast majority of the private sector in general. It remains to be seen whether workers at other powerful grant machines like the Ford Foundation follow in the footsteps of OSF and seek a union.","OSF employees in New York and Baltimore held a union election in 2016, prompted in part by a major reorganization that jostled staffers. They voted 109-80 in favor of joining the Communications Workers of America Local 1180.","In response, the foundation’s management did not wage the sort of anti-union campaign favored by many U.S. employers. It took around a year and a half for an agreement on the terms of a collective bargaining agreement, which is not out of the ordinary for a first contract.","There likely would have been a scandal had management balked at the unionization, considering the institution’s progressive agenda and the liberal reputation of its billionaire founder. Funded by Soros’ fortune made as a hedge fund manager, OSF is known for pouring money into human rights campaigns abroad, and into immigration, criminal justice and other reform efforts at home. The organization had a 2017 budget of nearly a billion dollars.","When the union push was afoot, the news site Inside Philanthropy wondered whether collective bargaining was compatible with the work of private foundations, noting the same fear that seems to crop up whenever non-union fields get a taste of union organizing ― “that it could limit the nimbleness of these institutions.”","OSF’s president, Patrick Gaspard, doesn’t seem too worried about that. Before joining the foundation last year, Gaspard spent much of his career in the labor movement, serving as a union organizer in New York and later as vice president and political director at the powerful Service Employees International Union, which now represents roughly two million workers.","In an email, Gaspard said OSF “has broken ground with this agreement” and was “proud to have led the way among foundations” by having a union contract.","“Round the world we stand with people working to access their rights,” Gaspard said. “This agreement is in keeping with our philosophy. In essence, to practice what we preach. I’m convinced that with this agreement we’ve emerged a strong, more unified organization.”","With their contract, OSF set minimum hiring salaries and across-the-board wage increases for the three years covered by the accord. They also locked in compensatory time off for extra work done, assured that promotions come with raises, and made clear who’s eligible for employer-paid cell phones, among other economic matters.","But Kevin Hirano, a fundraiser based in Baltimore, said even more important than compensation was achieving more transparency and fairness. The contract requires the foundation to clarify employees’ job responsibilities, while also setting up a labor-management committee and a grievance procedure, all of which Hirano said adds up to a larger seat at the table for employees.","“It took some convincing that we weren’t here to gouge anyone. We’re all here to make this organization better and make the world better,” he said. “I think unions and non-profits and private foundations have an opportunity that they shouldn’t shy away from.”","As for institutional “nimbleness,” employees did want to restrict some of that ― namely, the ability of the foundation to fire people for no good reason. Workers without contracts are generally at the employer’s mercy. OSF employees wanted to make sure that no one could be fired without first being put on notice about their job performance and given a chance to improve.","Thomas said the overall idea fueling the unionization was to commit the organization internally to values it claimed to uphold outside.","“It was taking a lot of the things we aspire to, and to have the inside be more reflective of that,” he said. “And that’s hard. It can be difficult to live up to your own standards.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ad761772000001311eb50ab.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Stormy Daniels Plans To Donate NDA Money To Planned Parenthood","authors":"Alanna Vagianos","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/stormy-daniels-plans-to-donate-nda-money-to-planned-parenthood_us_5ad7493be4b0e4d0715c2a0f","short_description":"She plans to donate $130,000 in President Donald Trump and attorney Michael Cohen's names, according to a recent report.","date":"2018-04-18"},"articleContent":["Stormy Daniels will reportedly donate the $130,000 she made in her nondisclosure agreement over an alleged affair with President Donald Trump to Planned Parenthood.","Daniels says she and Trump had the affair in 2006, and Trump attorney Michael Cohen arranged the payout to Daniels just before the 2016 election to silence her ― an exchange that may be illegal.

I still hold out a degree of hope that when [French President Emmanuel] Macron and [German Chancellor Angela] Merkel are here, maybe there’s something, there’s a little bit of a breakthrough,” Corker said Wednesday morning, referring to upcoming visits by the two world leaders. While Macron has had an April 24 state visit to Washington planned for some time, the White House only announced Merkel’s April 27 visit on Wednesday, hours before Corker’s remarks.","Trump has to decide by May 12 whether he will continue to waive nuclear-related American sanctions on Iran. He has indicated that he will reimpose the sanctions unless the two-year-old deal ― under which Iran is allowed some sanctions relief and a partial reentry to the global economy in return for accepting limits on its nuclear development ― is modified.","In particular, he wants the deal amended to address Iran’s testing of ballistic missiles, tighten international inspections of Iranian facilities and prevent the removal of limits on the Iranian nuclear program in as early as 10 years’ time ― what are known as “sunset” clauses. The Islamic Republic is already complying with the deal as it currently stands, according to inspectors with the International Atomic Energy Agency, the international body tasked with monitoring compliance.","France, Germany and the United Kingdom are the closest American partners involved in the agreement; the other two parties are Russia and China. The Europeans have the best chance to woo Trump and keep the deal alive but have repeatedly said they will not accept tweaks that totally reshape it. They see such a process as requiring fresh negotiations or essentially destroying the accord automatically by making it unlikely that Iran would stay in.","The question now is whether European leaders can give Trump enough assurances to keep him from suspending the sanctions.","European officials are happy to develop plans to address Trump’s concerns on the missiles and the inspectors, Corker said. The trouble is the “sunset” aspect.","“I think it’s especially Germany that feels like dealing with the sunset is changing the deal,” the senator said at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast event. “I don’t.” Lawyers Corker has consulted agree with him and so do European officials behind closed doors, he claimed, implying they would not say so publicly for fear of criticism at home from supporters of the deal.","European companies have been eager to keep the deal in place and do business in Iran. If Trump does decide to re-apply U.S. sanctions in May, such companies would immediately be affected, Corker noted, because American enforcement applies not just to the Iranians but to those working with them.","With White House help, the senator started working on legislation last year that would prevent the U.S. from honoring the “sunset” commitments if Iran progressed to a point where it could build a nuclear weapon in less than a year. But the bill made little progress and he said Wednesday that it would have to come after any agreements with the Europeans, because Democrats would not vote for it otherwise.","Experts supportive of the Iran deal say that regardless of the concerns, there are multiple restrictions and transparency requirements on Iran after the “sunset” period begins that would still make it hard for the country to begin developing a nuclear arsenal if it wanted to.","But it’s Trump’s view that matters. The president has reluctantly waived nuclear sanctions against Iran on three occasions and has repeatedly criticized the deal. Trump continues to hear criticism of it through his network of informal advisers like old friends and business associates, Corker said.","“There are many people that are arguing to the president: ‘Look, the investment in Iran that was expected [as a result of the sanctions relief] hasn’t really occurred yet, but it’s coming down the pipeline. If we pull out of this agreement, it’s going to stop it, we’re going to keep them weak,’” the senator said. “There are people that are arguing to him that that would be a better way, to keep them weak, keep them weak, and then try to renegotiate a deal. There are other people that are arguing something totally different.”","A sometime critic of Trump, the influential retiring lawmaker has both been harsh on Iran and vocal about the value of some kind of compromise on the nuclear issue.","“I think we’d be much better off as a nation if we could come up with a sunset agreement with the Europeans,” Corker said."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ad77dae2000001311eb50cf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Kim Kardashian And Chrissy Teigen Hilariously Roast Kanye West Over His Life Advice","authors":"Lee Moran","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-tweet-rid-everything_us_5ad70e45e4b03c426da9a31d","short_description":"The friends had the funniest responses to West's \"get rid of everything\" post.","date":"2018-04-18"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Twitter Users Shred Donald Trump Over Barbara Bush Tribute Typo","authors":"Lee Moran","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/white-house-tribute-barbara-bush-error_us_5ad6e8f4e4b0e4d0715b5189","short_description":"\"When you care so much that you can't even bother to have the correct year on an official White House statement.\"","date":"2018-04-18"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Jim Carrey Stuns Jeff Daniels By Crashing His Interview On 'Conan'","authors":"Lee Moran","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jim-carrey-jeff-daniels-conan-obrien_us_5ad70140e4b029ebe01f30b7","short_description":"It was a magical \"Dumb and Dumber\" reunion.","date":"2018-04-18"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"CRIME","headline":"Don't Count On 'Me Too' To Sway The Bill Cosby Jury","authors":"Angelina Chapin","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bill-cosby-me-too_us_5ad74918e4b03c426daa2fca","short_description":"The Me Too movement has launched a national discussion on sexual violence. But experts are skeptical about its power inside a courtroom.","date":"2018-04-18"},"articleContent":["In early April, Judge Steve O’Neil asked potential jurors in Bill Cosby’s sex assault retrial a question he couldn’t have asked 10 months ago: “Do you know about, or have any knowledge of, the ‘Me Too’ movement or allegations of sexual misconduct in the entertainment industry?” Of the 120 potential jurors, only one had not heard of the ongoing national dialogue on sexual misconduct, power abuse and consent.","One of the biggest questions looming over the Cosby trial, now in its second week, is how the cascade of headlines about sexual predators over the past year will affect jurors. This is the first high-profile sex assault trial of the Me Too era, and some see it as a test of the movement’s ability to shift public opinion on sexual harassment and violence.","“The #MeToo movement is on trial,” wrote Boston Globe columnist Renée Graham. “Bill Cosby is the defendant in his sexual assault retrial, yet the undeniable subplot is whether the still-burgeoning movement will impact the verdict.” Jen Kirby asked in Vox: “Just how much has the world changed in the 10 months since the jury deadlocked on whether to believe Cosby’s accuser?”","During Cosby’s original trial last June, in which complainant Andrea Constand accused the TV star of drugging and sexually assaulting her in 2004, the jury could not reach a unanimous decision. In his retrial, many people are hopeful that the Me Too movement will help push jurors toward convicting a man whom at least 57 women have accused of sexual assault in the media.","But while the public discussion over sexual violence is progressing, reversing deeply entrenched beliefs is a longer and more complicated process ― especially inside a courtroom.","A notoriously low percentage of sexual assault cases get referred to prosecutors ― and even fewer result in a conviction ― in part because jurors hold a lot of inaccurate views about sex crimes. For example, there’s a widespread belief that sex assault involves a stranger attacking someone in a dark alleyway, when in reality, at least 72 percent of victims know their abusers, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. And people assume sexual abuse always involves physical force, but victims often don’t have injuries.","There are also myths about how victims should respond ― that in order to be considered credible, a victim has to fight off their abuser, flee the scene, file a police report immediately and have a flawless memory of the assault. But many victims freeze during the abuse, delay reporting the crime, have spotty or fragmented recollections of what happened and keep in contact with their abusers ― behavior that makes sense once you consider how trauma affects the brain, and the lasting psychological impact of being violated by someone you know or trust.","Instead of holding perpetrators fully responsible for sex crimes, there’s a tendency for the general public to blame victims for drinking too much, wearing too little or being sex workers or strippers.","“It would never cross the jury’s mind to say ‘When she left that window open, was she really wanting to get burglarized?’” said Dominic Willmott, a research fellow in forensic psychology at the University of Huddersfield in England. “However, in rape cases the question is always asked. It’s almost the victim that’s on trial, not the defendant.”","Judges and defense attorneys are constantly reinforcing these myths. The lawyers representing Cosby have tried to paint Constand as a gold-digging liar, pointing to the $3.4 million civil settlement she received in 2006 and highlighting inconsistent statements she made to police.","In a recent case involving a woman who accused a truck driver of holding her at knifepoint and raping her three times, the defense focused on the complainant’s history of sex work and drug use. The jury found the defendant not guilty despite DNA evidence linking him to 11 other sexual assault reports. And when a Canadian judge recently acquitted a taxi driver charged with sexually assaulting a woman passed out in his back seat, he declared that “clearly, a drunk can consent.” (The province’s top court later overturned that decision.)","While many jurors are still strongly influenced by these misconceptions, some experts think the Me Too movement has the power to enlighten them about the reality of sexual assault.","“This country has gotten a graduate-level course on the issues surrounding violence against women,” said Jan Langbein, chief executive of Genesis Women’s Shelter in Texas. “I think in a lot of ways we’ve stopped looking at the credibility of the victim as opposed to concentrating on the behaviors of the perpetrators.”","Hearing the graphic allegations against men such as Harvey Weinstein, Matt Lauer and Bill O’Reilly has likely helped jurors understand that sexual assault is “all about power and control,” Langbein said, rather than “what the victim wore and how much they had to drink.”","The many Me Too stories have also shown that sexual predators aren’t fire-breathing monsters ― they can be progressive comedians, charismatic TV hosts and beloved artists. These allegations have revealed how men in all industries use their professional authority to manipulate vulnerable women and bully victims into staying silent.","Yet despite this very public exposé on what sex assault really looks like, Willmott is not convinced Me Too will have bearing on Cosby’s fate. He conducted a study on whether debunking rape myths before a mock sex assault trial ― for example, explaining to jurors that stranger rape and false rape reports are rare, and that most victims don’t have injuries ― would change their feelings toward the defendant. He found that jurors are just as likely to return a not-guilty verdict whether or not they’ve received any supplemental information about sex crimes.","“These beliefs are so deep-rooted that people can’t push them aside,” he said. “They are so deeply embedded in what we believe, we almost can’t shake them off.”","People who believe myths about rape will simply ignore facts that don’t fit their opinions, Willmott said. In court, they tend to invent a story about the defendant’s innocence, and throughout the trial, they’ll “pick evidence that fits the version of the story they constructed.”","Though there is some research to show that having expert witnesses explain victim behavior can sway juror attitudes on issues such as delayed reporting of a crime, Willmott has found that a person’s overall bias against a complainant is hard to change.","“Their views aren’t linear, they are multi-level,” he said. “If you tackle one, there’s another 50 that remain untackled that tie into a broader picture of negative attitudes.”","Kaarin Long, an assistant attorney in Ramsey County, Minnesota, is likewise dubious about whether the movement’s cultural progress will actually influence the outcome of trials. Having “a sort of general conversation that says sexual harassment in the workplace and sexual violence is wrong” is very different from making legal decisions as a juror, she said.","“You’re in a courtroom with one man, accused of a specific act, where 12 people have to unanimously agree it happened beyond a reasonable doubt,” she said. “Right now [Me Too] is not enough, in my view, to make the difference between guilty and not guilty in the courtroom.”","She’s also skeptical that the movement is as widespread as the media seems to believe. “The white feminist women of the world are joining together on it,” she said. “But in the cacophony of the experiences of people who don’t pay too much attention to these issues, it might not necessarily have as much force as we think.”","Others are worried that some jurors might be influenced by the backlash to Me Too, as seen with celebrities like Tony Robbins and Matt Damon who’ve accused the movement of attacking innocent men and, in Damon’s words, conflating rape with “patting someone on the butt.” (He later apologized for the remark.) “There are a lot of people who see women as gold diggers and money grubbers,” said Danielle McGuire, an author and historian who writes about racial and sexual violence. “And that’s the way the main survivor in this [Cosby] case is being portrayed.”","While McGuire thinks the Me Too movement will make people think more critically about sexual assault, she knows the more significant effects will require time.","“You don’t tear down the walls of patriarchy with a tweetstorm or a couple marches, even,” she said. “The Me Too movement will have to go on longer, and do more education and training.”","Willmott’s own research has led him to conclude that the most effective way to rid courtrooms of rape myths is to vet jurors more intensely. A potential jury pool would be asked a series of questions ― such as “Is it a biological necessity for men to release sexual pressure from time to time?” and “Do women receive ample support after a sexual assault?” ― in hopes of exposing attitudes that would prevent them from remaining impartial.","Willmott believes Me Too could indirectly influence future jurors if it leads to more education about consent in schools, but he doesn’t expect it will sway any of the 12 people responsible for deciding Cosby’s fate.","“A combination of factors may lead jurors to being less biased,” he said. “But I don’t think that’s going to happen in the short term, from this movement alone.”","CORRECTION: A previous version of this story indicated the conviction rate for rape cases is less than 1 percent. While experts believe that rape cases referred to prosecutors account for a very small percentage of the total estimated number of cases, the actual conviction rate for the few prosecuted cases is more than 60 percent."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ad74b011e0000fb077b1d93.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"COMEDY","headline":"Comey Hits Trump Where It Hurts: 'I'm Like A Breakup He Can't Get Over'","authors":"Ed Mazza","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/stephen-colbert-james-comey_us_5ad6c617e4b0e4d0715b3f06","short_description":"The former FBI director drinks and dishes about the president on the \"Late Show.\"","date":"2018-04-18"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"GOP Spending Against Obamacare Plummets In 2018 Elections","authors":"Amanda Terkel","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gop-spending-health-care-ads_us_5ad7859ee4b03c426daac0ee","short_description":"Democrats are on the offense, while Republicans have largely given up on health care as a campaign issue.","date":"2018-04-18"},"articleContent":["WASHINGTON ― Since the Affordable Care Act’s passage in 2010, repealing Obamacare has been the driving issue for the Republican Party.","GOP lawmakers voted to defund, change or repeal parts of the law at least 67 times while President Barack Obama was in office, and they promised voters that if they won control of the White House, they’d make the dream of full repeal come true.","Republicans received their chance in the 2016 elections, which handed the party control of both chambers of Congress and the White House. But they failed to get the job done last year as voters realized what they’d be losing and public opinion swung in favor of the law. The GOP has shown no signs of trying to take up repeal again this year.","Now, Republicans are giving up on Obamacare repeal as a campaign issue as well. Anti-Obamacare ad spending in the 2018 election cycle has plummeted compared to the same period in the previous three cycles, according to data compiled by Kantar Media/CMAG for HuffPost.","“The reality of the situation is that Republicans really don’t have much to say about health care at this point,” said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster who is president of Hart Research.","“What are they going to say on it?” admitted a Republican strategist who requested anonymity to speak openly and who previously worked at the National Republican Congressional Committee. “We’ll repeal Obamacare? I mean, what are they going to say that’s believable?”","Democratic spending on health care ads is slightly up from where it was in the past three election cycles during the same period. And Democratic strategists and candidates say that for them, health care will be front and center.","“We see health care as the defining issue of the 2018 midterms,” said David Bergstein, spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. “The Republican health care agenda is incredibly toxic with voters of every political persuasion.”","For the first time in an election cycle since Obamacare’s passage, a majority of the public now approves of the health care law. Democrats now have a sizable advantage over the GOP on the issue, too. And in a recent HuffPost/YouGov poll, voters chose health care as one of their top issues.","Even a poll commissioned by America First Policies, a pro-Trump group, found that lowering the cost of health care is the top issue for many voters. Of the respondents who said health care is a top concern, only 34 percent said they want Obamacare repealed and replaced. Forty-seven percent wanted problems with the law to be fixed, while 15 percent said they want it to stay exactly as it is.","“One of the ironies of the Republican attack on the Affordable Care Act is it’s made it more popular in voters’ eyes, especially as voters have a chance to compare the Affordable Care Act to the Republican alternatives,” Garin said.","Republican attempts to repeal Obamacare met a wall of opposition last year as the details of GOP alternatives became clear and Americans realized what it would mean for people who now benefit from the law’s protections and financial assistance. As part of a broader mobilization against the Trump administration and its policies, Obamacare supporters showed up at town halls and protests around the country, leading to high-profile confrontations and pleas to keep the health care law in place.","Health care is one of the most personal of issues ― far more so than tax cuts, which is what Republicans apparently want to run on this cycle ― and Democrats are using it in powerful campaign ads. Health care costs are still a significant concern for people, and the GOP has largely dropped any efforts to make health care more affordable.","Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster at Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research, cautioned that while there’s no doubt that people are concerned about health care costs, she’s not sure if that issue ― or any other particular issue ― will be what drives people to the polls in November. In political discussions, people talk more about how much they hate the divisiveness in the country, she said.","“I think it’s going to be interesting to see how Democrats can bring the health care issue in as an indictment of Republicans and their values, but also as an economic conversation at a time when a lot of this is being driven by this kind of larger mood in the country,” she said.","Republicans sense that health care is no longer an issue they own. Rep. Mike Bishop (R-Mich.) is in what should be a reliably Republican district, but in an election year that’s already bringing unexpected wins to Democrats, Bishop’s seat is considered a bellwether that could be up for grabs. Last year, his campaign site had a section about repealing Obamacare.","This year, Bishop’s “issues” page has no mention of health care. Stu Sandler, a campaign consultant for Bishop, told The Washington Post that the new site reflects the congressman’s accomplishments and that he hasn’t changed his position on Obamacare.","“I’m sure Republicans want to change the topic,” said Jesse Ferguson, a Democratic consultant who works with groups on the health care issue. “If you asked the captain of the Titanic, he’d want to change directions too. But after you’ve already hit the iceberg, it’s too late.”","Tax cuts seem to be where Republicans are focusing their energy and pinning their 2018 hopes.","“I think running for the benefits of tax reform is where I’m going to focus my attention on speaking about why ... we should be the party in power and in control, and what that means for the American people,” Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) said Tuesday when asked about health care in the midterms.","But so far, that measure ― which was supposed to be the highlight of the GOP legislative agenda ― isn’t resonating as much as the party would have liked. Toward the end of the heated special election in Pennsylvania’s 18th Congressional District last month, Republicans largely abandoned ads touting their signature piece of legislation.","On Tuesday, House GOP leadership told its members that they needed to get out there and start talking more about the tax cut law, because right now, it’s not at the top of the public’s minds.","Republicans did run ads on Obamacare in the Pennsylvania special election, going after Democrat Conor Lamb for supporting the health care law. And Republican Rick Saccone supported repeal. But ultimately, it didn’t work. Lamb won in a district where the Republican incumbent (who resigned over a sexual misconduct scandal) had run unopposed in the previous two cycles. Trump won there by 20 percentage points as well.","A Democratic poll found that the health care message was a winning issue in the race, with a majority of voters opposed to what the Republicans wanted to do to the Affordable Care Act.","On the anti-Obamacare side, the American Action Network is running the greatest number of ads ― and spending the most money ($1,253,700) ― this cycle, according to the data compiled by Kantar Media/CMAG for HuffPost. On the pro-Obamacare side, the group Save My Care has the highest number of spots, while J.B. Pritzker, who just won Illinois’ Democratic gubernatorial primary, has spent the most money ($2,173,010).","Yet the ongoing efforts to undermine the law ― and how that affects voter sentiments ― are an X-factor in all of this. Last year’s GOP tax bill eliminated the financial penalty for people who don’t get insurance. Without that penalty in place, healthy people are less likely to buy insurance, causing premiums for those who keep insurance to rise.","At the same time, Republicans at both the state and federal levels are doing what they can to change the rules on the kinds of insurance available. This is expected to result in cheap but less generous plans for people in good health ― and more expensive premiums for people who want or need more comprehensive coverage, including those with pre-existing conditions.","The effects of some of these changes will become apparent this fall, right before Election Day, as consumers begin to learn what coverage for next year will cost.","Republicans will likely respond as they always have, making the argument Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.) did in a closed-door event this month. The problem, they’ll say, is still with the law itself. Give Republicans more seats in Congress, and this time, they’ll actually repeal it.","Igor Bobic contributed reporting."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ad7889b2000007d06eb50e1.jpeg?cache=Hji1V7G4Di&ops=crop_0_75_4928_3074%2Cscalefit_1280_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"CRIME","headline":"Someone Tied A Hedgehog To A Tree With A 'Makeshift Crucifix' Of Shoelaces","authors":"Lee Moran","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hedgehog-tree-wales-crucifix_us_5ad72e9ae4b029ebe01fa299","short_description":"The perpetrator in Wales barbarically left the little creature to die, but it survived.","date":"2018-04-18"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Rob Delaney Of 'Catastrophe' Honors Late Son On Birthday To Help Other Cancer Victims","authors":"Ron Dicker","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rob-delaney-son-birthday_us_5ad71e72e4b0e4d0715bbd60","short_description":"The actor recalled his \"sweet boy\" Henry who died in January.","date":"2018-04-18"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Nikki Haley Hits Back At White House: 'I Don't Get Confused'","authors":"Rebecca Shapiro","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nikki-haley-i-dont-get-confused_us_5ad64aabe4b016a07ea1572c","short_description":"The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations did not mince words.","date":"2018-04-18"},"articleContent":["Nikki Haley, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, sharply responded to the suggestion that she was confused when she said that President Donald Trump’s administration would be imposing more sanctions on Russia.","“With all due respect, I don’t get confused,” the ambassador said in a statement to Fox News’ Dana Perino, who read the comment during her Tuesday show.","Haley was responding specifically to Trump’s newly appointed economic adviser Larry Kudlow, who said earlier on Tuesday that the ambassador “got ahead of the curve” when she told CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday that Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin would announce additional sanctions on Russia for supporting Syrian dictator Bashar Assad.","“There might have been some momentary confusion about that,” Kudlow told reporters in West Palm Beach, Florida, a day after reports surfaced that Trump had reversed his position on imposing sanctions.

The decision affected roughly 18,000 people whose registrations were being held up, and Robinson told Kobach to make sure those voters were fully registered. Kobach assured her that he would and that he would send out postcards to any affected voter.","Kansans usually get a postcard before an election informing them of their polling place, and those who didn’t get them before an election would likely have been confused, the plaintiffs said at the trial.","More than a year and a half later, the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the voters who challenged the Kansas law, filed a motion to hold Kobach in contempt, saying he had failed to send out the postcards and update the county election manual to reflect Robinson’s 2016 order. In a contentious hearing, Kobach said his office had orally instructed county clerks to send out the postcards but could not force them to do anything. Robinson was furious, saying that Kobach had assured her in court that he would send out the postcards.","Robinson imposed sanctions on Kobach on Wednesday, saying he had to pay the ACLU for attorney fees and that “any further remedial measures” would be decided when she ruled on the merits of the case.","The plaintiffs, a handful of eligible voters unable to get on the rolls, argue that the Kansas law, which went into effect in 2013, violates a 1993 federal law called the National Voter Registration Act. The federal law requires state motor vehicle agencies to offer people the chance to register to vote and only allows them to ask for the minimum amount of information necessary to do so. Robinson’s 2016 preliminary injunction put the law on hold and she oversaw a bench trial in the case in March. A final ruling is expected later this year.","Kobach defends the law as necessary to prevent noncitizens from voting in the state, but he has produced just 129 instances in which noncitizens attempted to vote in Kansas. The ACLU says the law is extremely restrictive and unnecessary.","“The Secretary of State’s Office will be appealing this decision,” said a Kobach spokesperson after the contempt ruling. “Secretary Kobach has no additional comment at this time.”","Robinson’s Wednesday order was scathing, and was particularly directed to Kobach, who made the unusual choice to represent his own office at the trial. She said that Kobach, who is running for governor of Kansas, had made disingenuous arguments to the court and suggested that her 2016 order was dynamic and not law. She also said Kobach had a history of “noncompliance” and “disrespect” for the court in the case. Kobach, who ran President Donald Trump’s voter fraud commission until it was disbanded in January, was fined $1,000 for making misleading statements to the court in the case last year.","“The judge found that Kris Kobach disobeyed the court’s orders by failing to provide registered voters with consistent information, that he willfully failed to ensure that county elections officials were properly trained, and that he has a ‘history of noncompliance and disrespect for the court’s decisions,’” Dale Ho, the ACLU’s top voting rights lawyer, who faced off against Kobach in court during the trial, said in a statement. “Secretary Kobach likes to talk about the rule of law. Talk is cheap, and his actions speak louder than his words.","Bryan Caskey, the state director of elections and a staffer in Kobach’s office, recently filed an affidavit in the case saying that he had instructed county election officials to send out the postcards and had orally done so before trial. Robinson said that was “too little, too late” to avoid a contempt finding. She noted that Kobach had maintained until the trial that he wasn’t obligated to send out the postcards. She said she didn’t find it credible that his staffer had orally instructed counties to send out the postcards before the trial.","Robinson also took Kobach to task for suggesting at the trial that it wasn’t his fault that his office didn’t ensure the postcards were sent out. She noted that he was the chief election official in the state and it was his responsibility to follow through on the orders of the court.","Kobach had said he complied with the court order because he sent out a separate notice from the court to the 18,000 affected voters ahead of the 2016 election informing them they could vote.","Robinson also criticized Kobach for failing to update the county’s election manual to reflect the fact that people applying to vote at the DMV don’t have to prove their citizenship. Caskey testified he was “too busy” to update the document in 2016 and Kobach’s office recently took it offline.","Kobach and his lawyers indicated that he didn’t need to update the document because of the preliminary injunction since it wasn’t the final law.

The conceptual conflicts he dissects throughout the album — pride vs. humility, love vs. lust, fear vs. trust (mostly in God), individuality vs. conformity, and, as Lamar explores in the album’s conclusion, “me vs. me” — are easily recognizable. It’s hard for black folks not to relate to Lamar’s boisterous pride in his African ancestry, his crisis of faith, his fear of returning to poverty and his anger at racial inequality.","His ability to capture the essence of black life, at its most minute, is also what makes “DAMN.” a great piece of journalism. The album chronicles the black struggle in real time, which makes listening to a Lamar album as satisfying as reading the works of Ida B. Wells or James Baldwin. His music, like the best journalism, is rooted in the moment and grounded in historical significance — like “King Kunta,” an oxymoronic ode to his life as a wealthy black man in America. “DAMN.” is a comprehensive explanation of the black struggle today that deserves its spot in the history books because, like The New York Times’ and The New Yorker’s Pulitzer-winning reporting on sexual assault, Lamar is documenting the reality we live in.","“DAMN.” is really an oral history, undoubtedly on par with the late Zora Neale Hurston’s finally-to-be released Barracoon.","But because he’s not writing for news outlets or bound to regressive notions of journalistic objectivity, Lamar’s work achieves something most reporters can’t: It speaks from the prerogative of black communities facing oppression and directly attacks the institutions responsible for their pain. In an industry still dominated by the white gaze, Lamar isn’t required to let both sides have a voice. Instead, his music lifts the weight of black communities alone — a burden he confronts in “FEEL.”","I feel like the whole world want me to pray for ’em\nBut who the fuck prayin’ for me?\n","Overall, his combination of reflexive narrative writing and scathing critiques of police violence, poverty and crime in black communities confronts the stories that many media outlets overlook. In doing so, he highlights how the people in these communities manage to survive. Of course, some journalists have dedicated their careers to similar work. But where journalism often prefers to focus on the grittier, more violent aspects of black life, Lamar is free to show the joy, too. His music captures the complexities of what people are feeling at this very moment in America’s political history, and in laying out our fears, he also puts forward our hopes of overcoming them.

Wright was also found guilty on a charge of lying to the FBI. The defendants will face a potential life sentence when they come back to court in late June.","The jury decided the case after slightly less than a day of deliberations. The three defendants showed little outward emotion as the verdicts were read. Afterward, defense attorneys comforted the defendants’ family members, who did not wish to speak to members of the media.\n","In closing arguments, attorneys for the defendants had accused the FBI of overstepping and targeting the group because of rhetoric that, while hateful, was protected by the First Amendment.","The prosecution’s case depended largely on secret recordings made by Dan Day, an FBI informant who masqueraded as a militia member, infiltrating the three men’s group for months. An undercover officer working on behalf of the FBI had also met with Stein, posing as an arms dealer who shared the group’s anti-Muslim beliefs and was willing to build them a bomb.\n","Jurors heard recording after recording of the men expressing a murderous hatred of Muslims, who they called “cockroaches.”","“The fucking cockroaches in this country have to go, period,” said Stein, who went by the code name “Orkin Man” in text messages with other militia members. “They are the fucking problem in this country right now. They are the threat in this country right now.”","In another recording, the men could be heard mapping out targets on Google Earth, dropping a “pin” labeled “cockroaches” over areas they knew to have a high concentration of Muslims. They eventually settled on a main target: a Garden City apartment complex that’s home to many Somali Muslim immigrants and the mosque where they worship.","The prosecution presented evidence that the men had started to collect explosive materials. Per the recordings made by Day, their plan was to detonate bombs at the apartment complex in November 2016. They wanted the explosions to occur during Muslim prayer times when more potential victims would be there, “packed in like sardines,” as Stein put it. The bomb’s shock waves, he hoped, would make “Jello out of their insides.”","Defense attorneys had attempted to characterize such comments as mere bluster. But prosecutors pre-empted this line of argument, in part, by calling another militia member to the stand.","Brody Benson, part of the Kansas Security Forces militia, held anti-Muslim beliefs himself. “Fucking Islam,” he wrote in a Facebook post in June 2016. “I’m done. Kill them all. Bring on the DOJ.”","But Benson testified that when he heard Stein talk about his plan to kill Somali immigrants in Garden City, he knew Stein was for real.","“I actually thought it was not just talk — it was more of an actual action, action,” Benson said in testimony. “I had a gut feeling that what was just banter back and forth, ranting and everything else, was turning into something more serious and concrete.”\n\n“This isn’t a case about the thought police,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Anthony Mattivi said during closing arguments. “The defendants plotted to murder dozens of innocent men, women and children. They didn’t just talk. They’re not here because of their words.”\n\nIn his final comments to the jury, Mattivi focused on a recording of a discussion the men had about what type of shrapnel to pack their bomb with to inflict the most damage. Stein suggested blades for drywall knives. Allen said ball bearings. “Anything that will kill and maim,” Wright said.","The men were enthusiastic supporters of Donald Trump, who vilified Muslims during his presidential campaign and has continued to do so while in office. During the plotting, Stein reportedly referred to then-candidate Trump as “the Man.” The men had planned their attack for after the 2016 election, so as not to hurt Trump’s chances of winning. Delaying the attack until then would avoid giving “any ammunition” to their political opponents, Stein said.","Trump had frequently spoken out against Muslim refugees in the runup to the 2016 election. Kansas’ top federal prosecutor, U.S. Attorney Stephen McAllister, brushed aside a question from HuffPost about what effect the now-president’s words had.","“I can’t say whether his rhetoric impacted the case or not,” McAllister, a Trump nominee, said. He later added that this case wasn’t about the rhetoric the defendants used, but about the bomb plot they agreed to participate in.","“I don’t view this as a prosecution of speech at all. This was a prosecution of speech coupled with actions,” McAllister said. “Just because you have some words involved doesn’t mean this was about speech. This was about actions, and their speech was to some extent evidence of the actions they were taking.”","The Justice Department’s national press office sent out a press release on the case featuring a quote from Attorney General Jeff Sessions, calling the jury verdict a “significant victory against domestic terrorism and hate crimes” and touting DOJ’s commitment to fighting both foreign and domestic terrorist threats.","“The defendants in this case acted with clear premeditation in an attempt to kill people on the basis of their religion and national origin. That’s not just illegal ― it’s immoral and unacceptable, and we’re not going to stand for it,” Sessions said. “Law enforcement saved lives in this case.”","Madihha Ahussain of the group Muslim Advocates praised Wednesday’s verdict, but said Americans must not ignore the “greater context” in which the plan unfolded.","“We cannot dismiss the disgusting rhetoric of these militiamen as mere ‘locker room talk’ as the defendants’ counsel argued. The stakes are simply too high,” Ahussain said. “Anti-Muslim rhetoric has led to an unprecedented spike in hate violence and mosque attacks, intense radicalization of white supremacists, and a shocking disregard for the lives of American Muslims.”","“This must not become the norm for American discourse,” Ahussain continued. “We must not be divided by hate, but, rather, stand together as a united nation to defend our ideals, values, and beliefs.”","HuffPost has been in Wichita, Kansas, to cover this domestic terrorism trial.

One passenger, later identified as Jennifer Riordan, was reportedly sucked toward the broken window. She was hospitalized after landing and later confirmed dead.","Following the emergency landing, a passenger named Marty Martinez posted photos and videos of the ordeal on Facebook. Former flight attendant and travel talk show host Bobby Laurie tweeted one of Martinez’s photos to share an important message about oxygen masks.","“PEOPLE: Listen to your flight attendants! ALMOST EVERYONE in this photo from @SouthwestAir #SWA1380 today is wearing their mask WRONG. Put down the phone, stop with the selfies.. and LISTEN. **Cover your NOSE & MOUTH,” he tweeted.","Other flight attendants made similar comments on Martinez’s Facebook post. Indeed, the instruction of cover your nose and mouth is part of Southwest’s safety demonstration script.","Laurie told HuffPost it’s important that passengers follow this instruction to maintain consciousness in the event that an aircraft cabin loses pressure.","Why You Need An Oxygen Mask","“The oxygen mask is meant to cover your nose and your mouth so that during a decompression ― either rapid or explosive, which is what it sounds like happened on Southwest ― you’re getting enough oxygen while the airplane dives down to a level in which you can breathe without the oxygen mask,” Laurie said.","Rapid or explosive decompression refers to incidents when an aircraft experiences an unplanned drop in cabin pressure at a dangerous rate. While there is a high enough percentage of oxygen in the air at flying altitudes (it remains around 21 percent until about 70,000 feet), the lack of air pressure makes it harder to get enough oxygen with each breath.","An oxygen mask helps plane passengers get the oxygen they need in a low-cabin pressure situation.","What Happens If You Don’t Use Your Mask Properly","Passengers who don’t get the oxygen they need are at risk of passing out from hypoxia. This is a condition in which low amounts of oxygen in the body’s tissues can rapidly lead to symptoms like dizziness, vision problems, mental confusion, and even unconsciousness, brain damage and death.","If you don’t use your oxygen mask properly ― by not covering your nose, for instance ― you increase your risk of hypoxia, Laurie explained. “Having it only cover your mouth is kind of like scuba diving in the air,” he added. “You have to remind yourself to breathe through your mouth in order to get enough oxygen until the plane gets down to that level at which you don’t need the mask.”","Southwest declined HuffPost’s request for comment, but in the case of Tuesday’s incident, reports indicate that the broken window caused the cabin to violently depressurize.","“We’ve heard about the passenger being sucked toward the window. All the air gets sucked out of the airplane. So if you have your mouth or nose open, the air is being sucked out, and you won’t be able to breathe because all the air is going away from you,” Laurie told HuffPost. “That’s why you need to wear the mask over your nose and mouth.”","The risk of hypoxia is also why safety demonstrations instruct passengers to secure their own oxygen masks before helping others. “You can pass out from a deprivation of oxygen. Your vision becomes blurry and your judgment becomes cloudy,” he added. “So you won’t be able or conscious to help someone else if you don’t put your mask on first.”","Misconceptions About Oxygen Masks","After tweeting his oxygen mask PSA, Laurie noticed people commenting that the masks don’t look big enough to actually cover a passenger’s nose and mouth.","“People don’t realize the mask isn’t stiff or solid. It’s not like a solid cup. It’s actually made out of a flexible plastic material,” he said. “Think of it like a stress ball ― if you were to squeeze the mask, it would elongate to cover your nose and mouth. It doesn’t look like people did that. It looks like they covered their chin and mouth.”","The former flight attendant said he can understand why two people sitting next to each other might secure their masks incorrectly because they’d likely look at each other for confirmation or guidance. But the photo he tweeted told a different story.","“When I saw that picture, what really blew me away is that not only were the two people next to each other doing it wrong, but people behind them did it too,” said Laurie. “It’s like: ‘Where were you during the safety demo? Where’s your safety information card?’”","“Also, if you look you’ll see the instructions are also printed ON the oxygen mask. You get it in all three places,” he added.","Another Way Passengers Are Getting It Wrong","Laurie said oxygen masks aren’t the only thing passengers are getting wrong in emergency situations.","“Another thing that I think gets lost a lot is that when it comes to the evacuation of an airplane and you have to use the emergency slide, a lot of folks straight away go and grab their luggage. Something is wrong with the plane and you need to get off and everyone is like, ‘oh let me grab my bag!’” he said. “What people don’t realize is your bag could puncture the slide. The slide is like a balloon, and if you puncture the slide, you’re trapped on the plane.”","The Problem With Safety Demos","This lack of understanding around airplane safety is, according to Laurie, part of a larger problem in commercial air travel today: People aren’t paying attention to safety demos.","“It’s very hard to get passengers’ attention,” he said. “A lot of airlines have even recognized that and started doing upbeat safety demos and videos. Virgin America has that dance video. Delta did that one with Deltalina. Southwest is known for flight attendants that do jokes and standup comedy and sing and dance during their demos.”","“Everyone’s trying to get your attention because more and more people are tuned out, especially since the use of cellphones has been permitted during taxi,” he added.","Laurie said he’s glad people have taken note of his tweet about oxygen mask usage and hopes people will pay more attention to practical safety measures when flying.","“Whether you fly once a week or once a year, if you’re not going to watch the safety video or safety demonstration, it’s important when you sit down in your seat to at least realize that this is something that could happen,” he advised. “And ask yourself ― if it does, ‘what do I do?’ Don’t be so complacent to think that it will never happen to you because the people yesterday didn’t think it was going to happen to them either.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ad7ab9e1f0000280616d830.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Trump Calls Stormy Daniels Threat Claim 'A Total Con Job'","authors":"Alana Horowitz Satlin","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-stormy-daniels-sketch_us_5ad719f1e4b029ebe01f732f","short_description":"\"A nonexistent man,\" Trump said of the person described by the porn star in a sketch released a day earlier.","date":"2018-04-18"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Republicans Say People Would Kick Themselves Off Food Stamps Under Their New Bill","authors":"Arthur Delaney","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republicans-food-stamps_us_5ad76c97e4b029ebe0205215","short_description":"Like self-deportation, but for basic nutritional needs!","date":"2018-04-18"},"articleContent":["WASHINGTON ― The Republican food stamp bill would cut benefit spending by billions of dollars by shrinking enrollment, but the bill’s author says nobody would actually be kicked off the program.","Instead, he says, anyone who stops receiving benefits after new “work requirements” take effect ― either because they couldn’t document 20 hours of work per week, or because they didn’t enroll in a training program ― will have simply chosen not to receive benefits anymore.","“If food stamps are not worth whatever the deal we put up ― the array of opportunities we have for them ― if it’s not worth that, then fine,” House Agriculture Committee Chairman Mike Conaway (R-Texas) told HuffPost on Wednesday. “We’re American. I’m not going to force food stamps on anybody.”","Conaway’s bill would impose work requirements that the Congressional Budget Office has said would reduce spending on Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits by $9 billion over 10 years, which amounts to a spending cut of about 1 or 2 percent. Democrats say roughly 1 million fewer Americans would receive benefits.","The bill would plow an additional $7 billion into a new training program that Conaway says would allow anyone to fulfill the work requirement if they can’t find a job. The proposal would mark a significant shift from current law, which imposes work requirements on a subset of SNAP recipients but doesn’t require states to provide slots in employment or training programs that fulfill the requirements.","“We don’t kick anybody off the program per se,” Conaway said on a radio program Monday. He has also said people would “self-select” to not receive benefits.","Democrats aren’t buying it.","“Let me be clear: This bill, as currently written, kicks people off the SNAP program,” Rep. Collin Peterson (D-Minn.), the top Democrat on the Agriculture Committee, said Wednesday. “The Chairman may call them ‘self-selections,’ but let’s call this exercise what it is ― reducing SNAP rolls.”","The committee approved Conaway’s work requirements Wednesday as part of a broader “farm bill” that includes changes to an array of agribusiness welfare programs. With Democrats and conservative House Republicans opposed, the legislation seems unlikely to become law in its current form.","More than 40 million Americans receive SNAP benefits, making it one of the biggest safety net programs in the U.S., and since it’s relatively easy to qualify, it’s probably the most responsive to changes in economic need. Though it’s known as a “farm bill,” food stamp spending represents about 80 percent of the total cost of the legislation.","The work requirements would apply to SNAP recipients between 18 and 59 years old so long as they don’t have a disability or children younger than 6, whereas the strictest requirements under current law don’t apply to people in their 50s or any parents with minor children. The measure would require beneficiaries to document at least 20 weekly hours of work or qualifying activity every month.","“Many workers would likely lose benefits if they couldn’t provide the needed paperwork to show they were working, if their employer cut their hours below 20 hours per week, or if they were temporarily out of work — all realistic scenarios given the reality of low-wage work,” Brynne Keith-Jennings, a senior research analyst with the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said in a blog post Tuesday.","If the policy had been in place in 2016, more than 9 million SNAP recipients would have been affected, according to the CBPP. Only 3.8 million adults met the criteria for the strictest work requirements under the law that was in place that year, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.","Conaway spokeswoman Rachel Millard said the proposal would not necessarily require people to visit state offices in person. “They work with their case manager/vendor to explore a reporting avenue that works for them, and in most cases that is not in-person,” Millard said in an email.","Peterson said the $7 billion workforce provision would create “giant, untested bureaucracies at the state level.” Potentially millions of SNAP recipients would need to enroll in training. Current workforce programs serve fewer than 1 million.","The entire debate over work requirements for able-bodied adults is a racist dog whistle, Rep. David Scott (D-Ga.) said.","“The image of able-bodied men not working are African-American men in the minds ― not of everybody’s mind ― but there are unfortunately people out there who have this mental disposition,” Scott said at Wednesday’s hearing.","A HuffPost/YouGov poll earlier this year showed that most Americans wrongly believe most food stamp recipients are black.","This story has been updated to reflect that the House Agriculture Committee passed the farm bill on Wednesday.","Clarification: Language in this story has been amended to more consistently describe the work requirements in the farm bill."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ad76d1f1f0000260616d7d6.jpeg?cache=OYvRQA00PM&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"COMEDY","headline":"Of Course Jesus Is Black: ‘That S**t Doesn’t Happen To White People’","authors":"Ed Mazza","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bbc-black-jesus-famalam_us_5ad6c5fae4b03c426da9496f","short_description":"Christ has some choice words in new BBC comedy sketch.","date":"2018-04-18"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"QUEER VOICES","headline":"Chilling Study Sums Up Link Between Religion And Suicide For Queer Youth","authors":"Carol Kuruvilla","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/queer-youth-religion-suicide-study_us_5ad4f7b3e4b077c89ceb9774","short_description":"“Religious groups who stigmatize LGBT people should be aware of the potential damage they can do.\"","date":"2018-04-18"},"articleContent":["Faith is supposed to be a source of strength for believers, especially during times of struggle and sorrow. However, a new study suggests that religiosity may be linked to negative feelings among queer individuals ― including increases in suicidal behaviors.","The study, published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine last month, is a chilling revelation of the ties between suicide and theology that doesn’t affirm queer identity.","“Religious groups who stigmatize LGBT people should be aware of the potential damage they can do to an individual and families, and honestly the damage they do to themselves as an organization,” study co-author John R. Blosnich told HuffPost.","Blosnich, of West Virginia University’s Injury Control Research Center, said that for decades, studies have indicated that religion generally protects people against thoughts of suicide. But the research has also shown that religion specifically doesn’t have that impact on those who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or questioning.","In order to study religiosity and suicidal ideation among sexual minorities, Blosnich and his fellow researchers turned to data collected by the University of Texas at Austin’s Research Consortium. The consortium produces national, large-scale studies on the mental health of college students. Its latest 2011 study surveyed 21,247 students aged 18 to 30 years old.","Out of this group, about 2.3 percent identified as lesbian or gay, 3.3 percent identified as bisexual and 1.1 percent said they were questioning their sexuality. (About 0.2 percent identified as transgender, which was too small of a sample to analyze.)","The students were asked to rate how important their religious or spiritual beliefs were to their personal identity. They were also asked a number of questions about whether they had ever seriously considered or attempted suicide.","Analyzing this data, the research team found that while 3.7 percent of heterosexual young adults reported recent thoughts of suicide, the percentages were significantly higher among queer youth. Those questioning their sexuality had the highest rate of recent thoughts about suicide at 16.4 percent, followed by bisexual individuals (11.4 percent) and lesbian or gay individuals (6.5 percent).","Five percent of heterosexual youth reported attempting suicide in their lifetimes, compared to 20 percent of bisexual youth, 17 percent of questioning youth and 14 percent of gay or lesbian youth.","Notably, the study authors found that religion may have acted as a protective factor against suicide attempts among heterosexual youth. Each increase in the level of importance of religion among straight youth was associated with a 17 percent reduction in recent suicide attempts.","On the other hand, for lesbian and gay youth, increasing levels of religious importance were associated with increased odds of recent suicidal ideation. In fact, lesbian and gay youth who said that religion was important to them were 38 percent more likely to have had recent suicidal thoughts, compared to lesbian and gay youth who reported religion was less important. Religiosity among lesbians alone was linked to a 52 percent increased chance of recent suicidal ideation.","Questioning youth who said religion was important to them were nearly three times as likely to have attempted suicide recently, compared to questioning youth who reported religion was less important.","For bisexual individuals, the importance of religion was not significantly associated with suicidal ideation or suicide attempts.","Overall, sexual minorities were also more likely than straight youth to report that religion was not important to them.","Blosnich said that sexual minorities who have greater religious belief may experience conflict between their faith and their sexual identity.","“It can be very scary to be caught in a space where your religion tells you that you are a ‘sinner’ just for being who you are,” he told HuffPost. “Sexual minority people may feel abandoned, they may experience deep sadness and anger, and they may worry what this means for their families ― especially if their families are very religious too.”","Studies conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have also found that lesbian, gay and bisexual youth seriously contemplate or attempt suicide at higher rates than heterosexual youth.","Blosnich said he’s not sure if societal changes since 2011 ― most notably the national legalization of same-sex marriage ― would lead to different results today. Large-scale surveys that ask about suicidal behavior, sexual orientation and religion are “very rare,” he said, which is why the team used the 2011 data. That survey looked only at college students, which means the findings may also not be generalizable to the broader LGBQ community.","The authors noted that the original data also did not include questions about whether respondents’ religions advocated stigmatizing beliefs about sexual minorities.","While several mainline Protestant and even evangelical leaders have begun to embrace a more inclusive theology, some of America’s largest religious denominations still hold non-affirming views of queer sexuality. Roman Catholic Church doctrine views gay and lesbian relationships as “intrinsically disordered.” The largest Protestant denomination in the U.S., the Southern Baptist Convention, sees marriage as exclusively reserved for one man and one woman and actively rejects equating gay rights with civil rights.","While these conservative denominations instruct believers to treat lesbian, gay and bisexual individuals with love, most encourage queer people to either remain celibate their entire lives or enter into mixed-orientation marriages.","Amelia Markham is a queer Christian activist with The Reformation Project, which works for the inclusion of LGBTQ people in the Christian church. They think Blosnich’s study demonstrates that for many queer people, non-affirming theology is at best problematic and at worst lethal ― “no matter how kindly or compassionately” it is articulated.","A number of Christian leaders are working toward a more nuanced view of queer sexuality, Markham said, but more needs to be done.","“There are some serious questions we have to begin asking ourselves if maintaining one interpretation of our sacred text is demonstrably linked to bodily harm and spiritual devastation for an entire group of people,” Markham said. “That is something I hope religious folks across the board would begin to think and pray more critically through.”","In Utah, where the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is based, researchers have documented a recent spike in teen suicides. Some advocates for LGBTQ Mormon teens have asserted that the spike is connected to the church’s policies on queer sexuality, although research hasn’t confirmed this link.","The Mormon church views queer relationships as sinful. In November 2015, it declared that Mormons in such relationships were to be considered apostates.","Diane Oviatt, a Mormon mother with a gay son, is part of Mama Dragons, a group of parents who have banded together to advocate for their queer children. She believes that non-affirming theology has a “direct” effect on suicidal ideation among LGBTQ youth and young adults. The Mormon church prioritizes marriage and formation of a “traditional” family, she said, and LGBTQ Mormons struggle with the fact that they don’t fit into that mold.","“There is absolutely no room for homosexuality anywhere in the doctrine,” she told HuffPost. “Our kids are stripped of hope and faced with the notion that they, by virtue of their sexual identity, are ruining their celestial ‘forever’ family and will be separated from them in the hereafter if they choose a same-sex partner.”","The only options left to queer Mormon teens are celibacy or mixed-orientation marriages, “both of which have extremely high levels of dissatisfaction and despair,” Oviatt said.","What LGBTQ kids need, she said, are religious communities that accept them wholeheartedly.","The Naming Project is one such community. The Christian ministry, which seeks to create safe spaces for LGBTQ youth, organizes an annual summer camp in Minnesota for teens of any sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression.","Project director Ross Murray said that ministries like his aim to provide support and affirmation to youth who may feel rejected by their own faith communities. When more religious groups affirm LGBTQ teens as their “whole and authentic selves,” he said, it will lead to healthier adult LGBTQ people of faith.","“When religious communities are affirming and supportive of identity, including sexual orientation and gender identity, then the people within those communities are going to develop into much healthier and better-functioning individuals who understand themselves and how they relate to the rest of the world,” Murray said.","As a child growing up in a non-affirming church, Isaac Archuleta said he experienced depression, anxiety, low self-esteem and substance abuse. Today, he identifies as bisexual and serves as the interim executive director of the Q Christian Fellowship. As a Colorado-based psychotherapist, he focuses on providing therapy to LGBTQ clients and their religious families.","Archuleta said he believes mental health providers should always affirm their clients’ sexual orientation and gender identity. Counselors who, for religious reasons, do not truly accept their LGBTQ clients end up promoting the shame from which their clients need to be rescued. They’re “working against love even though they preach a message of love,” he said.","Studies like the one conducted by Blosnich’s team are necessary, Archuleta argued, to help educate the non-affirming church.","“The most devastating effect for children in non-affirming religious environments, in my opinion, is an identity distortion that teaches the child to feel valueless as a relational being,” Archuleta said. “When a child feels unwelcome, too damaged for relationships, we strip them of their very purpose and sense of worth.”","“For a religion to have such a capacity and the willingness to maintain that maladaptive power is, in my opinion, antithetical to the God of love.”","If you or someone you know needs help, call 1-800-273-8255 for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

The county, after all, went to Donald Trump by more than 30 points, and in the runup to the 2016 election, Burtzloff decided against putting a Hillary Clinton sticker on her car, fearing vandals. Tensions were high, she said.","It’s a conservative place for sure, but also a diverse one. For years, immigrant workers — from Vietnam, Mexico and eventually Somalia — have moved to this flat stretch of prairie and farmland on the Oklahoma border to work at the meatpacking plants. For the most part, people got along, Burtzloff said, but something changed when Trump entered the political scene.","“I will be the first to tell you I do not fear getting killed by a Muslim,” Burtzloff said. “I fear getting killed by an angry white guy. That is much more likely to happen.”","It’s here in a trailer in this town of 20,000 people that three white men — fueled by a steady diet of anti-Muslim online memes and conspiracy theories, and captivated by presidential candidate Trump, who proposed a Muslim ban and proclaimed that “Islam hates us” — appeared to discuss a plot to massacre Somali Muslim immigrants who lived and worked nearby.","Patrick Stein, 49, Curtis Allen, 50, and Gavin Wright, 52, are accused of plotting to bomb an apartment complex that housed many Somalis and its on-site mosque. The three are believed to have gathered fertilizer to make a bomb while they added to their arsenal of weapons and ammunition. But the FBI says it foiled their plans with arrests four weeks before the 2016 election. The men have been in jail ever since.","Their trial began last month. They face up to life in prison if convicted on charges involving weapons of mass destruction and civil rights violations.","Evidence presented in the trial painted a picture of an all-American brand of homegrown terrorism: angry white men radicalized by Islamophobic memes and fake online news articles whose path to violent extremism was accelerated by a divisive election cycle and a candidate who sounded like them.","For the last five weeks, the defendants have shuffled into a federal courthouse in Wichita shackled at the ankles. They’ve listened day in and day out as their own attorneys called them “knuckleheads” whose talk of mass murdering Muslims was just bluster. And they’ve heard prosecutors portray them as sinister would-be terrorists.","Closing arguments took place on Tuesday in the case. A nearly all-white jury is expected to deliver a verdict at any time.","Jurors were played hours of tapes made by an FBI informant who had masqueraded as a militiaman, recording the three defendants as they discussed plans and spewed genocidal hatred of Muslims.","“The Crusaders,” as they called themselves, splintered off from a larger Kansas militia group whose members testified that they thought the three men were too extreme. In the recordings, the men followed a familiar script of Islamophobia.","First there are the conspiracy theories. In one recording they referred to “civilization jihad,” the paranoid idea that American Muslims are secretly conspiring to take over the U.S.","Most Muslims aren’t going to behead people, one of the men said in the recording. Instead, “they sit back and fuck their brains out. Four kids per fucking man per year,” he added, referring to the idea that Muslims are trying to grow the size of their population as quickly as possible. “Their objective is to breed us out of existence.”","Another familiar part of the Islamophobic script was taking Islamic scriptures out of context. In another recording, the jury heard one of the men talk about “taqiyya,” an obscure Islamic concept that white supremacists have willfully misinterpreted to accuse Muslims of lying to non-Muslims in their quest to take over the world.","Because of taqiyya, one of the militiamen explained, Muslims can “deceive and lie. They can go out and drink at the bar, just like you and I, and then the son of a bitch would cut your throat.”","Ultimately, the recordings capture the three men in an ideological frenzy: America was on a crash course with the so-called Muslim world, and they had to prepare for what they called “Crusades 2.0.”","All of these outlandish lies and distortions about Muslims and Islam were abundant online, and a scroll through the three men’s social media profiles showed they devoured this propaganda with abandon — retweeting, liking, sharing and posting.","And they started to hear the messages of these anti-Muslim memes echoed in Trump’s stump speeches, possibly taking inspiration from their favorite candidate’s soundbites.","On the campaign trail, Trump often told the same widely discredited story of how an American general ― over a century ago ― dipped bullets in pig’s blood to kill Muslims (most of whom don’t eat pork). The three men talked openly of dipping their bullets in pig’s blood.","When Trump justified his Muslim ban by citing a discredited poll, Stein shared a meme on Twitter based on that same poll.","Muslims were “cockroaches,” according to recordings of the three men. “You have to kill all of them. They keep coming back,” Stein said. “You have to exterminate them all.”","The men mapped out Muslim targets on Google Earth, dropping “pins” on a map of Garden City, Kansas, a slightly larger town an hour and a half drive north of Liberal. Each pin was labeled “cockroaches.”","According to testimony in the trial, as Trump warned Americans of Somali refugees being terrorists in disguise — “the great Trojan horse of all time” — the men decided on their main target: a Garden City apartment complex home to many Somali Muslims, and the mosque where they prayed.","The men were conscious that this planned massacre might somehow hurt Trump’s chances at becoming president, according to prosecutors, so they scheduled the attack for the day after the election: Nov. 9. This act of terrorism, they said, would “wake people up.”","They started gathering materials for bombs. They did drive-by surveillance of the apartment building they wanted to target. They planned to blow it up as people were praying in the building’s mosque when, as Stein put it, the Muslims were “packed in like sardines.” The shock wave from the bombs, he said, would make “Jello out of their insides.”","The men met with an undercover officer, who they thought was a like-minded arms dealer. Stein grew to trust him.","“We must win this battle because I refuse to go down in history as the generation who lost the best country on the planet,” Stein wrote in an encrypted text to the undercover officer. Stein said he was ready to “take out as many of those bastards as I possibly can till my last breath.”","The three defendants haven’t really denied that they engaged in hateful anti-Muslim talk, which their attorneys have dismissed as blowing off steam, “locker room talk,” as one attorney put it. So instead they’ve been leaning on an entrapment defense, arguing that the plan never would have been possible without the federal government’s involvement.","The defense has argued that the three men were manipulated by fake news but that ultimately all their talk of killing Muslims amounted to angry rants and that they never would’ve carried out their plot had it not been for the FBI’s meddling.","Although Stein, Wright and Allen would ultimately bear responsibility for their alleged terrorist plot, there’s a growing body of evidence showing how Trump might be radicalizing his followers.","Anti-Muslim hate crimes rose dramatically in America in 2015 and 2016, according to FBI statistics, rising to levels not seen since 9/11. Experts have attributed this rise to the divisive election and the hostile rhetoric of Trump.","A recent study found that 83 percent of “hate violence” incidents aimed at South Asian, Muslim, Sikh, Hindu, Middle Eastern and Arab communities in U.S. from November 2016 to November 2017 were anti-Muslim in nature. One in five perpetrators of these violent hate crimes, the study noted, “invoked President Trump’s name, his administration’s policies, or his campaign slogans” during the attacks.","Last month, authorities arrested three militia group members in Illinois for the 2017 bombing of a Minnesota mosque. They were Trump fans. One of the men admired Trump so much that he submitted a detailed bid to build the president’s wall on the Mexican border.","Alexandre Bissonette, the Canadian man convicted of killing six men inside a Quebec mosque in January 2017, searched Trump-related content online over 800 times in the month leading up to his act of terror, prosecutors revealed during a sentencing hearing this week.","Bissonnette told police he was upset over Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s message of welcome to refugees after Trump implemented his ban on immigration from Muslim-majority countries.","A conviction in Kansas this week isn’t a sure thing. “Even if they’re not convicted, I’m not convinced I want them in my community,” said Burtzloff, the Liberal businesswoman.","She rented out a storage unit to one of the three militiamen, where FBI agents found a notepad scribbled over with the names of chemicals needed for bombs. She also once owned the trailer park where another of the men kept his trailer, and where FBI agents found nearly 2,000 pounds of ammunition.","That trailer, and the other trailer in Liberal where the men allegedly hatched their plan, have both since been moved, their contents carried away by federal agents. Among the evidence collected was a manifesto the men had started.","“This is a call to action by all Americans,” they wrote. “Please do not just sit idle until we lose this once great nation.”","Killing Muslim refugees, their manifesto suggested, would make America great again.","Stein, the alleged ringleader of the group, once told the undercover agent by text that he worried about leaving a country that “is nothing resembling what I grew up in to my kids and grandkids.” When the agent pointed out the attack would kill children, Stein replied that he did not care. He thought an attack would help save America.","“We are dedicated patriots with love of country that doesn’t end,” Stein wrote, “and we are willing to die for this country if that is what it takes to get it back.”","HuffPost has been in Wichita, Kansas, to cover this domestic terrorism trial.

Even though that ground is a strange planet.","This is perhaps the most popular show Netflix released this month. “Lost in Space” ultimately didn’t live up to its high expectations though.

Scientology creator L. Ron Hubbard designed this trademark business model for his followers.","To fully educate yourself on Org Board, you need to complete introductory workshops so information about how it works exactly isn’t completely available. However, the Outline broke down the business model by describing its seven divisions. There are the “Communications, Dissemination (sales/marketing), Treasury, Production, Qualifications (quality control), Public (public relations), and, most important to the system, Executive.”","While this doesn’t seem that odd considering most businesses have hierarchy structures in place, Patricia Illingworth, a professor at Northeastern University and a Senior Fellow at the Kennedy School of Government’s Carr Center for Human Rights at Harvard, told the publication that “the model is less ethical than it appears.”","Illingworth noted that a department in the communications division, the department of inspections and reports, essentially spied on other employees and shared “pertinent” information with executives.","“The [department of inspections and] report’s section on ethics is really about a very primitive sense of justice, an eye for an eye, getting back at people who have in some sense harmed the organization,” Illingworth told The Outline.","“If someone in or outside the organization has done something that undercuts the mission of the organization, which is basically making money, then the organization, in the name of ethics, is advised to retaliate against the person in order to ensure that they don’t do it,” she said.","She went on to say that the entire business model was “morally problematic,” adding that “the idea that an organization should fire employees for having views that are different from those of the organization is morally disconcerting even when we don’t share the views, or we are adamantly against them.”","Like Illingworth, Neopet’s founders were against associating the company with Scientology. Co-creator Donna Williams said in a Reddit AMA in 2014 that the company “hired this lady who wanted to bring Scientology onto the site.” Williams said she, alongside co-creator Adam Powell, “fought that as hard as we could and they got rid of her.”","“At one time there was some talk about putting Scientology education on the site, but we killed that idea pretty sharpish,” she wrote. “Adam [Powell] and I made sure that it never made its way onto anything site related. Religion and politics were two big no-nos for us as far as site content went.”","Williams also said she and the other founders suspected the connection about six months after the new staff started working there.

In the latest update to its widely used stylebook, the news service has added a chapter devoted to polls, including a declaration that “poll results that seek to preview the outcome of an election must never be the lead, headline or single subject of any story.”","More broadly, the update urges AP journalists to consider a key question about any poll: “Are its results likely to accurately reflect the opinion of the group being surveyed?”","While the guidelines are written for reporters, they include some useful signposts for anyone to keep in mind when reading about horserace polling ― or public opinion surveys in general.","1. Look at how the survey was conducted.","From AP: “Reputable poll sponsors and public opinion researchers will disclose the methodology used to conduct the survey, including the questions asked and the results to each, so that their survey may be subject to independent examination and analysis by others.”","For a survey to be worth anything, the respondents must be representative of the population being measured ― that is, if a poll purports to be of Americans’ opinions, the people surveyed need to reflect the nation as a whole.","Traditionally, pollsters have done this by randomly calling phone numbers, which (if cell phones are included) theoretically gives everyone with a phone an equal chance of getting called. Others, especially those doing political surveys, will contact people named in voter files. In recent years, a growing number of pollsters have turned to online surveys, with varying levels of rigorousness.","Some kinds of people are more likely to respond to polls than other kinds of people. Pollsters correct for this by weighting their results based on demographics such as gender, age, race and level of education.","Surveys that don’t make an effort to reach a representative sample, or to use methods like weighting to make that sample representative, don’t say much about anyone but the people who answered them. That means it’s generally worth ignoring polls conducted among people who happen to use a specific app. And there’s almost nothing useful to be gleaned from “reader polls” that allow anybody to take them multiple times and that don’t track any sort of demographic information.","A pollster’s willingness to disclose information about how its poll was conducted isn’t an automatic stamp of quality, but an unwillingness to share those details is always a red flag. (Read more about how HuffPost/YouGov polling is conducted here.)","2. Remember that polls are not perfect.","From AP: “When writing or producing stories that cite survey results, take care not to overstate the accuracy of the poll. Even a perfectly executed poll does not guarantee perfectly accurate results.”","Many pollsters report a margin of sampling error ― that is, the error produced by interviewing a random sample of the population, rather than the population as a whole. Although that term is commonly shortened to the margin of error, there are other sources of error as well, including issues with the wording of questions and the possibility of certain groups disproportionately deciding not to respond.","Even surveys conducted by reputable outlets using the methods traditionally thought of as the “gold standard” of polling aren’t immune from error. Figuring out what lessons to draw from pollsters’ challenges in 2016 “would have been much easier if polls that on paper looked more rigorous than other polls performed better,” Courtney Kennedy, director of survey research at the Pew Research Center, explained last year. “It would be very easy to say, ‘Well, you should really hang your hat on these polls that have these characteristics.’ We didn’t really find that.”","The upshot: It’s a good idea generally not to draw big conclusions from small differences. If President Donald Trump’s approval rating goes from 39 percent in one survey to 38 percent the next week, it’s “roughly stable,” not “dropping.” If a poll shows two candidates for a Senate seat separated by just 1 or 2 points, they’re “essentially tied.”","That’s especially true when it comes to subgroups within the pool of respondents ― like Republicans, women or adults under age 30 ― for whom the margin of error is even greater. If a subgroup has fewer than 100 people in a particular survey, the AP won’t even report the results. If the sample size for a group falls beneath that mark, or if it’s not clear how many people that group contains, skip those results.","On the flip side, remember that interviewing a ton of people is no guarantee that a poll is reliable.","3. Look at who’s behind the survey.","From AP: “Polls paid for by candidates or interest groups may be designed to produce results that are beneficial to that candidate or group, and they may be released selectively as a campaign tactic or publicity ploy. These polls should be carefully evaluated and usually avoided.”","Surveys released by a group with a vested interest in the results can contain interesting data, but those results should be taken with a grain of salt.","One example: Polls that claim people will be more or less likely to vote for a candidate based on a specific issue are often used by advocacy groups to push an agenda. But when people say they’d be less likely to vote for Candidate A if he opposed Issue 2, what they often mean is simply that they already dislike A or that they feel negatively toward 2 ― not that it’s really a deciding matter for them.","As an extreme example, 10 percent of people who didn’t support Trump in the 2016 election said that his taste in steaks made them less likely to support him. That was probably not a major factor in the election.","4. Pay attention to timing.","From AP: “Public opinion can change quickly, especially in response to events. ... Be careful when considering results from polls fielded immediately after major events, such as political debates, that often sway public opinion in ways that may only be temporary.”","Surveys aren’t conducted in a vacuum, and looking at when they were in the field ― and what was happening around that time ― provides important context. Support for tougher gun control, for instance, often spikes temporarily in the immediate aftermath of a mass shooting. Public opinion on other issues can shift quickly too, as can candidates’ fortunes.","5. Be careful about apples-to-oranges comparisons and outliers.","From AP: “Comparisons between polls are often newsworthy, especially those that show a change in public opinion over time. But take care when comparing results from different polling organizations, as difference in poll methods and question wording — and not a change in public opinion — may be the cause of differing results.”","Examining multiple polls on a candidate or issue can, however, provide valuable information. When surveys on the same matter differ significantly in methodology and the wording of questions, considering them together can show just how much framing does (or doesn’t) affect public support.","Also, just because a survey produces results that are notably different from those of similar surveys doesn’t mean it’s wrong. But it’s important to recognize when one poll’s results are an outlier and to look more closely at what the causes might be."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ad64c431e000008087b1c82.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"BLACK VOICES","headline":"New Stephon Clark Videos Show Officers Waited 5 Minutes Before Trying To Save Him","authors":"Willa Frej","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-stephon-clark-videos_us_5ad5afb1e4b016a07ea01eb2","short_description":"Officers wondered whether he was armed and pretending to be dead.","date":"2018-04-17"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"How The Energy Industry's Wish List Became The Interior Department's To-Do List","authors":"Molly Redden","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lobbyist-regulations-interior-department_us_5ad10ac8e4b0edca2cb9b45f","short_description":"Ryan Zinke oversees the most business-friendly Interior Department in recent memory.","date":"2018-04-17"},"articleContent":["An Interior Department advisory group relied on a top energy industry lobbyist to help draft a list of potential regulatory rollbacks, documents obtained by HuffPost show.","At least one suggestion ― reducing the role that local environmental concerns play in leasing federal lands for oil and gas development ― quickly became a reality.","The Onshore Work Group, charged with recommending how Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke ought to regulate federal lands available for fossil fuel development, already has deep ties to the energy industry. Its chair is Kathleen Sgamma, the president of the oil and gas industry group Western Energy Alliance and a vocal proponent of tearing down many Obama-era environmental protections.","But metadata from the working group’s first draft of recommendations further link the Interior Department with the industry it is tasked with regulating. According to the metadata, Tripp Parks, the Western Energy Alliance’s head of government affairs, was the initial author of the document.","The working group belongs to a growing cadre of industry-friendly advisory bodies Zinke has set up to guide his agenda. In November, he assembled a wildlife conservation advisory group dominated by people with links to trophy hunting. Most members of a public lands advisory group have connections to the outdoor recreation industry.","“It’s a huge concern,” said John DeCicco, a University of Michigan research professor who has worked for the environmental advocacy group Environmental Defense Fund. Under previous administrations, DeCicco said, committees like these were usually composed of scientific experts. “What it really represents is that certain powerful interests, moneyed interests, they have the ear of policymakers who are running roughshod over due process and running roughshod over important checks and balances that are supposed to be there.”","The working group was set up under the umbrella of the Royalty Policy Committee, a group tasked with recommending the royalty rates the federal government should charge for drilling. Many of the committee’s members hail from the oil and gas sector or have significant ties to it. Whereas the same committee had a narrow, technical focus under previous administrations, under Zinke, it has been making sweeping proposals to roll back regulations on federal lands. The committee members who set up the working group have proposed measures like charging bargain-basement royalties for deepwater drilling operations and have described their mandate as “looking at steps to be taken to make DOI a better business partner to its investors.”","Some of those steps appear to have been come directly from the Western Energy Alliance. A document obtained under the Freedom of Information Act reveals that Parks created the draft recommendations one day before Sgamma circulated them to committee members overseeing the working group.","“It’s a very clear instance of regulatory capture,” said Pat Gallagher, the Sierra Club’s legal director. Of the recommendations, he said, “There is no other object than to get drill bits in the ground as quickly as possible.”","At best, Gallagher said, industry representatives are creating an echo chamber inside the Interior Department. Several of Parks’ recommendations mirror a report the department released in October on “energy burdens.” Sgamma told HuffPost that Parks’ name appears in the document’s metadata because she asked him to pull out relevant sections of the report. This was “the full extent of my staff’s involvement,” she wrote in an email.","The recommendations included items that had been on Western Energy Alliance’s wish list for years, like a proposal to abandon the practice of re-evaluating long-term leases instead of automatically renewing them, which allowed federal regulators to plan around major changes to the landscape, such as new suburban developments.","Sgamma circulated the draft ― which she described as focusing on “increasing the competitiveness of federal lands” ― on Jan. 9, inviting her fellow group members to make changes. Some of Parks’ initial recommendations were cut from later drafts, but the agency has already taken action on one recommendation that survived: The Interior Department quietly ceased the Obama-era practice of planning local drilling sites according to local environmental concerns on Jan. 31. The industry had long argued that the practice created a redundant roadblock to new drilling projects.","“We’re very pleased,” Sgamma said at the time.","A handful of the most influential oil and gas developers in the country fund the Western Energy Alliance. Although it does not currently publicize the names of its members, the alliance has included Devon Energy, Halliburton, Anadarko Petroleum and Pioneer Natural Resources. Its political action committee donated $5,000 to Zinke’s campaigns while he served as Montana’s lone congressman.","The Western Energy Alliance fiercely opposed the Obama administration’s efforts to regulate the oil and gas industry, sometimes to the point of adopting a siege mentality. It invited Rick Berman, known for his ruthless, corporate-backed PR campaigns against environmentalists, to address its members in 2014. At the event, Berman framed the struggle against environmental groups as “an endless war.”","The draft recommendations are not the only example of the Western Energy Alliance having an outsized voice in the Trump administration. Parks, who is not registered as a lobbyist, previously presented an Interior advisory group with 15 recommendations for scrapping protections for the greater sage-grouse, which the industry felt impeded new energy projects; the advisory group adopted 13 of them.","The Interior Department did not respond to HuffPost’s questions about Parks’ role in drafting the recommendations. Sgamma has defended her role in making policy recommendations to the Interior Department by noting she has subject matter expertise. “I’m not an alternate member of the Royalty Policy Committee because of my sparkling personality,” she told HuffPost.","Sgamma added that the Interior Department had considered scrapping several of the Western Energy Alliance’s least favorite regulations even before the formation of her working group.","But the alliance’s relationship with the Trump administration also stretches back many months.","Entries in Zinke’s calendar show he met with representatives of the alliance in April 2017. A brief prepared for the secretary reminded him of a Trump administration order that for every new regulation created, agencies must place two old regulations on the chopping block.","The brief recommended that Zinke ask the alliance lobbyists which regulations he should scrap. But it wasn’t a matter of urgency: The agency has already rolled back more than two regulations for every new rule, the brief made clear, with the result that it had “built [up] a credit.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ad10b6d1e00003b137b179b.jpeg?cache=lOejsWA4tP&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"COMEDY","headline":"Jimmy Kimmel Goes Back In Time To Give Baby Donald Trump Some Much-Needed Advice","authors":"Lee Moran","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jimmy-kimmel-donald-trump-baby_us_5ad59499e4b0edca2cbd4045","short_description":"For the good of the country.","date":"2018-04-17"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Civil Rights Groups Sue Missouri, Saying It's Failing To Automatically Update Voter Records","authors":"Sam Levine","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/missouri-voter-registration-lawsuit_us_5ad660cce4b03c426da9204b","short_description":"They say the state is making eligible voters jump through unnecessary hoops.","date":"2018-04-17"},"articleContent":["Missouri is violating federal law because it does not offer all residents the option to register to vote at the state’s motor vehicle agency or automatically update voter registration information when people notify the state that they have moved, according to a lawsuit civil rights groups filed against the state Tuesday.","Missouri Secretary of State John Ashcroft (R) and Joel Walters, the director of the Department of Revenue, which is responsible for issuing driver’s licenses, have violated the National Voter Registration Act, alleges the suit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri.","The 1993 law requires states to offer people the opportunity to register to vote when they interact with the motor vehicle agency and other state agencies. If someone wants to register to vote at the motor vehicle agency, the information provided on a driver’s license can also be used as a voter registration application for federal elections. The law also says states should update someone’s voter registration if they change their address at the motor vehicle agency, unless the person explicitly says not to.","But lawyers for the ACLU of Missouri, Demos and The Advancement Project say Missouri doesn’t comply with those requirements in several ways.","First, they say Missouri election officials aren’t automatically updating the voter information of people who change their address with the state. Second, they say the state requires military personnel to fill out a separate form to register to vote when they want to get or renew a driver’s license. Third, they allege the state is refusing to offer voter registration opportunities to people who can’t prove they are citizens during a licensing transaction.","The plaintiffs say the state’s process could block the hundreds of thousands of people who move within Missouri each year from casting a valid ballot.","The suit wasn’t filed on behalf of particular voters, but instead on behalf of the Missouri chapters of two groups that dedicate considerable resources to voter registration: the League of Women Voters of Missouri and the A.

And Congress is allowing it.","date":"2018-04-17"},"articleContent":["WASHINGTON ― The vanishing role of Congress in authorizing military force is nothing new. It’s a story that’s played out over decades with overly broad Authorizations for Use of Military Force and liberal interpretations of the president’s powers to conduct war. But if the reaction from a sample of lawmakers this week to President Donald Trump’s latest strike on Syria is any indication, Congress has very little concern ― or knowledge ― about the chief executive’s authority to pre-emptively attack a nation.","HuffPost asked more than 30 lawmakers about the Trump administration’s legal justification for bombing Syria, and while there isn’t a strictly correct answer, it’s clear from those interviews and other reactions since the strike that few lawmakers are concerning themselves with whether the president really has this authority. It’s just not a question they’re asking, despite a clear shift in the president’s rationale for conducting unauthorized war.","The Trump administration sent Congress a letter on Sunday claiming it was in the “vital national security and foreign policy interests of the United States” to conduct the strike, which followed a suspected chemical weapons attack inside Syria by President Bashar al-Assad’s regime. The Trump administration seems to believe the president has the authority to strike a country, without congressional approval, under the powers granted to the office in the Constitution ― just as long as it can say such actions are in our national interests.","That was exactly the answer administration officials ― including Secretary of Defense James Mattis and acting Secretary of State John Sullivan ― gave lawmakers on Tuesday during a private briefing for all House members, according to lawmakers who attended the session.","Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), who has been vocal about his concerns regarding unauthorized war, said he asked what their legal justification was for the strikes. And, according to Massie, the officials said Trump had the authority under Article II of the Constitution, which outlines in the president’s broad powers as commander-in-chief.","But As Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) brought up to HuffPost, that ignores what’s said in Article I: that only Congress has the power to declare war. (Article II also makes clear that the president derives power to direct the military after there has been a declaration, not before.)","Still, the vast majority of lawmakers HuffPost talked to had no issue with the president striking Syria without a new AUMF. And before the briefing, several lawmakers seemed to have little idea under what authority the president claimed for bombing Syria. Some told HuffPost that it was the 2001 AUMF, which Congress quickly passed to authorize military action against anyone associated with the 9/11 attacks, that justified the president’s actions.","“Every president since post-9/11 has had the authorization to make these types of surgical, targeted strikes,” Rep. Karen Handel (R-Ga.) told HuffPost, saying she was referring to the 2001 AUMF.","“We have the legal justification right now under the current AUMF,” Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-Texas) said.","And Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) ― the daughter of Dick Cheney, who was vice president when that AUMF was enacted ― said Friday’s actions were lawful because of it. “I don’t think we ought to just assume that because a certain amount of time has passed, that you’ve got to pass new legislation,” Cheney said.","In a letter to Congress explaining his justification on Sunday ― which very few of the lawmakers interviewed by HuffPost seemed to have read ― Trump did not mention the 2001 AUMF. While the U.S. has routinely used that measure to justify actions against Islamic State fighters in Syria, these strikes were aimed at sending a message to Assad, who has no apparent connection to 9/11 and whose forces also have been fighting ISIS inside Syria.","Trump mentions in the letter that he is providing the report to keep Congress informed, “consistent with the War Powers Resolution.” But according to Massie, the administration officials didn’t mention that resolution when they were asked about the legal justification.","The War Powers Resolution allows the president to use military force after an attack on the U.S., or to strike when the country is in “imminent” danger. Neither of those conditions seem to apply in the case of Syria.","Almost exactly a year ago, Trump ordered a similar bombing campaign against Syria, and because it was also a one-time attack, no one seemed to care about his authorization for that order, either.","Of course, none of this focuses on how the White House views the strikes. Trump justified the attacks by noting his inherent authority as commander-in-chief ― a role that is not clearly defined in the Constitution but has certainly expanded over the course of time.","Some lawmakers acknowledge that Congress has abdicated its responsibilities to authorize military action ― “missing in action” was how California Democratic Reps. Barbara Lee (the only member of Congress to vote against the 2001 AUMF) and Adam Schiff put it. But most interviewed by HuffPost seemed perfectly comfortable with the president claiming some nebulous authority to use the military any way he sees fit.","Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) told HuffPost that the president has the “absolute authority” to make war. And if Congress doesn’t like what the president is doing, then Congress could defund those military actions.","Asked if the president had the authority to bomb London if he decided it was in the national interest, King said the president could ― and there were plenty of lawmakers who implicitly agreed.","As Rep. Roger Williams (R-Texas) told HuffPost, “If he deems it right and it’s in the best concerns, I support him on it.”","Throughout the vast majority of these interviews ― which you can listen to in their entirety below ― it was clear most of the lawmakers did not have a level of familiarity with these issues or didn’t want to dwell on the matter.","House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said Trump used his “Article II” authorities for this strike, suggesting he thinks those powers allow for military actions simply if in the view of the president it’s in the nation’s interests.","And Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said that the administration felt it was on “firm footing” with its legal justification for the Syria strikes.","Pressed on how — presidential authority? The 2001 AUMF? — McConnell just walked away.","The precedent of virtually unlimited war-making power for the president has been taking hold for some time, but it’s becoming even more explicit under Trump.","Certainly, there still are lawmakers who are uncomfortable with the president using the military any way he sees fit ― such as Massie and a small group of Constitutional conservatives. And a number of Democrats are uneasy with the idea, too.","“That justification allows the president to wage war anywhere, anytime, any place that he might want to, simply saying it’s in the national security interest,” Rep. John Garamendi (D-Calif.) said. “We can’t allow that. We simply cannot allow that to happen, with this president or any other president.”","But Democrats like Garamendi are in the minority in Congress. And what’s most notable about the question of the legal justification of striking Syria isn’t that there are a few voices on either side who are uncomfortable with the president conducting war anytime he wants to; what’s most notable is how many lawmakers are amenable to the idea.","This story has been updated with comment from McConnell.

The fourth address, he said, was deleted.","Pruitt’s email accounts, revealed five days ago by The Washington Post, raised concerns that the EPA failed to disclose emails linked to the secret accounts in public records requests. The controversy added to the rapidly cascading series of corruption scandals and ethical lapses that have caused dozens of Democrats and at least three Republican members of Congress to call for his resignation.","Wilcox listed the four email addresses Gina McCarthy, Pruitt’s predecessor, used, and linked to a 2012 Politico story detailing a controversy over former Administrator Lisa Jackson’s secondary email address. In that article, officials from former President George W. Bush’s administration said the “arrangement is nothing new.”","But that didn’t quell concerns from Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), a staunch supporter of the Trump administration’s environmental agenda, who asked the Pruitt to “affirm that the EPA does in fact search all your official email accounts when responding to FOIA requests” in a letter sent to the administrator Friday.","“During your confirmation hearing, I specifically asked you to ‘refrain from taking any action — that makes it difficult or impossible for the public to access your official written communications under the Freedom of Information Act,’ ” Barrasso wrote to Pruitt, according to a transcript published by The Hill and The Washington Post. “You agreed to my request.”","After the Government Accountability Office released a report Monday saying that the $43,000 the EPA spent on a soundproof phone booth for Pruitt was illegal, Barrasso escalated pressure on the administrator by demanding that he “give a full public accounting of this expenditure and explain why the agency thinks it was complying with the law.”","In a separate memo, Wilcox outlined the agency’s defenses on the phone booth and another controversy involving five-figure raises given to EPA political appointees under the Safe Drinking Water Act after the White House rejected requests to bump their salaries. The latter scandal blew up two weeks ago when Pruitt struggled to defend himself during a surprisingly aggressive Fox News interview."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ad6727b1f0000280616d66d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Fox News: Sean Hannity Has 'Our Full Support' Following Michael Cohen Reveal","authors":"Hayley Miller","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fox-news-sean-hannity-michael-cohen_us_5ad63b32e4b016a07ea13301","short_description":"The conservative news outlet said it was “unaware\" of the TV host's \"informal relationship\" with Cohen until Monday.","date":"2018-04-17"},"articleContent":["Fox News is standing by Sean Hannity after it was revealed Monday that he was once represented by Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer.","Cohen’s own counsel identified Hannity as one of Cohen’s clients during a court hearing Monday, after a judge rejected his request to withhold Hannity’s name.","“While FOX News was unaware of Sean Hannity’s informal relationship with Michael Cohen and was surprised by the announcement in court yesterday, we have reviewed the matter and spoken to Sean and he continues to have our full support,” a spokeswoman for Fox News told HuffPost in a statement Tuesday.","Cohen was in court Monday to request that a federal judge limit prosecutors’ access to documents seized during an FBI raid on the lawyer’s office and residence last week.

I think everyone knows that we sent a strong message, and our hope is that they listen to it,” she added.","Less than 24 hours later, however, after the Kremlin denounced the sanctions as “international economic raiding,” Trump decided to put them on hold “because he was not yet comfortable” with executing them, according to The Washington Post. Haley’s comments, the paper further reported, had “caused consternation” in the White House on Sunday.","The cleanup continued the following day after White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters the administration is considering slapping additional sanctions on Russia and that it will make a decision in “the near future.” Larry Kudlow, the president’s chief economic adviser, meanwhile, pinned the blame on Haley by stating that she “got ahead of the curve.”","“There might have been some momentary confusion about that,” he told reporters in West Palm Beach, Florida, on Tuesday.","“With all due respect, I don’t get confused,” Haley later responded in a statement of her own.","The Trump administration’s sharp reversal on sanctions ― as well as the unusual public contradiction between top aides ― left lawmakers of both parties scratching their heads on Tuesday.","“It’s really disheartening to, one, have passed sanctions that haven’t been implemented, and two, to have the White House say, ‘All right, we’re going to do it’ and then move away from it,” Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) told HuffPost. “That’s just not a good signal to Moscow or any of our adversaries or allies.”","Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) said he was not surprised by how the administration handled the matter. Corker was an author of a sanctions bill that Trump signed in August ― but also called “seriously flawed.”","“You know, two weeks ago we were moving out of Syria, and then the next day we weren’t, so it’s just sort of standard confusion,” he told reporters.","The Trump administration’s public rebuke of Haley, in particular, could undermine her standing around the world, said Keith Michael Harper, who served as the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Human Rights Council under President Barack Obama.","Trump has been reluctant to criticize or take punitive measures against Russia, despite its meddling in the 2016 presidential election, support for Assad, the annexation of Crimea and likely poisoning of an ex-Russian spy and his daughter in Britain.","Trump was reportedly furious with his top aides last month after he learned the U.S. had expelled more diplomats and suspected spies ― 60 ― than European allies like France and Germany to punish Russia for its suspected role in the poison attack. “There were curse words,” one official told The Washington Post. “A lot of curse words.”","The U.S. president has offered effusive praise for Russian President Vladimir Putin and has expressed a desire to work with him to solve many of the world’s problems. He has also declined numerous opportunities to denounce Russia for election interference, leaving open the possibility that other foreign actors were responsible.","Yet Trump has also taken some recent steps to call out Russia. “To Iran, and to Russia, I ask: What kind of a nation wants to be associated with the mass murder of innocent men, women, and children?” he asked in a speech announcing U.S. missile strikes against Syria last Friday. Earlier this month, his administration also announced it was hitting 24 Russian oligarchs with sanctions over “malign activity,” including election meddling.","Republicans had few good answers on Tuesday as to why Trump has been hesitant to criticize or take action against Russia.","“I don’t know,” Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) told HuffPost. “I think he has criticized Russia and called them out, but, you know, I don’t know. He has long-standing relationships there.”","“I would support sanctions, definitely,” she added.","Asked why he seemed unwilling to criticize Russia, Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) told HuffPost, “I think he’s criticized them every day when he bombs their chief ally in Syria.”","Democrats, meanwhile, questioned Trump’s commitment to punitive actions against Russia given his reversal on new sanctions.","“The White House shouldn’t have to drag the president kicking and screaming to do the right thing when it comes to punishing Vladimir Putin and Russia,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Tuesday.","“Nikki Haley must be so embarrassed today,” he added. “That she forthrightly says, we’re going to be tough on Russia and do additional sanctions one day and the president contradicts her the next.

The 30-year-old told The Chicago Tribune that he opted to use the interaction as a “teachable moment,” explaining to students that some families have two moms or two dads.","“When the kids asked, ‘Are those flowers from your wife?’ I said, ‘No, they’re from my husband,’” Etter recalled. “There was [a] first grade response, such as ‘Ew, gross.’ I said, ‘Oh no, friends, we’re not going to have that response, because that’s not showing respect.’”","That “teachable moment,” however, apparently backfired. Etter was summoned to the principal’s office after a parent contacted the school about his comments, according to an April 13 statement issued by the Illinois Education Association and sent to faculty and staff.","In that meeting, the statement said, he was told that the parent felt he was “using Valentine’s Day as a means to celebrate his lifestyle choices.” The principal, he said, advised him to “stick to the curriculum.”","“The way the situation was handled has brought me great personal concern,” Etter said, “and continues to cause me to question my security in my teaching position in the district.”","Philip Etter agreed. “This would have never happened if Nathan received flowers from his wife,” he told NBC.","About 100 students, parents and faculty members appeared in support of Etter at a standing-room-only school board meeting Monday where the incident was discussed, the Tribune reported.

Jerry Brown (D) on Tuesday expressed confidence his state would prevail in a looming legal battle over the Trump administration’s plan to weaken auto fuel economy and emissions standards.","“The idea we’re going to roll back the auto standards is absurd. We’re not going to do that,” Brown told reporters at an event hosted by the National Press Club. “We have the legal horsepower to block the immediate legal moves by the Trump administration.”","Two weeks ago, the Environmental Protection Agency rolled out plans to gut vehicle fuel and emissions standards after complaints from automakers. Those 2012 standards, a compromise between California and federal regulators, require vehicles to average 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025, nearly doubling today’s benchmark.","Brown argued that the world auto market, especially China and Europe, demands that U.S. carmakers reduce emissions, not allow more pollution.","“They’re not going to sell cars in China if they don’t have zero-emission vehicles,” he said. “This is just another temporary kerfuffle where the newsies play around with these things. But the hard facts on the ground are we have to intensify, increase, our vehicle emission standards and not weaken them and go in the other direction.”","U.S. automakers, reeling from the financial crisis and subsequent bailout by taxpayers, agreed to the 2012 rules in part because they set national standards, avoiding the need to manufacture one set of vehicles to meet California’s strict standards, and another set for looser requirements in the remaining 70 percent of the U.S. auto market.","But carmakers pushed for relaxing the rules under President Donald Trump, complaining that lower fuel prices were boosting sales of gas-guzzling SUVs and trucks, and that electric and hybrid vehicles encouraged by the regulations weren’t selling.","Automakers, their critics say, prefer to sell gas guzzlers because that’s where the money is. Each $73,000 Cadillac Escalade, for example, nets $35,000 in profit, according to The Detroit News. Electric vehicles, meanwhile, are only half as profitable as cars with combustion engines, a Daimler executive said last year. It’s no wonder that American automakers devoted much of their coveted Super Bowl advertising slots this year to pickup trucks and SUVs.","“They create demand,” said Daniel Becker, the director of the D.C.-based Safe Climate Campaign’s Center for Auto Safety. “They know how to market vehicles ― that’s what they do for their existence. They want to make the vehicles that they make the biggest profit on.”","Brown said he was disappointed that people in Washington and elsewhere seemed to be “consumed by nonsense” rather than by the threat of climate change.","“People are asleep,” he said. “When you pick up the paper or turn on cable news, you’d think its another planet. It’s all about the nonsense of Washington, and carbon emissions are growing, and we’ve gotta radically turn that around or the migrations you see now are going to be child’s play. We’re going to have more conflicts, more terrorism, more insecurity because of climate disruption.”","Brown, 80, is California’s longest-serving governor.

A separate lawsuit was filed against CoreCivic by immigrant detainees in California in December. The second-largest prison company in the United States, the GEO Group, is also facing multiple lawsuits over its pay of detainees: one filed in Colorado by immigrants in 2015, and the other from the state of Washington last year. The GEO Group has disputed claims that it is violating the law.","Similar lawsuits have challenged work schemes in U.S. prisons, without success. But the lawsuits challenging the low pay for immigrant detainees contend that those detained under civil infractions like immigration violations should be entitled to receive the federal minimum wage.","Obliging detainees to work for such low wages subsidizes CoreCivic, which should either pay minimum wage or look to the local labor market for employees if detainees refuse to work, the lawsuit adds.","“CoreCivic’s economic windfall, and the profitability of its immigration detention enterprise, arises from its corporate scheme, plan, and pattern of systemically withholding basic necessities from detained immigrants to ensure a readily available, captive labor force that cleans, maintains, and operates its facilities for subminimum wages under threat of solitary confinement, criminal prosecution, and other sanctions,” the complaint says. “Without this nearly free labor, CoreCivic’s windfall from immigrant detention would be substantially decreased.”","CoreCivic spokesman Jonathan Burns said that the company does not comment on pending litigation as a matter of policy. He added that “all work programs at our ICE detention facilities are completely voluntary and operated in full compliance with ICE standards, including federally mandated statutory reimbursement rates for Voluntary Work Program participants.”","“We have worked in close partnership with ICE for more than 30 years and will continue to provide a safe and humane environment to those entrusted to our care.”","Detainees at CoreCivi’s remote detention center commonly work in the kitchen or carry out cleaning or custodial work, for which they earn approximately $1 per hour. Those who work double shifts can make as much as $8 in a day.","Wilhen Hill Barrientos, a Guatemalan national detained at Stewart who is seeking asylum, routinely works eight-hour shifts in the kitchen, seven days per week, according to the complaint. On days he works 12 or more hours, he makes $8, which is paid in the form of a credit to his commissary account.

Kaufman","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sec-eog-divest_us_5ad628b7e4b016a07ea110b1","short_description":"The agency's ruling in a little-noticed case last month has knocked the wind out of the push for shareholder activism, a favorite neoliberal tactic to address climate change.","date":"2018-04-17"},"articleContent":["The Securities and Exchange Commission has waded into the debate over what investors can do to stop fossil fuel companies from destroying the Earth’s habitable climate. And in siding with a major oil company, the agency inadvertently strengthened the case for divesting from fossil fuels altogether.","Late last year, Trillium Asset Management, an investment firm that works with environmental groups but also has fossil fuel investments, proposed a shareholder resolution calling for EOG Resources, one of the largest oil producers in the country, to set a target for cutting greenhouse gas emissions. But before shareholders could vote on the proposal, EOG complained to the SEC, requesting approval to ignore the proposal, which it said would “micromanage” the company with a “rigid and time-bound” target.","In February, the SEC agreed with EOG’s concerns, stating shareholders “would not be in a position to make an informed judgment” on the “matters of a complex nature” on which the resolutions sought to act. Last month, the SEC sent a formal letter to Trillium rejecting the proposal, allowing EOG to ignore the resolution and block a vote.","Axios’ Amy Harder, who drew national attention to the case earlier this month, called the move “unprecedented,” leaving investors “stunned.”","The ruling is a major setback for advocates who say internal shareholder pressure from high-minded investors is the best way to reduce pollution by corporate giants. It also adds new weight to arguments calling for more severe government intervention in the energy industry, either by nationalizing utilities and fossil fuel producers or imposing steep levies on emissions and extractive industries. But with Republicans in control of all three branches of the federal government and Democrats largely wrestling over whether to embrace more leftist economic principles, neither of these prospects is likely to happen in the near future.","So, at least in the short term, the SEC decision strengthens the case that the only serious strategy for investors to pressure fossil fuel companies is to completely pull their money out.","In the year leading up to last February, shareholders filed 429 resolutions, 83 focused on climate change, according to an annual report tracking such proposals. Of that 83 figure, which represents 20 percent of all proposals, 27 resolutions called for carbon risk disclosures and another 27 demanded that companies set deadlines for reducing emissions.","Such proposals, even when enacted, do little to incentivize companies to change polluting business practices while providing a veneer of progressive action. Take, for example, Exxon Mobil Corp. The oil giant caved to shareholder pressure last year to thoroughly account for its climate change risks and, in February, issued its first report. But, in a brazen move, the report claimed there is nearly no risk to Exxon Mobil’s business.","In March, Occidental Petroleum, one of the largest oil producers in Texas, responded to shareholders’ climate concerns with its own report, finding, curiously, that the company’s business won’t be impacted by global warming or policies to reduce the emissions causing it.","The existence of the reports represents the start of slow change at these companies, said Danielle Fugere, president of the nonprofit As You Sow, which tracks shareholder proxy fights. Even if the reports are tailored to bolster companies’ profit outlook, she said they provide information to investors that can ultimately strengthen the case for divestment.","“Even when a company doesn’t necessarily give you the response you want, their response gives you information, and that’s the real goal,” she told HuffPost. “Obviously the oil and gas companies haven’t changed what they do, but from an investor perspective, even getting them to think about how they can transition is good.”","But that sort of patient approach to shifting away from fossil fuels conflicts with the increasingly dire warnings from climate scientists who say the world economy requires an urgent transformation to avoid planetary catastrophe. Small, incremental fixes in the form of market solutions and corporate reformism represent what The Intercept’s Kate Aronoff described as “denial by a different name.”","“Shareholder resolutions and shareholder activism pushing fossil fuel companies to change has to take into account what we are really asking for: We need to see real decarbonization plans,” Ben Cushing, who helps lead the Sierra Club’s Beyond Dirty Fuels campaign, told HuffPost. “That really gets at the core of the fossil fuel industry’s business model.”","The divestment movement gained significant momentum this year after New York City announced plans in January to pull roughly $5 billion in pension fund investments out of oil, gas and coal companies and sue oil companies for climate change-related damages, a move quickly followed by other cities. European capitals including Berlin, Stockholm and Paris made similar divestments in 2016.","“Since companies weren’t being responsive to shareholders anyway ― witness Exxon’s recent absurd declaration that it faced no real climate risk ― it may save everyone the trouble of pretending that they’ll someday actually engage,” Bill McKibben, the founder of 350.org, told HuffPost. “It further strengthens the already overwhelming argument for divestment, and makes politicians like Bill de Blasio and Scott Stringer look prescient for the announcement earlier this year that New York City was done playing around with these guys.”","Still, even divestment is only a first step.","“The dominant framework has been about a neoliberal approach and it has failed over and over again,” Ashley Dawson, author of the book ”Extreme Cities: The Peril and Promise of Urban Life in the Age of Climate Change,” told HuffPost. “That whole approach is hugely flawed, so I think we need to really think about a much more radical solution.”","Dawson pointed to the proposal from British Labour Party Leader Jeremy Corbyn to nationalize the electrical grid and shift the United Kingdom to 65 percent renewable energy by 2030.","“We need to have really progressive conversations about how we get from where we are presently to carbon zero state,” he said. “To have a conversation about how to do that on a national scale and how to do that at a really fast rate we need to be talking about a public push rather than the kind of market-based arguments you hear so much in the United States.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ad629b11f0000270616d619.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"CRIME","headline":"Bungling Robbery Suspects Receive Much-Deserved Dose Of Karma","authors":"Lee Moran","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/robbery-suspects-karma-video_us_5ad5c1c2e4b0edca2cbd9ebb","short_description":"A gusty Mother Nature spoiled the getaway.","date":"2018-04-17"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Jordan Peele, BuzzFeed Create Fake News Video To Warn Of 'Dangerous Time'","authors":"Jenna Amatulli","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jordan-peele-buzzfeed-create-alarming-fake-news-psa-this-is-a-dangerous-time_us_5ad61cb8e4b0edca2cbe54fb","short_description":"Barack Obama appears to say, \"Stay woke, bitches.\"","date":"2018-04-17"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"QUEER VOICES","headline":"Samira Wiley Praises Ellen DeGeneres As 'Lord Of The Lesbians'","authors":"Curtis M.

Trent Franks (R). Franks resigned in December after it emerged that he had offered a female aide $5 million to serve as a surrogate mother for his children.","Although the odds of Tipirneni flipping the seat are not in her favor, her candidacy has excited the Democratic base, enabling the party to improve its chances in other races. In November, Arizona Democrats hope to take control of the state Senate and plan to mount serious bids for the governorship and an open U.S. Senate seat.","“The party is confident that 2018 could be a big year for Arizona,” said Drew Anderson, spokesman for the Arizona Democratic Party.","Arizona’s 8th Congressional District is composed of suburbs north and west of Phoenix. The district is home to a large number of retirees: More than one-fifth of residents are 65 or older.","In 2016, President Donald Trump defeated Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in the district by 21 percentage points. That same year, the district re-elected Franks by an even wider margin, but his main opponent was from the Green Party, not the Democratic Party.","Other parts of Arizona, including adjacent areas of the Phoenix metropolitan area, have been trending more Democratic. Clinton lost the state by just 3.5 percentage points, and in Maricopa County, which encompasses greater Phoenix, voters ousted Joe Arpaio, the notoriously anti-immigrant sheriff.","Now, in a reflection of this year’s higher-than-usual Democratic enthusiasm, public polling indicates that the race for Arizona’s 8th is competitive. Tipirneni even leads Lesko by 1 percentage point in an Emerson College poll released Monday, although political strategists still see her as an underdog.","National Republican groups have responded in force, hoping to avoid another embarrassing defeat in solid-red territory. Three groups ― the Republican National Committee, the National Republican Congressional Committee and the Congressional Leadership Fund super PAC ― have together spent nearly $1 million boosting Lesko’s bid.","The outside airpower aims to narrow the damage of Tipirneni’s fundraising lead over Lesko. Tipirneni has raised $740,000 compared with Lesko’s $564,000 haul. (Former Rep. Franks is among Lesko’s high-dollar donors, contributing the maximum of $2,700 allowed from an individual.)","And while the Arizona Democratic Party has pitched in for Tipirneni with a field office, staff and get-out-the-vote resources, national Democratic groups, including the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the Democratic National Committee, have not given her any cash directly.","The DNC has, however, used its email list to fundraise for Tipirneni. It also contributed a five-figure grant to the Arizona Democratic Party for voter outreach and registration through its State Party Innovation Fund, though the grant is not earmarked for use in the special election for Arizona’s 8th District.","Tipirneni’s biggest individual national booster may be Ady Barkan, an ALS-stricken activist who leads the progressive Center for Popular Democracy Action. Barkan, who played a lead role in Capitol Hill protests against the GOP tax cuts, traveled to the district to campaign for Tipirneni ― and press Lesko about her stances on cutting major social insurance programs.","Asked whether she was disappointed that the national party had not provided more support for her bid, Tipirneni responded indirectly.","“We have learned very clearly that every state is worth contesting and every race is worth investing in,” Tipirneni told HuffPost in an interview. “We’ve learned that repeatedly, so I don’t know why we’re even addressing it.”","An aide to Lesko said he would respond later this week to detailed questions about her policy stances and campaign. HuffPost will update this article accordingly.","It is hard not to see in the race for Arizona’s 8th some of the same elements that propelled Democrats to an upset victory in the March 14 special election for Pennsylvania’s 18th Congressional District.","Tipirneni is benefiting from the enthusiasm and mobilization of the district’s Democratic voters, particularly suburban women, in the wake of Trump’s election.","Recent policy battles in Arizona, one of several GOP-controlled states experiencing a backlash, including threatened teacher strikes, after years of fiscal austerity, have created a ready-made corps of activists primed to canvass for Tipirneni. Many of the same women knocking on doors for Tipirneni now had already mobilized against a bill in the state Legislature expanding private school vouchers. Lesko was a sponsor of the school voucher bill, which has since become a law that’s being challenged on the November ballot.","At the same time, Tipirneni is keenly aware that she needs the support of independents and Republicans to win. To this end, she has not made Trump a focus of her run ― or really spoken much about him at all.","“When people ask, I speak about him,” Tipirneni told HuffPost. Even then, Tipirneni does not dwell much on Trump as a person. She criticizes the president in the context of his work with congressional Republicans to pass policies Tipirneni opposes, such as the tax cut legislation, which she calls “atrocious.”","Indeed, Tipirneni has focused on the kitchen-table issues of health care, education and retirement security.","She supports creating a Medicare-like public option to compete with private plans that would be accessible to all Americans.","The proposal has prompted charges from Lesko that Tipirneni is too liberal for the district. “She’s for this socialized, Bernie Sanders, Medicare for all. And that’s not what our constituents want,” Lesko said in a televised debate with Tipirneni in late March.","In fact, while Sen. Sanders proposes replacing private insurance with Medicare, Tipirneni would simply permit people to buy into the program.","And she laments the pressure to cut Social Security and Medicare as the GOP tax cuts add $1.5 trillion to the national debt. (In an interview discussing his decision not to seek re-election, House Speaker Paul Ryan expressed regret that he had not accomplished “entitlement reform,” a euphemism for scaling back major social insurance programs.)","“A lot of my community are elderly folks, retirees. For them, Medicare and Social Security are their lifelines,” Tipirneni said. “These are earned benefits that they have paid into through decades of hard work.”","“It’s just unconscionable that on the backs of seniors they would pay for this huge corporate tax cut that puts billions of dollars into the pockets of companies like Exxon and Walmart, as opposed to folks who could really use that help,” she added.","In lieu of the current tax revision, Tipirneni proposes making the middle-class tax cuts in the law permanent and expanding them so they reach more people.","Although Tipirneni’s progressive policy stances put her comfortably in the Democratic mainstream, she identifies as a “moderate Democrat” and emphasizes her “data-driven approach” to policy.","“Show me the facts, show me the research. That’s what my science background brings to the table,” Tipirneni said.","For her part, Lesko has touted her conservative bona fides and devotion to Trump’s agenda, not least on the hot-button issue of immigration.","In a 30-second TV ad, “Built the Wall,” Lesko declares her support for Trump’s plan to build a wall on the southern U.S. border but also says it’s “not enough.”","“We need more Border Patrol agents and the best technology to stop this invasion,” she says.","Republicans have also accused Tipirneni of financially benefiting from the ACA. Her firm, CSRA, received a contract to assist with Obamacare enrollment. But Tipirneni said her research work is completely separate and that she has not profited from the landmark health care law in any way.","Tipirneni remains optimistic about her bid, but she also acknowledged the importance of her bid in increasing the Democratic Party’s reach in the state ahead of the November elections. The party’s biggest pickup opportunity is likely in the state Senate, where Republicans currently have a four-seat majority.","“Whatever happens on April 24, we have definitely laid the groundwork to continue the momentum forward,” Tipirneni said."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ad53add1e00003b137b1ac7.jpeg?cache=nHbi1OvbQA&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Jim Carrey Savages Sean 'Manatee' Hannity With Piercing New Portrait","authors":"Lee Moran","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jim-carrey-sean-hannity-artwork_us_5ad5a1e3e4b0edca2cbd555f","short_description":"\"Some endangered species aren't worth saving.\"","date":"2018-04-17"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"CRIME","headline":"Chicago Shootings Spike Amid Weekend Violence","authors":"David Lohr","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chicago-shootings-spike-amid-weekend-violence_us_5ad6703de4b03c426da92c24","short_description":"More than 600 people have been shot in the city this year.","date":"2018-04-17"},"articleContent":["A bloody weekend in Chicago boosted the number of shootings and homicides that have occurred in the city so far this year.","According to The Chicago Tribune, the violence began around 3:40 a.m. Saturday, with a shooting in Woodlawn.

The destruction of a firearm must also be recorded with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.","Although there is no officially outlined process for disabling an assault-style rifle, the ATF recommends making a series of cuts to a gun’s receiver, the piece that houses a firearm’s internal components.","It’s unclear if Dick’s had the option of returning its assault-style rifles to gun manufacturers, which typically offer dealers partial refunds for unsold firearms.","“Gun companies aren’t obligated to accept merchandise back from a retailer or a wholesaler, but they normally do accept it and reimburse minus a restocking fee of 10 percent to 20 percent, which is what the retailer/wholesaler loses from what he originally paid,” said Mike Weisser, a Massachusetts-based gun dealer who has previously blogged for HuffPost as “Mike the Gun Guy.”","Dick’s choice to destroy the assault-style rifles rather than return the firearms to a manufacturer that could redistribute them seems consistent with the company’s efforts to take a principled stance in the wake of the Parkland shooting, in which 17 people were killed at a high school.","“Thoughts and prayers are not enough,” Dick’s CEO Edward Stack said in February as he announced the company’s decision to end the gun sales. “We support and respect the Second Amendment, and we recognize and appreciate that the vast majority of gun owners in this country are responsible, law-abiding citizens. But we have to help solve the problem that’s in front of us. Gun violence is an epidemic that’s taking the lives of too many people, including the brightest hope for the future of America ― our kids.”","Dick’s has pulled assault-style firearms from its shelves before. In the aftermath of the 2012 shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, that killed 26 people, the company stopped selling the rifles at its main stores. It resumed selling them, but only at its 35 Field & Stream stores, in 2013."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a96a71d1f00005200168b2a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"COMEDY","headline":"Colbert Can't Hide His Pleasure After Learning Hannity Was Cohen's Mystery Client","authors":"Ed Mazza","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/stephen-colbert-donald-trump-lawyer_us_5ad551bde4b016a07e9fb8ec","short_description":"\"Late Show\" host revels in the latest news on the Fox News host.","date":"2018-04-17"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"See Emma Watson's Glorious 'Harry Potter' Reunion With Costars","authors":"Ron Dicker","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/emma-watson-harry-potter-reunion_us_5ad5bb4be4b0edca2cbd9390","short_description":"They're still a class act.","date":"2018-04-17"},"articleContent":["They can still make magic together.","Emma Watson reunited with “Harry Potter” costars Tom Felton and Matthew Lewis in a black-and-white snap that will make you pine for the days of the fantasy franchise.","The photo features a beaming Watson (Hermione Granger) flanked by Felton (Draco Malfoy) and Matthew Lewis (Neville Longbottom) wearing backward baseball caps.","Definitely not Hogwarts-issue, lads.","Felton posted the glorious pic on Monday, and it quickly racked up more than a million “likes” on Instagram.","Watson, 28, has seen her stardom grow since the hit film “Beauty and the Beast,” and the boys’ grown-up acting careers aren’t too shabby, either.

She was 92 years old.","Bush, the wife of former President George H.W. Bush, had been suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and congestive heart failure. A spokesman for her family had announced Sunday that she would no longer seek medical treatment after a recent series of hospitalizations.","Her son, former President George W. Bush, released a statement to the press on behalf of himself, his wife, and his twin daughters.","My dear mother has passed away at age 92. Laura, Barbara, Jenna and I are sad, but our souls are settled because we know hers was. Barabara Bush was a fabulous First Lady and a woman unlike any other who brought levity, love and literacy to millions. To us, she was so much more. Mom kept us on our toes and kept us laughing until the end. I’m a lucky man that Barbara Bush was my mother. Our family will miss her dearly, and we thank you all for your prayers and good wishes.","George P. Bush, son of Jeb Bush, honored his grandmother’s legacy in a statement to Twitter.","My grandmother’s entire life was focused on others. For my grandfather, she was his top adviser and confidante. For her family, she was a steady, loving and guiding hand. And for her country, she was an inspiration and an example for all. My grandmother didn’t just live life; she lived it well. And the sorrow of her loss is softened by the knowledge of her impact on our family and our country. I will miss you, Ganny — but know we will see you again.","As first lady from 1989 to 1993, she was known for her work on early childhood education. In 1989, she established the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy, with the goal of raising awareness about the importance of reading and writing at a young age. She was also recognized for her work on AIDS awareness and cancer research.","The Bushes celebrated their 73rd wedding anniversary in January, making them the longest-married couple in presidential history. Since leaving the White House, they had split their time between Houston and the Bush family home in Kennebunkport, Maine.","Bush is survived by her husband, her five living children, 14 grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.","Bush, née Barbara Pierce, was born in New York City on June 8, 1925, and raised in the suburb of Rye. Her father, Marvin Pierce, was the president of McCall Corp., the publisher of popular magazines including Redbook. Her mother, Pauline Pierce, was killed in a car accident in 1949. Bush was the third of four children.","As a child, she developed a love of reading, encouraged by her publisher father. She attended the prestigious Rye Country Day School and later Ashley Hall, a boarding school in South Carolina.","While visiting her family during her winter break in 1941, she attended a dance in Greenwich, Connecticut. It was there she met her future husband, who was attending Phillips Academy Andover, a prep school in Massachusetts. The two connected instantly and wrote letters to one another while they were away at school. George took Barbara to his senior prom, and the pair continued their courtship after George graduated from Andover and deferred admission to Yale University in order to enlist to fight in World War II.","As Barbara returned for her senior year at Ashley Hall, George departed for the Navy, attending flight training in North Carolina, Minnesota and Texas. They didn’t see each other for nearly a year but continued to exchange letters and plan for a future together. After Barbara’s graduation, George invited her to spend part of her summer with his family in Kennebunkport. At the end of that trip, they became engaged to be married.","George returned to the Navy, ready to ship overseas as a torpedo bomber pilot, and Barbara set off for her first year at Smith College. (She dropped out two years later, shortly before their wedding.) In a letter written in December 1943, George expressed his reservations about shipping overseas and leaving “Bar” behind.","“I do want to go because it is my part. But ... even now, with a good while between us and the sea, I am thinking of getting back,” he wrote. “This may sound melodramatic, but if it does it is only my inadequacy to say what I mean. Bar, you have made my life full of everything I could ever dream of — my complete happiness should be to hear of my love for you.”","The two were married on Jan. 6, 1945, while George was home from the war on leave. After the war ended later that year, the Bushes moved to New Haven, Connecticut, so George could attend Yale.","In July 1946, the couple had their first child ― future President George Walker Bush. After her husband’s graduation from Yale in 1948, the Bush family moved to Texas so he could pursue a career in the oil industry. The move would be one of many for the young family: By the time they settled into the White House for four years, they had lived in 29 different homes. After their big move west, the couple had two more children: Pauline Robinson, whom they called Robin, was born in 1949, and John Ellis, known as Jeb, came along in 1953.","Tragedy struck the Bush family shortly after Jeb’s birth when 3-year-old Robin was diagnosed with leukemia. She died seven months later.","“Both George and I felt this enormous physical pain for months afterward,” Barbara said in a 1988 interview with Texas Monthly. “It felt like our hearts were breaking.”","Later, the Bushes would become major boosters for cancer research, raising millions of dollars for the University of Texas’ MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.","The Bushes had three more children: Neil, born in 1955; Marvin, born in 1956; and Dorothy, born in 1959.","Meanwhile, George’s political career was beginning to take off. In Houston, he was elected chairman of the Harris County Republican Party and shortly thereafter made a bid for the U.S. Senate in 1964. He lost that race but was elected to the U.S. House two years later. Barbara took on the bulk of the work of raising their five young children but made occasional stops on the campaign trail.","“Barbara Bush enjoyed politics,” according to the 1996 book American First Ladies: Their Lives and Their Legacy, edited by Lewis Goud. “Her warmth and extroverted personality played well on the campaign trail; she was adept at small talk and rarely forgot a name. However, untrue or unfair statements provoked immediate and sometimes caustic responses from Mrs. Bush. She had to learn to control herself, to hold back.”","After another failed run for Senate in 1970, George was appointed by President Richard Nixon as ambassador to the United Nations. He went on to take several other posts in the Nixon and Ford administrations, including U.S. envoy to China and director of the Central Intelligence Agency.","During George’s time at the U.N., the couple spent most of their time in New York. Barbara volunteered at Sloan-Kettering Memorial Hospital, where Robin had been treated for leukemia. In China, Barbara took daily lessons to learn the language, studied Chinese history and explored Beijing by bicycle.","The couple returned to Washington in 1976 as George took the helm of the CIA. Years later, Barbara revealed that she experienced serious depression at that time, overwhelmed by being separated from her children as well as the demands of her husband’s job. She said she also felt regrets over spending her time as a homemaker, saying that “suddenly women’s lib had made me feel my life had been wasted.”","“I would feel like crying a lot and I really, painfully hurt,” she said in 1990. “And I would think bad thoughts, I will tell you. It was not nice.”","She decided to combat her depression by throwing herself into volunteer work. She spent long hours at Washington Home, a hospice care center. She also gave public presentations on her time in China.","Life again shifted for the Bushes when George decided to run for the Republican presidential nomination in 1980. The couple returned to Houston but spent the better part of two years on the campaign trail. She regularly met with Republican women over tea, showing her China slideshow to introduce voters to her family. According to biographer Pamela Kilian, “Her outgoing personality and well-honed social instincts helped her establish a quick rapport with audiences, and her confidence grew.”","While George won several contests, including the Iowa caucus and the Massachusetts and Michigan primaries, his GOP rival Ronald Reagan eventually appeared unstoppable. In May, George dropped out of the primary race and backed Reagan, who later selected him as his running mate. In November, the Republican ticket soundly defeated President Jimmy Carter and Vice President Walter Mondale, sending the Bushes back to Washington once again.","Barbara’s new role of “second lady” came with increased scrutiny. During the campaign, she had been questioned on her earlier support for the Equal Rights Amendment (which she backed off from), her decision to leave Smith College after two years and her role as a homemaker. By the time the couple moved into the vice presidential residence near Washington’s Embassy Row, Barbara was well-accustomed to interest from the press and the public.","Her years as second lady were largely spent attending dinners with foreign dignitaries and traveling with her husband. She also sowed the seeds for her future signature issue as first lady, literacy, by joining the board of Reading Is Fundamental.","At times, she found herself in the spotlight for her unwillingness to censor herself, perhaps most notably during the Reagan-Bush ticket’s 1984 re-election campaign when she referred to the Democratic vice presidential nominee, Geraldine Ferraro, as a “$4 million ― I can’t say it, but it rhymes with rich” after the then-New York congresswoman had criticized the Bushes for their wealth. Barbara later called Ferraro to apologize.","“She’ll go to bat for me, sometimes more than I’m inclined to myself,” George said of his wife at the time. “She’ll take ’em on head to head, dog-eat-dog. And that’s fine.”","The GOP ticket won that year’s race in a landslide.","By the end of Reagan’s second term, George was laying the groundwork for another stab at the presidency. His campaign got off to a rocky start: He came in third in the Iowa caucus. And Barbara faced scrutiny for her appearance and her traditional background. She also had to fend off rumors that her husband had had an affair with a staffer.","“I’m not going to turn into a glamorous princess,” she said in 1988. “I have plenty of self-confidence, not in how I look but in how I feel, and I feel good about my husband, my children and my life.”","George eventually defeated his GOP opponents to win the nomination and selected Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana as his running mate. The pair easily defeated Democrat Michael Dukakis, marking the third consecutive presidential win for the GOP.","George’s popularity as president ebbed and flowed, ultimately dipping as the 1992 election approached. But Barbara’s approval ratings soared ahead of her husband’s. The public saw her as down-to-earth, straightforward and tough, and her frequent self-deprecating comments endeared her to voters. According to a 1992 Vanity Fair profile, her aides referred to her as “the National Treasure ... in sly tribute to the qualities that make her an awesome asset to her husband.”","She devoted her time to a variety of causes ― primarily literacy, but also AIDS awareness, homelessness and poverty. She pressed the American people to get involved with volunteer work and stressed the importance of volunteer programs in schools.","“Everybody has something, whether you have time or money or know-how or space,” she said in 1989. “The drug problem worries me’ or ‘crime worries me’ or ‘illiteracy worries me.’ If it worries you, then you’ve got to do something about it.”","One of the most high-profile moments of her time as first lady was a 1990 commencement speech at Wellesley College, the all-women school outside Boston. As The New York Times reported, some students protested the speech, arguing “she did not represent the type of career woman the college seeks to educate.” Despite the protests and a petition circulated among the students, she delivered her speech, urging the graduates to “believe in something larger than yourself” and to remember to make time for the important people in their lives.","“For several years, you’ve had impressed upon you the importance to your career of dedication and hard work, and, of course, that’s true,” she said. “But as important as your obligations as a doctor, lawyer or business leader will be, you are a human being first, and those human connections ― with spouses, with children, with friends ― are the most important investments you will ever make.”","During the 1990 midterm elections, Barbara was an in-demand campaign asset for many Republicans.","“She inspires rank-and-file Republicans to pull the ticket through,” Republican National Committee official Leslie Goodman told the Times that October. “There is no question that she can make people go to the polls.”","That goodwill among Republicans, however, wasn’t enough to keep her husband in office. He lost his 1992 re-election bid to Democrat Bill Clinton after a long and often bitter campaign. Upon leaving the White House, she advised incoming first lady Hillary Clinton to steer clear of the media, pinning some of the blame for her husband’s defeat on what she felt was unfair coverage.","“Stonewall them,” she suggested to Hillary.","The Bushes returned to Houston, and Barbara continued to champion childhood literacy and other causes. After a multi-year hiatus, she returned to the campaign trail to support her oldest son’s successful quest for the presidency in 2000.","After George W. Bush’s tumultuous eight years in office, she was hesitant to get behind her son Jeb’s presidential ambitions.","“We’ve had enough Bushes,” she said in 2013.","Nevertheless, when Jeb mounted his bid for the 2016 GOP nomination, Barbara was right beside him. While Jeb’s campaign fell short, his mother did give him a jolt of press attention as he lagged in the polls.","“Mom, my crowd sizes normally aren’t this large. I wonder why,” Jeb said at an event where she joined him in New Hampshire in February 2016.","She later waded into the 2016 race to criticize its eventual winner, Donald Trump, telling CNN she was “sick of” the businessman.","Trump released a statement celebrating the life of the “wife, mother, grandmother, military spouse, and former first lady.”","“Amongst her greatest achievements was recognizing the importance of literacy as a fundamental family value that requires nurturing and protection,” Trump’s statement read. “She will be long remembered for her strong devotion to country and family, both of which she served unfailingly well.”","Former President Bill Clinton gave tribute to the “remarkable” former first lady on social media Tuesday.","“Barbara Bush was a remarkable woman. She had grit & grace, brains & beauty,” Clinton tweeted. “She was fierce & feisty in support of her family & friends, her country & her causes. She showed us what an honest, vibrant, full life looks like. Hillary and I mourn her passing and bless her memory.”","Barack and Michelle Obama, the former president and first lady, released a joint statement, calling Barbara Bush the rock of her family.","We’ll always be grateful to Mrs. Bush for the generosity she showed to us throughout our time in the White House, but we’re even more grateful for the way she lived her life ― as a testament to the fact that public service is an important and noble calling; as an example of the humility and decency that reflects the very best of the American statement."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/587fc9d4170000880192ad9c.jpeg?cache=6eZAQBaZih&ops=crop_12_38_2940_1914%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Sandy Hook Parents Hit Alex Jones With Defamation Lawsuits","authors":"Sebastian Murdock","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sandy-hook-parents-hit-alex-jones-with-defamation-lawsuits_us_5acf6a6de4b0ac383d74bfe1","short_description":"Suits against the Infowars host keep piling up.","date":"2018-04-17"},"articleContent":["Alex Jones has spent years claiming the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School ― where a shooter killed 20 small children and six adults ― was faked. He has claimed the parents of these dead children are liars and “crisis actors.”","Now, those parents are coming after him.","In a pair of lawsuits filed late Monday, the parents of two children who died in the December 2012 shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, say Jones’ repeated lies and conspiratorial ravings have led to death threats. The suits join at least two other recent cases accusing the Infowars host of defamation.","Neil Heslin, the father of a 6-year-old boy killed in the shooting, and Leonard Pozner and Veronique De La Rosa, who lost their own little boy, filed the suits in Austin, Texas, where Jones’ conspiracy-minded media outlet is based. Each suit is seeking more than $1 million in damages from Jones, Infowars and a related company, Free Speech Systems LLC. Infowars reporter Owen Shroyer is also named in one of the suits.","“Even after these folks had to experience this trauma, for the next five years they were tormented by Alex Jones with vicious lies about them,” Mark Bankston, the lawyer handling the cases for the parents, told HuffPost. “And these lies were meant to convince his audience that the Sandy Hook parents are frauds and have perpetrated a sinister lie on the American people.”","Bankston, of the Houston law firm Farrar & Ball, is also involved in another defamation suit against Jones, representing a man whom Infowars incorrectly identified as the Parkland, Florida, school shooter.","Infowars, Jones and Shroyer did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","Heslin’s suit focuses on what it calls a “heartless and vile” claim of Shroyer’s: that the father lied in an interview with NBC News’ Megyn Kelly about holding his dead son’s body.","“I lost my son. I buried my son. I held my son with a bullet hole through his head,” Heslin told Kelly in the June 2017 segment profiling Jones.","Days after the segment aired, Shroyer told Infowars viewers that Heslin could not have held his son because victims were identified through photographs, not in person.","“That’s not something you would just misspeak on,” Shroyer said during the June 26, 2017, broadcast, which Jones himself plugged a month later.","But that claim is “manifestly false,” Heslin’s suit says: The children’s bodies were eventually turned over to their parents for their funerals.","In the other suit filed Tuesday, Pozner and De La Rosa ― whose son was the youngest victim in the shooting ― are also targeting Jones for calling them liars.","During an April 2017 broadcast on Infowars, Jones discussed an interview De La Rosa gave to CNN’s Anderson Cooper shortly after the tragedy, and claimed the entire thing was faked.","“So here are these holier than thou people, when we question CNN, who is supposedly at the site of Sandy Hook, and they got in one shot leaves blowing, and the flowers that are around it, and you see the leaves blowing, and they go [gestures]. They glitch,” Jones said, according to a transcript quoted in the lawsuit. “They’re recycling a green-screen behind them.”","This was a lie Jones has been repeating for years.","“Folks, we’ve got video of Anderson Cooper with clear blue-screen out there,” Jones said in 2014. “He’s not there in the town square. We got people clearly coming up and laughing and then doing the fake crying. We’ve clearly got people where it’s actors playing different parts for different people, the building bulldozed, covering up everything.”","It’s been five years since the shooting, the lawsuit says, and “Mr. Jones continues to push this sick lie about Mrs. De La Rosa and her interview.”","Infowars’ practice of disseminating outright lies has led to serious consequences for the families of the Sandy Hook victims, the lawsuit says. In June 2017, Florida woman Lucy Richards, then 57, was sentenced to five months in prison for sending threats to Pozner.","“You gonna die,” Richards told Pozner in one recorded voicemail message. “Death is coming to you real soon.”","As part of her sentence, Richards will no longer be allowed to access Infowars, according to the lawsuit.","As of Tuesday morning, Infowars still had blatantly false stories posted on its website claiming the mass shooting was a hoax. “FBI SAYS NO ONE KILLED AT SANDY HOOK,” screams one headline.","Bankston told HuffPost he has never before seen cases involving the kind of “mental anguish” these parents are experiencing.","“I think as a father, it’s a very surreal experience,” Bankston said. “Anyone, parents or not, who spends 15 minutes talking to one of these parents will understand immediately how vile this lie was, and how genuine their pain is.”","The defamation lawsuits could have devastating consequences for Jones and Infowars, especially because these are not the only ones against him. In March, the man who recorded the deadly car attack at last year’s white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, sued Jones for calling him a “deep state shill” and a “CIA asset” who helped organize the attack ― he’s not, and he didn’t.","And then there’s the lawsuit Bankston filed earlier this month. He’s suing on behalf of the 24-year-old man whom Infowars falsely identified as the gunman who killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in February.","For the Sandy Hook parents, they just want the lies to stop. Even when Jones made an assurance he’d stop talking about it, that too was a lie. During a November 2016 broadcast, Jones said that if “children were lost at Sandy Hook, my heart goes out to each and every one of those parents.”","But he didn’t stop there: “The only problem is, I’ve watched a lot of soap operas, and I’ve seen actors before. And I know when I’m watching a movie and when I’m watching something real.”","The broadcast was titled “Alex Jones Final Statement on Sandy Hook.”","Less than a year later, in April 2017, Jones aired another segment. It was titled “Sandy Hook Vampires Exposed.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5abe95d51f00002d0016bf7c.jpeg?cache=que1LPB0T8&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"IMPACT","headline":"Scientists Accidentally Create A Plastic-Eating Enzyme","authors":"Laura Paddison","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/enzyme-plastic-bottles-pollution_us_5ad5e364e4b0edca2cbde373","short_description":"The discovery may be a breakthrough in tackling the plastic pollution crisis.","date":"2018-04-17"},"articleContent":["A Japanese waste dump is an unlikely location for what may be a huge breakthrough in the plastics pollution crisis.","But back in 2016, a team of Japanese scientists sifting through plastic waste found bacteria capable of breaking down and “eating” one of the world’s most popular plastics ― polyethylene terephthalate, or PET. It was hailed as a potential breakthrough at the time. But in a new twist, British and American scientists have announced that while studying this bacteria, they accidentally created a mutant enzyme that’s even more efficient at breaking down plastic bottles.","The discovery came as a team of scientists from the University of Portsmouth in the U.K. and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in the U.S. examined an enzyme produced by the Japanese bacteria to find out more about its structure.

Manipulating the structure to better understand how it worked, they accidentally engineered the mutant enzyme.","“Serendipity often plays a significant role in fundamental scientific research and our discovery here is no exception,” said John McGeehan, a biology professor at the University of Portsmouth and one of the lead scientists on the research. “This unanticipated discovery suggests that there is room to further improve these enzymes, moving us closer to a recycling solution for the ever-growing mountain of discarded plastics.”","The researchers, who published their findings in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on Monday, are now working to further improve the enzyme so it can be used on an industrial scale.","“The engineering process is much the same as for enzymes currently being used in bio-washing detergents and in the manufacture of biofuels ― the technology exists,” said McGeehan. It’s possible that within the next few years there could be an industrially viable process for turning PET into other substances or back into its “original building blocks” so it can be sustainably recycled, he added.","The ability to scale up the process will be crucial. Plastic pollution is fast becoming one of the biggest environmental issues of our time. The mass-produced material is ubiquitous: More than 1 million plastic bottles are bought around the world every minute. That’s more than 16,000 every second. Most of these bottles are made from PET, which can take up to 400 years to biodegrade, and many are littering the oceans. Around 8 million tons of plastics enter the oceans each year.","PET is relatively easy to recycle, but over half of global PET waste is not collected for recycling, according to research from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, and only 7 percent of bottles are recycled into new bottles (most go into lower-value products).","Some companies that rely on PET have committed to do more. Coca-Cola, for example, which produces more than 100 billion plastic bottles a year, according to Greenpeace, has promised to increase the recycled content of its bottles 50 percent by 2020.","But progress is slow, partly because big businesses have aesthetic concerns about bottles made from 100-percent recycled plastic. The newly discovered enzyme promises to recycle plastic bottles back into new clear plastic bottles, which would require much less virgin plastic.","Some environmentalists and scientists say the breakthrough, though promising, is nowhere near enough to solve our pollution crisis.","“These enzymes are not abundantly present in nature, so you would need to produce the enzyme first, then add it to the PET plastic to degrade it,” Wim Soetaert, head of the Industrial Biotechnology Centre at the University of Ghent, pointed out. “This is likely to be a slow process. If you have gone through the trouble of collecting the PET waste, then there are clearly far better ways to recycle it or burn it for energy.” He suggested the use of commercially available biodegradable bioplastics would be a better bet.","Greenpeace’s senior oceans campaigner Louise Edge pointed to a desperate need to change recycling and consumption systems on a much wider scale.","“What we really need are system changes to reduce the volume of throwaway plastic packaging and make sure plastic drinks bottles are collected and separated effectively,” said Edge. “An enzyme alone can’t clean up the complex and widespread legacy of plastic pollution that we have already created.”","CORRECTION: A previous version of this story indicated 20,000 plastic bottles are bought worldwide every second. In fact, the number is more than 16,000.","For more content and to be part of the “This New World” community, join our Facebook Group.\nHuffPost’s “This New World” series is funded by Partners for a New Economy and the Kendeda Fund.

Authorities took the two-hour video of Malinowski, then 33, five months before her death last year, Fox 28 News reported.","“She was extremely frail and she was burned, but yet could very clearly articulate what happened, where she was, fear, everything that you would expect,” Malinowski’s mother, Bonnie Bowes, told WCMH of the video. “I’m so proud of her and I know one day I’ll see her, although my heart will be forever broken without her.”","The use of such evidence in court has been blocked for years by strict hearsay rules, which give criminal defendants the right to confront their accusers. However, in this case, the defense had the rare opportunity to cross-examine the witness during the video recording.","“She was critically ill and was the only witness who could testify about the events that transpired on the day of her injury,” Judge Reece said in court.","Slager’s defense attorney, Mark Collins, told People magazine that the judge’s ruling is unprecedented.","“She may be the only victim to testify in their own murder trial,” Collins said.","Authorities contend that Slager and Malinowski were arguing on Aug. 2, 2015, when he doused her with gasoline and set her on fire outside a gas station in Gahanna, a suburb of Columbus. Malinowski was rushed to Ohio State University’s Wexner Medical Center. Doctors reportedly said that 90 percent of her body was covered in third- and fourth-degree burns, according to The Columbus Dispatch.","Witnesses pointed the finger at Slager, who was arrested on multiple charges in connection with the incident.

He paints the social media behemoth he founded in 2004 as a tool “to bring the world closer together,” but in many ways, it has become an indispensable amplification device for people who want to make it known that they hate other people.","Testifying before Congress last Wednesday, Zuckerberg declared: “We do not allow hate groups on Facebook, overall.”","As with many things the Facebook CEO said during his trip to the Hill last week, it was difficult to square this statement with the actual experience of using Facebook. Angry observers were quick to point to anti-Muslim, anti-Semitic, anti-Rohingya, anti-LGBTQ and other hateful groups actively operating on the platform.","Zuckerberg’s claim hit a nerve for me as well. Two months ago, a private Facebook group devoted to alt-right Trump memes inaugurated a campaign of sexual harassment against me. When alerted to the situation, Facebook’s response was, essentially, ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯.","On Feb. 13, I awoke to find a stream of friend requests on Facebook and a startling message from a man I did not know: “There is some random weirdo posting pictures of you.” He sent me a screenshot of a photo posted in the private Facebook group “Emperor Trumps Dank Meme Stash,” which had more than 72,000 members at the time.","There I was: standing on the beach in Oahu, wearing shorts, a bikini top and a cardigan. I loved that photo ― it was a reminder of a day spent hiking and swimming with my family during our first vacation together in years. I posted it on Facebook last April.","I was stunned as I stared at it almost a year later, along with my full name, literally hundreds of comments and a caption that read: “This is going to be a hard one guys. Huffington Post reporter, smash or pass?”","Immediately, I requested permission to join the closed group and was directed to answer two questions for approval by its administrators: “Where do you fall on the cuck spectrum?” and “Are you a normie?”","I turned back to the man who had alerted me to the photo and asked him to send me screenshots of as many of the responses as possible, so I could email them to the appropriate representatives at Facebook. As is common in the publishing industry, HuffPost and Facebook work closely on products, partnerships and other shared objectives.","“It is a lot of comments,” he warned. “None of them are nice.”","It’s difficult to describe how it feels to discover hundreds of complete strangers debating how fuckable you are. Or to see them casually suggest they’d like to “smash,” “pump” and “skullfuck” you as an apparent form of punishment for your gender and job title.","Dozens of my friends and coworkers reported the group to Facebook. Several hours later, Facebook responded to them with a message saying it had discovered content that “doesn’t follow our Community Standards.” It added: “We removed that specific content … instead of the entire group.” But subsequent screenshots showed my photo was still there.","A staff manager at HuffPost also contacted Facebook directly to request that the post be taken down as quickly as possible. His message contained the screenshots of comments and stressed the matter’s urgency. Two days later, a representative followed up and asked him for the link to the post with the photo, which was inaccessible to anyone who did not belong to the private group (and which I had failed to obtain from the growing swarm of “trolls” in my inbox).","The Facebook representative said that without the link, not much could be done. So the harassment continued, and it worsened.","As my account was flooded with creepy messages and friend requests (now 890 and counting), one of my colleagues wrote a public Facebook post asking others to report the group, hoping that it might expedite the process of getting my picture removed. Soon enough, the trolls found her profile, too.","“We’ll just post your pic and do a smash or pass,” one man wrote on her status below two other nasty comments. Another appeared in her inbox: “SMASH.” It was clear that she was also being targeted in “Emperor Trumps Dank Meme Stash.” She deactivated her account.","My photo remained posted in the group for at least six days ― long enough for it to garner even more attention and be shared to at least three other pages. So after nearly a week of apparent inaction from Facebook, I got in touch with one of the group’s administrators, who can review reports about members’ posts, remove content and revoke membership as they please. He told me that the picture might have “flown under the radar.”","“Don’t blame me,” he said, after assuring me he had taken the photo down. “Blame Facebook for their stupid reporting system.” When I asked him to let me join the group, so I could see for myself that it was gone, he refused.","With a growing network of more than 2 billion users around the globe, Facebook’s role in shaping the way we communicate online cannot be easily overstated. It has public policies in place to penalize those who violate its Community Standards (including posts containing nudity, hate speech and violent or graphic content). These users may have their content removed or their accounts disabled, or may even be reported to law enforcement.","Moderating hate speech is an issue “that we struggle with continuously,” Zuckerberg said last week. “There’s a lot of content flowing through the systems and a lot of reports, and, unfortunately, we don’t always get these things right when people report it to us.”","He vowed that Facebook would have “more than 20,000 people working on security and content review across the company” by the end of the year, acknowledging that “no amount of people that we can hire will be enough to review all of the content.”","But instead of advocating for more moderators, pundits have long been calling for greater transparency surrounding the organization’s internal content review standards to ensure consistent enforcement and accountability ― a plea many say has fallen on deaf ears.","A Guardian investigation into leaked documents from Facebook, including private guidelines for content moderation, revealed last year that phrases like “To snap a bitch’s neck, make sure to apply all your pressure to the middle of her throat” are allowed, while others like “Someone shoot Trump” are not.","The report noted that moderators often have “just 10 seconds” to make a decision when evaluating material. It also said many have concerns about “the inconsistency and peculiar nature of some of the policies,” especially those regarding sexual content.","Experts have cautioned that inadequate moderation practices can have serious consequences, such as fostering a culture of online impunity ― leading sites like Facebook to become breeding grounds and safe havens for harassment.","Whereas trolls used to work under the cover of relative anonymity on sites like 4chan and Reddit, many of the Facebook users who commented on my photo and sent me grotesque messages, astonishingly, felt comfortable enough to do so using their real profiles ― with their real names, photos, locations and even places of employment listed.","Alejandra, who works at a debt-relief company in Fresno, California, commented: “Smash with a ballgag so she doesn’t speak.” Ironically, in a public bio statement sitting atop her Facebook profile, she has written: “I don’t care who you are if you are kind to me I will be kind to you, it’s that simple.”","Michael, a New York-based account manager who was previously a cadet first lieutenant at a military academy in Pennsylvania, wrote that he would “Smash, but I’ll unload on her face… for the patriarch.” On his professional website, he lists his favorite Bible verse as Psalm 133: “How good and pleasant it is when God’s people live together in unity!”","Far from promoting unity, Facebook is an ideal ecosystem for hate groups to flourish. During Zuckerberg’s appearances on the Hill last week, much was made of his site’s explosive growth and transformation, but from my vantage point, staring at screenshots from “Emperor Trump’s Dank Meme Stash,” Facebook looks remarkably unevolved. A platform that grew out of a “hot or not” women-ranking site is now a place for users to debate “smash or pass.”","Upon receiving a request for comment for this article on Friday ― two months after HuffPost initially alerted Facebook to the situation ― the organization said it would review “Emperor Trump’s Dank Meme Stash.” By day’s end, the group was taken down.","“As groups evolve, we can evaluate their activity over time,” a spokesperson said in a statement that evening. “We have removed this group for violating our policies.”","A “revival” page is up and running with nearly 7,000 members. “Free Speech does not exist here,” its description reads. “Blame Zuck.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5acfabdd1f00002d0016d02d.jpeg?cache=mPLtUkcU9m&ops=crop_0_28_4843_3189%2Cscalefit_1280_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"IMPACT","headline":"8 Stats That Prove Social Anxiety Needs To Be Taken Seriously","authors":"Lauren Rearick","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/social-anxiety-by-the-numbers_us_5acb5934e4b09d0a1195aa91","short_description":"The disorder is often misunderstood.","date":"2018-04-17"},"articleContent":["Social anxiety disorder is more than a fleeting feeling of shyness. It’s a mental illness that can disrupt the regular flow of life, making everyday tasks and responsibilities seem impossible.","“When someone has social anxiety, they can experience it so severely that it inhibits their pursuit of life goals, prevents them from forming relationships, pursuing career or school, being assertive, or being in public places,” explains Larry Cohen, chair of the National Social Anxiety Center.","People with social anxiety often suffer in silence, their behavioral and emotional symptoms not apparent to friends and family. As the number of young adults with social anxiety continues to increase, mental health experts are trying to help dispel the notion that social anxiety is as simple to overcome as shyness.","Here are some numbers to help you understand the full scope of social anxiety disorder ― the number of American adults diagnosed, the number of symptoms and more.","15 million","The Anxiety and Depression Association of America estimates that nearly 15 million American adults have social anxiety. Social anxiety dIsorder is the second most commonly diagnosed form of anxiety in the United States.","13 years old","Social anxiety disorder can develop at any age, but symptoms of the mental illness usually begin in adolescence around the age of 13. Cohen notes that this period of life, particularly around the time teenagers and young adults prepare for high school or college, is a vulnerable time of transition.","10 years","The Anxiety and Depression Association of America estimates that more than one-third of those with social anxiety waited 10 years or more to speak with a doctor about their symptoms. “Socially anxious people know themselves that they need help, but they may not know help is available,” Cohen said.","Many times, social anxiety sufferers believe their mental illness is a personality trait, which causes them to confuse social anxiety with being shy or introverted. “They might be aware of having these experiences and being naturally introverted, but they may not realize they can get help,” he said.","9 physical symptoms","According to the Mayo Clinic, there are nine physical symptoms of social anxiety. Although symptoms can vary from person to person, the Mayo Clinic attributes symptoms of “blushing, fast heartbeat, trembling, sweating, upset stomach or nausea, trouble catching your breath, dizziness and lightheadedness, a feeling that your mind has gone blank, and muscle tension” to social anxiety disorder.","11 other symptoms","In addition to the physical symptoms of social anxiety, the Mayo Clinic reports that there are 11 emotional and behavioral symptoms that can possibly accompany the disorder. Many of the symptoms hinge on the fear of being judged by others, Cohen said. The emotional effects can vary in intensity, but are generally persistent feelings of fearing that one might be judged, an avoidance of activities or social situations for fear of embarrassment, and thinking that you’ll fail in social situations. Other symptoms include feelings of anxiety before attending an event, anxiety that lingers when you’re out in public, and a fear that others may notice you blushing, sweating, or acting nervous.","66 percent","It’s estimated that roughly 66 percent of people who are diagnosed with social anxiety disorder will have some other form of a mental health problem, Cohen said. Depression is the most common mental illness to accompany social anxiety, along with other anxiety disorders and possible substance abuse.","5 months","A diagnosis of social anxiety disorder doesn’t mean you’ll continue to contend with the mental illness for the rest of your life. Cohen estimates that with the proper treatment and in following a therapist or doctor’s orders, you can typically begin to see improvement in your symptoms in as little as five months.","3 resources","For those seeking professional treatment or more information on social anxiety, there are three organizations in the United States that Cohen recommends. The Academy of Cognitive Therapy is a good place to start for those searching for a therapist, the Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapy contains further information on therapists and the various symptoms of possible mental illness, and the Anxiety and Depression Association of America provides facts on mental illness, ways to manage symptoms and more."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ad4fc352000002d00eb4d22.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Shang Might Not Be In Disney's Live-Action 'Mulan,' And People Aren't Taking It Well","authors":"Kimberly Yam","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/shang-disney-live-action-mulan_us_5ad61b50e4b0edca2cbe516e","short_description":"Fans are not pleased ― particularly because Shang had been hailed as a meaningful bisexual icon.","date":"2018-04-17"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Steve Harvey: Kim Kardashian 'Didn't Know Nothing' On 'Family Feud'","authors":"Ron Dicker","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/steve-harvey-kim-kardashian-family-feud-ellen_us_5ad60eeae4b016a07ea0e28f","short_description":"You don't need a survey to say that the upcoming episode will be widely watched.","date":"2018-04-17"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"MEDIA","headline":"New York Daily News Scorches Sean Hannity With New Cover","authors":"Lee Moran","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-york-daily-news-sean-hannity-front-cover_us_5ad5aaa5e4b077c89cec4032","short_description":"The tabloid did not hold back.","date":"2018-04-17"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Adam Pally Escorted Offstage For Trashing Terrible Award Show While He Presented","authors":"Elyse Wanshel","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/adam-pally-shorty-awards_us_5ad62c9de4b077c89ced441f","short_description":"The “Most Likely to Murder” star became the “villain of the Shorty Awards.”","date":"2018-04-17"},"articleContent":["Well, this didn’t have a happy ending.","Actor Adam Pally, of “Happy Endings” and “The Mindy Project” fame, got kicked offstage Sunday while presenting at the Shorty Awards, a ceremony that celebrates social media producers, influencers and content.","The “Most Likely to Murder” star found the concept of the award show so dumb, he couldn’t help but rip it apart for a solid (and, OK, pretty funny) 10 minutes.","“Thank you very much for having me tonight at the Shorty Awards, the ‘waiting at the DMV’ of award shows,” Pally said as soon as he walked onstage (check it out at the 2:36:20 mark in the tweet below or here).","“I do have a few questions about what is happening tonight,” he continued. “I guess I’ll start with, ‘What is going on?’”","Pally then spent a few minutes alternating between dead-eyed recitation of apparently prepared copy, and incredulous reactions to what he’d just said.","“This award honors those brands that have the best yearlong presence on Instagram,” he said. “So I’ll be giving an award to a brand.

Certainly not Washington’s present cast of characters, a crew in flight from history, the past, or knowledge of more or less any sort. Still, just for the hell of it, let’s take a few moments to think about what some of the lessons of the last years of the previous century and the first years of this one might be for the world’s most exceptional and indispensable nation, the planet’s sole superpower, the globe’s only sheriff. Those were, of course, commonplace descriptions from the pre-Trump era and yet, in the age of MAGA, already as moldy and cold as the dust in some pharaonic tomb.","Let’s start this way: you could think of the post-Cold War era, the years after the implosion of the Soviet Union in 1991, as the moment of America’s first opioid crisis. The country’s politicians and would-be politicians were, then, taking street drugs (K-Street and military-industrial-complex ones, to be exact) and having remarkable visions of a planet available for the taking, as well as the keeping, forever and ever, amen.","On a globe without another superpower ― pre-Putin Russia was a shattered, impoverished shell of the former Soviet Union, while China was still entering the capitalist world, Communist party in tow ― history’s ultimate opportunity had obviously presented itself. And about to ascend to the holodeck of the USS America (beam me up, Dick Cheney!) were history’s ultimate opportunists, the men (and woman) who would, in January 2001, occupy the top posts in the administration of President George W. Bush. That, of course, included Cheney who, after overseeing a wide-ranging search for the best candidate for vice president, had appointed himself to the job. As a group, they couldn’t have been more ready for America’s ultimate moment in the sun. They had been preparing for it for years and largely came out of the first think tank ― the Project for the New American Century ― ever to enter the Oval Office. They had long been in favor of ensuring this country’s “unchallenged supremacy” by building its already staggering military into a force beyond compare. In doing so, they had no doubt that they would achieve the previously inconceivable: an “American geopolitical preeminence,” as they politely put it, that would be like no other great power’s ever.","A Power “Beyond Challenge”","As it happened, their moment came with blinding, thoroughly unexpected speed on September 11, 2001. Their response would be captured perfectly only five hours after the attacks of that day. From the partially devastated Pentagon, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, already certain that al-Qaeda was behind the strikes, ordered his aides (as one of them scribbled down) to “go massive. Sweep it all up. Things related and not.” And so they did. What followed would be not just the invasion and occupation of Afghanistan, but of Saddam Hussein’s Iraq, a country completely unconnected to the attacks of 9/11. And not just Iraq either, not in their fevered imaginations anyway (as once again today in the fever dreams of newly appointed National Security Advisor John Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo), but Iran, too. Not far behind in the sweep-it-up category would come, they were convinced, the rest of the Greater Middle East (still being called in those days “the arc of instability” ― little did they know!). In the end, they had no doubt that the rest of the planet would fall in line, too (or pay the price). It was to be a Pax Americana planet for the ages.","In the carnage that followed, it was easy to forget just how expansive those fever dreams were. But give them credit: whatever else they did (or didn’t do), geopolitically speaking, George W. Bush’s crew thought big. Just consider their seminal document of the post-9/11 moment, the 2002 National Security Strategy. Their goal, it stated, was to ensure that the U.S. would “build and maintain” the country’s “defenses” (that is, military power) “beyond challenge.” And keep in mind that they were already talking about a country in, as that document put it, “a position of unparalleled military strength.”","Let that roll around in your head for a second so many years later: on this planet a single, unparalleled military power “beyond challenge.” That was a dream of dominion that once would have been left to “Evil Empires” or madmen (or the truly, truly bad guys in Hollywood movies). But in the world as they imagined it then, the one in which only that “sole” superpower stood tall, how easy it proved to imagine a Great Game with just a single player and an eternal arms race of one.","The top officials of the Bush administration were, as I wrote back then, pure fundamentalists when it came to U.S. military power. As President Bush later put it, they considered that military “the greatest force for human liberation the world has ever known.” Under such circumstances, why would anyone be shy about loosing it to “liberate” the rest of the planet? In that 2002 document, the Bush administration essentially called for a world in which no other great power or bloc of powers would ever again be allowed to challenge this country’s supremacy. As the president put it in an address at West Point that same year, “America has, and intends to keep, military strengths beyond challenge, thereby making the destabilizing arms races of other eras pointless, and limiting rivalries to trade and other pursuits of peace.”","The National Security Strategy put the same thought this way: “Our forces will be strong enough to dissuade potential adversaries from pursuing a military build-up in hopes of surpassing, or equaling, the power of the United States.” And the president and his men promptly began to hike the Pentagon budget to fit their oversized fantasies of what an American planetary “footprint” should look like (a process that, despite everything that followed, has never ended).","The Lessons of American War","So much of this has, of course, already been buried in the sands of history, but that’s no reason for it to be forgotten. Almost 17 years after 9/11, the parts of the planet that “the greatest force, etc., etc.” was loosed upon remain in remarkable upheaval and disarray, while failed states and terror groups multiply, producing more displaced people and refugees than at any time since the end of World War II. Another great power, China, is rising, and an economically less than great Russia continues to hang in there militarily and strategically by force of Putinian chutzpah. Not surprisingly, American decline has become a topic of the moment.","What conclusions, then, might be drawn from the era of folly that led us to this Trumpian moment? Here are my suggestions for five possible lessons from the American experience of war in the twenty-first century:","Lesson 1: It should have been too obvious to say, but wasn’t: Earth can’t be conquered by a single power, no matter how strong. Try to do so and you’ll end up taking yourself down in some fashion.","Shakespeare would have been fascinated by the hubris of America’s leaders in these years (and that was before Mr. Hubris Himself even hit the White House). It couldn’t be clearer today that the military-first grab for an all-American planet proved strikingly too much for the U.S. to swallow by an Iraqi mile. It never even came close to happening. When the history of American decline is written, perhaps it will be said that never was there a great power whose leaders so effectively took it down themselves simply by wanting too much too badly and by woefully misunderstanding the nature of power on this planet. For Washington, the urge to make Earth into its imperium proved the equivalent of a submarine putting a torpedo into its own bow.","Lesson 2: In the twenty-first century, military power, even that of the “finest fighting force in the history of the world” (another presidential descriptor of these years), isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. It doesn’t matter how many hundreds of billions of dollars you put into building up and maintaining that military yearly or how many trillions of dollars you sink into its wars and the mayhem they produce.","In 2018, the greatest military on Earth turned out to be incapable of ultimately defeating forces that were producing roadside bombs for the cost of a pizza. If you want to measure the effectiveness of the U.S. military, note, for instance, that more than a decade and a half after its “Global War on Terror” was launched there are al-Qaeda affiliates in far more places than on September 12, 2001; the original al-Qaeda still exists; other al-Qaeda crews are fighting with reasonable success from Yemen to Syria to North Africa; ISIS, while destroyed as a state or “caliphate,” continues as a guerrilla movement in parts of Syria and Iraq and its branded affiliates have spread across that former “arc of instability” from Niger and Libya to Afghanistan and the Philippines. Washington’s war on terror, in other words, turned into a war for the spread of terror.","Lesson 3: Military power is now a force for chaos. Historically, in the imperial ages that preceded this one, such power, while applied brutally and devastatingly, could also be a way of imposing order on conquered and colonized areas. (Hence, say, the British Raj in India or the French military hold on Indochina.) No longer, it seems, not in the wake of the twentieth century wars of liberation and independence in the formerly colonized world. We’re now on a planet that simply doesn’t accept military-first conquest and occupation, no matter under what guise it arrives (including the spread of “democracy”). So beware of unleashing modern military power. It turns out to contain within it striking disintegrative forces on a planet that can ill afford such chaos.","Lesson 4: At least at the imperial level, victory turns out to be a concept from another century. In its wars of recent years, the American military has moved from dreams of victory to an acceptance that its conflicts might be “generational” in nature to, most recently, the idea of “infinite war” (that is, war without hope of end or ultimate success). In this way, its top commanders have admitted that, by their own definition, they now live in a victory-less world.","Lesson 5: Imperial wars do come home, even if in ways often hard to spot or grasp. Indeed, America’s wars of the twenty-first century have been returning to the homeland not as victory but as a kind of defeat, however hard that may be to see.","Donald Trump is proof of that. His slogan “Make America Great Again” ― implying, as no other politician of his moment dared do, that the country was no longer great ― rang a bell in the heartland and helped win him the 2016 election. His America First campaign similarly embodied a declinist sensibility, even if not recognized as such.","In promoting a presidency that would (again) put American first, Trump reflected what, for so many Americans, was a distinctly twenty-first-century message. Despite those soaring Washington dreams of an all-American planet, this century has proved anything but an America First one in the white American heartland. While citizen tax dollars poured down the drain of those distant wars (and the scams linked to them), the country’s unparalleled global corporate power helped generate profits and wealth beyond compare ― but mainly for a single gilded class of one percenters. And so the numbers of multimillionaires and billionaires multiplied impressively, creating an ever-widening inequality gap. In those same years, with a helping hand from the Supreme Court, the American political system was turned over, lock, stock, and barrel, to those very billionaires and multimillionaires and their super PACs. Meanwhile, actual investment in this country’s basic infrastructure, in everything that had once made it the most advanced of first world countries, went off a cliff.","All of this was felt particularly deeply by the inhabitants of the country’s white heartland, as the future seemed to close in on so many of them. In their own fashion, they had absorbed some intuitive version of the above “lessons” of recent history, as had Donald Trump. As a result, in election 2016, along with all his tweets, insults, and nicknames, which became the heart and soul of media coverage, he did something far more crucial. He reassured Americans who felt that their lives and those of their children (going into debt for their very educations in ways that once would have been unimaginable) were turning third world on them. This they blamed on both the “swamp” of Washington and people of color of every sort. In his own distinctive way, Trump reassured them that life in America didn’t have to be like this, repeatedly sending them messages of firstness and greatness, as well as anti-immigrant-ness, with convincing fire and fury.","Of course, upon entering the Oval Office, our first billionaire president promptly chose a cabinet of billionaires and multimillionaires, while the great achievement of his initial year as president would be to free both corporate America and that same gilded class of yet more financial responsibility for the nation, thanks to his tax “reform” bill. Meanwhile, he oversaw the expansion of America’s wars in distant lands.","None of this should have been slightly surprising. After all, whatever reassurance he may have offered, his campaign was always a The Donald First one. And whatever they thought they were doing, his voters were electing a man whose deepest expertise lay in how to emerge from bankruptcy proceedings smelling like a rose. Now, he seems intent on applying those special skills to peace, war, and the economy.","That means, in another year or two, you can count on lessons of American war six through 10 from me. In the meantime, hold on to your hats.","Tom Engelhardt is a co-founder of the American Empire Project and the author of The United States of Fear as well as a history of the Cold War, The End of Victory Culture.

She has written articles for Live Action News, the organization behind the heavily edited “sting” videos that inspired Republicans in Congress to investigate Planned Parenthood, and gained media attention in early 2017 when New Wave Feminists was ousted from a partnership with the Women’s March.","Hatten wrote in late 2016 that she found Trump to be so “creepy, gross and tacky” and such a “repugnant chauvinist” during his campaign that she quit the internet for a while to avoid reading about him. But after he won, something changed. Hatten began sharing white supremacist content on social media. She self-identified on Twitter as alt-right and “ethnonationalist” ― the same term used by white nationalist icon Richard Spencer. She mused on Facebook that immigrant “invaders” are replacing white Europeans in their own countries, and shared a post imploring Trump to grant “asylum” to white South Africans.","“She basically pulled a complete 180 from anything we had ever seen,” said Destiny Herndon-De La Rosa, founder and president of New Wave Feminists and a former close friend of Hatten.","Hatten told HuffPost in an email that she doesn’t consider herself to be a white supremacist or even a racist.","“I admit to being racist by today’s standards, but I also think almost everyone is racist by today’s standards,” she wrote. “Is it racist to live in a majority white neighborhood? Send your kids to majority white schools? When I was a kid ‘racism’ meant hatred for another race and/or acting on that hatred. Now you’re a racist if you touch a black person’s hair because you think it’s pretty.”","Hatten added that while she is proud to be white, she does not identify as a white nationalist or a white supremacist because she believes all races have a right to their own homelands.","“I do see that Europe and the US are becoming... well, not European,” she wrote. “This concerns me not because I hate anyone, but for the same reason Japan would be concerned if the Japanese were becoming a minority in Japan. No people should be excited to become a minority in their homeland. It is contrary to human nature. I wouldn’t expect it of any race and I don’t think it should be expected of whites.”","Hatten’s views present a problem for the anti-abortion movement as it continues to jockey for mainstream acceptance and tries to distance itself from right-wing extremists. Throughout the history of the abortion wars, a great deal of violent energy has been generated at the confluence of anti-abortion activism and white supremacy. The first known murder of an abortion provider was committed by a former Klansman. The kinship isn’t hard to understand: Both are movements of the status quo, dedicated to preserving a white patriarchal order.","Today, white supremacists emboldened by Trump’s election are a lot more explicit about their political fellow-traveling. Neo-Nazis have been showing up at March for Life rallies around the country. A Rewire analysis found that the Family Research Council, a powerful evangelical anti-abortion group, is also deeply influential among white supremacists on social media.","And the movements share heroes: Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), one of the most vocal opponents of abortion rights in Congress, infamously said that children of undocumented immigrants have “calves the size of cantaloupes because they’re hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert.” The conservative congressman, who has narrated a sonogram at a House hearing and compared abortion to “black genocide,” became a white supremacist icon after Richard Spencer compared one of his tweets ― “We can’t restore our civilization with somebody else’s babies” ― to neo-Nazi David Lane’s infamous “14 words” (“We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children”).","Lila Rose, the president of Live Action, echoed King’s rhetoric in an email about Hatten last week. She said Hatten no longer contributes to the group’s news site and “did not voice those views when she wrote for us,” but argued that abortion rights advocates are in fact the real racists.","“Institutionalized racism has also contributed to the deaths of millions of minority children in the womb,” she wrote.","Herndon-De La Rosa said she quietly kicked Hatten out of New Wave Feminists shortly after Trump became president and scrubbed every mention of her from the website when Hatten started to become a mouthpiece for the so-called alt-right. “As far as making a statement, I didn’t want to give this toxic garbage any more of a platform or attention,” she told HuffPost.","The Dallas Morning News also told HuffPost it will no longer publish anything by Hatten in light of her views.","Herndon-De La Rosa said Hatten’s journey to the far right appears to have been directly influenced by Trump’s election.","“Within a month, [Hatten’s] views got more extreme,” she said. “She was my best friend for seven years and I never heard anything like this coming out of her mouth. Everybody around her started doing damage control.”","Tensions between Hatten and Herndon-De La Rosa grew more pronounced earlier this month, when the latter wrote a Facebook post drawing attention to some of the things Hatten has shared on social media. Hatten responded with a long post defending herself and her ethnonationalist beliefs, but Facebook removed the post because it violated the site’s terms.","Abby Johnson, the famous anti-abortion activist who resigned from her job as a Planned Parenthood clinic director after seeing an abortion, defended Hatten in a Facebook comment.","After I reached out to Hatten last week, she deleted her Facebook and Twitter accounts. She said she is having a high-risk pregnancy and that the negative attention to her views would cause her more stress. On Saturday, someone identifying himself as the moderator of an “alt-alt-right” Facebook group, Space Right // Meta Future, texted me to say that Hatten had used an alias account to post my phone number on the group’s page and complain that I was “doxxing” her.","That post seems to have been deleted.","“I’ve said I identify with the alt-right to a large extent, and I do,” Hatten wrote in her email to me. “That said, there are elements within the alt-right with whom I don’t see eye to eye. I am not a national socialist nor am I a ‘Nazi.’ I am not a eugenicist. In fact I remain prolife.”","Meanwhile, Hatten’s husband, a reviewer at Guns.com who is currently deployed overseas with the U.S. military, issued a warning on Facebook “to any of you motherfuckers out in first world Facebook land” who might speak ill of his wife.","“I might be in Africa now,” he wrote, “but I’ll come home soon enough and pull your fucking heart out of your broken rib cage and eat it.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ad611a51e00003b137b1c23.png?ops=crop_5_5_635_478%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Country Music Stars Return To Las Vegas For First Time Since Mass Shooting","authors":"","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/academy-of-country-music-awards-2018_us_5ad4599ee4b016a07e9dff56","short_description":"Jason Aldean, who won entertainer of the year, was performing on Oct. 1 when a gunman opened fire on a country music festival, killing 58 and wounding more than 850.","date":"2018-04-16"},"articleContent":["(Reuters) - Singer Carrie Underwood returned to the stage on Sunday after a serious face injury as country stars went back to Las Vegas for the first time since a mass shooting there last October.","Opening the three-hour Academy of Country Music (ACM) awards show at a hotel less than a mile from the scene of the Oct. 1 shooting that killed 58 people and wounded more than 850, singer Jason Aldean paid tribute to the victims and invoked the healing power of music.","“We wanted to open the show with something that sums up what it’s like for our country music family to be back in Las Vegas for the first time since October 1,” said Aldean, who was performing on stage when a gunman opened fire on the Route 91 Harvest country festival from the window of a hotel on the Vegas strip.","“We thought about starting with a song, but it’s a lot bigger than a single song.

State officials have to review the signatures and are expected to decide next month whether enough are valid to put the initiative on the ballot.","Utah is one of three states where voters may get an opportunity to go around their governors and legislators to expand Medicaid.","There are similar campaigns underway in Idaho and Nebraska. Mainers voted for the Medicaid expansion last year, making it the first state to enact the policy through direct voter action. Maine Gov. Paul LePage (R), however, has thus far refused to implement the Medicaid expansion.","The Affordable Care Act’s authors intended a nationwide expansion of Medicaid eligibility to anyone earning up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, which is about $16,000 a year for a single person and $33,000 for a family of four. In 2012, however, the Supreme Court ruled that states could opt out of the expansion.","Utah, Idaho and Nebraska are among the 18 states that have refused to participate. The federal government covers at least 90 percent of the cost of the expansion, with states responsible for the remainder.","Medicaid expansion has been a subject of debate in Utah since the Supreme Court ruling. At times, Gov. Gary Herbert (R) has expressed support for some form of expansion, but it hasn’t gained enough support in the majority-Republican legislature to move forward.","The Utah Senate approved a privatized version of the expansion two years ago, but the state House didn’t act on it. Last year, the state implemented a small Medicaid expansion targeting about 6,000 homeless people and low-income people with substance-use and mental health problems.","In March, Herbert signed a bill that would expand Medicaid eligibility to up to 100 percent of the poverty level, which is about $12,000 for a single person and $25,000 for a family of four. The move would extend coverage to an estimated 72,000 people.","That partial expansion, however, depends on federal approval, which isn’t assured.","The Affordable Care Act is explicit that the extra federal money available to states for broadening Medicaid eligibility only applies to expansions to 133 percent of poverty. President Barack Obama’s administration wouldn’t permit these partial expansions, and President Donald Trump’s administration would be on shaky legal ground if they approved Utah’s request. The Trump administration last month declined to approve Arkansas’ request to scale back its Medicaid expansion to 100 percent of poverty.","Medicaid expansion enjoys the support of a majority of Utahns, according to a poll conducted in January by The Salt Lake Tribune and the University of Utah’s Hinckley Institute of Politics.","The survey found that 62 percent of the state’s residents want to see Medicaid expanded. That includes 51 percent of Republicans who were polled, along with 93 percent of Democrats, the Tribune reported in February.","Utah Decides Healthcare had to collect 113,143 signatures by Sunday to put expansion on the ballot, a figure that represents 10 percent of the number of Utahns who voted in the 2016 presidential election. In addition, the signatures had to come from across the state, with at least 10 percent of 2016 presidential voters in 26 of 29 state Senate districts.","In the end, the coalition met the geographic requirements and exceeded the overall threshold by gathering signatures from more than 165,000 people, Utah Decides Healthcare announced.","Activists in Idaho and Nebraska are hoping to duplicate these results.","Reclaim Idaho, a grassroots outfit founded last year, has until May 1 to collect 56,000 signatures. As in Utah, they must come from all over the state. The total must be at least equal to 6 percent of the state’s registered voters, and they must meet the same threshold in 18 of Idaho’s 35 state legislative districts.","In Nebraska, a coalition called Insure the Good Life ― made up of progressive groups and health care advocates, including the Nebraska Hospital Association ― is leading the campaign.","To put Medicaid expansion on the ballot, activists in Nebraska must gather 85,000 signatures, representing 7 percent of the state’s registered voters, by July 5. Nebraska also requires that the signatures be from around the whole state, so the activists must get signatures from 5 percent of registered voters in 38 of the state’s 93 counties.","CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article misstated the number of counties in Nebraska.

During this episode, he rigged the Saviors’ bullets to explode in their guns when they tried to shoot Rick (Andrew Lincoln). It was a turning point in the war, leading to the Saviors’ surrender and Eugene’s redemption.","But, uh, what?","Just a week ago in the episode “Worth,” Eugene, who has been aiding the Saviors since Season 7, was briefly kidnapped by Daryl (Norman Reedus) and Rosita (Christian Serratos). He threw up on Rosita in order to escape and get back to the Saviors. If he was planning on switching sides again, why spit up lunch? Why not just tell Daryl and Rosita, “I’m rigging all the bullets, so it’s cool.” Hmmm.","Back to the finale: After Eugene’s show of loyalty, Rick slashes Negan’s throat. But then he makes a speech to his followers and the Saviors, stating that he’s in favor of saving Negan and living together as one. A similar scene happens in the comic books, but if this is the plan, Rick, you might want to shorten your speech, because Negan is still lying on the ground bleeding out.","To top it all off, in the most inexplicable twist Maggie (Lauren Cohan), Daryl and Jesus (Tom Payne) are plotting against Rick now. Yeah. They apparently aren’t happy that Rick left Negan alive, so we get a brief scene of them scheming against their former leader.","Sure, earlier in the show there’s a scene with Jesus preaching to Morgan (Lennie James) about keeping people alive, but whatever. It’s all just a continuation of the other wild and wacky stuff that’s happened this season. Let’s look back and reminisce ...","Carl died by tripping and falling.","What was even going on this year? After surviving into Season 8 of the apocalypse and getting shot (twice), Carl (Chandler Riggs) died after tripping and subsequently receiving a bite from a zombie.","The Season 8 finale began with Siddiq (Avi Nash) trying to explain to Rick how Carl died, and it still doesn’t make a ton of sense. Why would Carl be so careless?","(Riggs has poked fun at his character’s carelessness on Twitter, too.)","Oh, and after he receives the bite, Carl shoots the zombie that bit him. I repeat: he shoots the zombie. Rick after learning Carl had a gun the whole time:","Same, dude. Same.","New rule: Zombie blood now turns you into a zombie.","If you haven’t been keeping up, here’s a crucial Season 8 revelation for you: Zombie blood can turn people into zombies. That’s a thing now.","Though this occurs in the comics, the TV show hadn’t established that being exposed to zombie blood in a wound could turn you. In Season 6, we see Rick cut his hand on a blade that’s gone through a zombie ― and he’s totally fine.","This year, that all changed. A bunch of people at the Hilltop were hit with weapons covered in zombie blood and eventually turned into zombies. In the apocalypse, the first thing to die off is continuity.","Wait, another new rule: Everyone turns into a zombie except for Negan.","OK, so you got all that about zombie blood? Good. Now forget that hogwash.","In Season 8, Negan gets in a car crash while riding with a bucket of zombie blood. The blood goes everywhere. He’s totally fine. Then he gets hit in the arm with his barbed-wire covered baseball bat after it’s been smothered in zombie blood. He’s cool after that, too.","Who knows why. Just don’t think about it too much.","Finally, introducing butthole vision.","In the “Walking Dead,” Negan talks a lot about people being assholes, so this just seems like a natural progression.","When Father Gabriel (Seth Gilliam) becomes sick after putting zombie blood and guts on himself early on in Season 8 (see above for new rule on zombie blood), a dose of antibiotics saves him. But he suffers some vision problems thereafter. This gave the show the opportunity to add a funky new POV camera, which the internet has lovingly deemed “butthole cam.”","The camera view, which is probably not unlike seeing out of one’s bottom, also makes a brief appearance in Sunday’s finale when Gabriel is trying to escape from Negan in the woods. With so many absurd plot points in Season 8, you can’t blame the internet for being cheeky."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ad3eb2f1f00002d0016d2ea.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"The 1 Good Movie Netflix Adds This Week","authors":"Todd Van Luling","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/good-movies-netflix_us_5ad4a756e4b077c89ceaeffa","short_description":"The film explores the challenges of trying to heal fractured family relationships.","date":"2018-04-16"},"articleContent":["Netflix is adding quite a few quality movies over the next few days.","The recently Oscar-nominated “The Incredibles 2” hits the service Wednesday (you can read more about that below). “Ant-Man and the Wasp,” another recent Disney blockbuster, joins the day before.","Then on Friday, Netflix gets 18 new movies, including “Jaws,” “Personal Shopper,” “Pretty in Pink” and “The Edge of Seventeen.” The three main “American Pie” movies also become available to stream, so there’s that.","Netflix has one major Original movie coming out this week: “Velvet Buzzsaw.” This satire stars Jake Gyllenhaal, John Malkovich and Toni Collette as figures in the Los Angeles art world.

It was previously reported that the first two clients were the president and GOP fundraiser Elliott Broidy.","Broidy had an affair with a former Playboy model. She became pregnant during their relationship, and Cohen helped arrange payments to her to keep her quiet.","On Monday, Cohen’s lawyer revealed that Hannity was Cohen’s third, secret client, although it’s unclear what the nature of the work was.","Cohen is under federal criminal investigation for possible bank fraud, wire fraud and campaign finance violations in connection with his business dealings. The U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan is handling the case. Mueller, who is investigating Russia’s involvement in the 2016 election, referred the matter to the U.S. attorney’s office but has not been involved since.","Hannity said on his radio show Monday that he has known Cohen “a long, long time” and tried to play down his involvement in his life.","“Let me be very clear to the media: Michael never represented me in any matter. I never retained him in the traditional sense. ... I never received an invoice from Michael. I never paid legal fees to Michael,” Hannity said. “But I have occasionally had brief discussions with him about legal questions. I wanted his input and perspective. I assumed those conversations were attorney-client confidential.”","“Not one of any issues I ever dealt with Michael Cohen on ever, ever involved a matter between me and a third party,” he added.","He also tweeted that his discussions with Cohen were primarily about real estate.","Hannity appears to be specifically trying to put to rest any speculation that he was in a situation similar to Broidy. Federal investigators are also reportedly interested in records Cohen has regarding a payment he made to porn star Stormy Daniels, who claims to have had an affair with Trump and received money from Cohen to stay silent in the run-up to the election.","On Monday, Fox News hosts found themselves in the strange position of reporting breaking news on their own colleague.","Hannity never addressed his conflict of interest in his initial coverage of the Cohen raid. On his radio show on April 9, Hannity said the incident showed “that there’s no limit at all into the fishing expedition that Mueller is now engaged in and if he has access to everything that his personal attorney has.”","Jen Bendery contributed reporting."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ad504fa1f00002d0016d475.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"BLACK VOICES","headline":"Protests Erupt At Philly Starbucks Where 2 Black Men Were Arrested For 'Trespassing'","authors":"Hayley Miller","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/protest-starbucks-men-arrested_us_5ad4a67de4b0edca2cbc1c3f","short_description":"\"Starbucks coffee is anti-black,\" the demonstrators chanted Monday morning.","date":"2018-04-16"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"SPORTS","headline":"Desiree Linden Becomes First American Woman To Win Boston Marathon In 33 Years","authors":"","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/desiree-linden-becomes-first-american-woman-to-win-boston-marathon-in-33-years_us_5ad4d920e4b077c89ceb7a5b","short_description":"The last time an American woman won was in 1985.","date":"2018-04-16"},"articleContent":["Two-time Olympian Desiree Linden became the first American woman to win the Boston Marathon in 33 years on Monday when she broke the tape at the finish line with a time of 2 hours, 39 minutes, 54 seconds.","Linden, 34, won with a time more than 14 minutes slower than her previous two races, but course conditions were not conducive to personal- or course-record performances.","Fellow American Sarah Sellers was second, 4:10 behind Linden.","“I don’t have the right words.

The GAO declined to rule on the phone booth’s necessity, but said its construction qualified as a furnishing under federal statute, meaning the “EPA was required to notify the appropriations committees of its proposed obligation.”","The agency also found that the EPA violated the Antideficiency Act by spending more than the amount Congress approved.","“Because EPA did not comply with the notification requirement, the funds were not legally available at the time EPA incurred the obligation,” the report concludes.","“EPA is addressing GAO’s concern, with regard to Congressional notification about this expense, and will be sending Congress the necessary information this week,” Liz Bowman, an EPA spokeswoman, said in a statement to HuffPost.","The congressional notification requirement does not carry a penalty for the agency. The EPA could, however, face administrative penalties under the Antideficiency Act. The law allows for criminal prosecution if an agency staffer knowingly violated the statute, but that seems highly unlikely. The Department of Justice has not brought charges against under the Antideficiency Act in modern history.","“The Anti-Deficiency Act is a criminal statute, but as a practical matter, it has never been used to prosecute anyone in a situation like this,” Clark Pettig, a spokesman for the watchdog group American Oversight, told HuffPost by email.","The report comes amid slowly intensifying Republican criticism of the EPA over its growing list of spending scandals. In a statement, Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), the chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, called on the EPA to “give a full public accounting of this expenditure and explain why the agency thinks it was complying with the law.”","Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), who is overseeing an investigation into Pruitt as chairman of the House Oversight Committee, skewered the administrator on Sunday over his claim that he booked first-class flights to avoid verbal attacks from fellow passengers in the coach section.","“The notion that I’ve got to fly first class because I don’t want people to be mean to me ― you need to go into another line of work if you don’t want people to be mean to you,” Gowdy said on Fox News. “Like maybe a monk.”","The phone booth first attracted criticism from Democrats and spending watchdogs after The Washington Post reported on its construction last September. In December, Pruitt told lawmakers he needed the booth.","“It’s necessary for me to be able to do my job,” he said.","In the footnotes of the GAO report, the agency said the EPA installed two soundproof phone booths, called “Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities.”","“These are operated by EPA sub-organizations and are located three floors away from the Administrator’s office,” the report states.","The findings came in response to a request from top Democrats, who are calling for Pruitt to resign over rampant spending and ethical lapses. The report arrived just three days after Democrats leading a congressional investigation into Pruitt released letters detailing accusations of “unethical and potentially illegal” moves. The explosive new allegations came from an interview with Kevin Chmielewski, a lifelong Republican and former Trump aide who served as the EPA’s deputy chief of staff until he was removed for raising alarm over Pruitt’s spending habits.","The latest controversies keep attention on Pruitt for a third consecutive week. The scandals began last month when ABC News reported that Pruitt paid just $50 a night to live in a luxury condo owned by an energy lobbyist with business before the EPA. The deal cast light on Pruitt’s roughly two dozen ethical breaches and prompted at least three Republican members of Congress to call for his resignation.","President Donald Trump has signaled strong support for Pruitt, whose vast network of conservative allies mounted an effort to defend him over the past month. But the White House could be more open to Pruitt’s exit since the Senate confirmed Andrew Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist, as the EPA’s deputy administrator on Friday.

On the other hand, this expands Trump's authority to bomb.","date":"2018-04-16"},"articleContent":["WASHINGTON ― A bipartisan group of senators is taking another crack at making Congress do its job and vote to authorize wars.","Sens. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) and Tim Kaine (D-Va.) on Monday unveiled a new authorization for use of military force, or AUMF, that redefines the limits on President Donald Trump’s ability to attack non-state terrorist groups around the world. This is not related to Trump’s recent strikes in Syria.","Their proposal does four things.","Most notably, it expands Trump’s authority to take military action against al Qaeda, ISIS or the Taliban, wherever they may be geographically. It also authorizes military action against “associated forces” of those groups.","It repeals a 2002 AUMF that authorized military action in Iraq and a sweeping 2001 AUMF that allowed military action against al Qaeda.","It requires the president to report to Congress any time he sends new forces into a new country. The president has 48 hours to notify Congress, and lawmakers have 60 days to pass legislation to remove that authority if they don’t agree. If lawmakers don’t take any action, the existing authorities stay in place.","Finally, every four years, it requires the president to submit to Congress a plan to repeal, modify or keep the authorizations. If Congress does nothing within 60 days, the existing AUMF stays in place.","“For too long, Congress has given Presidents a blank check to wage war,” Kaine said in a statement. “We’ve let the 9/11 and Iraq War authorizations get stretched to justify wars against multiple terrorist groups in over a dozen countries, from Niger to the Philippines. Our proposal finally repeals those authorizations and makes Congress do its job by weighing in on where, when, and with who we are at war.”","Here’s a copy of the bill.","Co-sponsors of the bill include Sens. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Todd Young (R-Ind.) and Bill Nelson (D-Fla.).","Corker, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has scheduled a hearing to debate, amend and vote on his legislation next week.","“There have been a number of efforts over the years to update these authorities,” he said in a statement. “I am pleased that we have reached an agreement on a product for the committee to consider and that I hope will ultimately strike an appropriate balance of ensuring the administration has the flexibility necessary to win this fight while strengthening the rightful and necessary role of Congress.”","The senators get points for pushing an issue that Congress keeps putting off. But they’ve got serious obstacles ahead.","Republicans, who typically want to give the president as much power as possible to take military action, have reasons to get on board. But this isn’t going to go over well with Democrats who have been pushing for tighter restrictions on the president’s ability to start wars, whether it’s by imposing geographic limits or on the number of U.S. troops being deployed. They also won’t like that this AUMF doesn’t expire.","Then there’s the issue of Hill leaders letting the bill get a floor vote at all. Congress is constitutionally required to authorize any sustained military action, but House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) have denied war authorization votes for years, for no real reason other than shielding their party members from a politically tough vote.","Congress’ inaction has infuriated a relatively small but bipartisan group of lawmakers who argue they are shirking their role in war-making decisions and letting presidents abuse the never-expired 2001 AUMF.","President Barack Obama stretched the legal limits of the 2001 authorization to unilaterally bomb ISIS, arguing it is an offshoot of al Qaeda. And just last week, Speaker Ryan said Trump could use the 17-year-old war authorization to bomb the Syrian government, which has nothing to do with al Qaeda.","Kaine, who has been loudly calling for a new AUMF for years, said holding a war authorization vote really comes down to lawmakers having a spine or not.","“This is personal to me as the father of a Marine and someone who represents a state so closely connected to the military,” he said. “Congress has painstakingly avoided this debate for years because war votes aren’t easy. But if we’re going to ask our troops to risk their lives in support of a mission, then we need to at least have the courage to show we are behind them.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ad518371e000008087b1ab7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"John Stamos Welcomes First Child Named After Late Father","authors":"Cole Delbyck","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-stamos-caitlin-mchugh-first-child_us_5ad4a61ee4b016a07e9ec3eb","short_description":"Have mercy!","date":"2018-04-16"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"QUEER VOICES","headline":"Trans Athlete Chris Mosier Earned A Spot On Team USA For The Fifth Time","authors":"Cyd Zeigler, Outsports","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chris-moiser-team-usa-outsports_us_5ad0c520e4b0edca2cb93d27","short_description":"The trans athlete continues to blaze a trail in duathlon and triathlon.","date":"2018-04-16"},"articleContent":["This article originally appeared on Outsports","Chris Mosier has made his fifth national duathlon team.

Neither Harder nor the Trump campaign responded to several requests for comment.","One Republican close to Trump said he can understand the logic of treating the original nondisclosure agreement Clifford signed one way and the efforts to enforce it the opposite way.","“I can see as how they could construe it as a re-election issue.

Now, Donald Trump’s Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke wants to change that.”","The American Economic Freedom Alliance, a secretive political nonprofit with ties to Vice President Mike Pence, paid for the ads. The group has a history of both supporting and pushing Republicans. The Indianapolis Star reported in March that the nonprofit ran more than $330,000 in ads applauding Rep. Luke Messer (R-Ind.) for fighting to end tax credits for undocumented immigrants. Messer is one of three Republicans vying for a chance to take on Sen. Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.) in November. And last year the organization ran television and digital ads aimed at persuading three Republican congressmen from New York to repeal an insurance tax that was part of Obamacare, Politico reported.","The nonprofit is registered to the same address in Alexandria, Virginia, as Republican media agency IMGE. Marty Obst, one of Pence’s senior advisers, is also a senior adviser at IMGE. He also appears to oversee the American Economic Freedom Alliance, according to a January Twitter post from the nonprofit’s research director, Matt St. Clair.","The Zinke ads ran on cable networks Fox News and MSNBC from March 26 to April 6, but only in the Washington area ― an odd choice, since district residents don’t have a voting representative in the U.S. Senate. The group paid $73,000 for a total of 75 spots, the majority of which aired only inside the Beltway, according to information HuffPost obtained via a media consultant.","As a nonprofit, the American Economic Freedom Alliance is not required to disclose where its donations come from.","Zinke has repeatedly vowed to address the ballooning maintenance backlog at national parks, which is estimated at $12 billion. The Trump administration’s 2019 budget request laid out a legislative proposal for a “Public Lands Infrastructure Fund” for park improvements using revenue from oil drilling and other energy development on public lands and in offshore waters. In March, a bipartisan group of lawmakers in both the House and Senate unveiled a bill based on the administration’s proposal to provide up to $18 billion.","Zinke, a former Montana congressman and Navy SEAL, touts himself as a conservationist in the mold of President Theodore Roosevelt. But in his first year as chief steward of America’s natural resources, he has prioritized energy development over conservation.","Craig Holman, a government affairs lobbyist for the progressive consumer rights advocacy group Public Citizen, told HuffPost it is “unusual,” but not unheard of, for an outside group to buy expensive ads praising Cabinet officials. Along with promoting a Pence ally, Holman expects the ad was aimed at helping to “get Zinke’s name in the public sphere” ahead of a future candidacy.","Although he has recommended Trump roll back national monument designations in states including Utah, Oregon and California, Zinke has proposed the creation of a 130,000-acre monument in his home state of Montana. He also supports a ban on new mining in Paradise Valley, in southwestern Montana just north Yellowstone National Park ― both of which add to speculation that he may be setting up a run for governor or Senate.","During his tenure at the Department of the Interior, Zinke has on several occasions met with Republican donors and attended GOP fundraisers during taxpayer-funded trips, drawing accusations that he’s mixing work with politics. And the Des Moines Register reported earlier this month that a polling firm floated Zinke’s name among Iowa Republican voters to gauge his popularity for a possible presidential bid.","“I think he wants to be governor of Montana, then president of the United States,” Land Tawney, president and chief executive of Backcountry Hunters and Anglers, a Montana-based nonprofit dedicated to protecting public lands and preserving opportunities for hunting and fishing, told HuffPost in a recent interview.","Kate Kelly, public lands director at the left-leaning Center for American Progress and a former interior official in the Obama administration, called the TV ads “really curious.”","“I kept waiting for the ‘Ryan Zinke for President’ logo to appear,” she told HuffPost via email. “The timing and targeting of the buy makes it hard to believe that it had any serious policy aims but was more about trying to salvage Zinke’s image using national parks as a backdrop.”","At a congressional appropriations hearing last week, Zinke said the administration’s budget proposal “calls for the largest investment in public lands infrastructure in American history” and that establishing a fund to rebuild parks was his “top priority.”","PolitiFact recently rated Zinke’s infrastructure claim as “false.” It noted that President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s $3 billion investment in the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s would amount to $53 billion today and “accounted for vastly more than the Trump proposal as a percentage of federal spending at the time.”","The Interior Department did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.

I think he’s morally unfit to be president.”\nHe said Trump “will stain everyone around him.

Buckel emailed copies of the note to several news organizations, including the New York Times.","“Pollution ravages our planet, oozing inhabitability via air, soil, water and weather,” Buckel wrote in his note, according to the Times’ copy of the note. “Most humans on the planet now breathe air made unhealthy by fossil fuels, and many die early deaths as a result — my early death by fossil fuel reflects what we are doing to ourselves.”","Buckel worked with several environmental groups, including doing volunteer work with the Added Value Red Hook Community Farm and acting as the senior organics recovery coordinator for the Brooklyn Botanic Garden’s NYC Compost Project.","But his more prominent achievements came in his work as a civil rights lawyer.","Buckel was a senior counsel and director of the Marriage Project for Lambda Legal, an LGBTQ advocacy group. He argued in many landmark cases involving LGBTQ youth, including a lawsuit against the Boy Scouts of America and its former ban on gay members.","Camilla Taylor, director of Lambda Legal, said in a statement to HuffPost that their organization will honor Buckel’s life by “continuing to fight for equality.”","“The news of David’s death is heartbreaking,” Taylor said.","“David was a brilliant legal visionary. David helped create Lambda Legal’s focus on LGBT youth,” Taylor continued, detailing Buckel’s work on a case that led a federal court to rule that schools “have an obligation to prevent anti-gay bullying.”","She added: “His thoughtful and engaging advocacy broke through many stubborn misconceptions and showed it was possible and necessary for our movement to speak up for bullied, ostracized LGBT young people.”","One of Buckel’s most high-profile cases involved the gang rape and murder of Brandon Teena, a 21-year-old transgender man who was killed as a result of a hate crime in Nebraska.","Buckel worked with Teena’s mom, JoAnn Brandon, in a lawsuit against Richardson County, accusing Sheriff Charles B. Laux of failing to protect Teena from his rapists, who killed him after he reported the rape. The Nebraska Supreme Court ruled in Brandon’s favor.","Teena’s life was later adapted into the 1999 film, “Boys Don’t Cry.” Hilary Swank, who starred in the film, won an Academy Award and Golden Globe for her portrayal of Teena.","Early Saturday morning, people at Prospect Park noticed Buckel’s body before first responders arrived on the scene.","Irene Ryjova, a 44-year-old woman who was rollerblading in the park early Saturday, told the New York Post she saw the body lying on the floor “like someone would lie on the sand at the beach.”","In his suicide note, Buckel recalled the Tibetan monk protesters who have set themselves on fire in protest of the Chinese occupation in Tibet, according to the New York Daily News.","“This is not new, as many have chose to give a life based on the view that no other action can most meaningfully address the harm they see,” Buckel reportedly wrote.","“Here is a hope that giving a life might bring some attention to the need for expanded actions, and help others give a voice to our home, and Earth is heard.”","If you or someone you know needs help, call 1-800-273-8255 for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

I immediately understood this conversation would be between myself and Ms. Helen Hunt, who could navigate my questions herself, thank you very much.","For over four decades, Hunt has affected audiences with her warm smile and natural charisma, appearing in everything from the late 1970s sci-fi series “The Bionic Woman” to Louis C.K.’s controversial and critically panned “I Love You, Daddy” last year. She won multiple Emmys for her role as Jamie Buchman in the long-running ’90s TV series “Mad About You” and took home an Oscar for “As Good As It Gets” in ’97. She starred in the films “What Women Want,” “Pay It Forward,” “Cast Away” and “Bobby,” to name just a few, before taking a step off screen to focus on writing and directing. Her two projects, “Then She Found Me” and “Ride,” solidified Hunt as a blossoming filmmaker, giving her the opportunity to direct episodes of television series’ like “Revenge,” “House of Lies,” “Feud,” “This Is Us” and “Splitting Up Together.”","But, at 54, Hunt seems eager to get back on our screens and uncover the kinds of roles she’s long been craving. As an actress who’s witnessed decades of Hollywood ups and downs, she has strong opinions about her industry and the parts she wants to inhabit in it.","Currently, she can be seen in “The Miracle Season,” based on the true story of Iowa City’s West High School 2011-12 volleyball team. The squad, after the tragic death of its star player, attempts to conjure up the strength to make it to the state championship alongside tough-love coach Kathy Bresnahan (Hunt). On the phone, sans publicist, we spoke about the movie, the changes she’s experienced in her ever-changing workplace and, of course, those “Mad About You” revival contracts.","You’re a busy woman these days.","I suddenly got busy after not being busy!","I can’t start this conversation off without mentioning the supposed deals you and Paul Reiser closed for a “Mad About You” reboot. Is it a go?","We closed this thing with Sony, who is our studio, which means that’s great, but there’s nowhere to do it yet. I read somewhere, “They’re being coy.” There’s no being coy, nobody’s bought it yet, you know what I’m saying? I mean, at all. [There’s] nothing I’m even hiding. So our enthusiasm is clear, but we don’t have any home for it yet. And we don’t know if we will or if we’ll have one that everybody likes. Seems like it is marching steadily toward “I hope it happens.”","The show is now going to be run by a spectacular writer, Peter Tolan from “Rescue Me” and “Murphy Brown,” with me and Paul by his side. Danny Jacobson (the show’s co-creator) will come back and consult, and that’s great. But we’re really excited that we have Paul and me as the guardians of what it was, and Peter Tolan with new, fresh, smart enthusiasm, who’s going to be doing a lot of the writing. The cocktail of what it was and something brand new is what has made me excited about it. I can’t think of anyone better than Peter Tolan to be that kind of new breath-of-life into it. He’s a big element. His sensibility combined with our comfy-with-each-other thing is exciting to me.","To come back with a different spin on it, a different showrunner and possibly a new network must be thrilling.","Yes. I honestly can’t high-five yet because no one may want to buy it or, more possibly, how ever those deals get made might not ever get made. But the prospect of doing it went from seeming absurd to seeming really exciting. I’ve always been interested with this show: What is it like to love someone over time? That’s been the thing that hooked me into doing it in the first place. It’s one thing to love somebody after a year and it’s another thing to love somebody after seven years. To check in on what’s the grace and the grit of loving someone after 20 years? That’s a pretty terrific prospect, and with a great new writer and my dear friend who I love acting with. If it happens, I’d be super excited, but I don’t know if it’s going to happen.","I really hope it does, especially with the many platforms out there now aside from the networks who could be interested.","Right, right. That’s in the hands of who knows what, but I’m open to any place that’s interested in the things we’re interested in.","You and Paul were, in a way, trailblazers for successful TV stars ― even earning yourself huge pay raises in the final season of “Mad About You.” (They each got a $750k raise, to $1 million an episode.)","Those days are gone [laughs].","But we see these stars now, like Ellen Pompeo, for instance, making a ton of money to remain on hit shows while fighting for what they deserve. Do you see yourself as a pioneer in that world?","It would be hard for me to use that word, but I was very aware that I had, thanks to Paul, been invited into an incredibly generous job in every way. Luckily, I knew enough, even in Season 2 and 3, to say to myself once a day, “This isn’t going to last forever, remember that.” Getting to work on 11-page scenes with a scene partner you love working with about something you care about [is amazing]. We didn’t have jerks on the show. There was nobody that made it a drag. It was a particularly lovely group, and Paul and I have remained really great friends, so coming back to all of that would be like, “You’re kidding?”","Even though we see a lot of solid roles for women and female-led shows and films, they’re still hard to come by. Are you excited to have the chance to maybe reprise Jamie Buchman and then take on even more roles?","Yes. I’m about to go work on something that just so happens would be great. I’m very fired up about my acting at the moment and excited about possibilities that are in front of me and behind me with this movie that’s out, which I’m really proud of.","Yes, let’s talk “The Miracle Season.” After taking a few years to focus on directing, what about this character, coach Kathy Bresnahan, resonated with you?","I had worked with the director Sean McNamara before on “Soul Surfer,” so I knew he was a lovely guy and a terrific filmmaker. That’s step one. And I knew that there was a wonderful part in there and I just went ahead and started working on it, and I had the help of the real woman I played. It wasn’t until I was standing on the volleyball court dressed like her, surrounded by these 20-something-year-old women that I thought, “Oh my God. I’m standing exactly where I should be.” In a circle of women, reminding them and myself what their value is. That they can remind themselves of what that value is rather than looking to somebody else, a man in particular, to give it to them. That I could be encouraging and loving with them and still be a fierce leader.","It wasn’t until I was playing the part that I realized that. And then, when the movie came out, I went, not only am I standing in a circle of women, which is where I like to be, but I’m standing in a circle of women at a time when that’s, I think, the hope of how to work through this. I have never had an experience of partnering with women around my work or in my friendships when there has been anything other than fierce solidarity. Whatever that myth is about women being competitive with each other, I have never experienced it.","We’re now in these Me Too and Time’s Up movements. Do you find that this film fits nicely within this particular moment?","I do. I mean, there’s a lot of other stories to tell: There’s anger to write about and healing ― or the impossibility of healing to write about. A lot is going to come out of this forever. I heard [the writer and activist] Alice Walker speak once and she said the most important thing [she’d] done in [her] life was be in a circle with other women and talk. So when I look at the clips from this movie or watch this movie, there they are; standing in a circle, reminding each other and fortifying each other. There’s no movie I’d rather be in today.","It’s a true story about this slightly unlikeable, tough coach who happens to be a woman. That’s a role we usually see played by men, so what was the experience portraying Kathy like for you?","I love sports movies. I mean, I wanted to be Kurt Russell in “Miracle” then, so this was my chance. It was a dream come true. I made a sports movie called “Ride” and I did “Soul Surfer,” so this is a genre that I adore and this one had this giant piece of heartbreak and soul in the middle of it. It made it the perfect movie for me.","Having a young daughter and being in a movie like “Miracle Season,” are you excited for her to see it. Well, has she seen any of your iconic roles? “Twister,” I hope!","She has not seen “Twister.” I suggested it actually and it hasn’t been on the top of her list. She’s not only seen “Miracle Season,” she’s in “Miracle Season.” She has two scenes at the beginning that I had nothing to do with ― she auditioned and she got the part. She’s the younger sister of Erin Moriarty’s love interest. Being on the set surrounded by these wonderful actors-turned-volleyball-players and volleyball-players-turned-actors, they all just treated her like they were her aunties and it was a pretty amazing summer we spent.","Could you see her getting into the business? You started young, so…","Yeah! It will be utterly and totally up to her.","Over this press cycle, you’ve talked about your fear of “sucking” as an actor.","[Laughs] It’s just more a motivator. I didn’t see how healing the movie might be to be in or what it might mean to people at the time it came out, I was just busy doing my work. There’s a famous line from a play where an actress says, “You have no idea what it feels like to be acting when you know it’s bad.” And I quote that to young actors a lot and say, “That’s what makes you do a lot of homework before you start a film.” Do I know who this person is? Do I know what my part in the story is? Am I serving what the writer wrote? Just to avoid feeling like you’re not doing a good job.","Looking at past roles that maybe could’ve happened for you, I stumbled across a rumor that you were considered for “Basic Instinct” [before Sharon Stone was cast].","I don’t ever remember being talked about for “Basic Instinct” for one second.","Were there any roles you turned down because you felt you couldn’t serve a character or honor the storyteller’s work?","There are. I never want to mention parts I’ve turned down. The roles I’ve succeeded in, many of them were turned down by other people, so I don’t want to put my sticky fingers on someone else’s work. But I certainly turned movies down and regretted it; I turned movies down and said, “Thank God! Why did I agonize for three weeks?” You just make the best decisions you can, you know?","You went on to win Emmys for “Mad About You” and an Oscar for “As Good As It Gets.” Then you appeared in movies like “What Women Want.” When you look back on that movie, for example, do you still feel like it would have the same success today?","I don’t know, they’re remaking it, I think? That’s what I heard. But the movies I look back on that are the most meaningful to me are probably the two that I wrote and directed, just because they came from the very deepest parts of me ― one is called “Then She Found Me” and the other was called “Ride.” And then I was in this movie “The Sessions” a handful of years ago and I feel really proud of that movie. I would like it if younger people saw that movie because in this time of being flooded with sexualized violence and porn, you can’t go anywhere now without seeing it or hearing about it. This was a movie about healthy sex, healthy sexuality and I think it was kind of singular and shocking in a quiet way. I’m very proud to leave that behind ― not that I’m going anywhere soon, but I’m proud that that’s something I was in and helped to make.","A beautiful movie which got an enormous response at Sundance in 2012.","It did, that was wild.","Were you expecting that kind of reception for the movie and your role in it, which earned you an Oscar nomination?","No, no, no. I had no idea, but I did sit down and there were, whatever there are, 2,000 people in that auditorium or something, and I had never been to Sundance and right before it started I was like, “I’m about to be vulnerable in every way in front of all of these people.” It was a very quiet screening but there was laughing, which was good, and when it was over, they stood up and they didn’t stop. And I said, “Whoa, this has made some sort of impact on people.” That was really exciting. I can tell when I read something ― especially when I watch something, even one episode of a show I otherwise like ― it will have that sick, frankly, feel to it that deals with sex. So to have a movie that was this intimate, and only feel its honest approach and desire to show what sex can be, I thought was quite remarkable in front of 2,000 people.","It was ahead of the curve we’re seeing now with filmmakers taking bigger risks with their female leads. Women not just playing stereotypes. How does it feel now versus a decade or so ago in terms of the treatment of women in Hollywood and the roles you’re being presented with?","It’s never been one thing. I can’t say now’s the time when it’s great. Certainly, there’s great parts on television for women for sure, but I don’t know how to say this time is different from before in terms of parts. It’s just all about writers. You just have to nurture and pay [laughs] writers because everybody, men included, are searching for a story and a good writer, and when it comes along, hope they’re smart enough to grab it.","Is that why you decided to write, direct and produce your own movies? To make the content you wanted to see?","Yeah. Also, writing is step one and discovering the courage to do that was something I wanted to try. When you direct something you wrote, it’s more like getting another chance to rewrite it. You’re rewriting it with the production design, the music and how you’re photographing it. I guess I wanted to experience getting as close to the bone as possible with creating a story.","And starring in it. Do you always have yourself in mind for these characters?","No, I think it’s, in general, a really bad idea [laughs], in terms of people taking the movie seriously and in terms of enjoying the job of writing and directing it. In these cases [“Then She Found Me,” “Ride”], both practically and creatively, it ended up being the right move. But I don’t recommend it necessarily.","I imagine it’s difficult to direct yourself.","It is definitely difficult. It’s also terrific, because on a small movie where time is an issue, you have one person who sees the movie the way you do and is willing to work long hours and change in the van and do whatever it takes to get the movie made. It sets a tone for we’re all going to dig in and get this movie made, even with the amount of time and money that we have. But it’s a very different experience; very immersive, to say the least.","Women directors, in general, have to push even harder to helm projects and fight for budgets. Are you seeing more female directors get a chance to make movies in the men’s club?","It’s all about money. People have to hire women, #JustHire. Hire women, people of color, women of color ― that is how this is changing and it will stop changing if people stop doing that. The pressure that people are feeling to hire not only white men has to remain in order for things to change.","You’ve been directing a lot in the television world with “Feud,” “This Is Us” and “Splitting Up Together,” among other shows. Have you seen a shift there in terms of female directors?","We’ll see at the end of the year when the directors guild tells us how many [there are]. It was a year or two ago we thought it was getting better and it got like 1 percent worse, so let’s hope. That’s my takeaway too; it seems like there’s more diversity in terms of directors on TV. One thing we all can do ― almost every time I direct I have a mentee with me, a woman, usually. Ryan Murphy really has been doing it for a few years now. He has a mentee program where every time you direct you have a woman or a person of color following you around. He really is in it for the long haul in helping to make sure they’re actually hired to direct. He deserves a ton of credit, I think.","He definitely pushed this before anyone else.","And the way he’s pushing it is, again, with money. He’s hiring people.","At the Oscars this year, Frances McDormand brought up the inclusion rider, which requires a certain level of diversity among a film’s cast and crew.","I think it’s fantastic. It comes back to the same thing: hire people.","Are you going to focus on directing as you have been doing or are we going to see you more on screen this year?","At the moment I have some acting and some directing on my plate, so I’m really excited about that. And some writing! I’m working hard and enjoying never having to choose between those things. I’ve never been comfortable saying, “I’m more of a comedic actress than a dramatic actress! I prefer this screen over that screen!” I just want to be a part of telling good stories, and today I’m getting to do that. That’s great news.","“The Miracle Season” is in theaters now."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ad10f9c200000d30ceb4a4a.jpeg?cache=GbEPoNozkl&ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"TECH","headline":"Facebook's Tracking Of Non-Users Sparks Broader Privacy Concerns","authors":"David Ingram, Reuters","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/facebook-tracking-of-non-users-sparks-broader-privacy-concerns_us_5ad34f10e4b016a07e9d5871","short_description":"CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that, for security reasons, the company collects “data of people who have not signed up for Facebook.”","date":"2018-04-15"},"articleContent":["By David Ingram","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Concern about Facebook Inc’s respect for data privacy is widening to include the information it collects about non-users, after Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said the world’s largest social network tracks people whether they have accounts or not.","Privacy concerns have swamped Facebook since it acknowledged last month that information about millions of users wrongly ended up in the hands of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, a firm that has counted U.S. President Donald Trump’s 2016 electoral campaign among its clients.","Zuckerberg said on Wednesday under questioning by U.S. Representative Ben Luján that, for security reasons, Facebook also collects “data of people who have not signed up for Facebook.”","Lawmakers and privacy advocates immediately protested the practice, with many saying Facebook needed to develop a way for non-users to find out what the company knows about them.","“We’ve got to fix that,” Representative Luján, a Democrat, told Zuckerberg, calling for such disclosure, a move that would have unclear effects on the company’s ability to target ads. Zuckerberg did not respond. On Friday Facebook said it had no plans to build such a tool.","Critics said that Zuckerberg has not said enough about the extent and use of the data. “It’s not clear what Facebook is doing with that information,” said Chris Calabrese, vice president for policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a Washington advocacy group.","COOKIES EVERYWHERE","Facebook gets some data on non-users from people on its network, such as when a user uploads email addresses of friends. Other information comes from “cookies,” small files stored via a browser and used by Facebook and others to track people on the internet, sometimes to target them with ads.","“This kind of data collection is fundamental to how the internet works,” Facebook said in a statement to Reuters.","Asked if people could opt out, Facebook added, “There are basic things you can do to limit the use of this information for advertising, like using browser or device settings to delete cookies. This would apply to other services beyond Facebook because, as mentioned, it is standard to how the internet works.”","Facebook often installs cookies on non-users’ browsers if they visit sites with Facebook”like” and “share” buttons, whether or not a person pushes a button. Facebook said it uses browsing data to create analytics reports, including about traffic to a site.","The company said it does not use the data to target ads, except those inviting people to join Facebook.","TARGETING FACEBOOK","Advocates and lawmakers say they are singling out Facebook because of its size, rivaled outside China only by Alphabet Inc’s Google, and because they allege Zuckerberg was not forthcoming about the extent and reasons for the tracking.","“He’s either deliberately misunderstanding some of the questions, or he’s not clear about what’s actually happening inside Facebook’s operation,” said Daniel Kahn Gillmor, a senior staff technologist at the American Civil Liberties Union.","Zuckerberg, for instance, said the collection was done for security purposes, without explaining further or saying whether it was also used for measurement or analytics, Gillmor said, adding that Facebook had a business incentive to use the non-user data to target ads.","Facebook declined to comment on why Zuckerberg referred to security only.","Gillmor said Facebook could build databases on non-users by combining web browsing history with uploaded contacts. Facebook said on Friday that it does not do so.","The ACLU is pushing U.S. lawmakers to enact broad privacy legislation including a requirement for consent prior to data collection.","The first regulatory challenge to Facebook’s practices for non-users may come next month when a new European Union law, known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), takes effect and requires notice and consent prior to data collection.","At a minimum, “Facebook is going to have to think about ways to structure their technology to give that proper notice,” said Woodrow Hartzog, a Northeastern University professor of law and computer science.","Facebook said in its statement on Friday, “Our products and services comply with applicable law and will comply with GDPR.”","The social network would be wise to recognize at least a right to know, said Michael Froomkin, a University of Miami law professor.","“If I’m not a Facebook user, I ought to have a right to know what data Facebook has about me,” Froomkin said.","(Reporting by David Ingram; Editing by Peter Henderson and Richard Chang)"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ad350471e0000fb077b18aa.jpeg?cache=FGWrb8Mw8f&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"COMEDY","headline":"Robert De Niro's Mueller Scorches 'Focker' Michael Cohen (Ben Stiller) On 'SNL'","authors":"Mary Papenfuss","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/deniro-stiller-snl-cold-open_us_5ad2c91fe4b016a07e9d161e","short_description":"\"You little weasel.\"","date":"2018-04-15"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"‘SNL’ Host John Mulaney Wrote Last Night’s Best Sketch In 2010","authors":"Andy McDonald","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-best-sketch-on-snl-last-night-host-john-mulaney-wrote-in-2010_us_5ad388e4e4b077c89ce9a15e","short_description":"The \"Les Misérables\" inspired musical number is wonderful.","date":"2018-04-15"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"COMEDY","headline":"Kate McKinnon Kills As Laura Ingraham On 'Saturday Night Live'","authors":"Mary Papenfuss","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mckinnon-as-laura-ingraman-on-snl_us_5ad2ddc0e4b077c89ce93f0c","short_description":"Fighting for her \"right to bully people without being bullied in return.”","date":"2018-04-15"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"A Peek Inside 'Divas Live,' Pop Music's Greatest Worship Service","authors":"Matthew Jacobs","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/divas-live-20th-anniversary_us_5acf57f6e4b0701783ac229a","short_description":"On the 20th anniversary, here's how all-star women came together for a concert extravaganza filled with as much drama as there was glory.","date":"2018-04-15"},"articleContent":["The New York air was crisp and calm on the night of April 14, 1998. But inside the Beacon Theater on Manhattan’s Upper West Side, a fire blazed. The faithful had gathered. A religious ceremony was to take place. Six deities waited in the wings, but they needn’t proselytize upon taking the stage. Every sane soul had already kneeled at their altar, and would do so again for several years to come.","The event, of course, was VH1′s “Divas Live.” The gods were pop prima donnas: Aretha Franklin, Mariah Carey, Céline Dion, Gloria Estefan, Shania Twain and Carole King who, separately and together, performed numbers from their respective catalogs. The worship service was a ratings smash, so the following year, VH1 increased the cause for hosannas. Whitney Houston, Tina Turner, Cher and Brandy headlined “Divas Live ’99,” joined by Mary J. Blige, Chaka Khan, LeAnn Rimes, Faith Hill and “very special guest” Elton John. It became the highest-rated program in the network’s history, a grail for both VH1 and the world at large.","As almost any large-scale production can attest, putting at least half a dozen superstars on the same bill doesn’t happen without a few hitches ― and altercations ― along the way. So, ahead of the event’s 20th anniversary, I called up five producers who put together the first three “Divas” shows (2000′s was a Diana Ross tribute featuring Carey, Hill, Donna Summer, Destiny’s Child and RuPaul) to see just how much gossip I could marshal about these glittery exaltations.","Grab some popcorn. Or a little holy water.","1. The Origins, Or: On The First Day, God Created Céline","Heading into 1998, a VH1 executive by the name of Wayne Isaak, who’d spent more than a decade as a publicity guru at A&M Records, was courting Céline Dion for a “big concert event” that would appeal to the network’s core audience: adults 24 to 35, particularly women, who’d made insidery fodder like “Behind the Music,” “Storytellers” and “Crossroads” appointment viewing.","Around the same time, Isaak and the rest of VH1′s original-programming team was in need of a tentpole to replace the network’s eponymous Honors special, a lackluster ceremony that, between 1994 and 1997, saluted musicians’ philanthropic work. Conveniently, the network had just launched the Save the Music Foundation, a nonprofit that donated instruments to public schools. Top brass seized the opportunity to raise funds for the organization and stage an all-star revue.","Isaak knew he could get Dion, but Lauren Zalaznick, a former marketing whiz who would go on to run Bravo, pushed for a franchise that would serve as a brand unto itself. So Isaak pitched an idea called “Three Divas,” a twist on the popular opera group known as the Three Tenors. The team thought to capitalize on the banner moment that women in music were enjoying. Sarah McLachlan had recently inaugurated Lilith Fair. Missy Elliott and Lil’ Kim were eating up the hip-hop scene. At the female singer-songwriter apex sat figures like Alanis Morissette and Tori Amos. Madonna and Lauryn Hill were on the cusp of releasing career-defining records. The 1999 Grammys would boast a rare all-female Album of the Year roster.","Isaak pitched Dion on the idea of joining Aretha Franklin and Mariah Carey for “Three Divas,” to which she apparently gave her resounding approval. With that, the concept quickly snowballed. What if we add Gloria Estefan, Isaak asked. “Of course,” everyone responded. And how about Shania Twain? Well, that was a bit iffier.","Twain had a couple of modest pop hits to her name, but she was still predominately a country draw. With her third album, “Come On Over,” released to widespread acclaim in November 1997, her record label was working to turn her into a mainstream crossover virtuoso ― a prospect aided by VH1, which put Twain’s videos in frequent rotation. But she wasn’t quite there yet when Isaak tried to convince his colleagues to place her in the same lineup as Franklin, Carey, Dion and Estefan.","“I didn’t want Shania Twain,” Zalaznick recalled. “I didn’t think she fit the bill as a diva. But he really convinced me that she was going to be the biggest artist of the year that year, and I think he was right.”","By the time “Divas Live” aired in April, Isaak’s premonition had come true. “You’re Still the One” was a mega-smash, turning Twain into a household name and giving her the third most popular song of 1998, per Billboard’s year-end chart. In fact, Twain’s segment was the highest-rated quarter-hour of the entire “Divas” broadcast, according to Isaak.","Once the lineup was intact ― veteran producer Ken Ehrlich recruited Carole King as a last-minute elder-stateswoman addition ― “Three Divas” shifted to “Divas Live.” As presented in the marketing, the women were on equal footing: The poster was designed so that each singer’s head was exactly the same size, down to a millimeter, according to Zalaznick. That helped to curb managers’ hesitations about the word “diva,” a moniker the producers insisted was meant to be empowering. “We guaranteed them we’d be friendly, that we wouldn’t be too acerbic or make fun of them,” Isaak said.","As such, a genre-agnostic jamboree was born. “In a weird way, we predated the casting of ‘The Voice,’ only in the sense that we were trying to take from each of the biggest genres, which was risky because, like the Grammys, if it’s a show for absolutely everybody sometimes you run the risk that it’s a show for nobody,” Zalaznick said. “We decided it was our best shot at being the most appealing, with the most chances for amazing duets.”","2. Lights, Cameras, Drama!","All the producers I spoke to agree that piecing together the first “Divas” slate was a cinch. But staging the actual show, which business honcho Jay Peterson estimates cost a hefty $2 million, proved more exhaustive.","Which is to say: Configuring six different artists’ accouterments was demanding. Rehearsals were a bitch. Each singer ― none of whom got paid for her appearance ― brought her own band, so the set had to be taken apart during commercial breaks. Personal assistants and publicists were flocking throughout the Beacon Theater during the few days before the telecast; Carey’s gofer stayed by her side, holding a bottle of Evian in one hand and a box of tissues in the other, according to Sean Murphy, a producer tasked with sorting out the “nuts and bolts” of the broadcast.","In addition to everyone’s solo performance, Carey joined Franklin’s set for “Chain of Fools,” and Dion, Estefan and Twain joined King for a tender “You’ve Got a Friend” collaboration, during which they sat around King’s piano as if conjuring a modern-day “Kumbaya.”","The production built toward a grand finale that united all the ladies, essentially leaving them to out-belt one another. They performed ”(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman” and the gospel anthem “Testimony,” a spectacle better described as Aretha Franklin and her five backup singers. Dion, a freshly minted icon thanks to the recent phenomenon that was “My Heart Will Go On,” was the only one who had the chutzpah to try to eclipse Franklin, and it’s a phenomenon to behold.","Preparing the pageant to go live was, in no short order, hectic ― especially by the time Franklin (“Miss Franklin,” as she apparently insisted everyone call her) stormed offstage and threatened not to return.","Every producer I spoke to related this incredible anecdote, to the point where “I assume you’ve heard the Aretha story” became a common refrain. There’s some dispute as to whether the episode occurred on the day of the show or the day before. Either way, Franklin, who’d taken a bus from Detroit because she famously refuses to fly, had arrived for rehearsals with a firm dictum, via her management: Turn off the building’s air conditioning when Aretha performs; it’s not good for her vocal chords. “‘Miss Franklin must have the air conditioning off,’” Zalaznick said, reciting the mandate she and her cohort consistently heard.","But when Franklin stepped onstage, she stopped in her tracks. “Please, everybody be quiet,” she commanded, according to Isaak. Holding her hand up to a vent, Franklin realized the AC was indeed running. “She threw a hissy fit and walked out of the backstage into a car and left,” Isaak said.","Accounts vary as to why Franklin’s ventilation request wasn’t granted. According to Murphy’s telling, the Beacon Theater just so happened to be testing the air-conditioning system that day. From Zalaznick’s perspective, the AC actually was off and the room had turned into a sauna ― “the other performers were horrified” by the temperature, she recalled ― by the time Franklin stormed away. Regardless, no one was sure whether Franklin would be back for the live show. Frantic phone calls ensued. People licked their fingers and held them in the air, looking for encroaching drafts. Eventually, the producers were informed that Franklin had gone to her hotel and was being fitted for dresses, a sign that she would, in fact, perform as scheduled.","“Things were coming down from Mount Sinai,” Zalaznick joked. “We didn’t know [if she’d return], and then all of a sudden the clouds parted, the tablets were delivered, and suddenly we knew. To me, it felt that mysterious and insane.”","But there was still one problem. “She’s eating powdered donuts, and she’s getting powdered sugar all over the dresses,” the show’s stylist, Cary Fetman, who was fitting Franklin, apparently told Murphy. (Representatives for Franklin did not respond to multiple requests for comment.)","Powered sugar or not, Franklin did, of course, turn up, bringing down the house in what became a de facto tribute to her decades-long tenure. While introducing Carey for “Chain of Fools,” she even landed a possible dig about the debacle: “Now, a little earlier in the evening, we didn’t get a chance to rehearse, so my newest girlfriend came in my trailer, and we sat in the back and we talked a little girl talk.”","“I think we put the house AC on and froze it as best we could,” Zalaznick said. “And I’m telling you I believe that we cut the AC before Aretha Franklin came out to perform, and maybe again for the finale. Or maybe we said we did but we didn’t.”","3. Bigger Wheels Keep On Turnin’","By April 15, 1998, a franchise was born. “You know what it’s like: It’s America ― you’ve got to do more,” Isaak said. Zalaznick agreed: “We went crazy,” she said of 1999′s edition. Jeff Gaspin, a well-appointed producer who had green-lighted “Pop-Up Video,” doubled down: “I think we were booking any female artist who had presence. It became about quantity at that point.”","To plan the second go-round, producers started with the “Mount Rushmore” of contemporary divas: Tina Turner signed on first (after some initial hesitancy because she wasn’t touring at the moment), and Whitney Houston, Cher and Brandy quickly followed as co-headliners, with Houston, who was in the midst of a musical renaissance, serving as the show’s “anchor,” much as Franklin had the previous year. The only major diva VH1 didn’t manage to get, according to the producers’ collective recollection, was Madonna, who’d been a key player at the flashy 1998 VH1 Fashion Awards, where she received a tribute prize.","“So whose idea was that ‘Divas’ thing,” Madonna apparently asked Isaak while prepping for the Fashion Awards at her home. When he admitted responsibility, “she just turned away with a repulsive sort of look,” he said. So Isaak knew better than to “beg” Madonna’s management, just like he knew better than to ask Sheryl Crow, who at the time didn’t want to be held in any sort of “diva” regard. (Crow was more of a Lilith Fair queen.)","Today, Zalaznick has regrets. “We didn’t have Madonna? Heresy!” she said. “What was I thinking?”","Once the “younger” divas ― LeAnn Rimes, Faith Hill and Mary J. Blige (as well as Chaka Khan and Elton John) ― were added to the slate, the producers opted to stuff the presentation with sizzling duos and trios. John and Turner performed “The Bitch Is Back” (a John song that Turner had covered in 1978), after which Cher joined them for “Proud Mary.” Rimes united with John for “Written in the Stars,” their hit single from the musical “Aida.” Brandy and Hill teamed up for the former’s cover of Bryan Adams’ melodramatic ”(Everything I Do) I Do It For You.” Houston welcomed her pal Blige for “Ain’t No Way,” and her daughter, Bobbi Kristina, sat onstage and recited a few lines on “My Love Is Your Love.” Brandy, Hill, Blige and Rimes joined Houston and Kahn for “I’m Every Woman,” a finale spectacle better described as Whitney Houston and her five backup singers.","But collaborations can be complicated things. For example, did you know Elton John and Tina Turner were arranging a joint tour, until a fallout during “Divas Live” rehearsals changed those plans? That’s another saga that every producer remembers.","While running through “The Bitch Is Back” and “Proud Mary,” with Turner centerstage at the microphone and John sitting at a piano upstage, Turner offered some notes on John’s instrumentals. As the story goes, the two went back and forth, with Turner asking him to play “Proud Mary” differently. “He gets up and slaps the piano and goes, ‘I am not just some fucking piano player’ and storms offstage,” Murphy said. “He had to be talked down off the ledge. That took about half a day. He was pissed. We’d done other shows with Elton John, and you always wonder: Are we going to get the good Elton or the bad Elton? He’s very mercurial. He was in a snit that day, so when Tina started talking to him like he was just an accompanist, he lost his shit.”","Eventually, Turner went to John’s trailer. Exactly what went on inside is anyone’s guess, but soon enough the trailer door opened and the duo returned to the theater. The show would go on. John apologized to the crew, according to Murphy, but in the interim, he and Turner had nixed the tour they were planning to announce after “Divas Live.” Turner addressed the incident during a CBS interview in 2000: “I made a mistake when I needed to show him how to play ‘Proud Mary.’ The mistake is you don’t show Elton John how to play his piano.” (A representative for John did not respond to our request for comment.)","Rewatching the performance today knowing the duo was rebounding from an altercation, Turner and John’s acumen is masterful. There’s no indication they’d ever quarreled. John mostly yields the stage to Turner ― he wasn’t a headliner, after all ― and kisses her hand at the end, a sendoff for the ages.","Feuds be damned, the ratings were dynamite. Disciples had flocked to witness their priestesses’ sermons. After 1998′s “Divas Live” had become the highest-rated program in the network’s history, 1999′s broke that record, netting a reported 2.4 million eyeballs on premiere night.","4. The Rest Is History","By 2000, VH1 had branded “Divas” successfully enough to break slightly from its hodgepodge format, turning the third iteration into an official Diana Ross tribute. Immediately, the event lost some of its pizazz. The producers nixed the live broadcast, which proved to be a blessing because it took a taxing five and a half hours to tape, partly because Ross (referred to specifically as “Miss Ross,” per her mandate) took 20 minutes to change costumes between each number, according to Murphy. Fed-up audience members started leaving. The telecast scaled back on collaborations ― the highlight was Carey and Ross, who sailed through “Baby Love” and “Stop! In The Name Of Love” ― and squandered its fount of religious blessings.","The producers generally agree the Ross salute was a logistical mess. Ross had requested a sound system that proved glitchy, and she walked through the audience mid-performance, even though the cameras and lights weren’t configured for such mobility. Regardless, the ratings remained impressive. Producers resoundingly agree that Donna Summer and Faith Hill were a delight to work with. Meanwhile, Destiny’s Child, still a year away from releasing “Survivor,” was thrilled just to be included. (It’s nice to hear some pleasant gossip every now and then!) “Destiny’s Child did the show, and they were so excited to do it that Beyoncé told me, ‘We’ve been rehearsing in our hotel room for the last two weeks,’” Isaak said. “That was the secret sauce: to get people to do something they’re really into.”","From there, some of the “Divas Live” mojo waned. 2001 was an Aretha Franklin tribute ― been there, done that ― and subsequent years featured folks who were decidedly not divas: Kid Rock, Backstreet Boys, Bobby Brown. Still, the franchise managed to maintain the delicious team-ups: Dixie Chicks and Stevie Nicks doing “Landslide,” Beyoncé and Jewel rolling through “Proud Mary,” Patti LaBelle joining Jessica Simpson and Cyndi Lauper for “Lady Marmalade.”","“Divas” ran consecutively through 2004, then took a break until 2009, when the lineup gravitated less toward classic chanteuses and more toward contemporary hitmakers. Between 2009 and 2012, Adele, Katy Perry, Kelly Clarkson, Miley Cyrus, Nicki Minaj, Sugarland, Florence Welch and Ciara were among the headliners. And while nothing could recapture the magic of first two “Divas” renditions, in the post-Lilith Fair era it remained one of the few destinations for A-list women converging for a diverse musical extravaganza. (“Divas” returned in 2016 for a holiday special starring Mariah Carey, Chaka Khan, Vanessa Williams, Patti LaBelle and Teyana Taylor.)","Furthermore, today’s overstuffed pop-culture landscape can’t turn an event like “Divas Live” into the miracle it was in the ’90s: Artists don’t rely as heavily on televised promotional appearances, and a network like VH1 can’t sink millions of dollars on broadcasts that aren’t guaranteed to generate exemplary ratings.","“These things are lost to history sometimes,” Zalaznick said. “The straightest and the most long-standing remain in the historical canon, but not these types of experiences, which have incredible value for many, many reasons.”","The devoted never forget."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ad0b7541f0000280616d140.jpeg?cache=7IV1qaSPaq&ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"WORLD NEWS","headline":"Tens Of Thousands In Hungary Protest Far-Right Leader Viktor Orbán","authors":"Nick Robins-Early","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/viktor-orban-hungary-election-protests_us_5ad0dbd0e4b016a07e9c11f7","short_description":"There is widespread concern that Hungary is drifting away from democracy.","date":"2018-04-14"},"articleContent":["Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through Hungary’s capital of Budapest on Saturday to protest Prime Minister Viktor Orbán’s government, as critics warn the country could slide further into illiberalism.","Orbán’s radical right, nationalist Fidesz party won a landslide victory in parliamentary elections last Sunday. With a two-thirds majority in the legislature, Fidesz now has the power to make changes to the country’s constitution.","The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe criticized the election for “intimidating and xenophobic rhetoric, media bias and opaque campaign financing.”","The campaign saw Orbán rail against migration and push the idea that unseen “foreign interests” were seeking to undermine the government. The prime minister also made Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros a focal point of the campaign, claiming that Soros was conspiring to bring hundreds of thousands of migrants into the country and putting up anti-Soros posters around the country.","Opponents fear that Fidesz’s parliamentary majority will allow Orbán to accelerate his attacks on democratic institutions and civil society, including pushing through so-called “Stop Soros” laws that would put harsh restrictions on non-governmental organizations such as Amnesty International.","In the week since the election, a pro-government magazine owned by one of Orbán’s allies has published a list of 200 people it accused of being agents for Soros. The roster included journalists, human rights workers and university professors.","A major opposition newspaper and an English language independent news site both announced they were shutting down just days after the vote. Orbán and his allies control most of the country’s media, and the closings only add to the prime minister’s grip on how Hungarians receive their information.","As the election results came in last Sunday night, there were no major protests but instead acknowledgments of defeat and resignations from opposition parties. Only a small crowd of young people gathered in front of Parliament to demonstrate against Orbán, before moving on to hold a sit-in at a major Budapest intersection under the lights of police cars. The effort petered out as the night dragged on.","But less than a week later, Hungarians came out in droves Saturday to voice their opposition to the government.

Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, later confirmed in an evening news conference:","A scientific research center in the greater Damascus area.\n\nA chemical weapons storage facility west of Homs.\n\nA weapons storage facility and a command post close to the facility near Homs.","The strikes “successfully hit every target,” Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White said at a briefing Saturday morning. The Syrian military had claimed earlier in the day that it had intercepted “most” of the 105 missiles.","Lt. Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie said that the U.S. had no indication of civilian casualties and that no aircraft or missiles involved in the operation were successfully engaged by Syrian air defenses.","Friday evening’s actions were a response to a chemical weapons attack on the town of Douma, in eastern Ghouta, last Saturday. The attack killed at least 70 people and rebel fighters were forced to relinquish control of the town to forces loyal to Assad shortly after.","Damascus, Moscow and Tehran all deny that the chemical attack was Assad’s doing. But Defense Secretary Mattis said Friday that the U.S. had conclusive evidence that chlorine gas was used in the Douma attack. He added the U.S. did not rule out that sarin gas was used as well.","McKenzie said on Saturday that the strikes had crippled the Syrian regime’s chemical weapons capabilities, but acknowledged that some of the infrastructure was still left. “I would say there’s still a residual element of the Syrian program that’s out there,” he said. “I’m not going to say that they’re going to be unable to continue to conduct a chemical attack in the future. I suspect, however, they’ll think long and hard about it.”","Tensions With Russia","On Friday, Trump once again called out Assad’s backers. “To Iran and Russia I ask, what kind of nation wants to be associated with the mass murder of men, women and children? The nations of the world can be judged by the friends they keep. ... Russia must decide if it will continue down this dark path or if it will join with civilized nations as a source for stability and peace.”","Although the Pentagon sought to avoid hitting Russian forces stationed in Syria to prevent a direct confrontation with Moscow, Friday’s operation is likely to further escalate tensions between the two countries.","By Saturday, there had been no indication that any Russian forces were hit. And Mattis said the U.S. had not detected any retaliatory action from Russia or Iran.","But the Russian Embassy in the U.S. warned that Friday’s strikes “will not be left without consequences.” On Saturday, Russian officials on Twitter called the “treacherous and insane” strikes a “clear and present danger to world peace” and demanded accountability.","A One-Time Shot","Trump ordered cruise missile strikes on a Syrian air base almost exactly one year ago following a chemical attack on civilians in the town of Khan Sheikhoun that the U.S. blamed on Assad. Experts said the U.S. retaliation last year did little to deter Assad’s campaign against his own people.","U.S. military leaders stressed on Friday that the new operation was much broader in scope and was “a one-time shot” aimed at debilitating Assad’s chemical weapons program in the long run.","It remains unclear, however, whether the latest strikes will do much to convince Assad and his powerful supporters that they must reconsider their approach.","While the Pentagon was adamant that the attack significantly decreased Assad’s chemical weapons capabilities, Syrian government forces had taken precautions at military bases throughout the week in anticipation of possible strikes. A Syrian official told Reuters on Friday that many of those sites had been evacuated ahead of the attack.","In his efforts to sustain his rule and bring Syria fully under his control, Assad has adopted a winner-take-all strategy that can bear any cost regardless of international condemnation. Just in the past two weeks, more than 1,000 people have been killed in a brutal offensive in eastern Ghouta, according to Doctors Without Borders.","Both Russia and Iran are likely to continue their support of Assad. Their presence deters further international action by raising the prospect of a major escalation.","The chief U.S. partner in the country, the Syrian Kurdish militia known as the YPG, remains uncertain about American intentions. And U.S. work on reconstruction to prevent the return of the self-described Islamic State is ongoing but could stop at any time.","Constitutional Questions","Former President Barack Obama, now remembered for promising military action if Assad crossed the “red line” of using chemical weapons, contemplated a strike in 2013. But Obama sought congressional approval and the strike never happened.","On Friday, before Trump had announced the operation, 88 House lawmakers challenged his legal authority to launch attacks against the Syrian regime without congressional approval. Republican Rep. Justin Amash (Mich.) later called the airstrikes “unconstitutional, illegal and reckless.”","Trump had set a path toward retaliation immediately after last Saturday’s reports of a chemical attack. “If President Obama had crossed his stated Red Line In The Sand, the Syrian disaster would have ended long ago!” he tweeted the following Sunday. “Animal Assad would have been history!”","Trump’s latest action further muddies his own approach to Syria. Just last week, he floated the possibility of imminently withdrawing the 2,000 U.S. troops stationed in the country.

From the bus station in the heart of downtown L.A., she walked north for miles. At the edge of Hollywood, she forced herself to stop. Her feet were swollen. Her phone was dead. She was hungry and exhausted. Phillips was 20 years old and completely alone.","Phillips had started walking with one destination in sight ― the Los Angeles LGBT Youth Center. When she entered the building the next day and admired its rainbow mural, she instantly realized: “This is the only place for me here.”","The center is a haven for the LGBTQ youth who make up a disproportionate number of the young people experiencing homelessness in L.A. The center helps them confront challenges similar to those many other people in the streets face. Directors at the organization report that many of the youth experience depression, anxiety and other mental health concerns. They describe repeated rapes, assaults and other abuse.","But the center also helps them navigate an additional battle ― one for their own identity. While struggling to find stability, queer youth on the street are also struggling to carve out their own place in life. And as they fight to stay alive and stay true to themselves, the issues facing LGBTQ youth are quickly becoming one of the most complicated challenges in fighting homelessness in Los Angeles.","Phillips came to California in hopes of finding something better. Her community in Texas didn’t accept or understand her gender identity, and she didn’t feel safe or wanted in her hometown. So at the age of 20, though she had never left home before, Phillips left Texas for the promise of a better life in Los Angeles.","Three years after her move, she laughs recalling that first night on the street. “I thought I was going to die. For real, I thought that was it,” she said. “‘Lay me down, I’m gonna die, it’s over.’ And that was just the first night.”","Since then, she’s had more than a dozen “addresses” in tents on the sidewalks of Hollywood. The center remains the closest thing she has to a home.","“People see trans people as a disgrace,” Phillips said, leaning back in her chair and tugging down on her bright pink shirt. “Even in the LGBT community. No one wants to talk about us. No one wants to help us. So when you walk in the center, and you’re their first priority... you never want to leave.”","Providing the complex and personalized care that young people like Phillips need is a large and difficult job.","There is little research into the mental health of LGBTQ youth, especially in the scope of homelessness studies, and none specifically focused on trans and nonbinary youth. But the few existing studies indicate that queer people end up on the street in disproportionate numbers. LGBTQ youth account for 40 percent of young people on the street nationwide, according to the Center for American Progress. The same study has found that while about 20 percent of U.S. teens in general are queer, 40 percent of homeless U.S. teens are queer. There is no precise data for the number of LGBTQ youth living on the streets of L.A.","These trends are connected to the wide range of challenges that young LGBTQ people face. Young queer people are 25 percent more likely to be sexually assaulted and twice as likely to run away from foster and group homes, the Center for American Progress found. Transgender people have an unemployment rate three times higher than the average American, research from GLAAD shows.","Faced with trauma, acute needs and questions about their gender identities, homeless LGBTQ youth need access to both mental and physical health care to make it through. They need food, showers and a safe place to rest. Many require education in the medical basics of affirming their gender identities. And many face tremendous fear, despite desperately wanting to take the next step.","Phillips is currently transitioning from male to female with the help of the center. She’s scheduled to undergo gender affirmation surgery in six months. The center has connected her with doctors, helped her secure proper prescriptions and enrolled her in therapy to guide her through the process, and is paying for the entire process.","But while Phillips is desperate for the surgery to take place, the transition is difficult to manage while living in a tent on an L.A. street.","Even in the months leading up to the procedure, the challenges have been apparent. The most valuable item in Phillips’ tent is a stack of paper ― her prescriptions for estrogen and spironolactone, an anti-androgen. She tries to have them on her at all times, but has struggled nonetheless to keep her medications safe and up to date. Staying on top of the medication is vital: Missing even a day can result in violent mood swings and depression.","The conditions in her tent raise additional concerns about the months ahead. Many people who undergo this kind of affirmation surgery do it in two stages — first the breast enhancement, then the vaginoplasty, or vice versa. Phillips plans to do it all at once. The healing process takes three months, with risks ranging from discomfort to bleeding that could require hospitalization.","Phillips’ tent is shaded in the afternoons, but at noon it takes the full brunt of the blazing sun. Over the summer, when temperatures rose into the triple digits, simply sitting up became an exhausting task.","Despite the challenges, Phillips hardly appears concerned about the surgery, or what comes next. In fact, she couldn’t be more excited. “I’ve always been a woman,” she said. “This is who I am. I can’t wait for this any longer.”","Source: True Colors Fund","The unique role of the LGBT Youth Center lies in providing personalized care for queer youth, even when they don’t have a home or a job. For homeless LGBTQ youth, the issue isn’t necessarily a lack of access to assistance — it’s a lack of the proper assistance.","“The other shelters, they can’t help me. This is the only place that can help,” said Justin, whose last name is being withheld to protect their safety. “I wouldn’t stay anywhere else, even if there was another shelter. I’d rather stay on the street outside the center, and at least eat there and shower there and have somewhere to go.”","The skin above Justin’s eyebrows is emblazoned with black ink. The name of Justin’s grandmother slants in Arabic script above the left; the English word “identity” arches over the right.","“I’ve had to fight for this one all my life,” Justin said, rubbing a thumb across the curling ink that spells out I-D-E. “It’s the most important thing, I think, for me. I’ve given up everything for this.”","Justin is nonbinary, a person who doesn’t identify as solely female or male. Like many nonbinary youth, Justin prefers the pronouns “they” and “them” rather than “he” and “him” or “she” and “her.” A tattoo on the back of Justin’s left hand reflects this identity in black and red ink — a face with flowing hair and painted lips on one side, and a stubbled, chiseled male jawline on the other.","Justin became homeless shortly after graduating high school in Chicago in 2013. On their first night on the streets, they wandered for hours before crawling under a bush outside a parking garage. Rats and squirrels scuffled through the leaves around their head.","“You don’t understand how scary it is until you’re living it,” Justin said. “I think most people think they can handle it, they can handle living like that, but once you’re there... it’s a different level of being scared. It changes you.”","Justin started out in a tent with a few other nonbinary youth, just a few blocks south of the center. But at night, the other youth in the tent often used drugs. Inches away, Justin watched, fear churning in their stomach. After a week of watching their friends soothe themselves to sleep with drugs, eyes glassy and faces blank, Justin left.","The center helped Justin remain grounded. They slept on the streets near the building, eating every meal and spending every day in its computer lab and lounge. Eventually, a spot opened up for Justin in a bed. But even after leaving the center for their own apartment, Justin remains close by.","Despite the role the center plays in the lives of many LGBTQ youth, it can’t reach every young homeless person in Los Angeles. The organization currently struggles with a waitlist of over a year for new people.","Organizers in the center are hopeful about the addition of the Anita May Rosenstein Campus, scheduled to open in Hollywood in early 2019. The campus is expected to add 100 bed spaces for LGBTQ youth, doubling the total resources. But the center will remain localized in the Hollywood area, limiting access for any youth who live on the outer edges of the sprawling Los Angeles metropolitan area. Ample resources, it seems, won’t be forthcoming any time soon.","Three years after they came to Los Angeles, life is looking up for Justin.

During her three-minute speech, she spoke decisively about the lack of sustained media attention that girls and women of color receive when they are impacted by gun violence. “I represent the African-American women who are victims of gun violence, who are simply statistics instead of vibrant, beautiful girls full of potential,” she said. “I am here to say Never Again for those girls too.”","Her speech was quickly circulated online, earning her fans like Sen. Kamala Harris, Shonda Rhimes, Tessa Thompson and Ellen DeGeneres. When I spoke with Wadler three weeks after her launch into the national conversation, she said the whole experience had been “weird,” but was still ready to use her new platform to give me and my fellow journalists some strong advice.","“The media can pay attention. I feel that a lot of them are very ignorant,” she told me, stressing that this ignorance is particularly clear when it comes to white journalists perpetuating racial stereotypes about black and brown people. “It’s the racial imbalance in the reporting that starts a chain reaction where then other people start to believe that.”","Wadler is certainly extraordinary. The fifth-grader first made headlines when she and classmate Carter Anderson planned a walkout at their elementary school in Alexandria, Virginia, in the wake of the Parkland shooting in February. (Wadler’s mother, Julie Wadler, who identifies as a moderate Republican according to The Guardian, went to high school with the father of Parkland victim Jaime Guttenberg.) On March 14, more than 60 students joined Wadler and Anderson in an 18-minute protest ― one minute for each victim of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, and an extra minute for Courtlin Arrington, a 17-year-old black high school student shot and killed in an Alabama classroom days earlier.","But Wadler is also still a kid. She giggles over the phone, does her interviews with her mother nearby, and has big, beautiful dreams not yet encumbered by the cynicism that so often accompanies getting older.","At Tina Brown’s Women in the World Summit on Saturday, she reiterated the power young people hold. “I’m not an 11-year-old girl who they can just hug and kiss,” she said. “I can deliver a message.”","During our phone conversation ahead the summit, Wadler and I spoke about her newly expansive platform, her hopes for the future, and her advice for us adults ― especially adult journalists. Us olds often forget just how smart kids are in general ― and how thoughtful, knowledgeable and opinionated we might have been at 9 or 11 or 15.","As Wadler explained, it’s on adults to check ourselves, step back and listen to young people. They “see the world through a different set of eyes,” she said.","How does it feel to have so many adults obsessed with you right now?","Naomi Wadler: Weird … I live in my house and I have my two dogs and my sister who I fight with and my mom who picks out dresses with me ― and people don’t know who I am, and now they do. So it’s a little weird!","Do you consider yourself to be an activist?","Julie Wadler: [Laughs] She’s thinking about that one.","NW: Well, I haven’t really thought about it. I feel like I’m just standing up for what’s right. I’m not really, like, “Ah, I’m an activist!” I’m just making the change. I’m not going onto the streets of D.C. and screaming for my causes.","Did you always believe you had the power to make the world a better place, or did you have a moment where you decided that that was what you were going to do?","NW: I’ve grown up in an environment where I’m told that I can be what I want to be and do what I want to do. And for a period of time, I had a piece of blue duct tape in my mirror that said, “You can do anything.” I’m very thankful to have two parents that encouraged me as much as they did, causing me to probably have more confidence in my voice.","That is very lucky. Your parents sound awesome. Can you talk to me a little bit about how you got involved with March for Our Lives?","NW: Yes, I can. So I organized a walkout [after the Parkland shooting] for my school with my friend Carter. And it was well and good. We did the walkout. And then The Guardian did an article about me and Carter and they wanted to know why we’d added an extra minute for Courtlin Arrington … and our answer was that she was black. And that black women don’t get as much media attention when they’re shot and killed. They don’t get trending Twitter hashtags, they don’t get Facebook posts dedicated to them, they don’t get whole Facebook pages dedicated to them. So I thought this would be a good way to get a message across, and inspire.","And you really have gotten that message across. In your March for Our Lives speech you called out “the African-American girls whose stories don’t make the front page of every national newspaper.” Why was that the message that you really wanted to drive home to people who were listening on that day?","NW: Because, I mean, it’s my story. I don’t think that a white girl could have gotten up there and explained how this was unjust and how this is unfair and that she felt so bad. Because she hasn’t lived it, she doesn’t know what it’s like. So I think it was my story so it was a lot easier for me to put into words.","I’m a journalist, and I work with a lot of other journalists. What advice do you have for those of us who are in the media? How can the media do better?","NW: The media can pay attention. I feel that a lot of them are very ignorant, and they don’t know what’s going on around them. They believe everything they hear. And so that causes them to report that ― they hear that black men are dangerous, so then the next time it just happens to be a black man robbing that bank, they’re gonna say “black” in a concerned tone [when they report on the crime].","I feel that also when they report a story, if it was a black man who shot somebody, they’re animals, they’re barbaric, they’re terrible, they’re dangerous and you should stay away from them. If it’s a white man, he was mentally unstable. It’s gonna be OK, we’re gonna send him to a treatment center. He didn’t mean to. He was a nice man, I don’t know where this came from. So it’s the racial imbalance in the reporting that starts a chain reaction where then other people start to believe that.","What do you say to adults who try to dismiss young people because of their age?","NW: Be the bigger person. I don’t wanna go out onstage and say, “They say I don’t know what I’m talking about so I’m gonna tell them all the ways that they’re wrong.” Because by doing that, I’m the little person and I am proving them right. I’m being immature. I’m not having the mature, strong persona that I’m trying to put across if I go out onstage and start whining about how wrong they are. So I’m gonna go up there, I’m gonna be mature. I’m going to tell my story and I’m gonna make a difference, because that’s proving them wrong without addressing them.","In general, how do you think us adults can do a better job of listening to kids and following kids?","NW: They can realize that ... they’ve made their progress. It’s gotten better, it really has, since the 1950s and 1960s, but there are still these giant leaps that we need to take. So since I feel that young people see the world through a different set of eyes, they can really give a different point of view and say what they’ve been through and adults should listen.","So, I’m 30. You’re 11. What do you hope has changed in this country before you turn 30?","[At this point Wadler’s mother apologized, because they had to put me on mute so she could “hack up a hairball.” They both laughed a lot.]","NW: By the time I’m your age, I would like to hope that we would have made a lot more progress. I know that not everything’s perfect, and even though we might get stricter gun laws, there’s always going to be a problem. And so I hope by the time I’m your age, we would have educated our children, our grandchildren, the children after that on today’s issues and we wouldn’t have kept them in a bubble, so that they can do what we did. So that they can make a difference in the world they live in.","Are there any specific things that you’re like, I want that law to change, or I want to see this happen in our government or in our schools?","NW: I want to see stricter gun laws. You shouldn’t be able to walk into a store and buy an assault rifle without an ID, without a background check, without registering it. And we should make it harder to get the accessories that make semi-automatic rifles fully automatic rifles. And I would like further recognition and awareness of racism in the media.","And also, one other thing ― to help ruin the school-to-prison pipeline, so that black children, Hispanic children don’t go to school thinking “I am less than any white peer, and that I’m nothing more than a criminal.” Since they might drive past all these wealthy white schools that have uniforms and MacBooks and perfectly polished hallways, and so [children of color] think that they’re nothing better than a criminal and therefore that’s what they amount to.","Your message has already had such an impact. You’ve effectively gone viral. What do you hope other girls who saw your speech or saw you on “The Ellen Show” take away from seeing you in that position?","NW: I hope that girls, especially black girls, realize that they have worth and they can do whatever they want to do. And they’re not restricted by the lines of poverty or racism, and they can amount to as much and more than I’ve amounted to. They can give speeches, they can become activists if they choose to identify that way. They can read books, they can empower other girls. They should know that they’re worth something. They’re not worthless and they can make a difference too.","I have a feeling that we’re going to see a lot of greatness from you ― we already have. But what do you hope to be and do when you grow up?","NW: When I grow up, I want to be a politician-slash-activist who runs my own business and is an entrepreneur who lives in my giant penthouse in New York City and/or Chicago and has a brown Siberian husky named Sheila. And I want to be executive editor and president of the New York Times ― the first black woman. Or the first Ethiopian woman.","Well, I would love to see you do all of those things.","JW: We’re laughing because she has a lot of options. If there’s already been the first black woman, she can be the first Ethiopian-American.","NW: First Ethiopian woman. And then on and on until we get to Ethiopian Jewish woman. And then I can be the first immigrant.","JW: [Laughs.] There’s a lot of adjectives she could use to be the first."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5acf5d8f1e0000fb077b14b8.jpeg?cache=wulKV96kPO&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"CRIME","headline":"Police Release Body Cam Video Of YouTube Shooter Nasim Aghdam","authors":"Mary Papenfuss","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/body-cam-youtube-shooter-nasim-aghdam_us_5ad12deae4b077c89ce8b013","short_description":"Asked if she wanted to hurt herself or anyone else just hours before shooting, she told California officers: \"No.\"","date":"2018-04-14"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Major Progressive Group Endorses Cynthia Nixon For New York Governor","authors":"Daniel Marans","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cynthia-nixon-working-families-party-endorsement_us_5ad25863e4b0edca2cba5c23","short_description":"The vote against New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo split the influential Working Families Party.","date":"2018-04-14"},"articleContent":["The New York Working Families Party, a major force in the state’s progressive politics, voted Saturday to endorse Cynthia Nixon in New York’s Democratic gubernatorial primary.","Nixon, an actress and longtime education activist, received 91.5 percent of the vote at a meeting of the party committee in Albany.","“I am indebted to you today and every day, because you are the heart and the soul of the progressive New York that we want to create ― a New York that belongs to all of us,” Nixon said in a speech accepting the endorsement.","The move is a blow to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo that sets the stage for one of the highest-stakes Democratic primaries since the 2016 contest between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Nixon’s left-wing challenge to Cuomo, which has thus far been considered a long shot, now has one of the most sought-after liberal endorsements in the state.","The New York Working Families Party, which labor unions and community groups formed two decades ago as a progressive faction within the Democratic Party, also voted to endorse New York City Councilman Jumaane Williams for lieutenant governor. Williams is challenging incumbent Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul (D).","Cuomo has sought to unite progressive groups and labor unions behind his bid for a third term. Three major unions backing Cuomo ― Service Employees International Union Local 32BJ, the Communications Workers of America District 1 and the Teamsters Joint Council 16 ― withdrew from the Working Families Party on Friday on the eve of the expected vote for Nixon.","Bill Lipton, director of the New York Working Families Party, claimed that the governor threatened to cut off contact with unions that back groups that have endorsed Nixon. Labor leaders at odds with the WFP have vehemently denied this version of events.","“There’s no truth to what Bill Lipton is saying ― this is nothing more than a diversionary tactic,” said Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union. “Labor is leaving the party we started because Bill Lipton is using it for his own personal agenda.”","Cuomo’s campaign dismissed the significance of the Working Families Party’s blessing of Nixon, given the withdrawal of several of the labor unions that helped found it.","“The governor stands with the unions who have left the WFP and no longer feel it represents the interests of middle- and working-class New Yorkers,” said Abby Fashouer, a Cuomo re-election campaign spokeswoman.","Nixon’s rise is the culmination of eight years of progressive anger brewing against Cuomo. In two four-year terms, Cuomo has at once established himself as a fiscal conservative cozy with wealthy donors, and a shrewd operator capable of co-opting progressive priorities when it becomes politically convenient for him to do so.","A major sticking point for progressives has been Cuomo’s willingness to reduce public spending and his reluctance to raise taxes, particularly at the start of his administration. In 2014, he boasted that “any Republican would be proud” of his fiscal stewardship.","Cuomo also did little to help Democrats regain control of the state Senate, enabling an arrangement that stopped ambitious liberal legislation without saddling him with the blame for its demise. He approved of a 2012 gerrymandering plan that protected the Senate’s GOP majority.","And in 2013, after Democrats narrowly won back a majority anyway, Cuomo reportedly gave his private blessing to a coalition between Senate Republicans and a breakaway Democratic caucus known as the Independent Democratic Conference. The alliance returned power to the GOP despite Democrats’ numerical majority.","Cuomo managed to fend off an intraparty revolt in 2014, when the Working Families Party was considering endorsing his primary challenger, law professor and anti-corruption advocate Zephyr Teachout. Cuomo assuaged the party by promising to shepherd the passage of a $15 minimum wage, the decriminalization of marijuana, public financing for state political campaigns, a state-level DREAM Act, new protections for women’s reproductive rights and climate change legislation. He also pledged to help win back the state Senate for Democrats.","Of those promises, Cuomo has only delivered on the vow to pass the $15 minimum wage (though the earliest the new minimum will go fully into effect statewide is 2021). The state Senate remains in Republican hands, recreational marijuana possession remains a criminal offense and the other legislative priorities have failed to come to fruition.","Cuomo and his allies point to a host of other policy achievements that he has presided over in his second term, including banning fracking, passing paid family leave and instituting free state college tuition for students from households earning up to $125,000 a year.","He has also tried to fashion himself a national leader in the liberal fight against President Donald Trump. With this end supposedly in mind, Cuomo brokered a deal that united the renegade IDC with the mainline state Senate Democratic caucus last week.","“The common enemy is defeating Trump and [Paul] Ryan and [Mitch] McConnell and defeating their agenda and taking over the New York state Senate so we can protect the state the way it needs to be protected,” he declared at a press conference announcing the agreement.","Left-leaning activists regard these moves, including the reunification of the Senate Democratic caucus, as concessions to their pressure that are nonetheless inadequate to tackle the state’s racial and economic inequality.","Since 2014, these critics have been spoiling for another opportunity to unseat Cuomo. But no elected officials have proven willing to risk being on the outs with the powerful chief executive in the event that their bid failed.","However, as an actress best known for her starring role in HBO’s “Sex and the City,” Nixon had little to lose by trying her hand against the governor.","At the same time, Nixon’s activism work makes her more than a mere celebrity candidate. For years, she has been a fixture of the protest movement pressuring Cuomo to provide more funding for public schools.","Nixon still faces steep odds in her bid against the famously deep-pocketed and popular Cuomo. Cuomo has over $30 million in his campaign war chest, nearly all of it raised from big donors in increments of more than $200.","A public poll in late March had Cuomo leading Nixon 66 to 19 percent.","The handful of Working Families Party members who spoke up against endorsing Nixon at Saturday’s meeting in Albany expressed their fears that her candidacy could inadvertently pave the way for a Republican governorship that would be far worse than the status quo.","They sought to avoid a situation where Nixon would remain on the Working Families Party ballot line even if she lost to Cuomo in the Democratic primary on Sept. 13. The result, they warned, could be a spoiler effect in which Nixon would take votes away from Cuomo after he emerged as the only viable contender in the general election.","In a bid to allay those concerns, Nixon told reporters after the endorsement that she would consult with the Working Families Party before deciding how to proceed after the primary.","To win in the primary, Nixon needs to erode Cuomo’s base of support in New York City and the surrounding suburbs where he swept Teachout in 2014. (Teachout’s strong showing upstate nonetheless handed her more than one-third of the vote with a fraction of Cuomo’s campaign funding.)","With fiery speeches against “corporate Democrats” and promises to legalize marijuana and pass state-level single-payer health care, Nixon is courting members of the Democratic base energized by Trump’s election and Sanders’ primary bid before that.","Nixon has also made addressing the specific needs of the state’s communities of color a key part of her pitch.","“Crushing inequality isn’t just something that happens,” Nixon said in her speech accepting the WFP endorsement on Saturday. “It’s an outcome that comes from a choice, a choice to slash taxes on the super-rich and corporations and slash services and opportunities on everybody else. It’s a choice to allow the schools that are attended by our students of color to be segregated, to be underfunded and to be over-policed.”","“This is the kind of choice we’re accustomed to seeing being made by Donald Trump,” she continued. ”But for the last eight years, it is a choice that we have seen made over and over and over again by our Democratic governor, Andrew Cuomo.”","This story has been updated throughout."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ad260411f0000260616d254.jpeg?cache=egAkoxcDnM&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Kentucky Gov.

She wrote that there was a “long and well-recognized” history of discrimination and systemic oppression against transgender people, that discrimination against transgender people was clearly “unrelated to their ability to perform and contribute to society,” that transgender people have immutable characteristics and that they lacked relative political power.","“Transgender people have long been forced to live in silence, or to come out and face the threat of overwhelming discrimination,” Pechman wrote.","“The Court also rules that, because transgender people have long been subjected to systemic oppression and forced to live in silence, they are a protected class. Therefore, any attempt to exclude them from military service will be looked at with the highest level of care, and will be subject to the Court’s ‘strict scrutiny.’ This means that before Defendants can implement the Ban, they must show that it was sincerely motivated by compelling interests, rather than by prejudice or stereotype, and that it is narrowly tailored to achieve those interests,” Pechman wrote.","While Trump had tweeted that he consulted generals and military experts about the ban, Pechman wrote that the government had “failed to identify even one General or military expert he consulted, despite having been ordered to do so repeatedly.”","Noting that Pentagon officials were surprised by the announcement and that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis got a heads up only one day beforehand, the judge wrote that she “is led to conclude that the Ban was devised by the President, and the President alone.”","Sharon McGowan, a former top official in the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division who now works as director of strategy for Lambda Legal, wrote that Pechman “cut through the nonsense,” recognizing that the plan announced by the military was just a dressed-up version of Trump’s original ban.","Read Pechman’s ruling below.","Ryan Reilly is HuffPost’s senior justice reporter, covering the Justice Department, federal law enforcement, criminal justice and legal affairs.

The group has started Bible studies in 43 state capitols, according to the BBC, and also holds meetings for members of the Senate and House.","The Cabinet Bible study group has several prominent members who go whenever they are able, according to the BBC, including Vice President Mike Pence, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and Attorney General Jeff Sessions.","A spokesperson for Capitol Ministries told HuffPost that Drollinger’s role as a Bible study teacher is to “help individual professing Christian legislators grow in their faith and knowledge of God’s Word and precepts, and to lead men who do not know Him to Christ.” The spokesperson emphasized that Drollinger was not appointed by anyone to teach these Bible studies ― rather, he established them.","During the meetings, Drollinger examines one verse of Scripture at a time, which means one book of the Bible could take more than a year to complete. The pastor has recently completed teaching his D.C. Bible study groups about the Sermon on the Mount, a set of moral teachings by Jesus that many Christians consider central to the faith.","In addition to these weekly Bible studies, Drollinger also posts supplemental topical studies on his website. These notes are distributed every week to members of the Cabinet, Senate and House, and to Trump, the spokesperson said. The supplemental topics are occasionally brought up during the in-person Bible studies.","In the BBC interview, Drollinger compared himself to a waiter who is tasked with serving God’s moral teachings to people.","“If God is the chef, then I’m just the servant, and I hope the guys like the meal,” he said. “But on the way out of the kitchen, I’m not going to alter what’s on the plate. So my job is just to be a servant.”","If people don’t like the message, he said, “you have to go talk to the chef [God]. Unless I’ve altered what’s on the plate ― which, hopefully in my discipline, I don’t.”","But although the pastor claims the lessons he’s dishing out come straight from God, there’s considerable debate within American Christianity about some of his conservative teachings.","American Christian denominations have varying opinions on whether women should be ordained as priests and if women should submit to men within a marriage. But Drollinger subscribes to a deeply conservative view of gender roles. While he believes women can be leaders in business and in politics, he doesn’t think women should be on equal footing with their husbands within a marriage or with men in the church.","“Those [prohibitions] are clear in scripture… it doesn’t mean, in an egalitarian sense, that a woman is of lesser importance. It’s just that they have different roles,” Drollinger told the BBC.","Drollinger also believes that homosexuality and same-sex marriages are “illegitimate in God’s eyes.” He laid out his case against marriage equality in an article on his website in January, writing, “Legalizing same-sex ceremonies in any state is a very, very serious matter in the eyes of God, and ... such ‘progressive thinking’ eventually evokes His wrath.”","Drollinger’s opinions about homosexuality and women’s roles may not diverge too far from views that the evangelical politicians closest to Trump already hold. Pence, who calls himself an evangelical Catholic, has said in the past that same-sex marriage is contrary to God’s will, claiming in 2006 that it would lead to the “deterioration of the family” and ultimately “societal collapse.” Sessions has made similar statements declaring that same-sex marriage erodes American culture and values.","And as a whole, most white evangelical Protestants still oppose same-sex marriage (59 percent), according to Pew Research Center data from 2017.","However, the share of white evangelicals who support same-sex marriage has grown in recent years ― from 27 percent in 2016 to 35 percent in 2017. This growth in support is driven in large part by younger white evangelicals.","Several mainline Protestant denominations, and even some evangelical pastors, have rejected theology that excludes queer people.","On his website, Drollinger opines that the work of “scripture-twisting clerics” who preach a more inclusive gospel is even more dangerous to the country than the “bullying of the LGBT lobby.”","“It is not the place of the state nor its populace to redefine what God has created. Such is arrogance of the highest order,” Drollinger wrote. “Man should not define God’s ways; God’s ways should define man’s.”","The pastor says he doesn’t tell members of his Bible studies how to vote.

She checks the road in both directions and scans for danger. Carefully, she makes her way down the street she called home until just three months ago.","Fernandez first arrived at Skid Row early one morning in July 2015, wearing nothing but a tank top, her underwear and ripped sneakers. She’d fled an abusive boyfriend who, she says, had threatened her with a knife and trapped her in a remote house for days. At 4:00 that July morning, she searched the line of colorful tents for Connie Revoiro. Fernandez had met Revoiro, who goes by the name “Mama Cuba,” on a scouting trip to the area three weeks before. Now Mama Cuba was her only hope.","“I searched from tent to tent to tent until I found her,” Fernandez said one day this past October. “It was awful. I didn’t come out of Mama Cuba’s tent for three or four days. I was terrified. Wherever she would go, I was there, because I was so scared.”","Nearly three years later, Fernandez is still frightened by Skid Row. She’s had her purse stolen more times than she can count. Once, a man yelling vulgar things followed her and grabbed her by the arm. She beat him with a wooden stick until he let go.","The number of homeless people in Los Angeles County went up more than 23 percent last year, according to the annual homeless count. Nearly 58,000 people were living on the street at the time of the count, about 4,500 of them in the Skid Row area ― a four-mile stretch of downtown Los Angeles often dubbed “the homeless capital of America.”","Women account for a third of people experiencing homelessness in L.A. As women like Graciela Fernandez and Mama Cuba navigate the challenges of living in a community where drug use, mental illness and assault are prevalent, they are particularly vulnerable to violence, predators and abuse. Amid a lack of shelter beds and resources to help them cope, loosely formed networks of women have banded together to fill the unmet needs. Some have found support in each other as they unite to survive and to demand solutions.","Skid Row is a meeting place for L.A.’s homeless community. Its streets are lined with tents, sleeping bags and suitcases and carts filled with prized possessions. Clusters of tents and makeshift structures have turned into quasi-separate neighborhoods, where people play cards, visit each other’s pets and barter for items like toilet paper and nail polish.","“The street is the street,” Mama Cuba said one day last fall, flashing a toothless, red-lipsticked grin. “It’s hard to live in the streets. There’s a lot of fights. Everything could be fine. It could be fine for a second, and all of the sudden everything jumps.”","Mama Cuba has many adopted Skid Row “daughters,” women like Fernandez who look to her for support in their darkest times. “If they’re hungry, they come to me. That’s why they call me Mama Cuba,” she said. “If there’s an extra blanket, not even extra, I give my own, I’m giving my last, I don’t really care.”","Yet Skid Row friendships can be difficult, complicated by mental illness, substance abuse and the daily struggle for survival. Today, Fernandez’s feelings for Mama Cuba swing between gratitude and betrayal. She knows how much Mama Cuba did to help her in her time of need, but she says Mama Cuba’s drug addiction and mental health problems have led her to steal from her multiple times ― a charge Mama Cuba vehemently denies.","Mental illness and substance abuse","Mental illness and drug addiction are major challenges in Skid Row that contribute to the vulnerable position of some of the women.","“Sexual assault and sexual harassment are everywhere,” said Angelia Harper, who goes by the name “Big Momma of Skid Row.”","After escaping homelessness herself, Harper has spent the last 20 years walking around the area by night in an effort to increase safety and help women get the resources they need, especially after an assault. More than 90 percent of the women in Skid Row have experienced physical or sexual violence in their lives, according to a 2016 assessment carried out by the Downtown Women’s Center, an L.A. nonprofit.","Compounding the problem, and the trauma, Big Momma explained, is that many perpetrators go free. “A lot of them are still looking at their abuser or the person that perpetrated the crime against them,” Big Momma said of the women she works with.","Some women fear reporting crimes to law enforcement because they believe they’ll risk retaliation. Others are hesitant to engage with police, for any number of reasons. Some are undocumented; some are on probation or parole; others struggle with substance abuse or have had negative experiences with law enforcement in the past. Even if a woman does report her assault and the perpetrator is arrested, it’s not uncommon for them to get released the same day.","Shelters aren’t always a safe haven","The longer women are homeless, the harder the climb back to stability becomes. But while many women are eager to escape the violence of the streets, their options are scarce. “There are no other avenues out,” Big Momma said.","There are a number of social services, shelters and nonprofit organizations in Skid Row, but the needs of the neighborhood’s population far outweigh the available resources.","There are only two overnight emergency shelters that serve single women in Skid Row, with 90 beds at the Midnight Mission and 350 beds at Union Rescue Mission. Both organizations have been providing shelter to the area’s homeless since the early 20th century, but it wasn’t until this past June that the Midnight Mission opened its doors to women who needed overnight housing. Before, the shelter only served homeless men.","Because space is limited, women who arrive at the shelters are first assessed by case managers. Their individual circumstances determine whether they get priority for a bed that night, how long they can stay and what other resources they are eligible for.","Big Momma is frustrated by the lack of shelter services available to women, particularly for victims of domestic violence and sexual assault. “Once a shelter is full, it’s full. There’s nothing else in place,” she said.","The current shelter system also fails single women for reasons that go beyond scale.","Through her experience helping trauma victims, Big Momma has learned that many of them, particularly those who have lost children, don’t feel comfortable staying in shelters designed for women and children. “They don’t want to be around these kids. They don’t want to have reminders that they were once this woman, that everything was great in their lives until this happened to them,” she said.","The emergency shelters that are available for single women aren’t necessarily safe or welcoming environments. In the DWC’s 2016 survey of women in certain L.A. neighborhoods, including Skid Row, nearly one-third of the women who slept in emergency shelters or transitional housing reported feeling unsafe. Women have complained about disrespectful staff, violent incidents and traumatic experiences.","Linda Sanders, a registered nurse, moved into Union Rescue Mission’s emergency shelter after her husband’s gambling addiction led him into crippling debt, which resulted in the loss of the couple’s home. She described a chaotic, unsanitary environment where she often felt unsafe.","“I’d say at least 80 percent [of the women at URM] have mental illnesses,” she said. “Some were previously incarcerated. Some are drug addicts. They’re very loud and they just wake up irate.”","Alexandra Monsibaez, URM’s public relations coordinator, said it can be challenging when so many women are living together in a confined space.","“We try our best to keep it as safe as possible for everyone,” Monsibaez said. “Sending women back out into the street if they are suffering from addiction or mental health issues can exacerbate those problems.”","According to DWC’s 2016 survey, 50 percent of homeless women in the area have mental health issues and 28 percent are recovering addicts.","“We’re doing the best that we can with the resources that we have, but we’re overwhelmed with the size of the problem,” URM chief executive Andy Bales said. “We have a policy of never turning away a woman in need, because there are sexual predators out on the streets.”","URM has an enclosed space where women who aren’t able to get a bed can spend the night on a mattress on the floor. The organization is working to construct a permanent dome-shaped structure that is expected to shelter 137 more women.","‘We need to get together’","The women in Skid Row need shelters that protect them, more access to affordable housing and a guarantee that their abusers won’t be free to retaliate against them. But until that happens, women band together in order to survive.","With the help of her new partner, Graciela Fernandez recently secured a studio apartment miles away from the noise and commotion of Skid Row. But Fernandez still returns every weekend to cook for her old neighbors in the area’s “Cuban Barrio.” “I can’t just forget them. These people were my family,” she said.","Fernandez and Mama Cuba have set aside their differences. “She did betray me, but she learned from that experience and how much it hurt me,” Fernandez said. “I love her to death. I’d never leave her behind.”","CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated the current number of beds at Union Rescue Mission.

Francis is also planning to meet personally with abuse victims and ask for their forgiveness.","The Vatican said on Thursday that Pope Francis’ letter to Chilean bishops effectively declared a “spiritual state of emergency” for the country’s Catholic Church. Vatican spokesman Greg Burke told The Associated Press that Francis is taking the situation seriously and assuring the victims that “Yes, we believe you, you have your place in the church.”","Tim Lennon, president of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP), told HuffPost that he is waiting for the pope to take concrete action, and not just offer expressions of “thoughts and prayers.”","“We hope this is a first step,” Lennon said about the pope’s letter. “Victims of sexual abuse need help and support, not just a show of concern.”","Francis has been dealing with the fallout from a rocky January trip to Chile, where he was caught on tape accusing Chilean abuse victims of slander. In follow-up interviews, Francis defended Bishop Juan Barros, whom victims say witnessed abuse by Chile’s most notorious pedophile priest, the Rev. Fernando Karadima.","The Vatican convicted Karadima of sexual abuse in 2011. But Barros has long enjoyed Francis’ favor ― the pope appointed him to lead the diocese of Osorno in 2015, ignoring the protestations of Chilean politicians and even some Catholic church leaders.","Francis’ actions this week are “long overdue but welcome” the research organization BishopAccountability, which tracks clergy sex abuse worldwide, said in a statement.","The pope’s tone seemed “strikingly different” from his previous approach toward the Chilean victims, Anne Barrett Doyle, the organization’s co-director, told HuffPost.","“It is clear that Pope Francis is trying to convey a change of heart,” Doyle wrote in an email. “While papal apologies in the abuse crisis are nothing new, this is the first time we can recall that a pope has conceded error in how he personally handled a situation of abuse.”","However, Doyle said that Francis’ claim that he lacked information about the allegations against Barros “beggars belief.”","Victims and other witnesses of Karadima’s crimes testified extensively during church, criminal and civil trials, Doyle said.","A committee from Chile’s bishops conference had recommended that Barros resign, according to the AP. The pope also received a letter from a victim in 2015 that outlined how Barros witnessed the abuse carried out by Karadima. It’s unclear whether the pope actually read that letter.","“Few abuse cases in the global Catholic church have generated as much information, testimony and documentation as the Karadima case,” Doyle wrote. “If Francis was misinformed or inadequately informed, it was because he chose to be so.”","On Thursday, Burke explained to the AP that the pope receives a lot of information from many sources. The pontiff has now read a 2,300-page dossier about the Barros case.","“Let’s just say it’s very clear now the pope has a complete picture of the situation,” the Vatican spokesman said.","For Lennon and other members of SNAP, true progress on this issue would mean a church-wide commitment to turning over all reports of abuse, both new and old, to local law enforcement for investigation.","Doyle said she hopes to see Barros removed from his post and to see the Vatican order an investigation into the Marist Brothers in Chile, a religious order that is also facing allegations of child sexual abuse. Another step would be the establishment of tribunals for judging and disciplining bishops and religious superiors who enable the sexual abuse of children.","“The cover-up by church officials, and the sexual assault of children and vulnerable adults by clergy, is a persistent and catastrophic situation,” Doyle said. “Only systemic reform of this magnitude will begin to resolve it.”","But creating any kind of change at the Vatican is a notoriously slow process. In 2014, Francis formed a commission on sex abuse to offer advice on how to protect children. Commission members sought to encourage changes that would hold bishops accountable for protecting predators and send a strong message that bishops were obligated to notify police when they discovered predator priests.","Two members of the commission, both abuse survivors, were frustrated by the slow pace of change and resigned. The commission’s mandate expired in December and it lapsed into an inactive state. Francis revived the commission this February amid growing criticism that the Vatican wasn’t doing enough to address clergy sexual abuse.","Marie Collins, an Irish victim of clerical abuse and former commission member, said she resigned due to the Vatican’s “unacceptable” resistance to change.","Collins told HuffPost the serious mistake that Francis referred to in his letter had caused Chilean survivors a “great deal of unnecessary hurt.”","“He took far too long to realize he was being misled by his clerical advisors,” Collins wrote in an email. “His first priority now must be to do everything possible to heal the hurt he has caused. He must also make those guilty of negligence or untruths accountable without delay.”","Need help?

They box out other competitors from running. And, in the case of conservative Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), they delicately put themselves forward to angle for something else.","Jordan said Friday morning that while “there is no speaker’s race right now,” if there was one, he’s been “urged by colleagues” to “consider” running and is “definitely open to that.”","Jordan, the first chairman of the meddlesome Freedom Caucus, almost certainly will never be Speaker of the House. The speaker needs 218 public votes on the floor, and it’s difficult to see Jordan ever getting there. But posturing now to throw his hat in the ring likely isn’t about winning that race. Instead, Jordan and other conservatives may be setting themselves up to stymie any other candidate and potentially make a deal for another position ― or, at least, get other concessions.","The dream scenario for conservatives is that in exchange for supporting a speaker they receive support for Jordan as majority leader. The two candidates would then run as a slate, potentially picking up the endorsement of President Donald Trump along the way, and pushing through both Republicans. While the speaker needs a majority of the whole House, the leader only needs a majority of Republicans behind closed doors, and conservatives believe Jordan could get there with the right pressure from the right people.","That demand might still be a little too ambitious, however, particularly if the Freedom Caucus only ends up holding a few dozen votes. The very fact that Jordan is now publicly putting himself out there suggests there isn’t yet any deal between Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) ― the natural heir to replace retiring Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) as speaker ― and the Freedom Caucus. And McCarthy may not be all that interested in a speakership where Jordan is the majority leader setting the floor agenda.","Either way, even if they don’t get their first ask, conservatives could still negotiate to get other demands, like proportional representation on more desired committees or procedural reforms. But ultimately their hand is only as strong as the number of votes they hold.","Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) did mention Friday that he was confident no one currently has the votes to become speaker. “So anybody who says, well, this person can’t be speaker, or that one, there is no one in this body who could be speaker other than Speaker Ryan,” Meadows said.","But conservatives aren’t the only ones banking on no one being able to get to 218 votes.","The whole strategy from Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) seems to be to wait and let McCarthy falter in his quest to get a majority of the House, at which point Scalise could ride in and save the GOP conference from itself ― a scenario that played out two and a half years ago when McCarthy dropped out of the speaker’s race and Ryan entered the fray.","That strategy has its own problems though, especially if McCarthy were to get within striking distance of the number. Scalise may believe the Freedom Caucus and his own loyalists can block McCarthy from getting the numbers, but Scalise is already getting backed into supporting McCarthy for speaker himself, and if the Freedom Caucus cut a deal with McCarthy for Jordan to take the leader spot, it’s not unimaginable that McCarthy and Jordan ― both of whom are close with Trump ― could get the president to pressure Ryan out sooner rather than later.","In that sense, the deal conservatives may be offering to McCarthy might be an enticing one. He could likely ascend to the speakership now and take his chances in November that Republicans hold the House.","Of course, if Republicans lose the House, which is a distinct possibility, McCarthy’s reign could be very short-lived, and Republicans would be setting themselves up for an even more ugly leadership race. But that’s just one of the risks involved in this ploy.","If everything goes the way Ryan has laid out ― where he remains speaker through the elections and until the end of this Congress ― Republicans will get to see if they retain control of the majority and whether they need to have a speaker race. But even then, Jordan’s gambit could pay off. Conservatives believe Republicans may want a more fiery minority leader if they lose the majority, and though Jordan would certainly have trouble winning that race, conservatives are interested in seeing the mood of the conference then.","Asked Friday whether Republicans may want a different person to be speaker than they would minority leader, Jordan said, “Who knows?”","Jordan did deny that his shadow candidacy may be about leverage. “That’s not the point, that’s not the focus, that’s not even a question that should be asked at this moment,” he said.","But it’s hard to believe Jordan when the Freedom Caucus has shown for years that they have a knack for these sorts of tactical situations.","When HuffPost asked Meadows Friday what he’d say to people who think Jordan’s candidacy is just about leverage for the Freedom Caucus, Meadows said those people would be thinking “there is a whole lot more strategy to members of Congress than what I’ve evidenced in the last six years.”","“How’s that?” he then asked, making sure his quote would suffice."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ad0de5a1e0000fb077b174b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"BUSINESS","headline":"In Los Angeles, Bitter Tensions Over Where To House The Homeless Rile Communities","authors":"Razzan Nakhlawi","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/housing-homeless-los-angeles_us_5ad0bf28e4b016a07e9bd831","short_description":"Voters approved a plan for supportive housing, but disputes over where to put it have stalled progress.","date":"2018-04-14"},"articleContent":["LOS ANGELES — Tony Rosado sits in the silent back room of El Mercado with a giant stack of papers piled in front of him on a sturdy wooden table. The papers are part of his appeals to stop the construction of Lorena Plaza, a 49-unit supportive housing complex that has been proposed for an empty parcel of land next to his market in this historically Latino neighborhood east of downtown.\n","“Why in Boyle Heights?” he asked. “I dare you to go try and build this in Beverly Hills. It would never get through.”","El Mercado, which Rosado took over after his father died in 2014, is a three-story restaurant and market packed with stalls of vendors, or puestos, selling cowboy boots, Communion dresses, religious paraphernalia, tubs of obscure moles and dried sweets. Boyle Heights is one of the most heavily Latino communities in the city, and El Mercado is its vibrant nerve center.","Lorena Plaza is one of the complexes that nonprofit developers have proposed to house the 58,000 people experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles. Voters approved a 2017 ballot measure calling for a $1.2 billion bond to fund permanent supportive housing for the chronically homeless. But where exactly that housing should go has proven a much more difficult question.","Boyle Heights is known citywide for its residents’ vigorous anti-gentrification efforts. They’ve fought to keep richer, whiter transplants from encroaching on their territory. In a sense, Rosado’s fight to keep housing for the homeless out of his neighborhood is part of the same struggle for agency.","Rosado says Lorena Street isn’t the right place for housing for the homeless. El Mercado gets busy on the weekends, and cars zoom down Lorena Street and into the parking lot. A Metro train line also runs nearby.","“To put a sensitive population so close to a busy cultural center and next to exposed railroad tracks?” Rosado said. “I don’t think that’s the right thing to do.”\n","The Rosado family has been fighting Lorena Plaza for years. They filed an environmental appeal with the city’s Planning and Land Use Management Committee in May 2017, citing uncapped oil wells on the property that could present a danger to residents if they leaked. The family found a sympathetic ear with Councilmember Jose Huizar, who approved their appeal in the committee and stalled construction until a full environmental review was conducted.","Housing developers and other critics claim such resistance pits communities against the will of citywide voters. In an open letter to Huizar during the appeal meetings, L.A.’s top nonprofit developers argued that the appeal “would deny Los Angeles voters the mandate and action they overwhelmingly supported.”","“We all care and we all want to eradicate homelessness,” said Janet Kim, a Los Feliz resident and member of a multi-neighborhood homelessness task force, SELAH Neighborhood Homeless Coalition, that includes residents from Silver Lake, Echo Park, Los Feliz, Atwater Village and Hollywood. The problem, she said, is “that people are on the fence about how we’re going to do that.”","This concern isn’t limited to Boyle Heights. Residents of Venice ― a wealthy, white oceanside neighborhood where companies like Snap Inc., Google, YouTube and Vice have mutated the community into a post-gentrification business district of sorts ― have also fought plans to build housing for the homeless.","Suburbanites in leafy, pleasant Temple City have successfully stalled the redevelopment of a motel that was planned for supportive housing. Property owners in Lincoln Heights are also rallying against a handful of housing proposals. “Five is too many,” reads the mission statement of the Coalition to Protect Lincoln Heights.","Still, Rosado thinks his situation in Boyle Heights is different from other conflicts around the city. Residents here feel their voices have been ignored, and say community outreach was inadequate for this kind of development.","A Community of Friends, the nonprofit developer seeking to build Lorena Plaza, seems surprised by the backlash. In the past 30 years, ACOF has built 42 supportive housing complexes in the city without much controversy.","“The word I would use to describe us was ‘stealth,’” said Dora Leong Gallo, ACOF’s director. “We built the buildings, we operated and moved people in, and nobody was the wiser. People ask if this is a brand-new thing, like we’ve never done it before. That’s not quite true.”","Gallo knows better than most the complexities of building units in a city historically constrained by rigid planning laws, and ACOF usually navigates the process well. But the Lorena Plaza development has been particularly difficult.","Gallo believes the Rosados’ environmental appeal was disingenuous. The opposition to Lorena Plaza stems from stereotypes of the homeless, she argued, pointing to the Rosados’ initial appeals. The late Pedro Rosado told a Metro Board hearing in 2013 that he was “very appalled how people are not mentioning that in this facility they are trying to bring mentally ill people to put our children at risk.”","Boyle Heights was already primed for a fight over development. Non-local artists have been opening new galleries here, like 356 Mission and BBQ LA, which attracted the ire of activist-residents. Last year, Weird Wave Brewers, a coffee shop owned by two white men and a Latino man (none of whom live in Boyle Heights), opened on Cesar Chavez Avenue, prompting concerns that the neighboring Arts District ― which is demographically wealthier, whiter and younger ― was trickling into the barrio.","Rosado argues that the city is taking advantage of the mostly Spanish-speaking, low-income residents of Boyle Heights, and that other neighborhoods would never have to fight so hard to keep out a proposal like this.","“They would lobby their representatives and then bombard their offices with calls,” he said. “They would pull all their financial support for their campaigns if their representatives were allowing these types of projects to get through.”","He suggested that people experiencing homelessness be housed on the outskirts of the city, “where it’s not the white-collar people that are affected or the blue-collar.”","On March 6, the L.A. City Council held a final vote on the Lorena Plaza environmental appeal. Dozens of supporters of the project, identified by fluorescent yellow stickers that said “Lorena Plaza, SUPPORTER,” packed the aisles of City Hall’s chambers. There did not appear to be any critics of the development present.","The Rosado family was not in attendance, but their lawyer read aloud a statement arguing that the city is responsible for investigating the environmental concerns thoroughly, and urging the council to pursue a new assessment.","ACOF’s Gallo also addressed the council, telling them her organization has “remained optimistic and steadfast in our belief that this is a good project at a good location, and reasonable people who care about the state of homelessness in Los Angeles can successfully negotiate a solution.”","Huizar, the councilmember, raised concerns about community involvement in the proposal.","“It’s not an issue of NIMBYism or against permanent supportive housing. It’s an issue about community process, building trust, no matter what you’re building ― whether it’s a retail center, permanent supportive housing, commercial,” he said. “Whatever it is, there needs to be trust between the applicant, the developer and the local community, and that’s what was lacking here.”","Yet Huizar recommended that his colleagues deny the appeal and allow ACOF to build Lorena Plaza. Then the council cast its vote: thirteen in favor of allowing the development to go forward, and zero opposed.","Gallo said she was pleased with the result, especially Huizar’s about-face. “It’s a pretty incredible feeling to have him change his mind, because it’s hard, and he does want what is best for his community, and I recognize that,” she said. Gallo expects to break ground in fall 2019, with a completion date toward the end of 2020.","Tony Rosado said he is “disappointed,” but isn’t backing down yet. “We’re going to continue fighting it,” he said. “We’re going to pursue our legal options.”","In a statement to HuffPost, Huizar said the developer has agreed to complete the necessary environmental review, and will ensure the soil is clean. He also emphasized the importance of community involvement as the city seeks housing solutions for people experiencing homelessness.","“As we unroll our efforts to construct permanent supportive housing throughout the City, we need to be completely honest with the public from the outset and throughout the approval processes,” he said. “That doesn’t mean everyone will be happy with every project, but unlike this process, at least we’ll all be clear about what is being proposed.”","On April 5, Rosado filed suit against the city of Los Angeles, alleging that environmental law had been broken. The writ, submitted by Rosado’s lawyers, asks for the city’s decision to be vacated in lieu of a full environmental review.

The union announced it would support teachers whether they continued to stay off the job or headed back to their classrooms, signaling that most schools would soon reopen.","“We recognize that our formal efforts to lobby elected leaders have achieved all that we will be able to accomplish this legislative session,” the union’s president, Alicia Priest, said in a statement.","The walkout had shut down most schools across the state, with teachers calling for more education funding after years of deep cuts. Despite making headway with lawmakers early on, the union was unable to convince the GOP-dominated legislature to pass the tax hikes needed to raise the revenue teachers wanted.","Although lawmakers agreed to expand gambling in the state and tax more online sales, Republicans did not take up a vote on repealing a capital gains tax break, as the union had demanded. They also voted to repeal a tax on hotel and motel stays that was part of an education funding bill passed shortly before the walkout, creating a shortfall that the union said must be filled.","The union was probably wary of continuing a formal walkout for much longer if progress at the Capitol was stalled. School districts had already burned through their snow days and would have to make up any additional time schools were closed. It’s possible public support for the teachers would start to wane the longer kids were at home.","Teachers won average raises of roughly $6,000, but they did so through legislation passed before they began their walkout. Many of them said the raises were secondary to increasing general school funding, as the state faces a severe teacher shortage and schools lack basic supplies and modern textbooks.","Many teachers hopped on to the union’s Facebook page on Thursday to say they were unhappy with the decision to wind down the walkout.","“We came to get additional funding for schools, and that’s been the narrative for teachers the whole time,” Beth Wallis, a teacher in the Tulsa suburbs, told HuffPost. “In my opinion, we haven’t gotten what we came here for. We can’t call it a success just yet.”","Oklahoma is one of a handful of red states where teachers have recently walked off the job to protest education cuts. West Virginia teachers went on strike in late February and early March, eventually winning raises of 5 percent, while Kentucky teachers have taken part in walkouts after lawmakers moved to cut pensions. Teachers in Arizona also say they will go on strike if the state doesn’t grant significant raises and restore school funding to pre-recession levels."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5acbd20a1f0000280616cb59.jpeg?cache=5Mw1mzdP5Z&ops=crop_48_365_3924_2299%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"WORLD NEWS","headline":"Father Seeking Justice For Teen’s Alleged Rape At Hands Of Indian Lawmaker Dies In Custody","authors":"Dominique Mosbergen","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/unnao-rape-kuldeep-singh-sengar_us_5acfb333e4b0edca2cb7dd38","short_description":"The case has provoked nationwide outrage in India, where police have been accused of covering up the assault of a girl.","date":"2018-04-13"},"articleContent":["In a grim development to a sexual assault case involving a state lawmaker in India, the alleged victim’s father died in police custody on Monday after sustaining injuries that his family said were from retaliatory beatings ordered by the lawmaker and his supporters.","Kuldeep Singh Sengar, a member of the legislative assembly in the state of Uttar Pradesh, has been accused of raping the man’s teenage daughter. Sengar has been defiant in his denial of the alleged assault, which reportedly took place last summer in the city of Unnao and had been largely ignored by the public and media until last weekend, when the alleged victim attempted to burn herself to death near the residence of the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh.","The self-immolation was in protest of what the teenager said was indifference and inaction by politicians and law enforcement officials who’d failed to pursue ― and, in some cases, even abetted ― the man she said raped her.","A day after her attempted suicide, the girl’s father, identified by local news outlets as 55-year-old Pappu Singh, died while in police custody. His family, who The Guardian reported had tried “for months” to get police to investigate the rape allegations against Sengar, said Pappu Singh was attacked by the lawmaker and a group of men, including Sengar’s brother, last Tuesday after they “barged” into the family’s home.","The men also molested two young girls in the home, the family said.","Sengar, a member of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, was charged with rape, criminal intimidation and abduction of a minor on Thursday, reported The Hindustan Times. The Central Bureau of Investigation, India’s top investigative body, is now investigating the charges against the lawmaker.","Sengar told reporters this week that the charges are part of a “conspiracy” being leveled against him by “low-status people.”","On Thursday, Sengar told the Times of India that the teen had been “tutored to build rape case against me.”","Sengar’s alleged victim told reporters this week that police officers had been there when her father was beaten “but did nothing.”","“[They] took him to the police station and put him in jail,” the teen said. “They did not take him to hospital ― maybe if they had, he could have been saved.”","The girl said her father was beaten again while in prison. According to NDTV, a postmortem report showed the man had multiple wounds and bruises on his body. The report said he died of “shock and septicemia.”","Six police officers have reportedly been suspended, and a number of other men, including Sengar’s brother, Atul Singh Sengar, have been arrested in connection with the man’s death.","Pappu Singh’s family has called for justice this week, and people across India have reacted with fury to what has been described as a cover-up by law enforcement officials of Sengar’s alleged crime and a failure of the state to protect the teenager and her family.","“The police facilitated the beating to death of the father of the girl,” Vrindra Grover, an Indian supreme court lawyer who specializes in sexual assault cases, told Al Jazeera. “If the police is going to not act according to the law but at the behest of the accused, then there can be no hope for justice. Today law and justice are a mirage that we are offering the women of this country.”","“The state is supposed to protect the people. This lawmaker is shamelessly flaunting his power by saying that he has the blessings of the entire state government,” Grover added.","On Thursday night, Rahul Gandhi, head of the opposing Congress party, led a candlelight vigil in New Delhi to call for justice for sexual assault victims, including the teenager in Unnao and an 8-year-old girl who was raped and murdered in January.","“This is not a political protest, this is a national matter.

He is innocent, and he and his family have suffered for years because of his wrongful conviction,” the former vice president said.","ABC News and The Washington Post both reported this week that Trump had been considering the pardon for a few months, but there was no clear timeline for when it might happen.\n\nThe chief prosecutor in Libby’s case, Patrick Fitzgerald, also happens to be friends with former FBI Director James Comey. The pardon comes as Trump has been railing against Comey as a “liar” and a “leaker” for writing about his interactions with the president in his new memoir.","Libby was charged in 2005 with lying to the FBI, perjury and obstruction of justice following an investigation into who leaked the identity of Valerie Plame, a covert CIA operative at the time, to various journalists. Libby, according to prosecutors, lied about where he learned of her identity and what he discussed with reporters.","He pleaded not guilty but resigned from his position and was disbarred until 2016. He was also sentenced in 2007 to 30 months in prison and fined $250,000 for his role in the leak case.\n\nPresident George W. Bush refused to grant a pardon to Libby, despite Cheney pushing for it, although the former president did commute Libby’s 30-month prison sentence.\n\nFormer Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage eventually admitted in 2006 that he was the one who inadvertently revealed Plame’s identity.\n\nPlame released the following statement on Libby’s pardon:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has granted a pardon to I. Lewis “Scooter” Libby on the basis that he was “treated unfairly”. That is simply false. Libby was convicted of obstruction of justice and perjury in a fair trial. President George W. Bush closely reviewed the facts in the case at the behest of Vice President Dick Cheney, who urged a pardon. Both the President and the Vice President willingly testified themselves. President Bush declined to issue a pardon, stating “I respect the jury’s verdict.” He added, “And if a person does not tell the truth, particularly if he serves in government and holds the public trust, he must be held accountable.” President’s Trump’s pardon is not based on the truth.","Trump’s most controversial pardon to date was that of former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio last August. Arpaio had been convicted of criminal contempt for violating a federal judge’s order to stop detaining individuals the sheriff believed were in the country illegally. Arpaio had a long history of discrimination and unlawful policing toward Hispanics.

In the book, Comey writes that he’s replayed the way he handled the Clinton email investigation in his mind “hundreds of times” and that he understands Democrats were “baffled” and “outraged” at the actions he took.","Comey details the decision he made in the final days of the 2016 campaign to send a letter informing Congress that the FBI was examining newly discovered emails ― found on former Rep. Anthony Weiner’s laptop ― that may have been relevant to the Clinton email investigation that had been closed months earlier.","The letter to Congress made its way to the media “in about ten minutes, which in Washington was about nine minutes later than I expected,” Comey writes. His world, he says, “caught back on fire.”","Comey concedes that, unconsciously, the near-universal consensus at that point that Clinton would roundly defeat Trump could have affected his decision-making:","I was surprised when Donald Trump was elected president. I had assumed from media polling that Hillary Clinton was going to win. I have asked myself many times since if I was influenced by that assumption. I don’t know. Certainly not consciously, but I would be a fool to say it couldn’t have had an impact on me. It is entirely possible that, because I was making decisions in an environment where Hillary Clinton was sure to be the next president, my concern about making her an illegitimate president by concealing the restarted investigation bore greater weight than it would have if the election appeared closer or if Donald Trump were ahead in all polls. But I don’t know.","Debates within the FBI about the decision, Comey writes, “kept coming back to the same place: the credibility of the institutions of justice was at stake.”","He writes:","Assuming, as nearly everyone did, that Hillary Clinton would be elected president of the United States in less than two weeks, what would happen to the FBI, the Justice Department, or her own presidency if it later was revealed, after the fact, that she was still a subject of an FBI investigation? What if, after the election, we actually found information that demonstrated prosecutable criminal activity? No matter what we found, that act of concealment would be catastrophic to the integrity of the FBI and the Department of Justice.","Comey writes that he was also concerned there could be leaks out of the FBI’s New York field office, although he said he didn’t base his decision on the prospect of the news leaking out. He writes that former Attorney General Loretta Lynch also suggested the news might have leaked out before the election anyway if Comey hadn’t sent his letter.","His wife had wanted Clinton to be the first woman president, Comey writes, and he’s still haunted by the notion that decisions in the final days of the election could have swayed things.","“I hope very much that what we did ― what I did ― wasn’t a deciding factor in the election. I say that with a wife and daughters who voted for Hillary Clinton and walked in the 2017 Women’s March in D.C. the day after Donald Trump’s inauguration,” Comey writes.","Comey’s wife, he said, understood what he did, but “resented the fact that I had to stand out front and take another hit.” She said it was like he was “stepping in front of the institution to get shot.”","The former FBI director writes that he’s “sorry that I couldn’t do a better job explaining to her and her supporters why I made the decisions I made.”","Comey did get some private support from Democrats. He writes that Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) tearfully told Comey he knew he was “in an impossible position.”","But Lynch, Comey says, didn’t offer any direct endorsement of his decision during a meeting right before the election, on Oct. 31. Comey describes an awkward hug between himself and Lynch, who is roughly 18 inches shorter than he is, in great detail.","“When our bodies came together, her face went into my solar plexus as she wrapped her arms around me. I reached down and pressed both forearms, also awkwardly, against her back,” he writes.","Lynch, Comey says, didn’t tell Comey he’d done the right thing or thank him for taking the heat. And when the meeting ended, Lynch told him to “try to look beat up.”","“She had told somebody she was going to chew me out for what I had done. What a world,” he writes.","Ultimately, Comey says that he wouldn’t have done things differently, even with what he knows now, but that he “can imagine good and principled people in my shoes making different choices about some things.” He thinks “different choices would have resulted in greater damage to our country’s institutions of justice, but I’m not certain of that. I pray no future FBI director is forced to find out.”","Comey also recounts meeting with Obama in the Oval Office in late November, after Trump was elected. He says when the meeting broke up, Obama asked him to stay behind.","“I picked you to be FBI director because of your integrity and your ability,” Comey says Obama told him. “I want you to know that nothing ― nothing ― has happened in the last year to change my view.”","Comey said those were the words he “needed to hear” and that even though Obama wasn’t necessarily saying he agreed with Comey’s decisions, he was indicating he knew where they came from. Comey said hearing Obama’s words brought on “a wave of emotion” and left Comey almost on the verge of tears.","“That means a lot to me, Mr. President,” Comey says he told Obama. “I have hated the last year. The last thing we want is to be involved in an election. I’m just trying to do the right thing.”","Comey writes that while he didn’t support Obama when he first ran, by November 2016 Comey had “developed great respect for him as a leader and a person” and realized at that moment the “full weight of his imminent departure” and what that meant.","“Mr. President, my wife would kill me if I didn’t take the opportunity to thank you and to tell you how much I’m going to miss you,” Comey says he told Obama. “I dread the next four years, but in some ways, I feel more pressure to stay now.”","Comey says Obama didn’t respond. “Instead he patted me on the arm, then we rose and shook hands, and I walked out of the Oval Office,” Comey writes. “Soon that same office would have a new and very different occupant.”","Ryan Reilly is HuffPost’s senior justice reporter, covering the Justice Department, federal law enforcement, criminal justice and legal affairs.

The mega-project inaugurated a new industrial era in the United States that transformed the nature not just of work and life, but also of time and space.","Soon a new phrase would be used to describe the locations of workplaces, people, goods and entire cities. They were either “on-line” or “off-line,” the line being the railway itself. Either you were connected (or traveling on that connecting line) or you weren’t. This distinction had consequences.","Online, which lost its hyphen sometime before AOL launched, now refers to our connection to the internet and its millions of active websites. Our phones are almost always connected to the internet, but we tend to consider ourselves online when we are actively engaging on a website, usually some kind of social media platform.","The problem of Facebook, the most popular such platform in the U.S., is in part a problem of metaphors. This much was made clear during Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s hearings on the Hill earlier this week. Lawmakers seemed to operate from very different conceptions of the social media giant. Is Facebook a publisher? wondered Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska). Is Facebook a “self-regulated superstructure for political discourse”? mused Rep. John Sarbanes (D-Md.). “If I buy a Ford and it doesn’t work well and I don’t like it, I can buy a Chevy,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) in a line of inquiry that went to the heart of the Facebook question. “If I’m upset with Facebook, what’s the equivalent product that I can go sign up for?”","Last fall, New York Magazine’s Max Read listed various proposed comparisons for Facebook that he’d come across: “a state, the E.U., the Catholic Church, Star Trek’s United Federation of Planets.” More metaphors have bloomed in the aftermath of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Facebook is like a record company. Facebook is like a fashion designer.","How can we begin to work on the question of what to do with Facebook if we can’t even agree on what Facebook looks like?","But perhaps the answer is as plain as the ground beneath Facebook’s sixth U.S. data center, which is currently under construction just outside Omaha. The center will open in 2023, exactly 150 years after the transcontinental railroad was completed nearby.","Maybe history has handed us the right metaphor: Facebook is like the railroads.","In a sense, it’s hardly a metaphor at all. The internet and the railroads share the same physical space, as Ingrid Burrington explained in an article for The Atlantic in 2015 and David A. Banks explored in a scholarly journal article published the same year. Railroad right-of-ways have been used by every communication medium from telegraph wires to telephone lines to fiber optic cables. Now, digital platform corporations build their data centers on these same lines.","The late Sen. Ted Stevens was right: The internet is best thought of as “a series of tubes” (not “a big truck”). Just like the railroads before them, platform companies like Facebook and Google are pieces of infrastructure, albeit a new type of infrastructure. They connect people and transform society, politics, the nature of time and space itself. And like the railroads and phone companies before them, they can be regulated or broken up ― whether they provide a physical service or not.","This is important to acknowledge now as discussions about regulation move forward in Washington following the revelations about Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm that harvested data from approximately 87 million Facebook users. Facebook, like Google, like Amazon, is a thing, or more precisely a concatenation of things. These digital platforms are not unearthly beasts that exist apart from the real world. They are real-world entities that possess corporeal form. What their owners do with them and what their users do on them are real actions that have real consequences. Just look at the past four years if you have any doubts.","Notions that the internet is separate from real life have existed since the dawn of the web. While comedians like Dave Chappelle mine this sentiment for jokes, the real beneficiaries of this idea are the corporate executives who run the giant online platforms currently eluding regulation. If people believe that online life is distinct from what we now call real life, that digital capitalism is somehow less real than the industrial capitalism on which it is quite literally founded, then the impression will settle in that online companies can’t be regulated in the way offline companies are regulated. How can you write an agency rule about a phantom? How can you pass a bill about a cloud?","Yet it’s quite clear that what happens online matters in offline life. Nearly 80 percent of Americans have a Facebook account. Political campaigns are spending an increasing amount on digital advertising. Social movements, including neo-Nazis, are organized on digital platforms. Those platforms have also become the best distribution tool for disinformation and propaganda, as they favor individual emotional expression over reasoned discussion. People have funerals for their online friends in massive multiplayer online game universes. And, of course, the president of the United States occasionally threatens nuclear holocaust on Twitter.","Much of this activity, however, doesn’t need to be regulated. Americans can still vote out their president in the next election if they don’t like his rage tweets about cable news stories. Congress doesn’t need to regulate anyone’s speech.","But Congress could regulate the business side of the digital platform economy. Or force the platform giants to shrink to a size at which no individual platform could alter society with the tweak of an algorithm. That’s being debated in policy circles right now and could soon be debated by congressional lawmakers.","Therein lies the value of the railroad metaphor. It zeroes in on the thingness of Facebook, sidestepping the free speech issues that so consumed many of the politicians questioning Zuckerberg in the capital this week. Congress can intervene for the same reason it intervened to regulate the railroads more than a century ago: Power over infrastructure is political power.","Railroads were the engine of 19th-century industrial capitalism, and as they became economic monopolies, their market power translated into political power. Controlling the lines that people and business rode on, railroads could pick winners and losers by setting rates to benefit friends or cripple individual businesses. John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil monopoly colluded with the railroads to privilege his product over others. Railroad companies worked to take over the political apparatus of state governments and the national government by handing out free rail passes to their preferred political party, installing railroad allies in office, shortchanging states by evading taxes and, of course, directly trading stocks, gifts and cash for public goods.","The concentrated private political influence of monopoly violated the long-standing American democratic spirit of one man-one vote. As corporations built nationwide networks of infrastructure that held power over governments, monopoly mattered even more. This is what the muckraking journalist Henry D. Lloyd wrote in 1881, when he argued that the “railroad problem ... may indicate whether the American democracy, like all the democratic experiments which have preceded it, is to become extinct because the people had not wit enough or virtue enough to make the common good supreme.”","That “railroad problem” was that the railroads themselves were captive to an even bigger monster, Standard Oil, which used its massive market position to crush competitors by forcing the railroads to raise rates on other oil producers. This then altered the economic and political life of states subject to Standard Oil’s decision.","Congress began to take action against the “railroad problem” in 1890 when it enacted the landmark Sherman Antitrust Act. The law’s author, Sen. John Sherman (R-Ohio), decried the power of monopolistic railroads on the floor of Congress. “If we will not endure a king as a political power,” he said, “we should not endure a king over the production, transportation, and sale of any of the necessaries of life.” It was clear to Sherman that economic power was political power. His law was later used to break up Standard Oil under the administration of President Teddy Roosevelt.","Today, digital platform behemoths like Facebook and Google are the major private designers of American life. They make decisions that affect the flow of information and pick political winners and losers with little democratic input. News organizations find themselves at the whim of algorithms determined by digital platforms, the campaigns of future lawmakers who would oversee digital platforms are dependent upon them to reach voters, and meanwhile, those platforms spend tens of millions of dollars on lobbying and campaign contributions to influence politics to their benefit.","Once again, this is market power translating to political power. Some lawmakers see this clearly, as evidenced by their questioning of Zuckerberg.","“Do you think you have a moral responsibility to run a platform that protects our democracy?” Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.) asked.","Rep. Bill Flores (R-Texas) stated outright that Facebook operates as a monopoly just like Standard Oil and Ma Bell, the nickname for the telephone giant that began as Bell Telephone and ended as AT&T. Those corporations either colluded with and abused infrastructure monopolies to their benefit (Standard Oil) or were infrastructure monopolies themselves (Ma Bell).","“These companies were started by entrepreneurs and their companies grew and eventually became detached from everyday Americans,” Flores said. “And then what happens is policymakers had to step in and re-establish the balance between those folks and everyday Americans.”","The congressman then veered into aggrieved irrelevancies about a constituent whose “conservative postings” were supposedly being “banned or stopped,” but for a moment Flores had been saying something useful and insightful. He was talking straightforwardly about Facebook as a thing, a thing with power that needed to be handled as such. “I mean,” he said, “we’ve seen it before.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ad0fc2f1e00008e0b7b1784.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"'Roseanne' Promo Trumpets Johnny Galecki's Return Next Week","authors":"Ron Dicker","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/johnny-galecki-roseanne-return_us_5ad0c312e4b077c89ce80402","short_description":"His character has some explaining to do in an awkward homecoming.","date":"2018-04-13"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Trump Lawyer Arranged Payoff To Playboy Playmate For Republican Fundraiser","authors":"Karen Freifeld, Reuters","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/elliott-broidy-playmate_us_5ad0ed7de4b0edca2cb980b6","short_description":"Michael Cohen handled the matter on behalf of Elliott Broidy.","date":"2018-04-13"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"BLACK VOICES","headline":"Cal Poly President Says Frat Member In Blackface Likely Won't Be Expelled","authors":"Sara Boboltz","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cal-poly-blackface-no-expulsion_us_5ad0e41ee4b0edca2cb9751d","short_description":"The student said he was not aware of the racist history of blackface in an apology letter.","date":"2018-04-13"},"articleContent":["The California Polytechnic State University chapter of fraternity Lambda Chi Alpha outraged many on campus last weekend after a photo from one of its events circulated showing a frat member in blackface.","But the student in question, Kyler Watkins, a senior studying agricultural business, will likely not be expelled, university president Jeffrey Armstrong told the San Luis Obispo Tribune on Thursday.","“That’s very, very likely protected by free speech, and freedom of expression,” Armstrong told the outlet. “If a student walks around on campus with their face painted black, they can do that.”","In an apology letter published Friday afternoon by Mustang News, a local outlet, Watkins said he hoped the campus community believed that his “ill-informed” decision “had nothing whatsoever to do with racism or discrimination” because he did not know what blackface was.","“When I woke up Sunday morning to learn that ‘blackface’ is of historical racial significance, no words can express my regret and horror,” he wrote.","Lambda Chi Alpha apologized in a statement on Sunday, saying the frat held a competition that grouped members into teams represented by different colors. One team chose black, and “that is why the person’s face was colored,” the fraternity’s president, Logan Boersma, told Mustang News.","“In my own mind, I was simply ‘going all out’ in my theme as a member of the black team,” Watkins said, adding that he has received death threats.

President Riley Nilsen, who leads a student government group, made controversial comments at the meeting that elicited immediate calls for her resignation.","“I cannot believe that the members of Lambda Chi Alpha did not tell their brother to go wash his face off when they walked into that party,” Nilsen said. “I 100 percent know the privilege that I’ve been given, because I don’t have to wash my face off, and I know that I am given a privilege to make a difference.”","(Nilsen wrote a very lengthy apology on Facebook Wednesday, acknowledging that her remarks “weren’t sensitive.”)","By Monday evening, a group of students, including many students of color, had gathered outside the Lambda Chi Alpha house to confront members of the fraternity, and some people led chants. Police eventually arrived to intervene.","Both Cal Poly and Lambda Chi Alpha’s national headquarters put the local frat on interim suspension, pending the results of separate investigations, the San Luis Obispo Tribune reported.","Armstrong hosted another town hall meeting on Thursday night that drew a crowd of nearly 1,000 people, according to the Tribune. Students there asked questions about diversity and racism on campus for more than 90 minutes.","By the week’s end, all fraternities on campus had voluntarily placed themselves on probation and suspended some activities.","Hundreds of students turned out for a protest on Friday morning, local NBC affiliate KSBY reported, noting that some were calling on Armstrong to resign.

His future in the U.S. is now uncertain.","date":"2018-04-13"},"articleContent":["Ahmed Abdelbasit, a New Jersey teacher who faces a death sentence in Egypt for his pro-democracy activism, was detained last week outside his Jersey City apartment by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Three days later, a notice came in the mail saying his asylum case had been transferred to an immigration court.","On that Thursday morning, seven plainclothes ICE officers demanded that Abdelbasit get into an unmarked car. Confused, the physics teacher complied, all while frantically texting his friends and co-workers to let them know he would not be in class that day at a private Islamic school in Union City.","HuffPost has learned that Abdelbasit, 33, was taken to a detention center in Elizabeth, New Jersey, where he was forced to turn over his belongings and was given an orange jumpsuit to wear. Abdelbasit has been held there ever since.","ICE confirmed to HuffPost that he is being held at Elizabeth Detention Center on administrative immigration violations. ICE would not elaborate on what those violations were.","It was only after Abdelbasit was detained did his lawyer learn that his asylum case was transferred to immigration court in a notice that arrived three days after Abdelbasit’s arrest, HuffPost has learned, leaving the teacher and his lawyer with more questions than answers.","“It’s not clear why they would feel the need to detain somebody who has no criminal record in the United States, who has been living a very law-abiding life here and has been doing everything correctly,” Anwen Hughes, Abdelbasit’s lawyer and the deputy legal director at Human Rights First, told HuffPost. “It’s very unclear why this happened. What we’re trying to find out at the moment is what the actual basis is for this.”","When Abdelbasit didn’t show up to school that day, his students were immediately worried. He was not one to take days off.","Mariam Siam and Yusef Haddabah are both students in Abdelbasit’s physics class at Rising Star Academy. They spoke at length about their teacher’s kindness, often staying late to help them with classwork. Since the school did not have the funds for lab equipment, Abdelbasit appealed to local colleges to teach his students at their facilities. He was always going above and beyond, Siam and Haddabah said.","The moment they found out what happened, they sprang into action. Both students visited Abdelbasit at the detention center. They were concerned about his well-being, and they say they noticed that Abdelbasit had lost weight and were afraid for his physical and emotional health.","Instead, all Abdelbasit wanted to talk about was how his students were doing in physics with their substitute teacher.","“I was expecting a completely different him after what he’s going through, like an emotional person. When we started talking, his strength, it didn’t fail to amaze me. He was cracking jokes,” Haddabah told HuffPost on the phone. “One of the first things that he asked me before I got to ask him how he was doing was who was taking over the physics class and if we liked the teacher.”","Siam and Haddabah, along with other students, launched an online petition and a social media campaign for their teacher’s release. The pair launched a website, called local politicians, tweeted action plans and urged others to do the same.","“We are trying our best to do whatever we can do within our hands to help and support him,” Siam told HuffPost. “He is our drive to do what we are doing right now and be student activists and fight for him.”","Haddabah agreed. “I look at him as my role model. There are traits and different things about his personality that he holds, I only dream to hold in my future.”","Abdelbasit was a doctoral student, physics professor and activist at Cairo University, where he helped organize peaceful protests against the military’s removal of Egypt’s first freely elected president, Mohammed Morsi, in July 2013.","His activism, online and on the ground, did not go unnoticed. The university investigated Abdelbasit’s activism and expelled him in June 2014. His expulsion was widely criticized by various Egyptian media outlets and human rights organizations for violating his right to a fair hearing. Soon after, Abdelbasit left Egypt to find security and employment elsewhere. Initially he landed a teaching position at Qatar University.","Back in Egypt, the political crackdown and human rights abuses intensified. Abdelbasit was sentenced to death in absentia by a military court in May 2016.","In an interview with HuffPost, Human Rights Watch called the military sentence “completely baseless,” noting that the evidence was “almost non-existent.”","“It is very alarming to see the U.S. administration willing or trying to remove and deport an asylum seeker who might face imminent execution upon return to his country, and perhaps even torture or other things before execution,” Amr Magdi, a researcher at HRW’s Middle East and North Africa division, told HuffPost. “We call on authorities to release him and give him full judicial recourse, and the opportunity to appeal and object to his case.”\n","Following the sentence, a decision Abdelbasit could not appeal, he immediately sought refuge in the United States, where he hoped he was safe.","He arrived in June 2016 on a visitor visa and applied for asylum two months later Newark. He was given permission to work legally while his case was being processed.","Abdelbasit’s visitor visa eventually expired, but he was allowed to continue to work with a pending asylum application. He was interviewed in April 2017 by the asylum office and was told the final decision would arrive in the mail.","Less than two years after arriving, the teacher had just begun to find stability in the United States and had been welcomed into a large Arab and Muslim community in New Jersey.","Now ICE has classified Abdelbasit as “deportable from the United States,” according to Hughes. It is unclear why, since the Egyptian immigrant has fulfilled all his application requirements and interviews, as well as repeatedly checking in with immigration officials since his initial arrival, his lawyer said.","ICE has ramped up its deportation efforts under President Donald Trump, increasingly deporting civilians with no criminal records, including business owners, mothers and Army veterans. During Trump’s first year in office, in which he signed an executive order that granted ICE immense authority to arrest undocumented immigrants, the U.S. saw a 171% increase of non-criminal individuals arrested in 2017 compared with 2016.","“ICE has been detaining a lot more people from within the United States,” Hughes said, “including people who have been here for a fairly significant amount of time and in some cases a very significant time, than was the case two years ago. That’s definitely a pattern, and it’s been affecting what’s actually a fairly diverse collection of people.”","“Sometimes it happens in ways that are fairly random,” she said. “This obviously wasn’t.

Far be it from me to disagree with the esteemed Bishop of Hippo, but his crisply formulated aphorism just might require a bit of updating.","I’m not a saint or even a bishop, merely an interested observer of this nation’s ongoing military misadventures early in the third millennium A.D. From my vantage point, I might suggest the following amendment to Augustine’s dictum: Any war failing to yield peace is purposeless and, if purposeless, both wrong and stupid.","War is evil. Large-scale, state-sanctioned violence is justified only when all other means of achieving genuinely essential objectives have been exhausted or are otherwise unavailable. A nation should go to war only when it has to ― and even then, ending the conflict as expeditiously as possible should be an imperative.","Some might take issue with these propositions, President Trump’s latest national security adviser doubtless among them. Yet most observers ― even, I’m guessing, most high-ranking U.S. military officers ― would endorse them. How is it then that peace has essentially vanished as a U.S. policy objective? Why has war joined death and taxes in that select category of things that Americans have come to accept as unavoidable?","The United States has taken Thucydides’s famed Melian Dialogue and turned it inside out. Centuries before Augustine, the great Athenian historian wrote, “The strong do what they will, while the weak suffer what they must.” Strength confers choice; weakness restricts it. That’s the way the world works, so at least Thucydides believed. Yet the inverted Melian Dialogue that prevails in present-day Washington seemingly goes like this: strength imposes obligations and limits choice. In other words, we gotta keep doing what we’ve been doing, no matter what.","Making such a situation all the more puzzling is the might and majesty of America’s armed forces. By common consent, the United States today has the world’s best military. By some estimates, it may be the best in recorded history. It’s certainly the most expensive and hardest working on the planet.","Yet in the post-Cold War era when the relative strength of U.S. forces reached its zenith, our well-endowed, well-trained, well-equipped, and highly disciplined troops have proven unable to accomplish any of the core tasks to which they’ve been assigned. This has been especially true since 9/11.","We send the troops off to war, but they don’t achieve peace. Instead, America’s wars and skirmishes simply drag on, seemingly without end. We just keep doing what we’ve been doing, a circumstance that both Augustine and Thucydides would undoubtedly have found baffling.","Prosecuting War, Averting Peace","How to explain this paradox of a superb military that never gets the job done? Let me suggest that the problem lies with the present-day American military system, the principles to which the nation adheres in raising, organizing, supporting, and employing its armed forces. By its very existence, a military system expresses an implicit contract between the state, the people, and the military itself.","Here, as I see it, are the principles ― seven in all ― that define the prevailing military system of the United States.","First, we define military service as entirely voluntary. In the U.S., there is no link between citizenship and military service. It’s up to you as an individual to decide if you want to take up arms in the service of your country.","If you choose to do so, that’s okay. If you choose otherwise, that’s okay, too. Either way, your decision is of no more significance than whether you root for the Yankees or the Mets.","Second, while non-serving citizens are encouraged to “support the troops,” we avoid stipulating how this civic function is to be performed.","In practice, there are many ways of doing so, some substantive, others merely symbolic. Most citizens opt for the latter. This means that they cheer when invited to do so. Cheering is easy and painless. It can even make you feel good about yourself.","Third, when it comes to providing the troops with actual support, we expect Congress to do the heavy lifting. Our elected representatives fulfill that role by routinely ponying up vast sums of money for what is misleadingly called a defense budget. In some instances, Congress appropriates even more money than the Pentagon asks for, as was the case this year.","Meanwhile, under the terms of our military system, attention to how this money actually gets spent by our yet-to-be-audited Pentagon tends to be ― to put the matter politely ― spotty. Only rarely does the Congress insert itself forcefully into matters relating to what U.S. forces scattered around the world are actually doing.","Yes, there are periodic hearings, with questions posed and testimony offered. But unless there is some partisan advantage to be gained, oversight tends to be, at best, pro forma. As a result, those charged with implementing national security policy ― another Orwellian phrase ― enjoy very considerable latitude.","Fourth, under the terms of our military system, this latitude applies in spades to the chief executive. The commander-in-chief occupies the apex of our military system. The president may bring to office very little expertise pertinent to war or the art of statecraft, yet his authority regarding such matters is essentially unlimited.","Consider, if you will, the sobering fact that our military system empowers the president to order a nuclear attack, should he see the need ― or feel the impulse ― to do so. He need not obtain congressional consent. He certainly doesn’t need to check with the American people.","Since Harry Truman ordered the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, presidents have not exercised this option, for which we should all be grateful. Yet on more occasions than you can count, they have ordered military actions, large and small, on their own authority or after only the most perfunctory consultation with Congress. When Donald Trump, for instance, threatened North Korea’s Kim Jong-un with “fire and fury the likes of which the world has never seen,” he gave no hint that he would even consider asking for prior congressional authorization to do so. Trump’s words were certainly inflammatory. Yet were he to act on those words, he would merely be exercising a prerogative enjoyed by his predecessors going back to Truman himself.","The Constitution invests in Congress the authority to declare war. The relevant language is unambiguous. In practice, as countless commentators have noted, that provision has long been a dead letter. This, too, forms an essential part of our present military system.","Fifth, under the terms of that system, there’s no need to defray the costs of military actions undertaken in our name. Supporting the troops does not require citizens to pay anything extra for what the U.S. military is doing out there wherever it may be. The troops are asked to sacrifice; for the rest of us, sacrifice is anathema.","Indeed, in recent years, presidents who take the nation to war or perpetuate wars they inherit never even consider pressing Congress to increase our taxes accordingly. On the contrary, they advocate tax cuts, especially for the wealthiest among us, which lead directly to massive deficits.","Sixth, pursuant to the terms of our military system, the armed services have been designed not to defend the country but to project military power on a global basis. For the Department of Defense actually defending the United States qualifies as an afterthought, trailing well behind other priorities such as trying to pacify Afghanistan’s Kandahar Province or jousting with militant groups in Somalia. The United States Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps are all designed to fight elsewhere, relying on a constellation of perhaps 800 bases around the world to facilitate the conduct of military campaigns “out there,” wherever “there” may happen to be. They are, in other words, expeditionary forces.","Reflect for a moment on the way the Pentagon divvies the world up into gigantic swathes of territory and then assigns a military command to exercise jurisdiction over each of them: European Command, Africa Command, Central Command, Southern Command, Northern Command, and Pacific Command. With the polar icecap continuing to melt, a U.S. Arctic Command is almost surely next on the docket. Nor is the Pentagon’s mania for creating new headquarters confined to terra firma. We already have U.S. Cyber Command. Can U.S. Galactic Command be far behind?","No other nation adheres to this practice. Nor would the United States permit any nation to do so. Imagine the outcry in Washington if President Xi Jinping had the temerity to create a “PRC Latin America Command,” headed by a four-star Chinese general charged with maintaining order and stability from Mexico to Argentina.","Seventh (and last), our military system invests great confidence in something called the military profession.","The legal profession exists to implement the rule of law. We hope that the result is some approximation of justice. The medical profession exists to repair our bodily ailments. We hope that health and longevity will result. The military profession exists to master war. With military professionals in charge, it’s our hope that America’s wars will conclude quickly and successfully with peace the result.","To put it another way, we look to the military profession to avert the danger of long, costly, and inconclusive wars. History suggests that these sap the collective strength of a nation and can bring about its premature decline. We count on military professionals to forestall that prospect.","Our military system assigns the immediate direction of war to our most senior professionals, individuals who have ascended step by step to the very top of the military hierarchy. We expect three- and four-star generals and admirals to possess the skills needed to make war politically purposeful. This expectation provides the rationale for the status they enjoy and the many entitlements they are accorded.","America, the (Formerly) Indispensable","Now, the nation that has created this military system is not some “shithole country,” to use a phrase made famous by President Trump. We are, or at least claim to be, a democratic republic in which all power ultimately derives from the people. We believe in ― indeed, are certain that we exemplify ― freedom, even as we continually modify the meaning of that term.","In the aggregate, we are very rich. Since the latter part of the nineteenth century we have taken it for granted that the United States ought to be the richest country on the planet, notwithstanding the fact that large numbers of ordinary Americans are themselves anything but rich. Indeed, as a corollary to our military system, we count on these less affluent Americans to volunteer for military service in disproportionate numbers. Offered sufficient incentives, they do so.","Finally, since 1945 the United States has occupied the preeminent place in the global order, a position affirmed with the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War in 1991. Indeed, we have come to believe that American primacy reflects the will of God or of some cosmic authority.","From the early years of the Cold War, we have come to believe that the freedom, material abundance, and primacy we cherish all depend upon the exercise of “global leadership.” In practice, that seemingly benign term has been a euphemism for unquestioned military superiority and the self-assigned right to put our military to work as we please wherever we please. Back in the 1990s, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said it best: “If we have to use force, it is because we are America. We are the indispensable nation. We stand tall. We see further into the future.”","Other countries might design their military establishments to protect certain vital interests. As Albright’s remark suggests, American designs have been far more ambitious.","Here, then, is a question: How do the principles and attitudes that undergird our military system actually suit twenty-first-century America? And if they don’t, what are the implications of clinging to such a system? Finally, what alternative principles might form a more reasonable basis for raising, organizing, supporting, and employing our armed forces?","Spoiler alert: Let me acknowledge right now that I consider our present-day military system irredeemably flawed and deeply harmful. For proof we need look no further than the conduct of our post-9/11 wars, especially in Iraq and Afghanistan, but also in Libya, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria, Yemen, and parts of sub-Saharan Africa.","These myriad undertakings of the last nearly 17 years have subjected our military system to a comprehensive real-world examination. Collectively, they have rendered a judgment on that system. And the judgment is negative. Put to the test, the American military system has failed.","And the cost so far? Trillions of dollars expended (with trillions more to come), thousands of American lives lost, tens of thousands of Americans grievously damaged, and even greater numbers of non-Americans killed, injured, and displaced.","One thing is certain: our wars have not brought about peace by even the loosest definition of the word.","A Military Report Card","There are many possible explanations for why our recent military record has been so dismal. One crucial explanation ― perhaps the most important of all ― relates to those seven principles that undergird our military system.","Let me review them in reverse order.","Principle 7, the military profession: Tally up the number of three- and four-star generals who have commanded the Afghan War since 2001. It’s roughly a dozen. None of them has succeeded in bringing it to a successful conclusion. Nor does any such happy ending seem likely to be in the offing anytime soon. The senior officers we expect to master war have demonstrated no such mastery.","The generals who followed one another in presiding over that war are undoubtedly estimable, well-intentioned men, but they have not accomplished the job for which they were hired. Imagine if you contracted with a dozen different plumbers ― each highly regarded ― to fix a leaking sink in your kitchen and you ended up with a flooded basement. You might begin to think that there’s something amiss in the way that plumbers are trained and licensed. Similarly, perhaps it’s time to reexamine our approach to identifying and developing very senior military officers.","Or alternatively, consider this possibility: Perhaps our theory of war as an enterprise where superior generalship determines the outcome is flawed. Perhaps war cannot be fully mastered, by generals or anyone else.","It might just be that war is inherently unmanageable. Take it from Winston Churchill, America’s favorite confronter of evil. “The statesman who yields to war fever,” Churchill wrote, “must realize that once the signal is given, he is no longer the master of policy but the slave of unforeseeable and uncontrollable events.”","If Churchill is right, perhaps our expectations that senior military professionals will tame war ― control the uncontrollable ― are misplaced. Perhaps our military system should put greater emphasis on avoiding war altogether or at least classifying it as an option to be exercised with great trepidation, rather than as the political equivalent of a handy-dandy, multi-functional Swiss Army knife.","Principle 6, organizing our forces to emphasize global power projection: Reflect for a moment on the emerging security issues of our time. The rise of China is one example. A petulant and over-armed Russia offers a second. Throw in climate change and mushrooming cyber-threats and you have a daunting set of problems. It’s by no means impertinent to wonder about the relevance of the current military establishment to these challenges.","Every year the United States spends hundreds of billions of dollars to maintain and enhance the lethality of a force configured for conventional power projection and to sustain the global network of bases that goes with it. For almost two decades, that force has been engaged in a futile war of attrition with radical Islamists that has now spread across much of the Greater Middle East and parts of Africa.","I don’t know about you, but I worry more about the implications of China’s rise and Russian misbehavior than I do about Islamic terrorism. And I worry more about changing weather patterns here in New England or somebody shutting down the electrical grid in my home town than I do about what Beijing and Moscow may be cooking up. Bluntly put, our existing military system finds us focused on the wrong problem set.","We need a military system that accurately prioritizes actual and emerging threats. The existing system does not. This suggests the need for radically reconfigured armed services, with the hallowed traditions of George Patton, John Paul Jones, Billy Mitchell, and Chesty Puller honorably but permanently retired.","Principle 5, paying ― or not paying ― for America’s wars: If you want it, you should be willing to pay for it. That hoary axiom ought to guide our military system as much as it should our personal lives. Saddling Millennials or members of Generation Z with the cost of paying for wars mostly conceived and mismanaged by my fellow Baby Boomers strikes me as downright unseemly.","One might expect the young to raise quite a ruckus over such an obvious injustice. In recent weeks, we’ve witnessed their righteous anger over the absence of effective gun controls in this country. That they aren’t comparably incensed about the misuse of guns by their own contemporaries deployed to distant lands represents a real puzzle, especially since they’re the ones who will ultimately be stuck with the bill.","Principles 4 and 3, the role of Congress and the authority of the commander-in-chief: Whatever rationale may once have existed for allowing the commander-in-chief to circumvent the Constitution’s plainly specified allocation of war powers to Congress should long since have lapsed. Well before Donald Trump became president, a responsible Congress would have reasserted its authority to declare war. That Trump sits in the Oval Office and now takes advice from the likes of John Bolton invests this matter with great urgency.","Surely President Trump’s bellicose volatility drives home the point that it’s past time for Congress to assert itself in providing responsible oversight regarding all aspects of U.S. military policy. Were it to do so, the chances of fixing the defects permeating our present military system would improve appreciably.","Of course, the likelihood of that happening is nil until the money changers are expelled from the temple. And that won’t occur until Americans who are not beholden to the military-industrial complex and its various subsidiaries rise up, purge the Congress of its own set of complexes, and install in office people willing to do their duty. And that brings us back to…","Principles 2 and 1, the existing relationship between the American people and their military and our reliance on a so-called all-volunteer force: Here we come to the heart of the matter.","I submit that the relationship between the American people and their military is shot through with hypocrisy. It is, in fact, nothing short of fraudulent. Worse still, most of us know it, even if we are loath to fess up. In practice, the informal mandate to “support the troops” has produced an elaborate charade. It’s theater, as phony as Donald Trump’s professed love for DACA recipients.","If Americans were genuinely committed to supporting the troops, they would pay a great deal more attention to what President Trump and his twenty-first-century predecessors have tasked those troops to accomplish ― with what results and at what cost. Of course, that would imply doing more than cheering and waving the flag on cue. Ultimately, the existence of the all-volunteer force obviates any need for such an effort. It provides Americans with an ample excuse for ignoring our endless wars and allowing our flawed military system to escape serious scrutiny.","Having outsourced responsibility for defending the country to people few of us actually know, we’ve ended up with a military system that is unfair, undemocratic, hugely expensive, and largely ineffective, not to mention increasingly irrelevant to the threats coming our way. The perpetuation of that system finds us mired in precisely the sort of long, costly, inconclusive wars that sap the collective strength of a nation and may bring about its premature decline.","The root cause of our predicament is the all-volunteer force. Only when we ordinary citizens conclude that we have an obligation to contribute to the country’s defense will it become possible to devise a set of principles for raising, organizing, supporting, and employing U.S. forces that align with our professed values and our actual security requirements.","If Stormy Daniels can figure out when an existing contract has outlived its purpose, so can the rest of us.","In between his contributions to TomDispatch, Andrew J.

Blake Farenthold (R-Texas) abruptly resigned amid pressure to repay $84,000 in taxpayer money that he used to settle a sexual harassment lawsuit against him.","His departure, which was weird and involved him immediately deleting his Twitter and Facebook accounts, means an ongoing probe into his behavior by the House Ethics Committee was cut short. Whatever his colleagues may have found in their investigation to date is now locked away in a vault.","But the committee hasn’t forgotten that he still owes $84,000, even if he isn’t a congressman anymore. And its members want him to pay up.","In a Thursday evening statement officially announcing the end of their probe, leaders of the committee urge Farenthold to follow through with a promise he made four months ago to pay back taxpayers.","“We note Rep. Farenthold publicly promised to reimburse the U.S. Treasury for $84,000 in funds paid to settle the lawsuit brought against him for claims of sexual harassment, gender discrimination and retaliation,” said Reps. Susan Brooks (R-Ind.) and Ted Deutch (D-Fla.), the chair and ranking member of the committee, respectively.","“We encourage him in the strongest possible terms to uphold that promise.”","Here’s a copy of their statement:","HuffPost reached out Farenthold’s former chief of staff, Bob Haueter, to ask if the former congressman plans to repay the taxpayer money. He directed HuffPost to the Clerk of the House, which he said is now handling press inquiries related to Farenthold’s former office.","“The office cannot provide a comment,” said Jodi Detwiler of the House Clerk’s Offie. “We encourage you to reach out to former Rep. Farenthold.”","There’s really nothing anyone in Congress can do to make Farenthold repay the money. It comes down to Farenthold following through on a promise or not.","The allegations against him include his former spokeswoman Lauren Greene saying in legal documents that Farenthold told another aide that Greene could “show her nipples whenever she wanted to” and that he had “sexual fantasies” and “wet dreams” about her. She describes the congressman as often being drunk and flirtatious at work, complaining of a sexless marriage and telling her a story about a female lobbyist propositioning him for “a threesome.”","One thing lawmakers can do is pass legislation cracking down on sexual harassment in their ranks. The House overwhelmingly passed a bill addressing this two months ago, but the Senate hasn’t done anything with that bill or put forward a bill of its own.","HuffPost spent the week trying to figure out why nothing appears to be happening on that front.

None of those three senators responded to a request for comment on what’s going on with the issue.\n\nBut it’s irritating their colleagues in the House.

But at each turn, the president emerged unscathed.","Then on Monday, the FBI raid on Trump lawyer Michael Cohen’s office and hotel raised the prospect once again. Cohen’s apparently been under criminal investigation for months, according to court papers prosecutors released on Friday. It is incredibly early to say this with any certainty, but it’s starting to look possible that women could ultimately topple the Trump presidency.","Not Russia. Women.","The scandals prompted by two women, Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal, reportedly led the FBI to Cohen’s door. Federal agents were reportedly seeking information on hush agreements the adult film star and the former Playmate signed to stay silent about their alleged affairs with Trump. The agreements may have violated federal campaign finance laws, raising the real possibility of criminal charges for Cohen ― and maybe even for Trump himself.","The nonprofit Common Cause filed complaints with the Department of Justice and the Federal Election Commission in January over the hush agreements, alleging they are campaign finance violations. The punishment for breaking such laws includes fines and even jail time.","At a time when the Me Too movement has brought down many powerful men for sexual misconduct, the alleged violations raise the prospect of bagging the biggest whale of all.","Though the raid this week was a sign of how serious the situation is, there are a million caveats going the other way: First, there is no publicly available evidence that Trump knew about these payoffs. He didn’t even sign the agreement with Daniels and denies he knew about it or had an affair with her or McDougal. Cohen said he paid Daniels without Trump knowing.","Even if the feds nail the evidence, successfully pressing the case in court would be technically pretty tricky, legal experts say. Recently, former presidential candidate John Edwards was charged with campaign finance violations and went to trial, but the jury couldn’t agree on his guilt.","Also, recall that no sitting U.S. president has ever been charged with a crime.","The more obvious punitive route would be impeachment, which seems unlikely at the moment because Trump’s party runs Congress. And even if the Dems were running the show, it’s not clear they’d want to make a whole thing out of what seems to be essentially a sex scandal ― 20 years after the Lewinsky debacle. (Though not everyone sees this as simply a salacious story.)","Further, campaign finance violations aren’t exactly the sexiest, most outrageous crimes around.","And of course, no one knows what special counsel Robert Mueller ― who’s already done a lot of damage to the Trump administration with indictments and criminal charges ― still has up his sleeve.","And yet, right now, the campaign finance violations do seem further along than the Russia case to a number of experts.","“The public evidence we know on the campaign finance issue is more clear to us at this moment,” said Liam Brennan, a former federal prosecutor who was the lead attorney in the prosecution of former Connecticut Gov. John G. Rowland (R) for campaign finance violations. “From what is publicly known, there is fairly compelling evidence that campaign finance laws were broken,” he said.","Cohen has already admitted he paid Daniels $130,000, but said the president was not involved. McDougal’s $150,000 came from the folks at American Media Inc., home to the National Enquirer, but McDougal’s lawsuit says the company acted in coordination with Cohen. American Media Inc. denies all of this.","Though the alleged affairs happened more than a decade ago, the payoffs came right before the election: McDougal’s just after the Republican National Convention in August 2016, Daniels’ a week before the general election, right when the “Access Hollywood” tape was imperiling Trump’s campaign.","The maximum amount an individual can contribute to a campaign is $2,700 ― obviously, far less than $130,000. Corporations are prohibited from making donations to individual candidates.","The timing of the payouts increases the likelihood that they’ll be seen as money spent on getting Trump into office ― if the women’s stories had emerged prior to the election, the reasoning goes, they would’ve hurt Trump’s chances. Particularly Daniels’ story, which was kaiboshed during Pussygrab-gate.","In fact, according to reporting from The New York Times, FBI agents were also looking for information tied to that infamous recording, wherein Trump brags to host Billy Bush that he is very famous and can just kiss women without asking and grab them by their genitals.","If prosecutors are able to build a compelling case against Cohen ― and possibly Trump ― around these payments, it’s plausible that the president could find himself facing criminal charges, legal experts told HuffPost.","That road leads to possible impeachment and even a criminal trial, where the president and his lawyer could face fines and even, yes, jail time ― up to five years, said Paul S. Ryan, vice president of policy and litigation at Common Cause. “Imprisonment is exceedingly rare, but it happens occasionally,” he said.","Still, a case would hardly be a slam dunk. “Proving intent in white-collar cases is extremely difficult,” Brennan, the former prosecutor, said.","While it “seems obvious” the intention was to protect the Trump campaign, it can be hard to prove, he said. The keys will be: Will Cohen talk and will agents find compelling hard proof to back up the case?","And it’s an open question as to how seriously anyone is going to take these scandals. The sexual nature of Daniels and McDougal’s stories may make prosecutors and Congress “squeamish,” Brennan added.","(Remember, it’s mostly men making these decisions.)","And to get to Trump, legal experts said, there needs to be more evidence. “In order to pin any of this on Trump, he would have needed to know what’s going on,” said Laurie Levenson, a criminal law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. “That’s why it’s key to find a link,” she said ― possibly paperwork of some sort, an email or a letter.","At this point, the worst-case scenario for Trump would be a finding that Cohen and others were involved in illegal activity, Levenson said ― some kind of criminal activity, maybe campaign finance violations, but possibly bank fraud, which FBI agents are reportedly also looking into. If Cohen or others talk, they could end up pointing a finger at Trump and saying not only did he know, but he was orchestrating all of this.","“You have to make a lot of jumps and assumptions,” she said.","Still, the prospect remains delicious.","CORRECTION: A previous version of this story said the Lewinsky scandal was 30 years ago.

On Wednesday, a federal judge dismissed a tax evasion charge against him, saying that the government had failed to prove that he tried to conceal or mislead officials about his income. Prosecutors claimed the 53-year-old contract engineer from Columbia City had been cashing his work checks and keeping his bank balance low specifically so that tax collectors couldn’t garnish his account.","U.S. District Judge Michael W.

His 2003 New York Times op-ed undermined Bush’s claim that Iraq’s former President Saddam Hussein had purchased materials needed for a nuclear weapon from Africa. He came to his conclusion after traveling to Niger in 2002, on behalf of the CIA, to investigate whether Saddam had purchased uranium yellowcake.","The Bush administration leaked the name of Wilson’s wife, Valerie Plame, a covert CIA agent, to the press in its attempts to undercut Wilson. That move effectively ended her career with the agency.","Plame similarly told MSNBC on Friday that Trump’s actions show “you can commit crimes against national security and you will be pardoned.”","In 2007, a federal jury found Libby, Vice President Dick Cheney’s chief of staff, guilty of lying about his role in the leak of Plame’s identity and of obstructing the probe into the leak.","“I don’t know Mr. Libby, but for years I have heard that he has been treated unfairly,” Trump said in a statement Friday. “Hopefully, this full pardon will help rectify a very sad portion of his life.”","In a statement later, Plame said Trump’s comments were not based on the truth, noting that a jury heard the evidence and convicted him, and even Bush refused to pardon him.","Bush did commute Libby’s sentence, sparing him from serving in prison.","Wilson also said he finds Trump to be a “vile and despicable individual” who is “utterly unacceptable as president.”","Wilson’s full comments to HuffPost below:","It has nothing to do with Libby, and it has nothing to do with me.

The man, who has not been publicly identified for legal reasons, was convicted more than a decade ago of conspiracy to intercept communications, reported The Guardian. He served a six-month prison sentence.","Google had refused the man’s request to remove the information about his criminal past, but Warby ruled the demand was reasonable as “the crime and punishment information has become out of date, irrelevant and of no sufficient legitimate interest to users of Google search to justify its continued availability.”","The judge said he’d also taken the nature of the man’s conviction into consideration, as well as his demonstrated “remorse” for the crime.","“There is not a plausible suggestion ... that there is a risk that this wrongdoing will be repeated by the claimant,” Warby said, according to The Guardian. “The information is of scant if any apparent relevance to any business activities that he seems likely to engage in.”","Warby, however, refused the request of another unnamed businessman who’d also asked Google to remove search results related to a prior criminal conviction. That man, referred to in the media as NT1, was convicted of conspiracy to account falsely in the late 1990s and spent four years behind bars.","Warby said NT1 had continued to mislead “the public and this court,” and had shown “no remorse over any of these matters.” The information available online about his past conviction was useful for people who might work with him in the future, the judge added.","“He remains in business, and the information serves the purpose of minimizing the risk that he will continue to mislead, as he has in the past,” Warby said of NT1. “Delisting would not erase the information from the record altogether, but it would make it much harder to find.”","Reacting to Warby’s ruling on the two cases, a Google spokesperson said the company would “respect the judgments.”","“We work hard to comply with the right to be forgotten, but we take great care not to remove search results that are in the public interest and will defend the public’s right to access lawful information,” the spokesperson said. “We are pleased that the court recognized our efforts in this area, and we will respect the judgments they have made in this case.”","Open Rights Group, a digital rights organization based in Britain, said Warby’s rulings set a “legal precedent” and could have far-reaching consequences.","“The right to be forgotten is meant to apply to information that is no longer relevant but disproportionately impacts a person,” Jim Killock, the group’s executive director, told the BBC. “The Court will have to balance the public’s right to access the historical record, the precise impacts on the person, and the public interest.”","In 2014, the European Court of Justice, the supreme court of the European Union, had ruled that people and corporations had a right to request the “delisting” of information on search engines that is “inaccurate, inadequate, irrelevant or excessive,” but that public interest also had to be considered.","That ruling, however, has been criticized as being too vague, making it challenging for companies like Google to figure out how to find a balance between privacy protection and providing information for the public good.","As Engadget noted, the London high court ruling could force internet companies to not immediately dismiss conviction-related delisting requests. “They may have to weigh the seriousness of crimes and the convict’s willingness to reform,” the site said.","Reactions to the rulings were mixed on social media. Some advocates celebrated the court’s decision, calling it a win for people with criminal records who face discrimination because of their past misdeeds. Others, however, expressed concern that the ruling could harm free press and speech rights.","Google has received requests to remove more than 2.4 million links from its search results in Europe since the 2014 ECJ ruling. The tech company says it has removed more than 800,000 pages so far.","Surveys show a majority of Americans support the “right to be forgotten,” but observers have said it’s unlikely that such legislation would pass here because of possible violations of the First Amendment.","Regulators in France, however, are currently pushing to extend the EU’s “right to be forgotten” ruling to apply to websites globally, which would include the United States.

For years, President Barack Obama went around Congress to take military action against the self-described Islamic State by saying he could use a sweeping 2001 authorization for use of military force, or AUMF, to do it. That AUMF, which has no expiration date, allowed then-President George W. Bush to attack anyone connected to Al Qaeda, anywhere, at any time. Obama argued that ISIS was an offshoot of Al Qaeda, so he argued he could invoke the same AUMF.","Trump can’t make that argument for launching missile strikes on Syrian government targets, even if House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) says it’s fine if he does.","The administration hasn’t even tried to make that case. When Trump directed strikes on a Syrian government airbase in April 2017 ― the first-ever direct military strike by the U.S. against Assad’s regime ― the administration claimed the president had that authority under his presidential powers because it was a limited military action, not because of the Iraq War-era AUMF.","But as lawyers at the nonpartisan Protect Democracy note, U.S. military action in Syria is unlikely to be limited to a single engagement. Instead, they say, it is likely to lead to larger and ongoing conflicts, which sounds a lot more like the beginnings of war than a surgical attack. Hence the growing concerns among lawmakers about Trump’s next step.\n\nTrump received plenty of support from members of his own party Friday night after he announced the attacks. But some were unhappy at not being consulted.","House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said one night of U.S. airstrikes would not be “a substitute for a clear, comprehensive Syria strategy” and said Trump must go to Congress to receive congressional authorization “by proposing a comprehensive strategy with clear objectives that keep our military safe and avoid collateral damage to innocent civilians.”\n\nA White House spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment on the letter.\n\nAmanda Terkel contributed reporting.\n\nClarification: The letter from the 88 members of Congress misidentifies at least two lawmakers’ state and/or party affiliations.

What happens when you put a cop in charge of deporting people?","date":"2018-04-13"},"articleContent":["UPDATE: June 29 — Acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Thomas Homan retired Friday from government service after spending the last 16 months serving as the most controversial deportation chief in the beleaguered agency’s brief history.","Original story continues below:","The day Thomas Homan turned the immigration debate on its head, he could have just presented his agency’s budget request like he was asked.","The first nine people to lead Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency President Donald Trump picked Homan to lead last January, rarely courted controversy. Most of them were lawyers, adept at the art of bipartisan doublespeak and content to leave policy fights to politicians. They generally described ICE as a national security agency, emphasizing its investigative work and the number of criminals removed, while downplaying its core function: deporting people who pose little or no threat.","But last June, when Homan was supposed to be explaining to a House subcommittee why ICE needed a 29 percent budget increase to $7.9 billion, he pierced the bubble of diplomacy that has surrounded the agency since its founding — with a threat.","“If you’re in this country illegally and you committed a crime by entering this country, you should be uncomfortable,” Homan said. “You should look over your shoulder, and you need to be worried.”","Those words transformed Homan from a career law enforcement official into the face of Trump’s deportation agenda. In the months that followed, he continued to defend the fact that, under Trump, the crushing weight of immigration law can fall as heavily upon an undocumented parent of American children as it can on a convicted murderer. This January, he went the farthest yet, telling Fox News that the Justice Department should consider prosecuting mayors and city council members who pass so-called “sanctuary” policies that limit local cooperation with ICE.","That comment invited sharp criticism from legal groups.","“Homan would be a great mid-level functionary in any right-wing totalitarian government you can name,” Thomas Saenz, the president of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, told HuffPost.","Homan dismisses his critics by pointing out the obvious: Federal law requires him to remove people living in the U.S. without authorization. Despite the partisan battle over his tactics, his agency’s mission isn’t new. And no law requires the agency to halt the deportation process for immigrants who garner public sympathy. “If you want the law changed, ask Congress,” Homan often says. “I don’t make the laws. I just enforce them.”","Now Homan, who is serving as acting director while awaiting confirmation by the U.S. Senate, is on a mission to glorify the men and women who deport people ― something he sees as one of the most thankless tasks in federal law enforcement. ICE officers, he told Congress in June, “are unfairly vilified for simply doing their job.”","The country had just observed National Police Week, which honors officers whose lose their lives in the line of duty. “Too often that respect does not seem to extend to the honorable men and women of ICE,” Homan complained, noting that two of his officers had died while serving the year before. Unlike virtually every other local, state and federal law enforcement agency, he said, ICE officers go about their work in the face of a “constant deluge of biased attacks against ICE personnel by those who disagree with the laws we enforce.”","Homan’s celebration of ICE’s core mission and the people who carry it out is admirably frank. But chipping away at the pretense that ICE’s role is to keep the U.S. safe from terrorists and criminals risks exposing the brutal reality of our deportation system — the crushed hopes, the separated families; the people who die in the desert and the ones who are sent home to their deaths. It’s a reality Homan can stomach, not least because he has seen the violence of human smuggling at the border. He is betting that if Americans see the deportation machine through his eyes, they’ll consider his agency’s work as necessary and just.","Will they?","Born To Serve","Thomas Douglas Homan, who has a thinning crop of strawberry blond hair, a penchant for speaking in aphorisms that slice through policy jargon, and a preference for baggy suits often graced by an American flag lapel pin, describes himself with great pride as a “cop.”","Policing is in Homan’s blood. His grandfather served as a police officer in West Carthage, the 2,000-person village in upstate New York where Homan was born. So did his father, who went on to become a magistrate judge. Homan grew up watching law enforcement officers come to the house with offenders to arraign. Each of his six siblings became a police officer, firefighter or nurse.","“I’m one of the lucky guys — I always knew since I was a kid that I wanted to be in law enforcement,” Homan told HuffPost. “We were raised to serve.”","After earning a bachelor’s degree in criminal justice from the state university system at Utica, Homan became a West Carthage police officer in 1983. He worked the evening patrol shift in the quiet community surrounded by dairy farmers, rarely responding to anything more nefarious than an abandoned car or local kids pelting rocks at a street light.","Homan wanted more. While out fishing one day later that year, he met a Border Patrol agent — they were a common sight in West Carthage, which is just 35 miles from the Canadian border — and the conversation piqued his interest enough to apply.","A few months later, Homan’s parents took him to the airport to catch a plane bound for San Diego so he could join Border Patrol. When he arrived in California, helicopters were flying overhead. A group of Border Patrol agents was tracking unauthorized immigrants near the Motel 6 where he was staying the night.","“This is different,” he thought. “I’m not in upstate New York anymore.”","Homan distinguished himself at the training academy as an enthusiastic recruit and strong strategic thinker. Stationed in Campo, an outpost about 40 miles from San Diego, he spent his days “sign cutting” — tracking the physical marks left behind by people crossing illegally through the brush. In the isolated station with about three dozen other agents, Homan discovered a sense of camaraderie. Today, he recalls the four years that he “wore the green,” a reference to Border Patrol’s uniforms, as some of the best of his life.","After Homan left the Border Patrol, he became an investigator with the now-defunct Immigration and Naturalization Services, and eventually oversaw major operations to break up human smuggling networks.","On May 14, 2003, 19 years into Homan’s career in immigration enforcement, police discovered an abandoned tractor-trailer at a truck stop in Victoria, Texas. The driver had attempted to smuggle more than 70 migrants who had recently crossed into the United States past a Border Patrol checkpoint in the unventilated trailer. Seventeen of them had suffocated to death inside, and two others died later. Homan was scheduled to give a speech in Dallas that morning, but instead flew to Victoria, where a Texas Ranger walked him through the crime scene and into the trailer that held the bodies. Among them was a man whose 5-year-old child had died in his arms.","Homan, now part of the newly created ICE, led the investigation. Under his direction, ICE special agents broke up four smuggling organizations involved in the tragedy, and put a dozen people behind bars. A jury convicted the truck driver, Tyrone Williams, in 2006; he was ultimately sentenced to 34 years in prison. But the episode stuck with Homan. He still mentions it in speeches, partly to refute the notion that immigration enforcement officials like him are heartless.","“This is something I can’t forget,” Homan told HuffPost. “At the time, I had a 5-year-old boy. As a parent, you look at it and you think, ‘That could be your child.’”","In the years that followed, Homan continued to rise through ICE’s ranks, landing a job in the Washington bureaucracy the year Barack Obama took office. He took over Enforcement and Removal Operations, the part of the agency that handles deportations, in 2013. The timing meant that it fell to Homan to implement the Obama administration’s “prosecutorial discretion” policy, which required ICE to prioritize the removal of people who posed threats to national security or public safety, had been caught while crossing the border or had prior deportations on their records. Under the new policy, the agency would often postpone deporting unauthorized immigrants who had established themselves in the United States without seriously running afoul of the law.","To judge from Homan’s public remarks since taking control of ICE, carrying out prosecutorial discretion grated on him. But regardless of his personal views of the Obama policy, Homan was well-suited to communicate the new orders down the chain of command. The changes were planned by Washington bureaucrats and signed by then-ICE Director John Morton, a former federal prosecutor who had served in the Peace Corps. Condensing Morton’s six-page, heavily bulleted memo into the two-word motto “worst first,” Homan gave the policy an air of legitimacy within the agency that it might otherwise have lacked.","The Obama administration was thrilled with Homan’s performance, and honored him with the Presidential Rank Award for his service in 2015. That year, 98 percent of people ICE deported from within the country met one of the three priority categories, a record Homan described as “pretty close to perfect.” (ICE uses separate statistics to track people deported after trying to cross the border illegally.)","But Homan’s roots in the rank-and-file also give him a rough edge. As a Washington bureaucrat, he continued to refer to unauthorized immigrants as “tonks,” according to two former DHS officials who have worked with him. (Homan denied using the term, saying he hasn’t heard it in years.) The epithet has an uncertain origin, but those familiar with the term say it’s Border Patrol slang that derives from the sound of bashing an immigrant over the head with a flashlight or a baton.","As Obama prepared to leave office, Homan prepared to retire. A week after Trump’s inauguration, he stood before a crowd of colleagues at ICE’s headquarters in Washington, toasting the end of a 33-year career. Having risen nearly to the top of the immigration enforcement system, Homan had lined up a job in the private sector and was ready to leave. He had already cleaned out his desk.","But as he was shaking the hand of the last guest to leave the celebration, he received a call from then-Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly, who said Trump himself had asked that Homan come back to head ICE. Homan returned the gifts. He was back in the office the following week.","‘ICE Isn’t Going Anywhere’","By the time it was announced on Jan. 27, 2017, that Homan had been selected to lead ICE, he had already received a new set of instructions from Trump. The president had issued an executive order that scrapped Obama’s prosecutorial discretion policy. Within two weeks, ICE began summarily deporting people — including some who had received stays of deportation — who came in for routine check-ins with the agency. And officers once again began detaining unauthorized immigrants they encountered during operations targeting other people. These once-common detentions, known as “collateral arrests,” had been largely phased out during Obama’s second term.","The aggressive tactics sparked a furious backlash from immigrant rights leaders and legal groups. But rather than defuse the tensions created by ICE’s increasingly indiscriminate arrests, Homan heightened them.","On March 28, the ICE director attended an unusual town hall meeting called by Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones, a Republican. Jones hoped to dispel misconceptions about the way ICE carries out its operations. The agency has long disputed the idea that ICE conducts “raids” or “sweeps,” contending instead that its officers specifically target people with criminal records or prior deportations.","In the state with the country’s largest undocumented population and firm Democratic control of the government, Homan was greeted by an angry crowd. “Fuck you!” someone yelled. “Piece of shit!” another person shouted. The hecklers visibly unnerved Jones, who repeatedly threatened to toss them out. But Homan, stone-faced, stood up and told his critics exactly what they didn’t want to hear: He had a duty to enforce the law. If California sheriffs wouldn’t let him into a jail, the safest place for his officers to make an arrest, then he’d have no choice but to go after his targets at their homes or places of employment. With no classes of unauthorized immigrants left untouchable under Trump’s executive order, the implied threat meant that sanctuary policies would backfire, spurring more arrests of bystanders without legal status.","Someone shouted that ICE should “get out of California.”","“Let’s be clear on one thing: ICE isn’t going anywhere,” Homan shot back. “We’re going to enforce the laws that are on the books.”","This combative attitude hasn’t undermined Homan’s reputation among his contemporaries. “Tom Homan would not be doing what he’s doing today if he did not believe it is in the interest of this nation,” David Aguilar, a former acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, told HuffPost. “But there’s probably no bigger target in the media as it relates to law enforcement than Director Homan right now.”","And despite facing periodic criticism from the officers union, Homan remains widely respected within ICE and among the agency’s former leadership. Both supporters and critics of the direction ICE is moving under Trump are likely to cite the same qualities that elevated him to the top job: a strong work ethic, a dry wit, a deep sense of mission and, above all, his devotion to the common officer.","“Tom is even-tempered,” Gary Mead, the former head of ERO, told HuffPost. “He has a good sense of humor. He gets along with a wide variety of people both up and down the chain of command. He’s a team player. He’s totally committed to three things. That’s the mission of ICE, looking out for his employees, and looking out for the public he serves. I don’t see him as being contentious, I see him as being committed to those three things.”","Homan’s frontline experience sets him apart from his predecessors. Of the nine people who led ICE before him, six were lawyers and two began their careers as customs investigators ― a prestigious criminal law enforcement position that has as much to do with routine deportations as a police detective’s work has to do with traffic stops. The only other ICE director to serve in a rank-and-file immigration enforcement position was former Border Patrol officer John Clark, who led ICE for five months as an acting director more than a decade ago.","“I’m sitting in this chair right now, and I know what a Border Patrol agent feels like,” Homan said. “I know what it’s like to arrest an alien and feel bad about it. I know what it’s like to see a dead alien on the trail.”","But Homan’s unrelenting boosterism of Trump’s deportation agenda has some former colleagues saying they don’t recognize the man they see puffing his chest on Fox News. Having been plucked from retirement at the end of a long career, Homan bears little burden to preserve appearance of non-partisanship. His most confrontational comments ― particularly the threat to prosecute local officials who embrace sanctuary policies or his warning that unauthorized immigrants should be afraid ― have widely alienated Democrats and critics “on the left,” as Homan puts it. But some suspect Homan’s over-the-top public pronouncements don’t reflect his personal views as much as his desire to please a White House beset by infighting and historically high turnover.","“Those comments are just ingratiating himself with this administration,” former deputy director of ICE Alonzo Peña told HuffPost. “He knows a lot better than that. … But he’s in a hard spot. You’ve got an administration that is very direct. I don’t think in his wildest dreams he would’ve thought he’d become acting director. I’m sure he’s trying to conform as much as he can.”","Democratic critics are likely to pounce on Homan when he eventually goes before the Senate for confirmation. But some wonder whether Homan’s commentary may have soured some moderate Republicans, whose support he’ll need to cement his job title.","“He wants to get confirmed so badly that he has been willing to say things that are nothing short of outrageous and offensive,” a former DHS official told HuffPost. “I’m wondering if Tom has unintentionally screwed himself out of the job with some of this bombastic language meant to appeal to an audience of one: Donald Trump.”","A Rank-And-File Leader","Homan’s public statements may mirror the president’s hawkishness, but the campaign the ICE director is waging against sanctuary cities is at least as personal as it is political. Homan begins his days at the office by hate-reading press statements from legal groups like the American Civil Liberties Union and clippings from mass media. All of it, he says, demonizes his officers. And nothing makes Homan seethe more than seeing his deportation officers take the blame for the United States’ dysfunctional immigration politics. To him, every one of them is a hero who makes the choice to strap a gun to his or her hip in the morning to carry out a solemn task that Congress has decided is not only necessary, but, at least since 2003, also a matter of national security.","“That’s the real difference — having a rank-and-file person,” one ICE employee, who declined to be named because he’s not authorized to speak on behalf of the agency, told HuffPost. “The way I see Homan is he’s a tough cop who has integrity and compassion. But he also knows what it’s like to be an officer and to be out there on the front lines and think about officers’ safety.”","If Homan’s deportation officers suffer from a lack of national prestige, it’s partly due to bureaucratic processes over which they have little control. Congress created the Department of Homeland Security after the Sept. 11 attacks by mashing together 22 agencies, including most of those that enforce immigration law. In that pivotal moment, interior immigration enforcement leapt from the realm of civil procedure administered by the Justice Department to an element of national security conflated with the broader mission of fighting terrorism.","Under that arrangement, deportation officers drew the short end of the stick. The former customs agents and INS investigators evolved into ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations Unit ― the ones tasked with carrying out long investigations that have some tie to the border. That nexus is at times nebulous and routinely overlaps with agencies like the FBI or Drug Enforcement Administration; many of HSI’s targets are U.S. citizens.","ICE’s most prominent arrests ― gang leaders, child pornographers, human traffickers ― usually result from HSI investigations. Deportation officers, on the other hand, carry out the more mundane task of removing unauthorized immigrants, regardless of whether they have committed serious crimes in the United States. Unlike HSI investigators, deportation officers don’t generally make criminal arrests. It’s a well-paid job that opens the door to federal law enforcement, usually without having to move to a remote part of the southern desert, as Border Patrol positions often require. But job satisfaction at ICE consistently ranks in the bottom quartile of federal government agencies, according to the annual federal viewpoint survey, with low scores from ERO historically dragging down the average.","Today, ICE’s deportation officers have come to symbolize the most draconian aspects of immigration enforcement, without enjoying the prestige accorded to virtually every other branch of law enforcement.","It’s difficult to honestly describe the U.S. deportation system as an urgent national security function. Some of the criminal offenders ICE removes each year were convicted of violent crimes, including more than 8,000 convicted of some form of homicide since 2009. But the criminals ICE has deported in the last decade were most commonly guilty of immigration violations, DUIs, traffic violations or drug charges. Under Homan, who doesn’t think ICE should wait for a criminal court to secure a conviction before starting removal proceedings, a growing number of deportees from outside the United States’ 2,000-mile southern border region haven’t been convicted of anything at all.","Some of the agency’s prominent critics on the left, including former Hillary Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon and MSNBC host Chris Hayes, have floated the idea of abolishing ICE altogether.","Trump and Homan have chosen the opposite path — boosting the power, funding and reputation of the parts of the federal government responsible for deportation. This focus on deportations also helps Homan achieve a narrower goal: shifting the blame for the injustices of the immigration enforcement system away from ICE and back to the political class. And he’s citing concerns about his officers’ safety to make that happen.","When Homan rails against so-called “sanctuary” cities, his argument is simple: Arresting someone who is already jailed is far less risky for his agents than knocking on an unknown door. It’s also more efficient. One deportation officer working in a jail can easily carry out 10 administrative arrests in a workday, according to Homan. At-large arrests, on the other hand, require several agents to arrest a single person and introduce the possibility that their target might be armed or try to fight back. Moreover, Homan says, it undermines public safety in immigrant communities when authorities release someone who has been jailed for a criminal offense and could be deported if only ICE officers had more access to the jail.","There’s no question that at-large arrests present greater risks than a custody transfer from a local jail. But in his zeal, Homan often overstates the case. Even the most generous sanctuary laws, like California’s Trust Act, allow local authorities to help ICE detain and deport people accused or convicted of serious crimes involving homicide, sexual abuse or human trafficking. And despite California’s policies of limiting cooperation with ICE, more than 80 percent of the agency’s arrests there since 2017 have taken place inside a jail, according to a declaration Homan submitted last month alongside a lawsuit filed by Attorney General Jeff Sessions and aimed at overturning three of the state’s sanctuary laws.","Nor does Homan’s portrayal of the risks deportation officers face entirely square with the statistics he cites. Homan has repeatedly said in speeches that 52 names of ICE agents are inscribed on the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial, and he won’t have a 53rd “because some politician put politics above public safety.” But that figure, which the ICE press office clarified is actually 51, dates back to 1915 and includes legacy INS and Customs agents, some of whom carried out jobs far riskier than administrative arrests of potential deportees. Both of the officers Homan referred to in his congressional testimony in June died in the line of duty. But Special Agent J. Scott McGuire was hit by a drunk driver, and Brian Beliso died of a heart attack during a foot chase.","Since the creation of ICE in 2003, Beliso, McGuire and three other agents ― David Wilhelm, Jaime Zapata and Lorenzo Gomez ― have died in the line of duty. But Wilhelm and Zapata were investigators, and neither died during an immigration enforcement operation. Zapata was killed outside Mexico City by a drug cartel; Wilhelm was murdered at his home by a U.S. citizen who escaped from a federal courthouse and killed three others. Gomez died of kidney failure after collapsing during a special response team training session. No deportation officers have died because of a violent altercation with an unauthorized immigrant since ICE was founded, according to the data collected by the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund.","‘I’m Not The Devil’","Unlike deportation officers, migrants often lose their lives as a result of U.S. immigration policy. No government agency tracks the fate of migrants after their deportations, but a New Yorker investigation published in January documented 60 cases in which deportees in recent years were killed, kidnapped or sexually abused after their removal from the United States. Others suffocate in unventilated trailers, as Homan knows from personal experience. At least 175 immigrants have died in detention centers since 2003, according to Human Rights Watch data. Hundreds more die annually from trekking through remote parts of the desert.","The increase of border-crossing deaths stems partly from the unprecedented fortification of the region. In the 1980s, it was common for people to simply walk across unpatrolled stretches of the border or wade through the Rio Grande. Some used smugglers as guides, but others crossed independently. Some might cross more than a dozen times during their lives.","But over the last three decades and with bipartisan support, the United States has laid down 700 miles of border fencing, more than quadrupled the number of Border Patrol agents and dealt out increasingly harsh consequences to those who cross illegally. The result is that now people who make the crossing rely in ever greater numbers on human smugglers, paying sums as high as $7,000 a head to take their chances, pumping hundreds of millions of dollars each year into an illicit economy dominated by drug cartels and transnational gangs. For Homan, the only way to halt the deaths at the border is to dismantle that criminal economy by eliminating the possibility of crossing the border illegally.","“I’m not the devil. There’s a reason why I feel the way I feel,” Homan said. “We have to do everything we can to dismantle these smuggling organizations.”","For those who do make it past the Border Patrol, Homan’s officers will be waiting. Immigration laws won’t mean much if would-be unauthorized immigrants think they’ll gain immunity from deportation if they get past Border Patrol and have a child born in the U.S., Homan says.","That argument treads closely to a criticism of birthright citizenship. But when pressed to define his vision for the future of the immigration system in the U.S., Homan suddenly sounds more like one of the bipartisan group of lawmakers that has unsuccessfully pushed for comprehensive reform than the hardliners who control the White House.","“I’m the first one to say, I can’t arrest 11 million people,” Homan told HuffPost. “So Congress needs to make some decisions about immigration reform. The answer isn’t ‘ignore the law.’ The answer is ‘fix the law.’”","As Congress bickers, Homan is working to make the immigration enforcement system still more punitive. With 34 years of experience enforcing immigration law, he knows all the pressure points to make the United States’ sprawling detention and deportation system function more efficiently, with or without new laws.","Shortly after taking control of ICE, Homan asked the Justice Department to challenge the Supreme Court’s ruling in the case of Zadvydas v. Davis, which bars immigration authorities from detaining immigrants for more than six months unless they pose a national security or public safety threat. He set in writing a new policy allowing ICE officers to detain unauthorized immigrants at courthouses, over the objection of federal judges. And he walked back a policy he himself had signed as head of ERO in 2016 that required ICE to generally release pregnant women from immigrant detention.","For those who have a problem with any of that, Homan is happy to point them to the ballot box or their local members of Congress — anyone but the deportation officers who are doing a job that politicians of both parties have ordered them to do.","In the meantime, Homan will proudly continue to act as the face of Trump’s deportation agenda. The job comes at a personal cost. He bristles at being caricatured by critics as a Nazi. He said his youngest son has been harassed at school. Authorities are investigating numerous threats against him and his wife.","And behind his bluster on national television, the job weighs on him emotionally. He knows his officers separate families on a daily basis. Then again, he says, so does every police officer who makes arrests. Homan signed up for that the day he first became a cop in 1983.","“People think I don’t feel bad about the plight of these people. Well, I do feel bad,” Homan said. “But I have a job to do.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5acfd3a01f0000270616d04e.jpeg?cache=cjosvRq09F&ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"WOMEN","headline":"The Rape Kit Backlog Shows Exactly How We Regard Women In This Country","authors":"Alanna Vagianos","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-rape-kit-backlog-shows-exactly-how-we-regard-women-in-this-country_us_5acfb5e1e4b016a07e9a8c65","short_description":"Mariska Hargitay’s new documentary “I Am Evidence” humanizes the rape kit crisis.","date":"2018-04-13"},"articleContent":["You don’t matter.","That’s the message every survivor hears loud and clear when a rape kit goes untested. Behind every kit is a person ― usually a woman ― who has been brutalized in the most intimate of ways. And yet there are estimated to be hundreds of thousands of untested rape kits currently sitting in police storage across the country.","So, how did we get here?","That’s the question actress and activist Mariska Hargitay answers in her new HBO documentary “I Am Evidence,” set to air April 16. The film, produced by the “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit” star and Trish Adlesic, and co-directed by Adlesic and Geeta Gandbhir, takes a human approach to an epidemic that has reduced survivors, their stories and their trauma to a box of evidence.","“To me, the backlog is one of the clearest and most shocking demonstrations of how we regard these crimes in our society,” Hargitay says in the film. “Testing rape kits sends a fundamental and crucial message to victims of sexual violence: You matter. What happened to you matters. Your case matters.”","In a conversation with HuffPost, Hargitay and Adlesic laid out the herculean task they had in front of them four years ago when they began making this documentary.","“One of the things that was so difficult about making this movie is that there is just so much pain involved,” Hargitay said. She hopes the documentary “holds up a real hard mirror” to people who have turned a blind eye to this epidemic.","Watch the trailer for “I Am Evidence” below. Story continues below video.","And the film is a hard one to look away from. “I Am Evidence” features 14 courageous survivors telling their stories of assault and the subsequent poking and prodding that comes with enduring a rape kit.","“I am evidence that there is more to that box, there is a human being there. It is not just a kit. This is a person,” a survivor named Erica says in the film.","The women discuss the inevitable re-victimization of being questioned by law enforcement and the agonizing wait to get their kits tested ― a wait that often never ends.","“The fact of the matter is, if we have DNA testing, if we have the ability to fix this problem and we don’t test these kits, we’re saying that sexual assault is not important,” Hargitay said.","Since the rape kit backlog hit the public consciousness nearly 10 years ago, 225,000 rape kits have been uncovered, according to a program called End The Backlog. That program is the work of anti-sexual violence nonprofit The Joyful Heart Foundation, which Hargitay founded after thousands of survivors shared their abuse stories with her after she began appearing as Detective Olivia Benson on “SVU.”","Testing rape kits is important for several reasons: It can identify an unknown perpetrator, it can confirm the presence of a known suspect, it can confirm a survivor’s account of an assault, it can help solve other cases that might not involve sexual violence, it can exonerate innocent people.","And it can connect a suspect to other crimes around the country.","Indeed, a disturbing takeaway from the film is just how common serial rapists are. One scene depicts law enforcement officials, who have finally begun testing old rape kits, linking one rapist to two women living in completely different parts of the country. By testing the kits, police are finally catching serial offenders.","“I Am Evidence” lays out the root causes of this countrywide backlog: misogyny and racism. The systemic lack of policies and protocols, of resources and funding, and ― most glaringly ― of training for first responders, reflects these prejudices. As with other systems that abuse and disregard marginalized people, poor black women get the worst of it.","“Nobody gives a damn about women in this country,” concludes Detroit prosecutor Kym Worthy in the film. Worthy has been tackling the rape kit backlog head-on since 2009, when 11,000 untested rape kits were uncovered in her city.","Adlesic said it’s “absolutely necessary” for first responders to receive sexual assault training and recalled an “I Am Evidence” screening last year where a man made a powerful comment during the Q&A portion.","“He was quite emotional and spoke about being an emergency room doctor. He hadn’t had the training to conduct a sexual assault kit, and he was so afraid he was going to get it wrong, or make someone feel awful for not knowing how to do it,” she said. “It helped us understand that we really need to advocate for a curriculum in medical schools and law enforcement agencies so that people learn how to do this.”","All too often, police officers learn the law, but no one teaches them the varying ways victims respond to trauma. Along with bringing their own prejudices to the job, officers often don’t know what trauma looks like or how trauma affects memory. They also might not realize how often sexual violence triggers involuntary paralysis in a victim ― an often-forgotten “freeze” component of the fight-or-flight reflex ― in order to get them out of the situation alive.","Hargitay described the lack of resources to investigate these crimes, as well as cultural misunderstandings surrounding sexual violence, as a “microcosm” of how we as a country regard women.","“Trish and I, we wanted to make a hard-hitting film,” she said. “It is a painful movie to watch, and it’s the facts. And it’s time that we take a look at not sweeping this under the carpet, that we treat women, and treat our society, and all survivors with the humanity, the empathy that they deserve.”","Adlesic told HuffPost she hopes this documentary forces people to care about this issue and creates change. Most of all, she hopes this film shows survivors that they’re not alone.","“I want them to know that we understand, and that we care and that we want to help give them the support they need and deserve,” she said. “I want survivors to feel heard and know that they matter, and that violence against women matters, and that we walk in hand with you to a better way of life for everyone.”","“I Am Evidence” will air on HBO on Monday, April 16, at 8 p.m. Eastern."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ad09ee51f0000260616d11f.png?cache=q5e4FDr5OP&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Ex-Ambassador To Vietnam Quit Because Trump Planned To Deport More Refugees","authors":"Kimberly Yam","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/former-ambassador-to-vietnam-quit-because-of-trumps-deportations-of-refugees_us_5ace7866e4b0648767767941","short_description":"Ted Osius revealed why he quit in October: \"There was an ethical line that I could not cross.\"","date":"2018-04-13"},"articleContent":["As deportations and detentions continue to rock the Vietnamese community in the U.S., the former ambassador to Vietnam has revealed that those “repatriations” were the reason for his October departure.","Writing in the April issue of Foreign Service Journal, Ted Osius said he was instructed to press the Vietnamese government to repatriate more than 8,000 people ― most of whom were refugees who had “fled South Vietnam on boats and through the jungle” after the Vietnam War.","“The majority targeted for deportation — sometimes for minor infractions — were war refugees who had sided with the United States, whose loyalty was to the flag of a nation that no longer exists,” Osius wrote. “And they were to be ‘returned’ decades later to a nation ruled by a communist regime with which they had never reconciled. I feared many would become human rights cases, and our government would be culpable.”","The former diplomat said a number of the Trump administration’s foreign policy decisions didn’t sit right with those in the foreign relations field. Among those moves, he said, were the United States’ exit from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, its “abdication of responsibility” on climate change, and the travel ban targeting mostly Muslim-majority countries.","“What happened to the nation that welcomed ‘your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free?’” Osius asked.","But the former ambassador said he reached his limit when he was told to push for the repatriations. Not only did he feel this was a human rights issue, Osius said, but also that this “repulsive policy” would interfere with President Donald Trump’s other goals in Vietnam, like reducing the trade deficit and bolstering military relations.","“I voiced my objections, was instructed to remain silent, and decided there was an ethical line that I could not cross if I wished to retain my integrity,” he wrote. “I concluded that I could better serve my country from outside government, by helping to build a new, innovative university in Vietnam.”","A State Department spokesperson gave HuffPost a statement that said Osius is “entitled to his personal views” as a private citizen, but doubled down on the Trump administration’s deportation policy.","“We respect Ambassador Osius’ many years of service to the U.S. government,” the statement said. “Facilitating the removal of aliens from the United States who are subject to a final order of removal, particularly those who pose a danger to national security or public safety, is a top priority for the U.S. government.”","The statement also said that “each country has an international legal obligation to accept the return of its nationals whom another state seeks to expel, remove, or deport,” and claimed that the U.S. has been cooperating with foreign governments in documenting and accepting “our citizens.”","Many of the refugees who are facing deportation entered the U.S. legally in the aftermath of the Vietnam War, and obtained green cards as well. After being convicted of crimes, many of which occurred decades ago, the refugees received orders of removal due to their criminal records.","But many have not had contact with the criminal justice system for years and have been leading new lives, advocates say. Nancy Nguyen, the executive director of a nonprofit VietLead, explained that the greater Southeast Asian community is grappling with many of the issues Osius raised.","“Osius’ writings reflect the concerns and worries of many Vietnamese and Southeast Asian families who are now threatened with deportation,” she told HuffPost in an email. “Folks are being forced to return to a country they do not know, being separated from families in the U.S. that depend on them.”","Nguyen noted that several of these deportations violate a 2008 agreement between the U.S. and Vietnam. That “Memorandum of Understanding” allowed for the deportation of Vietnamese nationals who face removal orders only if they arrived in the U.S. on or after July 12, 1995.","However, she said, there have been several recent cases where authorities detained Vietnamese nationals who arrived before 1995. A few have also been deported. The MOU is still in force, according to Nguyen.","A few weeks ago, around 40 Vietnamese refugees who came to the U.S. before the 1995 cutoff sued U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for unlawful, prolonged detention. The lawsuit noted that many more could be in a similar situation. In total, about 8,000 to 10,000 Vietnamese refugees have orders of removal and are at risk for detention.","The mass roundups and detentions have spanned the Southeast Asian community, likely affecting U.S. relations with several other nations, Nguyen said. More than 40 Cambodians were deported earlier this month.","“The United States is continuing to bully these countries. This is not just about Vietnam, but about all the countries that the U.S. is now bullying to take back more and more of our community members ― this includes Cambodia, this includes Laos,” Nguyen told HuffPost. “We fear that the U.S. will continue to retreat from its responsibilities to these countries and our community members who bore witness to mass carnage and war only decades ago.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5acfa9cd1e000008087b1582.jpeg?cache=Jd1pmhYgwZ&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Cynthia Nixon Issues Progressive Call To Arms: ‘Time Is Up For Corporate Democrats’","authors":"Daniel Marans","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cynthia-nixon-time-is-up-corporate-democrats_us_5ad0db3de4b0edca2cb968f8","short_description":"The actress and activist faces an uphill climb in her left-wing challenge of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D).","date":"2018-04-13"},"articleContent":["WASHINGTON ― New York gubernatorial challenger Cynthia Nixon said Friday she embraces the disdain of the so-called “Democratic establishment,” and called on her fellow political newcomers to take over the party.","“We may have come here today from different states, from different backgrounds and for different reasons. But everyone here today has something in common: The Democratic establishment didn’t want us to run,” Nixon said to an audience of hundreds participating in the Progressive Change Campaign Committee’s candidate training. “Well that’s too bad, because here we are.”","“We’ve tried it their way. We’ve seen the results. If 2016 taught us anything, it’s that Democrats can’t just give voters something to vote against,” she continued. “We have to give them something to vote for.”","Nixon, a Democrat and education activist best known for her starring role in HBO’s hit series “Sex and the City,” faces an uphill climb in her left-wing challenge of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D). However, the loud ovations she received in a ballroom at the Omni Shoreham Hotel suggest she is already a favorite with the party’s progressive base.","For rank-and-file liberals still reeling from the 2016 election loss, Nixon’s bid has a natural appeal. In Cuomo, Nixon is taking on one of the most powerful Democrats in the country.","The governor has considerable progressive accomplishments, including same-sex marriage, gun regulations and more recently a $15 minimum wage and paid family leave, which requires employers to provide paid time off to care for family members.","But Cuomo’s fiscally conservative budgetary policy and reputation for heavy-handed governance have earned him a national reputation as a transactional moderate leader.","A particular sore point is Cuomo’s alleged tolerance of a breakaway faction of Democrats that have enabled Republicans to control the state Senate chamber despite consistent Democratic numerical majorities since 2012. Until last week, a group of eight Democratic state senators was part of a GOP-aligned Independent Democratic Conference, and a ninth Democrat, Simcha Felder, caucuses with Republicans.","The Democratic Assembly has passed progressive bills to create a state-level single-payer system and combat climate change, but thanks to the IDC and Felder, the GOP-controlled Senate has prevented the sweeping legislation for coming up for a vote.","Nixon made Cuomo’s coziness with the IDC a major campaign theme.","But last week, Cuomo brokered a deal for the IDC to return to the mainline Democratic Senate caucus. Felder is still caucusing with the GOP, however. And for many progressive activists, the timing of the rapprochement ― coming as it did, after Cuomo had already hammered out a more moderate budget with the IDC’s help ― meant the move was too little too late.","Nixon too remains dissatisfied, likening Cuomo last week to someone who set his “own house on fire and watched it burn for eight years.”","“Finally turning on a hose doesn’t make you a hero,” she said.","Cuomo gave Nixon some ammunition for her argument on Thursday evening when activists captured him on camera arriving at a fundraiser held by former members of the Independent Democratic Conference. Although the fundraiser was mainly for two Democratic Senate candidates running in April 24 special elections, some former IDC members were in attendance and had the opportunity to benefit from the money raised.","“The governor is 100 percent focused on maintaining a unified Democratic Party to fight Trump in Washington, take back the House and the State Senate,” said Cuomo campaign spokeswoman Abbey Fashouer.","Nixon nonetheless seized on the appearance as evidence that Cuomo was still siding with the IDC, in contravention of his previous promises.","On Friday, Nixon made clear that the main fight in New York is still between progressive Democrats and the more cautious establishment that Cuomo embodies.","“Andrew Cuomo and the Trump Democrats of the IDC brokered a backroom deal to hand power to the Republicans to ensure many of our progressive priorities die in the Senate,” Nixon said.","“Well, we’ve got news for them: The time is up for corporate Democrats ― for politicians who campaign as Democrats but govern as Republicans,” she continued. The crowd gave her the loudest applause of her entire speech.","Nixon’s run against has inevitably drawn comparisons to Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-Vt.) presidential primary contest against Hillary Clinton in 2016.","And there are certainly parallels between Nixon and Sanders, who are both long-shot progressive challengers running against better-known and better-funded Democrats.","But Nixon appears determined to avoid being pegged as a candidate who ignores racial injustice. Critics accused Sanders of failing to offer solutions for black voters specifically, saying he merely addressed their concerns through universal, class-based solutions alone.","Last week, Nixon came out strongly in favor of legalizing marijuana in New York ― and has made the disproportionate racial impact of the status quo a key part of her pitch.","“Legal weed is first and foremost a matter of racial justice. We have to stop putting people in jail for something white people do with impunity,” she said Friday.","Nixon also said she would vacate past convictions for marijuana-related offenses. She added she would fight to ensure that communities of color shared in the economic gains of legalization, arguing that “huge corporations and rich white men like John Boehner” shouldn’t reap all the rewards.","“It is a grave injustice to only let them profit from a product that for decades sent millions of people of color to jail,” she said.","She also articulated the need to end the racist policies that amount to a “school-to-prison pipeline” for the state’s young students of color.","Members of the audience applauded loudly when she discussed the racial implications of marijuana legalization. Several said they appreciated her willingness to discuss the way that race intersects with broader social problems.","Nixon “showed why economic justice supports racial justice,” said James Thompson, who ran a surprisingly competitive bid for Kansas’ 4th Congressional District in an April 2017 special election and is running for the seat once again.","Dinah Mason, a 50-year-old Army veteran and small business consultant from Jacksonville, Florida, also liked Nixon’s remarks.","The new marijuana decriminalization laws are set up “to not allow African-Americans to be able to cash in on or even own certain parts of the new-coming of marijuana,” said Mason, who is planning a 2020 congressional run against Rep. Ted Yoho (R) in Florida’s 3rd Congressional District.","“In everything we do in this country, there is always a stigma connected to it that eliminates certain races from progressing in those areas,” she said."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ad0dc7b1f0000280616d188.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"James Comey: Discussing 'Pee Tape' Dossier With Trump Was 'Out Of Body Experience'","authors":"Marina Fang","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/james-comey-book-pee-tape_us_5ad090b2e4b016a07e9b80e6","short_description":"In his first TV interview promoting his new book, the fired FBI director repeatedly said he was stunned by his interactions with Trump.","date":"2018-04-13"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"MEDIA","headline":"Laura Ingraham Accidentally Delivered The Best Self-Own Of 2018","authors":"Ed Mazza","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/laura-ingraham-self-own-commercial-break_us_5ad0084ce4b016a07e9abf47","short_description":"Fox News host has now lost more than two dozen sponsors.","date":"2018-04-13"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"MEDIA","headline":"Donald Trump's Hometown Newspaper Just Burned Him With A Savage Nickname","authors":"Ed Mazza","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ny-daily-news-trump-pee-cover_us_5ad01136e4b0edca2cb81e0f","short_description":"New York Daily News comes out swinging over Comey's claim that the president was \"obsessed\" with the alleged \"pee tape.\"","date":"2018-04-13"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"BLACK VOICES","headline":"Black Teen Nearly Shot After Knocking On Door Asking For Directions To School","authors":"Jenna Amatulli","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/black-teen-nearly-shot-asking-for-directions_us_5ad0d38be4b077c89ce82acc","short_description":"People are saying the 14-year-old boy's near-death experience is what it means to be black in America.","date":"2018-04-13"},"articleContent":["When 14-year-old Brennan Walker missed his bus on Thursday morning and started walking to school, he thought knocking on a door to ask for directions would help.

The crew begins their evening with a pre-game in which Candi pushes her lip gloss promo code on Instagram live, Tami rolls a blunt, Nadine throws back shots while Van has her face in her phone.","She’s watching Earn get his hair twisted by a new chick on an Instagram story before she laments that her IG feed is “weak as fuck.” She vows then and there to get a photo with Drake at the party tonight, the ultimate stunt on her ex. (Y’all listen to Drake. Y’all know what we mean.) The rest of “Champagne Papi,” the latest installment of “Atlanta,” is devoted to her quest to get a photo with the rap superstar.","But Van’s hunt for Drake is about more than just a photo: She’s searching for her way off the bench. Often reduced to a side character or, as she herself pointed out in the season’s fourth episode, “Lotte’s mom” or an “accessory [Earn] can fuck,” Van has remained vocal about her desire to be seen as an individual who is worth more than how she serves the people around her. Her character is fascinating in ways that the three male leads are not. She always finds herself pushing against the bounds laid out for her by the show despite often coming off as vapid and one-dimensional in her commentary. Van needs to make this power play in order to establish herself as more than a supernumerary who seemingly only makes thoughtless, less than ideal decisions about her life. But when she doesn’t get the photo, it makes a resounding statement that stuntin’ on social media is just an illusion that won’t solve anyone’s issues in real life — not even those of Van, the person who needs a win more than anyone.","On this week’s “Run That Back,” Taryn Finley and Julia Craven discuss Van’s (annoying) status as a secondary character, the use of horror as a recurring theme this season and the beauty of seeing black women talk about IUDs on network television.","After leaving the pre-game, the women ditch their car in a parking lot, recite a secret code so they can hop into a strange party shuttle and ride off to an undisclosed location in the Atlanta suburbs. Once they get past party security, they enter a mansion full of women in bikinis and bodycon dresses holding champagne glasses — an undeniable mockery of 99 percent of rap videos on YouTube right now.","Taryn: I’m mad Van ain’t get her picture with Drake. I was rooting for her.","Julia: I have feelings about this episode.","Taryn: Do tell.","Julia: I want to know why Van always gets the vapid episodes, or those making a point about how nothing is what it seems. Sure, there’s an argument for those episodes being serious along with those about trauma, but Van ALWAYS gets these solo episodes about hanging out with her girls and realizing that everybody is fake. It makes Van seem stupid and superficial, which she isn’t. I’m annoyed.","Taryn: Yea, I noticed that too. I feel like they use her to overstate that point. And the fact that this is the first time we see her since cutting ties with Earn is kinda disappointing. I wanted to see her catch a damn break but I guess this is “Robbin’ Season.”","Julia: I appreciated the nuance in this episode and how it used a party with “Drake” to highlight how superficial everything on social media is though. So we start with this very typical IG live shot of ole girl promoting her promo codes, making kissy faces, getting them views up, finessing some nigga’s Netflix password. Then we flash to Van, who is really worried about what Earn’s homeless ass is doing.","Taryn: I hate that she misses his ashy ass, but I get it, I guess. I really enjoyed the engagement between her and her friends before the party. Four black girls casually talking about their IUDs and niggas. Like other simple, yet intentional, things in this show, that’s something we don’t hear from black women on TV. White women get stuff like that all the time.","Julia: Yes! I loved how they talked about not wanting to talk about their kids and wanting to be more than that, to do more than that. One thing I do love about Van being a side character is how vocal she is about not wanting to be a side character. Have we ever seen a side character be this vocal about being more than that?","Taryn: That’s a really good point, and it makes me wonder if that’s purposeful, too. Black women always be off to the side, not only in TV but in real life, and be having the greatest impact. Van wasn’t playing when she said she was tired in the Helen episode. We see here that even though she’s no longer with ashy, she’s still tired of not getting a damn break, thus her desire to take a picture with Drake at his party and make niggas mad on IG.","Julia: I love how they openly wanted to make niggas mad on IG because SAME.","Taryn: Me, too, my fave modern pastime, tbh. But when they pulled up to the mansion, I hollered when security made them put on booties so their heels don’t scratch up the marble floors. I have this idea of the rules Drake would have to enter his house and that sounds like it would be on there.","Julia: Shit, it’d be on mine, too. I don’t let people wear shoes in my basic-ass apartment, MUCH LESS on my marble floors. (If I had marble anything.)","Also, poor sis who just wanted to get into the party and meet Drake but got snatched up by security outside. I feel for her. She just wanted her IG pic, I ain’t mad. But this moment shows us just how WILD people go for celebs, for the image, for the aesthetic. And I admit I love crafting what people see and what pieces of myself I present to the world. So few of us are authentic, which is why most of us ADORE QUEEN CARDI, but this episode shows that quest for authentic-looking bullshit.","And, you know, sometimes you just wanna stunt on these bitches, climb to the top floor so you can spit on niggas.","Taryn: Yup. I, too, like shitting on niggas. All of us do, but that image has cost folks time, energy and sometimes money. No shade to anyone who stunts on IG, but keeping up that appearance is taxing.","Julia: Absolutely. Like, I staged my meals for 2 days for one pic and I was incredibly over it. It took so much work that I finally just dumped my shit on a plate and here y’all go. Idc.","Taryn: Social media is so powerful. So much of our lives are on display so I get wanting to remind folks I’m a poppin-ass bitch (shoutout to Rico Nasty), but shit ain’t always a mirror image of the ugly, messy shit we’re dealing with. We fall in love with the dopamine effect that’s caused by posting pics and slaying shit for our circle to see.","Julia: Exactly, and it feels good to have a moment of slay when shit is falling apart. I loved that about this episode. Sure, Van’s life is in shambles, lowkey. And she just wanna stunt. I’m not mad.","After getting indoors, the crew pops some edibles courtesy of Candi’s quasi-boyfriend.

Van, annoyed that she has to deal with this, goes looking for some water to help her friend calm down. She bumps into Brandon, a random dude at the party. He hands Van a bottle of water and walks with her back to Nadine, who has vanished. Van starts to panic but eventually calms down and follows Brandon down to the home’s bottom floor — all because he promised her access to a power outlet so she could find her friend and a bathroom. Thankfully, Nadine is safe and is sitting beside the pool talking about the fallacies of life with Darius.","Julia: Another issue I have this season is how Van’s sound judgement is just gone, even though I get that it’s out the window because of her complete absorption with fixing her life. BUT DAMN SIS CAN’T DO BOTH?!","I was on edge the entire episode. When the dude driving the shuttle said, “I’m gonna take y’all home with me” to her going into the basement with Drake’s nutritionist’s cousin, my nerves was shot. This episode following “Teddy Perkins” had me ON THE EDGE. I was like, “I KNOW THEY NOT GONNA KILL VAN AND DARIUS LIVED” (even though I stan for Darius).","Taryn: Yea, that was really creepy. I was getting bad vibes when they pulled up to the lot looking for the shuttle in the first place, tbh. So did Van. I could tell. But when Patron and Drake lyrics get into your system, you don’t give one fuck about sound judgment.","Julia: And this episode mixes the season’s two major elements, horror and social media, which has been so fascinating! The show already does a good job of imitating real life but they’re grabbing onto our generation’s biggest vice and mixing it with the genre that best depicts the black American experience. So it’s like a morbid(ish) depiction of “this is what happens when you always on that phone.” That’s how Darius ending up at Teddy Perkins’ House of Horrors. He saw an ad for a free piano on a message board. But we first saw it in the last Van-centric episode, where she was wandering off alone during a search for her phone.","Taryn: Wow. Now look who’s the smartest bitch in the world.","Julia: Ma’am lmao. Also, I am mad at Nadine.","Taryn: I knew I was gonna be pissed with Nadine the moment she came on the screen. Like bitch, how you gon leave your friend. I was livid.","Julia: I know we’ve all been that friend but also come on bruh. I’m just glad she ended up with Darius (which I think it’s so funny that he was there but it also makes sense) instead of a rapist or something.","And meanwhile, Van is in the basement of a big-ass house with a man she doesn’t know and a dead phone.","Taryn: Oh THAT’S Nadine. I thought that was the girl who left to go to T-Pain’s party. But, yeah, I was mad at her high ass, too, but I guess I get it. I’m glad she ended up with Darius, too, because that could’ve went left.","Julia: LMAOOOOOOOO.","Taryn: Lmao I be so lost. You see I had to take God’s hand right there to get to the truth.","Julia: She could have ended up in harm’s way. But she just sat in a pool with Darius and dissected the simulation of importance and fame surrounding them, which is a great high conversation.","So, tbh, Nadine had the best night.","Taryn: I have definitely been the friend just off to the side under the influence of something talking to somebody’s brother about the damn universe and deep shit at a party. Whole time I’m MIA. Nadine definitely had the best night.","Tami follows fictional actor Devyonne Johnson around all night before eventually cussing out his white girlfriend and explaining that black women aren’t being chosen by wealthy men of any race. Meanwhile, Van has safely split from Brandon and begins wandering the halls of the home. She finds a huge closet with a Mexican flag lying on the dressing table. She snags a pair of pants and a bomber jacket before continuing her prowl of “Drake’s” house. She then walks up on a Spanish-speaking man who’s seated in a recliner watching a static-filled television screen, which gives us Teddy Perkins vibes. Van doesn’t speak Spanish so she doesn’t know what the man is saying, but a calendar of a soccer player hanging on the wall with the last two weeks of December — including New Year’s Eve — annotated as “EURO TOUR” makes it clear that Drake is not at this party.","Julia: Then there was Tami, who followed that actor and his white girlfriend around the entire night to “talk some sense” into him. Her convo with the white girl was ... well, idk how to feel about it. I don’t think I liked how it was portrayed, though. But I’ll let you go first lol.","Taryn: The way she had this uninterrupted stare had me weak. And honestly they could’ve kept their conversation. I understand homegirl’s passion, though, because I mean, look at who a majority of black men in Hollywood are NOT dating/marrying. The thing that probably stuck out to me the most was when she said, “I love him too!” I think that was telling of how hard we go for black men and we just want to stop being overlooked and shitted on.","Julia: Yeah, that’s kinda how I feel, too. It felt out of place in this episode. I understood what they tried to do, but it seemed like this wasn’t the episode for that.","So let’s circle back around to Van. She’s wandering around in the bowels of this mansion and she steals somebody’s clothes. There’s a Mexican flag lying on the dressing table. Then she walks up on somebody’s abuelo and she thinks it’s Drake’s grandfather. And then she sees the calendar, which says “EURO TOUR,” and it clicks that Drake isn’t there. But the gag is that it didn’t click that this ain’t even Drake’s house, or at least not Drake the rapper. Drake is a half-black, half-Jewish Canadian.","I loved all the cues in the lead-up though. The Mexican flag. The abuelo. The soccer player on the calendar. Darius knowing Drake’s chef “Guillermo.” The cutouts of Drake in the parlor. Then Van’s exclamation at the end that Drake’s Mexican.","Drake has been seen dancing in a Mexican soccer jersey, though.","Taryn: When I realized it wasn’t Drake’s house, girl I hollered. But the fact that no one in the house knew that it wasn’t Drake the rapper’s house really got me, too. Niggas in the basement tryna get folks to pay for photos of them and a cardboard cutout of Drake in this soccer player’s home. It’s so funny because I can imagine this happening to me and my friends. 😂😂😂","Julia: I saw a tweet that said this was an Airbnb party and I SCREAMED!","Taryn: LMAO this was definitely a Airbnb party.","Julia: This episode that was pretty cut-and-dried, though. Nadine summed the point up perfectly: “It’s a simulation, Van. It’s all fake.”","Taryn: Yea, it was. We’re so tied to public perception and our image that we can’t tell what’s real. I get it, Donald! I’m a fake bitch.

I appreciate the interest and concern and look forward to future travels to the United States.”","A B-1 visitor visa allows foreign citizens to travel to the U.S. to attend a scientific, educational, professional or business convention or conference, according to the State Department’s Consular Bureau. People traveling with this visa cannot use it to participate in “paid performances, or any professional performance before a paying audience.”","A spokesperson for Customs and Border Patrol confirmed to HuffPost that Abdel-Magied was denied entry because she “did not possess the appropriate visa to receive monetary compensation for the speaking engagements she had planned during her visit to the United States.”","“She was deemed inadmissible to enter the United States for her visit, but was allowed to withdraw her application for admission,” the spokesperson said in a statement, adding that Abdel-Magied is “eligible to reapply for a visa for future visits.”","The official also said that the “issuance of a visa or a visa waiver does not guarantee entry to the United States.”","PEN World Voices Festival organizers defended Abdel-Magied’s visa in a statement forwarded to HuffPost, arguing that the activist was “traveling on a type of visa that she had used in the past for similar trips without issue.”","Festival organizers called on Customs and Border Patrol to allow her back into the U.S. They did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s inquiry on whether Abdel-Magied was being paid for her appearance at the festival.","“Plane is up,” Abdel-Magied wrote in one of her last tweets Wednesday evening. “See y’all on the other side, inshallah.”","The final destination of Abdel-Magied’s return flight was unclear, and she did not return HuffPost’s request for comment late Wednesday.","Abdel-Magied, a 2015 recipient of Queensland’s Australian of the Year award, is no stranger to the controversy that comes with being a feminist, activist and Muslim woman ― especially one who is vocal about social justice.","Her liberal views, her challenging of capitalism and her defense of Islam have led some Australian politicians, and many more online trolls, to publicly denounce her.","In February 2017, a conversation on immigration issues between Abdel-Magied and Australian Sen. Jacqui Lambie turned into a yelling match on the Australian Broadcasting Corp.'s political show “Q&A.”","During the exchange, Abdel-Magied called Islam “the most feminist religion.”","“My frustration is that people talk about Islam without knowing anything about it, and they’re willing to completely negate any of my rights as a human being,” she told Lambie.","That exchange, which went viral across the country, was one incident that led her to become “the most publicly hated Muslim in Australia,” Abdel-Magied later wrote in an op-ed for The Guardian.","Then came a controversial Facebook post she wrote on Anzac Day, a memorial day in Australia honoring military service members.","“Lest we forget (Manus, Nauru, Syria, Palestine),” she wrote on the April 25 holiday, recalling victims of war in other countries, including war refugees.","The post, which she later deleted and apologized for, evoked outrage across Australia, with many accusing the activist of being insensitive.","In July 2017, three months after her Anzac post and five months after her exchange with Lambie, Abdel-Magied left Australia and moved to London.","“Just last year, Yassmin Abdel-Magied was hounded out of Australia by ferocious media and online attacks,” reads a blurb for her PEN World Voices Festival event.","She was scheduled to speak alongside Muslim American activist Amani Al-Khatahbeh about “how to survive and thrive in cultures that hate them.”","In a statement, festival organizers said, “We are dismayed that an invited guest to our annual PEN World Voices Festival in New York ... was turned away by US Immigration officials in Minneapolis, reportedly had her phone and passport seized, and was put back on a plane to Amsterdam.”","“Abdel-Magied is an advocate of the rights of Muslim women and refugees and is a citizen of Australia, traveling on that country’s passport,” the statement continued.","“The very purpose of the PEN World Voices Festival, founded after 9/11 to sustain the connectedness between the U.S. and the wider world, is in jeopardy at a time when efforts at visa bans and tightened immigration restrictions threaten to choke off vital channels of dialogue that are protected under the First Amendment right to receive and impart information through in-person cultural exchange.”","This story has been updated to include Abdel-Magied's statement issued Thursday."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aced481200000d30ceb4761.jpeg?cache=ceN4y4ULDO&ops=crop_9_163_1984_1251%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Senate Confirms Controversial Former Coal Lobbyist As Next-In-Line To Lead EPA","authors":"Alexander C.

Heidi Heitkamp (N.D.), Joe Manchin (W.Va.) and Joe Donnelly (Ind.) ― voted to approve the nominee, a former coal lobbyist and Washington insider who sailed through his confirmation process despite his industry ties, contrarian views on widely accepted science and controversies in his past Senate dealings.","The 53-to-45 vote comes nearly two weeks after EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt began facing intense pressure to resign over accusations of corruption and wasted tax dollars, and just over an hour after a former staffer’s new allegations emerged. If Pruitt exits, Wheeler is next in line to lead the agency. The White House is already considering replacing Pruitt with Wheeler, The Daily Caller, the conservative tabloid that has lately served as a clearinghouse for the administration’s EPA news, reported Wednesday.","Technically, Wheeler would need to be confirmed in another Senate vote to become the permanent administrator, according to Bob Perciasepe, the former deputy EPA administrator who served for five months as acting administrator in 2013. But the acting rules are complicated and riddled with loopholes that give the White House leeway over who commands a federal agency in the absence of its Senate-approved chief.","“It’s like a shadow confirmation vote for the next administrator of the EPA,” Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) said ahead of the vote. “It’s an attempt to slip by at the end of the week ... the nomination and confirmation of a man who stands for just the opposite of the credentials of a candidate to run the EPA.”","Wheeler won confirmation with more support than Pruitt did when the Senate narrowly approved his nomination in February 2017. At the time, just two Democrats, Heitkamp and Manchin, voted for Pruitt. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) voted against him.","Until mid-2017, Wheeler worked as a lobbyist for Murray Energy, the mining giant owned by coal magnate Bob Murray. Murray has been a top Trump donor and bombastic political commentator who wields staggering influence in the White House. He provided the Trump administration with an “action plan” that called for a federal bailout of coal-fired plants, repeal of the Obama-era Clean Power Plan and a challenge to the 2009 EPA “endangerment finding” that determined carbon dioxide pollution poses a risk to public health.","At a confirmation hearing in November, Democrats hammered Wheeler on his record of working for Murray. But they largely skimmed over Wheeler’s refusal to accept the overwhelming consensus among scientists that burning fossil fuels is the chief cause of climate change.","“I believe that man has an impact on the climate, but what’s not completely understood is what the impact is,” Wheeler said at his confirmation hearing when confronted with the findings of the federal government’s latest climate report.","In March 2010, Wheeler accused the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change of blurring “the lines between science and advocacy” and functioning “more as a political body than a scientific body,” suggesting the EPA could “reconsider its endangerment finding without almost exclusively relying upon the IPCC,” according to remarks posted to his website. At Wheeler’s confirmation hearing, Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said the former lobbyist assured him privately that he “views EPA’s legal authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, which is based on the ‘endangerment finding,’ as settled law.”","Wheeler made attempts to woo critics at his confirmation hearing, calling EPA staffers “the most dedicated and hard-working employees in the federal government.”","Compared with the president’s other environmental nominees, Wheeler came off polished and a safer bet. He spent four years at the EPA’s Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics under Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton. He later served as counsel to the Republicans on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and as an aide to Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.).","His record in Congress, and the way he later used the relationships he built there, raised concerns before his confirmation. In 2005, state air pollution regulators accused Wheeler of abusing his power to bully and intimidate them after their nonpartisan association came out against an anti-climate bill that his then-boss, Inhofe, had sponsored. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a government accountability and transparency watchdog, told HuffPost in February that the 13-year-old case “raises serious concerns as to Wheeler’s judgment.”","In a speech on Thursday, Inhofe said “nothing in the article is true.”","In early February, the Sierra Club asked the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee to postpone a vote to advance Wheeler’s nomination to the Senate for final confirmation after The Intercept published a report detailing fundraisers that Wheeler had held for Sens. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) and Inhofe in May, five months before his formal nomination and two months before his first White House interview for the job. But Republicans, who hold a one-seat majority on the committee, ignored the request and voted along party lines to approve the nomination.","Democrats lobbied hard to upend other nominations, including those of Kathleen Hartnett-White, Trump’s pick to lead the White House Council on Environmental Quality, and Michael Dourson, the president’s choice to run the EPA’s chemical safety division. Hartnett-White, a former Texas regulator, credited coal with helping to end slavery and admonished her own party for not campaigning on the idea that environmental problems don’t exist. Dourson’s consultancy was described in 2014 by InsideClimate News as the “one-stop science shop” for affirmative research for the chemical and tobacco industries. Both nominees withdrew amid waning support.","“Andrew Wheeler is ready and waiting, and waiting, and waiting to clock in as deputy administrator of EPA,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Thursday. “His qualifications are beyond question.”","None of the 10 Democrats on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee voted to advance Wheeler’s nomination in February. But no Democrats on the committee raised Wheeler’s nomination as a concern in January during Pruitt’s first appearance before the panel since taking office.","On Wednesday, Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.) demanded that Republicans delay the confirmation vote “to ensure [Wheeler] receives the same thorough vetting process a EPA Administrator would receive.” But the GOP once again disregarded the request.","On Thursday morning, the Senate voted 53 to 45 to invoke cloture on Wheeler’s nomination, ending debate on his qualifications. Donnelly, who is running for re-election in a red state, joined Heitkamp and Manchin to approve the motion. Democrats took turns pleading with Senate colleagues to reject Wheeler’s nomination, arguing that he hadn’t been properly vetted for the expanded role he was likely to take on as Pruitt faces new allegations that could lead to his departure. Carper alone spoke at least three times.","“We should hear from Andrew Wheeler what his plans are to rein in the abuses at EPA before he takes off,” Carper said after the first vote.","The softened scrutiny could come back to haunt Democrats. Trump has signaled his support for Pruitt, who could end up riding out the wave of criticism over his ballooning scandals. But even if he survives his latest controversies, EPA administrators under Republican administrations have tended to leave office early over the past three decades, including Christine Todd Whitman under President George W. Bush and President Ronald Reagan’s first EPA chief, Anne Gorsuch, to whom Pruitt is frequently compared.","Before his scandals broke, Pruitt was said to be considering a run for the U.S. Senate or governor in Oklahoma, his home state. He also had ambitions to become U.S. attorney general if Jeff Sessions steps down, according to January reports in Politico and Reuters. In March, Vanity Fair reported that Trump was considering the move, though the president disputed a CNN report last week that said he’d considered replacing Sessions with Pruitt as recently as this month.
