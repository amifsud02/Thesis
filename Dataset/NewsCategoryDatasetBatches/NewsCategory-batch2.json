            "A day after an embarrassing error prompted the New York City Board of Elections to rescind unofficial results in the Democratic mayoral primary, the board issued new tallies of candidates’ shares of in-person votes on Wednesday that were similar to the original, errant totals.",
            "Kathryn Garcia trails Eric Adams by a narrow margin in New York City’s Democratic mayoral primary after the city’s Board of Elections ran in-person results through the ranked-choice voting system, eliminating candidates until only two were left.",
            "The results remain unofficial, because they do not account for the nearly 125,000 absentee ballots that Democrats have submitted. Absentee ballots are due to be counted by next Tuesday and official results are expected by July 12.",
            "Still, the preliminary results provide a picture of how the leading candidates fared under the ranked-choice voting system. Following nine rounds of elimination, Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, leads Garcia, the former sanitation commissioner, in the in-person vote, 51.1% to 48.9%.",
            "Before being eliminated in the final round, civil rights attorney Maya Wiley was catching up to Garcia. She received 29.5% to Garcia’s 29.6%; just 347 votes separated her from proceeding to the end in a matchup with Adams.",
            "The preliminary outcome is a major shift from election night on June 22, prior to the implementation of the ranked-choice voting elimination system. That evening, Adams led Wiley in first-choice votes by nine percentage points and Garcia by 11.",
            "“Our campaign was the first choice of voters on Election Day and is leading this race by a significant margin because we put together a five-borough working class coalition of New Yorkers to make our city a safer, fairer, more affordable place,” the Adams campaign said in a Wednesday statement. “There are still absentee ballots to be counted that we believe favor Eric―and we are confident we will be the final choice of New Yorkers when every vote is tallied.”",
            "Garcia appears to have benefited from her decisions to refrain from attacking her opponents and to campaign jointly with entrepreneur Andrew Yang in the final days. Yang instructed his supporters to rank Garcia second, though Garcia did not reciprocate.",
            "In the end, Garcia received slightly more of Yang’s votes after he was eliminated than Adams, and far more of Wiley’s vote than Adams after she was eliminated.",
            "Garcia said in a Wednesday statement that the unofficial results show her and Adams in a “dead heat.”",
            "“Well over 124,000 absentee ballots remain to be counted and the campaign continues to urge patience over the coming weeks,” she said.",
            "Rather than turn on each other, the candidates have been in agreement about their disappointment in the New York City Board of Elections.",
            "“Following yesterday’s embarrassing debacle, the Board of Elections must count every vote in an open way so that New Yorkers can have confidence that their votes are being counted accurately,” Wiley said in a Wednesday statement.",
            "After the board revealed preliminary results on Tuesday, the Adams campaign and other observers noted that the in-person voting totals had increased by a much larger number than the board had claimed on June 22 had yet to be counted.",
            "As the evening progressed on Tuesday, the board removed the results from its website. At around 10:30 p.m. Eastern, the board provided an explanation: It had mistakenly left 135,000 additional test ballots in its software system prior to entering in the actual votes.",
            "The incident prompted rounds of mockery from public officials and journalists marveling at the agency’s elementary error and expressing concern about how the mistake would further undermine confidence in the integrity of elections. Champions of the ranked-choice voting (RCV) system, in particular, feared that the new system ― adopted by city voters in a 2019 referendum ― would take the blame for the entirely unrelated issue of board incompetence.",
            "The president of the NYC Board of Elections, Frederic M. Umane, and board secretary Miguelina Camilo issued an apology on Wednesday.",
            "“Let us be clear: RCV was not the problem, rather a human error that could have been avoided,” the officials said. “We have implemented another layer of review and quality control before publishing information going forward.”",
            "The Adams campaign is not leaving the integrity of additional results up to chance. His campaign ― at first derided and then vindicated for questioning “irregularities” in the results ― has sued for judicial oversight of the vote counting to “ensure a fair and transparent election process.” The step, commonly taken by campaigns as a formality, will enable Adams to get a Kings County Supreme Court judge to review board actions.",
            "Critics of varied ideological stripes are going further, calling for the state legislature to amend the state Constitution so local election authorities are run by nonpartisan technocrats rather than political appointees from both parties.",
            "Others merely questioned why the board chose to release preliminary results at all without accounting for absentee ballots. Waiting for complete results might have provided the board more time to catch its error.",
            "“Why they would put out an interim number is beyond me,” said Sid Davidoff, a city lobbyist with ties to Mayor Bill de Blasio. “The fact that they did it incompetently is a whole other question.”",
            "A spokesperson for the board did not respond to a request for comment on the decision to publish preliminary results."

            "Christina Aguilera tweeted a lengthy message of support for Britney Spears, wishing her former “Mickey Mouse Club” co-star love in light of the allegations she made in court last week about the conservatorship that has ruled her life since 2008.",
            "Spears claimed her father Jamie Spears’ control over her life was “doing me way more harm than good,” alleging she was prescribed lithium against her will and couldn’t have a birth control device removed.",
            "“It is unacceptable that any woman, or human, wanting to be in control of their own destiny might not be allowed to live life as they wish,” Aguilera wrote late Monday alongside a throwback photograph of herself and Spears as children. The two former child stars were frequently pitted against each other during the early 2000s.",
            "“To be silenced, ignored, bullied or denied support by those ‘close’ to you is the most depleting, devastating and demeaning thing imaginable,” Aguilera continued. “The harmful mental and emotional damage this can take on a human spirit is nothing to be taken lightly.”",
            "Aguilera, the latest in a line of celebrities to publicly express support for Spears, acknowledged that she was “not behind the closed doors of this very layered & personal yet public conversation” and that “all I can do is share from my heart on what I’ve heard, read and seen in the media.”",
            "But she said the “conviction and desperation” of Spears’ plea for freedom “leads me to believe that this person I once knew has been living without compassion or decency from those in control.”",
            "“To a woman who has worked under conditions and pressure unimaginable to most, I promise you she deserves all of the freedom possible to live her happiest life,” she concluded. “My heart goes out to Britney. She deserves all the TRUE love and support in the world.”",

            "The whole world got a chance to see on Tuesday what New York City residents already knew: The city’s Board of Elections is dysfunctional.",
            "New York state’s Constitution requires local election authorities to be run by political appointees from both major political parties.",
            "That means that the county-level Democratic and Republican parties in each county in the state appoint an equal number of people to lead ― and manage ― local election authorities.",
            "Virtually every other state in the country has independent, nonpartisan technocrats run their elections.",
            "The result, in New York state in general, and New York City in particular, has been chronic mismanagement and a series of embarrassing scandals that culminated in Tuesday’s revelation of incorrect results. The NYC Board of Elections accidentally published preliminary ranked-choice voting results for the Democratic mayoral primary that included 135,000 test ballots, rescinded them, and posted new ones on Wednesday.",
            "“There’s a fundamental problem having partisan boards of elections,” said Jerry Goldfeder, a Democratic elections attorney. “An independent, professional operation would serve the people of New York much better.”",
            "The Board of Elections’ errors and political shenanigans are nothing new.",
            "In 2012, for example, the board botched the results of an upper Manhattan congressional primary by initially omitting votes in precincts more favorable to the ultimate winner, Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D). And ahead of the 2016 presidential primary, the board admitted to illegally purging some 200,000 registered Democrats from the voter rolls ― a sin it promised to remedy, but never fully explained.",
            "And due to lack of preparation for the unprecedented influx of mail-in ballots, the board disqualified more than 84,000 mail-in ballots in the June 2020 Democratic presidential and congressional primaries on technical grounds like the lack of a postmark from the post office.",
            "There is wide agreement that the lack of a premium on technical expertise, and reliance instead on well-connected party officials’ friends and family members to fill key roles is to blame for the disfunction. Staffers at the NYC Board of Elections routinely clock in and leave for the gym, smoke marijuana on the job or use their working hours to watch Netflix, according to a New York Times investigation in October. Patronage extends into the ranks of computer programmers, where Ruben Díaz III, the son of Bronx Borough President Ruben Díaz Jr., holds a job.",
            "Mike Ryan, the current executive director of the board, went on medical leave months ago. He entrusted the agency’s management to Dawn Sandow, a Bronx Republican appointee, who lacks experience overseeing elections, and who was called a “disaster” as interim leader by a source in the New York Post.",
            "The stakes are especially high this year. The June mayoral primary was New York City’s first major election to employ ranked-choice voting, making it the country’s largest laboratory for the instant-runoff method favored by reformers.",
            "And the national Republican Party is more eager than ever to bolster claims of election fraud ― and undermine federal efforts to protect voting rights.",
            "Already, Republican skeptics are seizing on Tuesday’s chaos as evidence that their concerns about election integrity, fueled by former President Donald Trump’s evidence-free insistence that he won reelection, are well founded.",
            "Tommy Pigott, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee, called New York City’s elections a “preview” of what Democratic voting reform bill H.R. 1 would do to the country’s elections. H.R. 1 would, among other things, strengthen federal oversight of state governments that seek to curtail voting rights with the stated aim of ensuring greater election integrity.",
            "“New York shows we should be enacting measures that improve election integrity, not tearing them down,” Pigott wrote in an email blast to reporters.",
            "Proponents of ranked-choice voting are worried that the mistake will reflect poorly on a system that had nothing to do with the delay in vote counting, let alone the board’s error.",
            "Rob Richie, president of FairVote, which promotes ranked-choice voting (RCV), conceded that it “is a challenge when things are associated with an RCV election.”",
            "What’s more, in August 2020, New York state expanded absentee ballot access by allowing ballots sent out by Election Day to remain eligible so long as they arrive at local election authorities within a week after the election. At the same time, state law still bars localities from counting absentee ballots until after Election Day, rather than as they come in, saddling the system with extra delays.",
            "Even without the error, Richie contends that the Board of Elections’ as-yet-unexplained decision to release incomplete results, rather than waiting to release comprehensive results, was the “worst of both worlds.” The move, he said, ensured that results would neither be available speedily, nor clarify the final outcome when they did arrive.",
            "The Board of Elections also did not respond to offers from the Ranked Choice Voting Resource Center, the nonprofit that developed the RCV software that the city is using, to tabulate the totals in a parallel process as an extra layer of quality control.",
            "Richie praised the board’s willingness to engage nonprofits when designing the ranked-choice ballot, but said, “On other pieces of their operation, they were like a stone wall.”",
            "Still, Richie expressed optimism that voters, more of whom turned out than in any NYC mayoral primary since 1989, would see through the mess. In its apology statement on Wednesday, the board itself made clear that “RCV was not the problem, rather a human error that could have been avoided.”",
            "Critics of ranked-choice voting argue, though, that whether or not RCV is to blame ― and despite the fact that it functions seamlessly in places like Maine and San Francisco ― it might not be the right experiment for New York City, precisely because of the city’s notorious election board.",
            "“When you compound that with other things like waiting a week for absentee ballots and the Board of Elections bureaucracy, you’re adding layers to a system and complicating it,” said Duncan Bryer, a former adviser to New York state Sen. Julia Salazar (D). “To maximize confidence in democracy, voting should be much simpler.”",
            "New York City Councilman Daneek Miller, a Queens Democrat opposed to RCV and backing Eric Adams’ mayoral bid, wants to give voters another chance to stick with, or reject, the RCV system. He’s proposing a ballot referendum on the matter for this November.",
            "“We want to do it now while it’s fresh in people’s mind and not in 2022,” he told CBS News.",
            "Regardless of their views on RCV, reform-minded Democrats largely agree that amending the New York state Constitution to depoliticize boards of elections should be a top priority. Goldfeder even suggested as a temporary measure that New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) use his executive powers to put the city’s board of elections under trusteeship and use that authority to overhaul the agency.",
            "But Cuomo, who has already had more than a decade in power to solve New York’s election woes, does not seem particularly interested in reforms that would deprive him of his own power to distribute patronage jobs through the county parties.",
            "Back in April 2020, Cuomo deferred to Democratic appointees on the state Board of Elections, which has an identical structure to the city board, on whether or not to cancel New York’s presidential primary.",
            "Although Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) formally withdrew from the contest earlier that month, he and his supporters wanted the chance to amass enough national convention delegates to shape the party platform and nominating rules. The state board nonetheless canceled the presidential primary, only to have the election reinstated by federal judges in May 2020.",
            "A spokesperson for the governor did not respond to a request for comment on whether the state should consider amending its Constitution to allow for technocratic voting agencies.",
            "But Jay Jacobs, a Cuomo ally whom the governor tapped to chair the New York State Democratic Party in 2019, told HuffPost that the current organizational structure is ideal.",
            "“Bipartisan boards are the best,” he said.",
            "The state legislature’s two Democratic leaders, Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie and Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, who have shown an increasing appetite for challenging Cuomo, both issued statements expressing concern about Tuesday’s error.",
            "Stewart-Cousins criticized what took place in stronger terms, however, calling the mistake a “national embarrassment” that “must be dealt with promptly and properly.”",
            "She vowed that the state Senate would hold hearings on the New York City Board of Elections’ flub.",
            "State Sen. Zellnor Myrie (D), the progressive Brooklynite who, as elections committee chairman, would preside over those hearings, wrote on Twitter that he is open to a number of proposed reforms.",
            "“Stay tuned for a hearing date and bring all the energy, concerns, and ideas for change to the table,” he said."

            "“I won’t say it again,” interrupts a U.S. Border Patrol agent, giving orders in Spanish for Rojas and a dozen others to get into an idling detention van. “Only passports and money in your hands. Everything else — earrings, chains, rings, watches — in your backpacks. Hats and shoelaces too.”",
            "It’s a frequent scene across the U.S.-Mexico border at a time of swelling migration. But these aren’t farmers and low-wage workers from Mexico or Central America, who make up the bulk of those crossing. They’re bankers, doctors and engineers from Venezuela, and they’re arriving in record numbers as they flee turmoil in the country with the world’s largest oil reserves and pandemic-induced pain across South America.",
            "Two days after Rojas crossed, she left detention and rushed to catch a bus out of the Texas town of Del Rio. Between phone calls to loved ones who didn’t know where she was, the 54-year-old recounted fleeing hardship in Venezuela a few years ago, leaving a paid-off home and once-solid career as an elementary school teacher for a fresh start in Ecuador.",
            "But when the little work she found cleaning houses dried up, she decided to uproot again — this time without her children.",
            "“It’s over, it’s all over,” she said into the phone recently, crying as her toddler grandson appeared shirtless on screen. “Everything was perfect. I didn’t stop moving for one second.”",
            "Last month, 7,484 Venezuelans were encountered by Border Patrol agents along the U.S.-Mexico border — more than all 14 years for which records exist.",
            "The surprise increase has drawn comparisons to the midcentury influx of Cubans fleeing Fidel Castro’s communist rule. It’s also a harbinger of a new type of migration that has caught the Biden administration off guard: pandemic refugees.",
            "Many of the nearly 17,306 Venezuelans who have crossed the southern border illegally since January had been living for years in other South American countries, part of an exodus of nearly 6 million Venezuelans since President Nicolás Maduro took power in 2013.",
            "While some are government opponents fearing harassment and jailing, the vast majority are escaping long-running economic devastation marked by blackouts and shortages of food and medicine.",
            "With the pandemic still raging in many parts of South America, they have had to relocate again. Increasingly, they’re being joined at the U.S. border by people from the countries they initially fled to — even larger numbers of Ecuadorians and Brazilians have arrived this year — as well as far-flung nations hit hard by the virus, like India and Uzbekistan.",
            "U.S. government data shows that 42% of all families encountered along the border in May hailed from places other than Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras — the traditional drivers of migratory trends. That compares with just 8% during the last sharp increase in migration in 2019. The Border Patrol recorded more than 180,000 encounters in May, a two-decade high that includes migrants’ repeated attempts to cross.",
            "Compared with other migrants, Venezuelans garner certain privileges — a reflection of their firmer financial standing, higher education levels and U.S. policies that have failed to remove Maduro but nonetheless made deportation all but impossible.",
            "The vast majority enter the U.S. near Del Rio, a town of 35,000 people, and they don’t try to evade detention but rather turn themselves in to Border Patrol agents to seek asylum.",
            "Like many of the dozens of Venezuelans The Associated Press spoke to this month in Del Rio, 27-year-old Lis Briceno had already migrated once before. After graduating with a degree in petroleum engineering, she couldn’t get hired in the oil fields near her hometown of Maracaibo without declaring her loyalty to Venezuela’s socialist leadership. So she moved to Chile a few years ago, finding work with a technology company.",
            "But as anti-government unrest and the pandemic tanked Chile’s economy, sales plunged and her company shuttered.",
            "Briceno sold what she could — a refrigerator, a telephone, her bed — to raise the $4,000 needed for her journey to the U.S. She filled a backpack and set out with a heart lock amulet she got from a friend to ward off evil spirits.",
            "“I always thought I’d come here on vacation, to visit the places you see in the movies,” Briceno said. “But doing this? Never.”",
            "While Central Americans and others can spend months trekking through the jungle, stowing away on freight trains and sleeping in makeshift camps run by cartels on their way north, most Venezuelans reach the U.S. in as little as four days.",
            "“This is a journey they’re definitely prepared for from a financial standpoint,” said Tiffany Burrow, who runs the Val Verde Border Humanitarian Coalition’s shelter in Del Rio, where migrants can eat, clean up and buy bus tickets to Miami, Houston and other cities with large Venezuelan communities.",
            "They first fly to Mexico City or Cancun, where foreign visitors are down sharply but nearly 45,000 Venezuelans arrived in the first four months of 2021. Smugglers promoting themselves as “travel agencies” have cropped up on Facebook, claiming to offer hassle-free transport to the U.S. in exchange for about $3,000.",
            "“We’re doing things the way they do things here — under the table,” a smuggler said in a voice message a migrant shared with the AP. “You’ll never be alone. Someone will always be with you.”",
            "The steep price includes a guided sendoff from Ciudad Acuna, where the bulk of Venezuelans cross the Rio Grande. The hardscrabble town a few hundred wet steps from Del Rio is attractive to both smugglers and migrants with deeper pockets because it had been largely spared the violence seen elsewhere on the border.",
            "“If you’re a smuggler in the business of moving a commodity — because that’s how they view money, guns, people, drugs and everything they move, as a product — then you want to move it through the safest area possible charging the highest price,” said Austin L. Skero II, chief of the U.S. Border Patrol’s Del Rio sector.",
            "But the number of smugglers caught with weapons has recently increased in the area, and agents who normally hunt down criminals are tied up processing migrants.",
            "The uptick in migrants crossing is “purely a diversion tactic used by the cartels” to carry out crime, Skero said as a group of Haitians carrying young children emerged from a thicket of tall carrizo cane on the riverbank.",
            "Once in the U.S., Venezuelans tend to fare better than other groups. In March, Biden granted Temporary Protected Status to an estimated 320,000 Venezuelans. The designation allows people coming from countries ravaged by war or disaster to work legally in the U.S. and gives protection from deportation.",
            "While new arrivals don’t qualify, Venezuelans requesting asylum — as almost all do — tend to succeed, partly because the U.S. government corroborates reports of political repression. Only 26% of asylum requests from Venezuelans have been denied this year, compared with an 80% rejection rate for asylum-seekers from poorer, violence-plagued countries in Central America, according to Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse.",
            "“I can write their asylum requests almost by heart,” said Jodi Goodwin, an immigration attorney in Harlingen, Texas, who has represented over 100 Venezuelans. “These are higher-educated people who can advocate for themselves and tell their story in a chronological, clean way that judges are accustomed to thinking.”",
            "Even Venezuelans facing deportation have hope. The Trump administration broke diplomatic relations with Maduro when it recognized Juan Guaidó as Venezuela’s rightful leader in 2019. Air travel is suspended, even charter flights, making removal next to impossible.",
            "Meanwhile, as the migrants leave Del Rio to reconnect with loved ones in the U.S., they are confident that with sacrifice and hard work, they’ll get an opportunity denied them back home.",
            "Briceno said that if she had stayed in Venezuela, she would earn the equivalent of $50 a month — barely enough to scrape by.",
            "“The truth is,” says Briceno, hustling to catch a bus to Houston where her boyfriend landed a well-paying oil industry job, “it’s better to wash toilets here than being an engineer over there.”"

            "WEST DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — In the past week alone, Nikki Haley regaled activists in Iowa, Mike Pence courted donors in California and Donald Trump returned to the rally stage, teasing a third campaign for the White House.",
            "The midterms are more than a year away, and there are 1,225 days until the next presidential election. But Republicans eyeing a White House run are wasting no time in jockeying for a strong position in what could emerge as an extremely crowded field of contenders.",
            "The politicking will only intensify in the coming weeks, particularly in Iowa, home to the nation’s leadoff presidential caucuses and a state where conservative evangelicals play a significant role in steering the direction of the GOP. Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas is slated to visit on Tuesday, and others, including Pence, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo are expected to appear in July.",
            "The flurry of activity is a sign that there is no clear frontrunner to lead the GOP if Trump opts against a 2024 campaign.",
            "“It definitely feels early, but it doesn’t feel like it’s a bad idea based on the situation,” said Mike DuHaime, a longtime Republican strategist. “The party has changed, the voters are changing and I think the process has changed. And I think many of the candidates have realized that.”",
            "For now, a central question in Republican politics is whether Trump, who continues to advance lies about his loss last year to Joe Biden, will run again. The former president has said he will make a decision after next year’s midterms.",
            "In the meantime, he faces mounting legal vulnerabilities, including the potential that prosecutors in Manhattan may file criminal charges against his company as soon as this week. Trump is also under investigation by a district attorney in Georgia for attempting to pressure elections officials to change results in his favor.",
            "Still, Trump, who left office in January under the cloud of impeachment for inciting a riot at the U.S. Capitol, is flirting with a political future. Returning to the rally stage last weekend for the first time as a private citizen, Trump looked every bit the candidate as an enthusiastic crowd of thousands in Ohio chanted, “Four more years!”",
            "“We won the election twice,” he said. “And it’s possible we’ll have to win it a third time.”",
            "The specter of Trump has been especially challenging for Republicans like Pence. As a conservative evangelical Christian who was Trump’s unflinchingly loyal vice president, Pence would seem appealing to many of the party’s activists. But his decision to follow the constitutional process and certify Biden’s win angered many in the GOP.",
            "Though he still heaps praise on Trump’s accomplishments, Pence has worked more recently to forge his own identity, splitting with his former boss in particular over the severity of the deadly Jan. 6 riot, which forced him into hiding but which many Republicans have sought to minimize.",
            "That balancing act came into sharp relief Thursday as Pence delivered a speech at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in front of a sold-out crowd of more than 800 people during a swing through California that included meetings with donors and a headline speech at a Republican National Committee dinner.",
            "After being booed and jeered the week before at a conservative conference in Florida, Pence appeared to have a newfound sense of swagger as he delivered his strongest rebuttal to date of Trump’s continued insistence that he could have unilaterally overturned the results of the last election. Many of Trump’s supporters continue to blame Pence for Trump’s loss, even though he had no power to overturn the results.",
            "“The truth is, there’s almost no idea more un-American than the notion that any one person could choose the American president,” Pence said, adding that he would “always be proud that we did our part, on that tragic day, to reconvene the Congress and fulfill our duty under the Constitution and the laws of the United States.”",
            "It’s been a similar tightrope act for Haley, Trump’s former ambassador to the United Nations and a former governor of South Carolina, who sharply criticized Trump after the Jan. 6 Capitol riot but has since largely avoided the subject.",
            "At a Thursday dinner during a three-day swing across Iowa, Haley presented herself to about 500 Republican activists as a next-generation conservative figure.",
            "Like Pence, Haley spent much of her speech praising Trump’s time in office and sharing anecdotes of her work with him that lit chuckles throughout the hall, while ignoring the deadly siege at the Capitol as well as Trump’s monthslong campaign to cast doubt on the outcome of the 2020 election, even though there is no evidence of the widespread fraud he alleges.",
            "“I saw firsthand as ambassador to the United Nations that Donald Trump put America first, sometimes in the most interesting of ways,” she said.",
            "Haley was also the guest on a popular conservative radio talk show Friday and headlined fundraisers for statehouse and county leaders, including Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds.",
            "“There are a lot of reasons why I love Iowa,” she said. “But maybe the biggest reason is that Iowa loves to elect badass Republican women.”",
            "The activity is not surprising to activists in the states that will ultimately have first say in picking their party’s candidates.",
            "“It takes a while to court states like New Hampshire and Iowa,” said Greg Moore, the New Hampshire state director of Americans for Prosperity, a conservative political advocacy group founded by the Koch brothers. “And it’s fine and dandy if you’re President Trump and you have a prebuilt infrastructure in the state and just have to turn the key. But for everyone else, you have to build that.”",
            "So far, polls and interviews suggest voters are a long way from picking favorites, though Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is frequently mentioned as a possible Trump successor. He is notably one of the few leading Republicans who has yet to visit Iowa this year.",
            "At last week’s GOP event in California, retiree Bob Egbert, 75, praised Trump but doubted a third run would be good for the party. Egbert likes what he sees in DeSantis and considered Pence’s low-key personality as a liability with voters.",
            "“I think he would be a nice, bland candidate,” said Egbert, a Republican. “I don’t think that’s what we need.”",
            "Former California Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican, predicted a “spirited contest” in 2024, but declined to identify a favorite among the emerging candidates.",
            "As for Trump?",
            "“It is, after all ... his decision. It’s a decision he shares with his family,” Wilson said. “He is much admired. It’s obvious from what has occurred he is much feared and demonized by this (Biden) administration.”",

            "Sandra S. Weyer, also known as Sandy Pomeroy Weyer, recorded several men assaulting the photographer, who can be heard screaming in the video, according to an FBI affidavit, which did not name the victim. As the photographer got up, approached her assailants and tried to retrieve her backpack, Weyer allegedly yelled, “Fucking traitor, get the fuck out!” and “Get her out! Mace her!”",

            "“I did what needed to be done! I’m happy,” she allegedly said to another person.",

            "ROME (AP) — Hush-hush diplomacy. In-person visits. Hush-hush diplomacy. In-person visits. And a very public no-surprises agreement on Iran.",
            "U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid met in Rome on Sunday as their new governments look to turn the page on former President Donald Trump and former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose close alliance aggravated partisan divisions within both countries.",
            "Now, with Trump sidelined in Florida and Netanyahu leading the opposition, President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Naftali Bennett are focused on pragmatic diplomacy rather than dramatic initiatives that risk fomenting opposition at home or distracting from other priorities.",
            "“In the past few years, mistakes were made,” Lapid told Blinken as they sat down for talks in a Rome hotel. “Israel’s bipartisan standing was hurt. We will fix those mistakes together.”",
            "Lapid said he had spoken with Democrats and Republicans since taking office and had “reminded them all that we share America’s most basic, basic values — freedom, democracy, free markets and constant search for peace.”",
            "Blinken noted that even though the two governments are new, “the foundation that we’re working on is one of an enduring partnership, a relationship, friendship between the United States and Israel.”",
            "The push means aiming for smaller achievements, such as shoring up the informal cease-fire that ended last month’s war with Gaza’s militant Hamas rulers and replenishing Israel’s Iron Dome defense system. A major push to revive the long-dormant peace process between Israel and the Palestinians could unsettle the delicate balance.",
            "“Nobody thinks it’s a good idea to start charging through on a major new peace initiative,” said Ilan Goldenberg, a Mideast security expert at the nonprofit Center for a New American Security. “But there are things you can do quietly under the radar, on the ground, to improve the situation.”",
            "That approach — of managing the conflict rather than trying to solve it — may succeed in papering over domestic divisions. But it also maintains a status quo that the Palestinians find increasingly oppressive and hopeless, and which has fueled countless cycles of unrest.",
            "The Americans and Israelis will try to work out differences away from the public, as in Biden’s “quiet” diplomacy, when he privately urged Netanyahu to wind down the Israel-Hamas war ahead of a truce that took effect May 21.",
            "“We believe the way to discuss those disagreements is through direct and professional conversation, not a press conference,” Lapid said.",
            "Both governments will try to preserve Israel’s fragile governing coalition, in part by reducing provocations that played a part in sparking the 11-day war that claimed at least 254 Palestinian lives and killed 13 people in Israel.",
            "The new coalition in Israel shares little beyond the conviction that Netanyahu had to go. It’s composed of eight parties, each effectively with veto power on decisions. So if even one party bolts, Israel’s government would be at serious risk of collapse, with Netanyahu waiting just offstage.",
            "At least in the short term, Lapid, a centrist, will be Israel’s point man on repairs to the tattered relationship with Biden and the Democrats. The party controls both houses of Congress but is increasingly divided on the Mideast conflict, with progressive members calling for the U.S. to exert more pressure on Israel.",
            "“What they’re building now is mutual trust,” said Michael Oren, former Israeli ambassador to the United States under Netanyahu. “I expect a change of tone rather than of substance... but there’s a possibility that it could produce something better for Israel.”",
            "Topping the agenda in both countries are talks in Vienna over reviving Iran’s 2015 accord with world powers to limit Tehran’s ability to develop nuclear weapons. Trump, with Netanyahu’s backing, pulled the U.S. out of the deal in 2018 and imposed sanctions on the Islamic Republic. Biden promised to restore and expand the agreement.",
            "Now, Israel’s new government seems intent on staying engaged and trying to influence the talks, rather than scuttle them.",
            "“Israel has some serious reservations about the Iran nuclear deal that is being put together in Vienna,” Lapid said, before pledging that Israel would make its objections privately. Netanyahu had loudly and publicly opposed the deal when the Obama administration was negotiating it.",
            "“We have the same objective,” Blinken said. “Sometimes we differ on the tactics, and we, I think, are very clear and direct to each other when that’s the case and that’s exactly how it’s supposed to be.”",
            "Even the right-leaning Bennett, who is ideologically aligned with the hawkish Netanyahu, has toned down the rhetoric on Iran.",
            "“We will continue to consult with our friends, persuade, discuss, and share information and insights out of mutual respect,” Bennett said Thursday. “But at the end of the day, we will be responsible for our own fate, nobody else.”",
            "Tamping down tensions — or at least not inflaming them — is a key strategy, the officials said.",
            "Blinken spoke of the need to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict but did not offer any kind of timetable or any strategy to “offer a more hopeful future for everyone: Palestinians and Israelis alike with equal measures of opportunity and dignity.”",
            "And, while the Biden administration supports and hopes to expand on the Trump-era Abraham Accords that normalized relations between Israel and several Arab countries, Blinken said they “are not a substitute for engaging on the issues between Israelis and Palestinians that need to be resolved.”",
            "On the U.S. side, the Biden administration has made clear it wants to extricate the country from intractable conflicts in the Middle East and focus on other challenges, such as climate change and competition with China.",
            "On Monday, outgoing Israeli President Reuven Rivlin is to visit Washington at Biden’s invitation. A group of House Democrats are planning an official trip to Israel as soon as Congress’ July 4th recess.",
            "There’s even talk of Lapid and Bennett traveling to Washington later in the summer, separately or together, the officials said. Bennett will serve as prime minister for the first two years, followed by Lapid, the architect of the coalition.",
            "All the officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss administration plans and logistics, which have not been finalized.",
            "So far, the reset seems to be functioning. But with the Israeli coalition barely two weeks old, significant challenges loom.",
            "Biden has moved to reverse Netanyahu-backed Trump policies that alienated the Palestinians, and the administration has said Israelis and Palestinians should enjoy equal measures of security and prosperity.",
            "But the U.S. has yet to explain how it intends to bring that about without ending Israel’s half-century military occupation of the West Bank, its blockade on Hamas-ruled Gaza and discriminatory policies in Jerusalem that fueled a spring of unrest."

            "Former director of the Office of Government Ethics Walter Shaub isn’t cutting President Joe Biden any slack just because he’s a Democrat and better than Donald Trump on ethics. Shaub slammed the president Friday over coveted administration jobs going to aides’ relatives after candidate Biden had sharply criticized Trump for nepotism.",
            "“We’re in trouble as a nation if ‘better than Trump is good enough’ becomes the standard for ethical behavior,” Shaub wrote in an op-ed for The Washington Post.",
            "“We need active measures to overcome the pernicious influence of family connections, cronyism and systemic racism,” he added. “Otherwise, implicit bias will surely get America more appointees from privileged backgrounds, insulated from the needs of the broader public.”",
            "Biden pledged that his children, unlike Trump’s, would never “have offices in the White House,” Shaub noted. So it’s “troubling that so many relatives of top Biden appointees are landing jobs in his administration,” he added.",
            "The Post last week identified 11 family members of Biden aides employed in various administration posts. The actual numbers may be higher.",
            "“Whatever Biden meant when he promised a better way, it seems his administration now interprets that promise as narrowly applicable to his [immediate] family,” Shaub wrote.",
            "Granted, Trump was worse. Trump not only doled out top jobs to completely politically inexperienced daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner, his administration also employed multiple members of at least 20 families, The Daily Beast discovered.",
            "But one “egregious” example of nepotism — in the Biden administration — is the family of one of Biden’s closest advisers, Steven Ricchetti. Three of Ricchetti’s children work in the administration, and a fourth child has worked for a member of Congress for two years, Shaub noted. (Ricchetti’s brother also works as a Washington lobbyist.)",
            "Ricchetti’s son J.J. “scored a political position in the Treasury Department’s legislative affairs office” after simply graduating from college, nailing a position that typically requires some standout experience, Shaub noted.",
            "“These are no ordinary entry-level jobs,” he writes. “A political appointment in a Cabinet agency ... is a coveted prize that adds sparkle to a résumé,” one chased by thousands of campaign workers, including countless who are not politically connected and are people of color.",
            "“Rather than broadening diversity, J.J.’s hiring gave the political class one more well-to-do White son of privilege,” Shaub wrote. The Treasury Department will “lack the ideas and experiences that someone with a different background (and probably better qualifications) would have brought to the job,” he added.",
            "Shaub warns that “fixing these flaws is a tall order. Tolerating the appearance of nepotism is no way to show we are capable of confronting even our smallest problems.”",

            "SEASIDE, Calif. (AP) — Mike Gravel, a former U.S. senator from Alaska who read the Pentagon Papers into the Congressional Record and confronted Barack Obama about nuclear weapons during a later presidential run, has died. He was 91.",
            "Gravel, who represented Alaska as a Democrat in the Senate from 1969 to 1981, died Saturday, according to his daughter, Lynne Mosier. Gravel had been living in Seaside, California, and was in failing health, said Theodore W. Johnson, a former aide.",
            "Gravel’s two terms came during tumultuous years for Alaska when construction of the trans-Alaska oil pipeline was authorized and when Congress was deciding how to settle Alaska Native land claims and whether to classify enormous amounts of federal land as parks, preserves and monuments.",
            "He had the unenviable position of being an Alaska Democrat when some residents were burning President Jimmy Carter in effigy for his measures to place large sections of public lands in the state under protection from development.",
            "Gravel feuded with Alaska’s other senator, Republican Ted Stevens, on the land matter, preferring to fight Carter’s actions and rejecting Stevens’ advocacy for a compromise.",
            "In the end, Congress passed the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980, a compromise that set aside millions of acres for national parks, wildlife refuges and other protected areas. It was one of the last bills Carter signed before leaving office.",
            "Gravel’s Senate tenure also was notable for his anti-war activity. In 1971, he led a one-man filibuster to protest the Vietnam-era draft and he read into the Congressional Record 4,100 pages of the 7,000-page leaked document known as the Pentagon Papers, the Defense Department’s history of the country’s early involvement in Vietnam.",
            "Gravel reentered national politics decades after his time in the Senate to twice run for president. Gravel, then 75, and his wife, Whitney, took public transportation in 2006 to announce he was running for president as a Democrat in the 2008 election ultimately won by Obama.",
            "He launched his quest for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination as a critic of the Iraq war.",
            "“I believe America is doing harm every day our troops remain in Iraq — harm to ourselves and to the prospects for peace in the world,” Gravel said in 2006. He hitched his campaign to an effort that would give all policy decisions to the people through a direct vote, including health care reform and declarations of war.",
            "Gravel garnered attention for his fiery comments at Democratic forums.",
            "In one 2007 debate, the issue of the possibility of using nuclear weapons against Iran came up, and Gravel confronted then-Sen. Obama. “Tell me, Barack, who do you want to nuke?” Gravel said. Obama replied: “I’m not planning to nuke anybody right now, Mike.”",
            "Gravel then ran as a Libertarian candidate after he was excluded from later Democratic debates.",
            "In an email to supporters, he said the Democratic Party “no longer represents my vision for our great country.” “It is a party that continues to sustain war, the military-industrial complex and imperialism — all of which I find anathema to my views,” he said.",
            "He failed to get the Libertarian nomination.",
            "Gravel briefly ran for the Democratic nomination for president in 2020. He again criticized American wars and vowed to slash military spending. His last campaign was notable in that both his campaign manager and chief of staff were just 18 at the time of his short-lived candidacy.",
            "“There was never any ... plan that he would do anything more than participate in the debates. He didn’t plan to campaign, but he wanted to get his ideas before a larger audience,” Johnson said.",
            "Gravel failed to qualify for the debates. He endorsed Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the contest eventually won by now-President Joe Biden.",
            "Gravel was born Maurice Robert Gravel in Springfield, Massachusetts, on May 13, 1930.",
            "In Alaska, he served as a state representative, including a stint as House speaker, in the mid-1960s.",
            "He won his first Senate term after defeating incumbent Sen. Ernest Gruening, a former territorial governor, in the 1968 Democratic primary.",

            "Scores of rescue workers remained on the massive pile of rubble, working to find survivors among the more than 150 people who remain unaccounted for. Four of the dead have been identified and next of kin notified, the mayor said.",
            "Four days after Thursday’s collapse, more than 150 people remain unaccounted for in Surfside, and authorities and loved ones fear the toll will go much higher.",
            "As rotating teams of rescuers used heavy machinery and power tools to clear the rubble from the top and tunnel in from below, the Noriega family hoped that their 92-year-old matriarch, Hilda Noriega, had somehow survived.",
            "When Mike Noriega heard that part of the condominium tower where his grandmother lived had collapsed, he rushed with his father to the scene. They arrived at a nightmarish 30-foot pile of broken concrete and mangled metal, the remains of the 12-story building known as Champlain Towers South.",
            "But among the flying debris, they stumbled across mementos that bore witness to Hilda’s life on the sixth floor: an old picture of her with her late husband and their infant son, and a birthday card that friends from her prayer group sent two weeks earlier with the acronym “ESM,” Spanish for “hand-delivered,” scrawled across the yellow envelope with a butterfly etching.",
            "“There was a message in the mess of all this,” said Mike Noriega, who last spoke with his grandmother the day before the disaster. “It means not to give up hope. To have faith.”",
            "Surfside Mayor Charles Burkett sought to assure families Sunday that rescuers were working nonstop. “Nothing else on our mind, with the only objective of pulling their family members out of that rubble,” he told ABC’s “This Week.”",
            "“We’re not going to stop doing that ― not today, not tomorrow, not the next day. We’re going to keep going until everybody’s out.”",
            "The Noriega family described Hilda as a fiercely independent and vivacious retiree — in Mike’s words, “the youngest 92-year-old I know ... 92 going on 62.”",
            "Hilda Noriega had called Champlain Towers South home for more than 20 years. But six years after her husband’s death, she was ready to leave. The condo was for sale, and she planned to move in with family.",
            "She loved living near the ocean and friends, but “when you lose a spouse, you want to be surrounded by family ... and she wanted to spend more time with her family and grandchildren,” said Sally Noriega, Hilda’s daughter-in-law.",
            "Hilda Noriega was a loving person who built a life with her husband and raised a family after coming to the U.S. from Cuba in 1960, her daughter-in-law said.",
            "“She was just one of those people who from the first time she met a person she instantly loved that person, and that person instantly loved her,” Sally said.",
            "Carlos Noriega, Hilda’s son and police chief of nearby North Bay Village, was one of the emergency responders atop the pile.",
            "The Noriegas don’t entirely know what to make of the treasured mementos found amid the chaos, but Sally said: “We are a family of faith. We’ll just leave it at that.”",
            "They are among dozens of anguished families awaiting word on the fate of loved ones. The wait has been agonizing.",
            "The atmosphere inside a hotel ballroom where around 200 family members were being briefed by authorities Saturday was tense, two people present told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss the private conversations.",
            "The two said families frustrated with the slow pace of recovery efforts had demanded they be allowed to go to the scene and attempt a collective shout — an attempt as much to find survivors as a cathartic farewell to those who had died.",
            "The mayor said Saturday that the identification of three bodies had dropped the number of people unaccounted for down to 156, and crews also discovered other unspecified human remains. The remains are being sent to the medical examiner, and authorities are gathering DNA samples from family members to aid in identification.",
            "A video posted online showed an official briefing families. When he said they had found remains among the rubble, people began sobbing.",
            "Late Saturday, four of the victims were identified, as Stacie Dawn Fang, 54; Antonio Lozano, 83, and Gladys Lozano, 79; and Manuel LaFont, 54.",

            "When the Elmwood Village organization in Buffalo, New York, convened a debate for the candidates in the city’s Democratic mayoral primary, only community organizer India Walton agreed to attend.",
            "Mayor Byron Brown, a four-term incumbent, and challenger Le’Candice Durham, a civil servant, declined to participate.",
            "But Walton’s team asked the neighborhood group, which hosted the debate via Zoom on June 15, if they could feature empty chairs with nameplates to acknowledge Brown and Durham’s absence.",
            "The host even symbolically offered Brown and Durham the chance to respond to questions and deliver closing remarks ― pausing briefly to highlight the dead air before turning to Walton.",
            "“We are ready for change. And I am a transformative and servant leader,” Walton said in her final remarks at the debate. “This is a radical act of love for me ― a big risk. But I can feel it in my bones, we can win this thing.”",
            "About a week later, Walton did just that, stunning the political world with a lead over Brown in in-person voting that all but assures her control of City Hall.",
            "There is no Republican candidate in the race, but Brown is openly considering a write-in campaign against Walton in the general election.",
            "Walton would be Buffalo’s first female mayor. She would also be the first self-described democratic socialist mayor of a major American city in half a century.",
            "She owes her victory to a confluence of circumstances and decisions, including low (albeit not atypical) turnout; public dissatisfaction with Brown’s housing, development and policing policies; and a disengaged incumbent who declined to take his main challenger seriously.",
            "Brown’s refusal to debate Walton ― he did not appear at a June 10 debate either ― embodied a bury-his-head-in-the-sand approach to the race that ultimately doomed his bid.",
            "In many ways, it resembled then-Rep. Joe Crowley’s fateful decision to send a surrogate to debate then-candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in June 2018 ― down to the negative reaction in the press. Both incidents drew scathing reviews from the incumbents’ hometown newspapers.",
            "The editorial board of The Buffalo News, which endorsed Brown’s re-election, nonetheless chided Brown for “cheating the public” with his refusal to debate.",
            "Brown’s absence at the debates was a “real turning point” in the race, according to Charlie Blaettler, political director of the New York Working Families Party, which endorsed Walton in February and provided critical professional support to her volunteer campaign staff.",
            "“It was something that random people on the street would say, ‘I’m not voting for him ― he won’t even debate. He’s scared,’” said Blaettler, who embedded with the campaign in Buffalo in the final days before the election.",
            "Phil Rumore, president of Buffalo’s public school teachers union, which endorsed Walton in June, had a similar assessment.",
            "“This mayor took [the election] for granted, and people do not like being taken for granted,” he said.",
            "Walton, who grew up on the city’s largely poor, overwhelmingly Black East Side, gave birth to her first child at the age of 14. She eventually earned her graduate equivalency degree and became a registered nurse and union representative in 1199SEIU.",
            "Fed up with the Brown administration’s focus on attracting corporate investment in the city with tax incentives, and its refusal to turn over thousands of vacant lots to the communities where they are located, Walton became active in the Fruit Belt Community Land Trust. Walton had arrived in the Fruit Belt neighborhood as a middle-class renter in 2015, but by 2018, she had been priced out of the neighborhood herself.",
            "The premise of the land trust, which Walton eventually led, was that Buffalo, under Brown’s leadership, was gentrifying predominantly working-class and low-income Black neighborhoods on the city’s East Side without regard to the needs of the communities already there.",
            "The land trust fought to acquire 50 vacant lots in the Fruit Belt neighborhood, and is now using them to build affordable housing that would prevent more displacement of local families.",
            "“This is huge,” Walton said in February 2018, after the land trust reached an agreement with the city to acquire the lots. “The existence of the ‘FB Community Land Trust’ is going to ensure permanent affordable housing.”",
            "When Walton announced her plan to challenge Brown for the mayoralty in December, she cited the need for more affordable housing as a key reason for her bid.",
            "“Mayor Brown is doing the best that he knows how,” she said at the time. “As a person who is a career politician I think he’s a little bit detached from what folks on the ground are feeling.”",
            "Walton has signed an activist-sponsored “Homes Guarantee” pledge, affirming her commitment to eradicating homelessness and making affordable housing a right. She plans to begin the process required for Buffalo to take advantage of a 2019 state law that allows cities to opt into a rent stabilization regime of the kind already in effect in New York City; create a registry that allows renters to check on a landlord’s record; provide relief to small landlords in exchange for forgiving some tenants’ back rents; and eventually set aside at least half of the vacant lots owned by the city for public use.",
            "“India has been in the trenches of all of these fights for years,” said John Washington, a Working Families Party activist in Buffalo. “People saw a real opportunity to have a person who could really change a lot of these dynamics that are hurting so many people in Buffalo.”",
            "Some of the energy behind Walton’s bid also came from dissatisfaction with how Brown, who has received donations from top police union officials, responded to the Black Lives Matter protests in June 2020.",
            "Members of the Buffalo Police Department infamously knocked Martin Gugino, a 75-year-old progressive activist, to the ground during a demonstration, sending him to the hospital for a month with a brain injury and a fractured skull. Two of the officers involved with the incident were charged with assault, prompting 57 members of the city’s special response team to resign from the unit in protest. The city later dropped the charges against the two officers.",
            "Brown promised to enact widespread police reforms, but disappointed activists with his insistence on taking credit for changes already mandated under state law, such as decriminalizing marijuana and banning police chokeholds.",
            "Many progressives were already wary of Brown’s coziness with police, based on how he handled the firing of a Black officer, Cariol Horne. Horne sued the city and the police department for firing her two years after she intervened in 2006 to stop a fellow cop from choking a suspect who was already in handcuffs.",
            "Last October, Brown signed “Cariol’s Law,” recognizing the duty of police officers to intervene when a fellow officer is acting inappropriately. And in April, a state Supreme Court judge ruled in Horne’s favor, restoring her right to a full police pension.",
            "Washington, the Working Families Party activist, nonetheless faults Brown for not doing more to expedite the restoration of Horne’s pension.",
            "“People saw Byron Brown take 15 years to give Cariol Horne her pension for doing the right thing as a police officer,” Washington said.",
            "For her part, Walton ran on a platform of having mental health professionals respond to mental health calls in lieu of police; making it easier to discipline and fire bad cops; investing in summer jobs programs for young people; and enacting a modest reduction in a police budget that she considers inefficient.",
            "But Walton, who always campaigned with a smile, pointedly avoided embracing the slogan “defund the police.” It was part of a broader strategy of speaking in plain language, while not hiding her ambitious policy ideas or her identity as a democratic socialist, that Walton and her allies say was a key to her success.",
            "“The challenge of the left is that we use our jargony activist language and don’t take time to fully explain what we mean to those who may not be as ‘woke’ as we are,” she told The New York Times.",
            "Walton had a shoestring budget, but with an all-volunteer staff, she poured her limited resources into a direct-mail and TV campaign that used the same easy-to-understand message she uses when she speaks.",
            "“For 15 years, under the same mayor, Buffalo has not been working for us,” intones the narrator in a TV ad that Walton aired in the final three weeks of the campaign. “Corruption, investigations and financial mismanagement ― this year, we can change that.”",
            "Of course, for all that Walton emphasized the elements of her platform with the broadest possible support in her paid media, her earliest institutional support came from the activist left, helping build an army of volunteers that vaulted her into contention. The Buffalo chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America endorsed Walton in mid-February. A couple of weeks later, after a vote by the WFP’s Western New York chapter, the New York WFP endorsed her as well.",
            "The WFP had endorsed Brown for his previous mayoral runs, but saw in Walton a chance to rethink the city’s priorities after the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Louisa Fletcher-Pacheco, who chairs the Western New York chapter of the Working Families Party.",
            "“We are a working-class city. We’re a blue-collar city. India being a nurse, and meeting with teachers, and talking about being a nurse in schools and saying that we need a nurse in every school” had an impact, Fletcher-Pacheco said.",
            "More mainstream stakeholders also got behind Walton in the final weeks of the campaign, as local institutions saw the challenger developing momentum.",
            "The teachers union was pleased with Walton’s support for more dedicated city funding for public schools and a cap on the number of charter schools. The union generally sticks with incumbent Democrats, but occasionally takes risks, such as when it endorsed law Professor Zephyr Teachout’s primary run against New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) in 2014.",
            "This time, the decision was “easy,” according to Rumore, the union president.",
            "“To stay out of it would have been hypocritical,” he said. “You really need to stand up for a person who is willing to say ‘I’m not afraid to fund the schools like they should be.’”",
            "The union sent a letter to its 3,800 active members and thousands of retirees informing them of the endorsement, as well as an email blast encouraging members to get involved.",
            "More critical still was the endorsement Walton picked up a few days later from The Challenger, a venerated newspaper that caters to Buffalo’s Black residents.",
            "“We endorse India Walton in her noble quest, based on the strength that she dared to step to the plate to give voters a choice,” The Challenger’s editorial board wrote. “Not to mention that at 38 years young ― she is qualified, experienced, intelligent, organized, and as her campaign slogan touts: Real. Resilient. Ready!”",
            "The Challenger’s endorsement likely helped Walton eat into Brown’s margins in the middle-class Black neighborhoods that make up a core part of his base.",
            "Although Walton performed best in whiter and more liberal neighborhoods on the West Side of Buffalo, such as the Delaware and Niagara common council districts, she did respectably in some of Brown’s traditional strongholds as well.",
            "For example, Brown still won the Masten common council district, where he has historically performed well ― but Walton received 40.6% of the vote there, according to a Buffalo News analysis of in-person voting results.",
            "As a result, the Working Families Party’s Blaettler sees her candidacy as a successful model for other progressive insurgents, who have sometimes struggled to unite liberal professionals with working-class Black and Latino voters. Generally, a coalition of that kind is needed to win major elections, even in liberal cities.",
            "“When you run people who are deeply connected to where they live, who speak with moral clarity and are authentic, and you combine that with an efficiently run campaign ― if you do those things, the left is competitive anywhere,” Blaettler said."

            "A day after President Joe Biden endorsed a deal that pares down his signature infrastructure package in a bid to win Republican support in the Senate, one of his top environmental allies is preparing to rally for stronger climate measures.",
            "The League of Conservation Voters on Friday told HuffPost it will spend $8 million deploying more than 100 staffers to eight states in hopes of rallying support for a more aggressive federal program to pay for climate upgrades and clean energy. The effort marks the group’s biggest ever field campaign during a non-election year.",
            "The nonprofit ― which campaigned hard for Biden in 2020 ― plans to canvass voters and businesses in 15 congressional districts in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Virginia, targeting lawmakers such as Reps. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.) and Elaine Luria (D-Va.) and Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.).",
            "“This field effort is about making sure members of Congress see and feel and understand their constituents’ desire for big action on climate change,” said Pete Maysmith, the senior vice president of campaigns at the League of Conservation Voters.",
            "The lawmakers the group is targeting are “folks we think this kind of program will help reinforce and spur ambition” for policies to cut emissions. While conservative Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) is widely seen as one of the biggest obstacles to getting Democrats to vote in lockstep and use their narrow majority to pass legislation, the League of Conservation Voters does not have an active chapter in West Virginia, Maysmith said.",
            "The bipartisan package that Biden endorsed Thursday totals about $1.2 trillion over eight years, and contains $579 billion in new federal spending on narrowly defined projects such as roads, bridges, airports and waterways. Five Republicans and five Democrats negotiated the deals, and 20 senators in all now support it. But that’s still far short of the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster, and some progressives have stopped short of promising their votes amid fears that the package will privatize public goods and impose more fees and tolls on Americans.",
            "Green groups panned the proposal on Thursday. Greenpeace lamented that it has “yet to see real action” from Biden and Congress on climate. The Sierra Club demanded that Congress pass a “bold infrastructure package that tackles the climate crisis before moving any bipartisan deal.” Sunrise Movement said that by agreeing to water down the package, Democrats were “condemning Americans to untold devastation.”",
            "“This bipartisan proposal is not the climate bill, and no one should pretend otherwise,” Jamal Raad, executive director of the climate group Evergreen Action, said in a statement. “The bipartisan framework comes nowhere near the scale and scope of investments that we need to meet the climate crisis. Climate leaders in Congress should reject this deal unless it’s accompanied by a reconciliation bill with bold climate investments.”",
            "Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) told HuffPost on Thursday that the deal is just one half of a total package Democrats plan to pass through budget reconciliation, a process that allows them to circumvent the filibuster and pass legislation with just the party’s 51-vote majority. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Thursday afternoon that she would wait until the Senate passed both halves of the infrastructure package before holding a vote in the lower chamber.",
            "A survey last week from the environmental group Climate Power and the think tank Data for Progress found 86% of Democrats, 55% of independents and 23% of Republicans support the original $2 trillion package that Biden proposed, as they understood it. When provided additional details about the proposal’s funding for renewable energy and environmental cleanup, overall support climbed from 57% to 65%. The biggest increase was among Republicans.",
            "In the meantime, canvassers from the League of Conservation Voters plan to start papering the local cafes and restaurants that congressional staffers are known to frequent with materials that read “Climate Action Now!”",
            "“We’re thinking about how to have the most visible presence,” said Jennessa Agnew, the group’s field director. “That includes thinking about where the places are where people are congregating in these districts, and how we can ensure congressional staff are seeing this support for bold climate action.”"

            "The student loan payment pause is set to expire on Sept. 30. The Democrats who signed the letter, led by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, are asking Biden to extend the pause until March 30, 2022, or until employment reaches pre-pandemic levels.",
            "“Borrowers have reaped significant benefits from the ongoing payment pause, taking the opportunity to pay down other debt, relieve financial pressures from lost jobs or decreased earnings, and support their families’ needs,” the members wrote.",
            "“The scheduled resumption of student loan payments in October could create a significant drag on our economic recovery,” they added.",
            "The Education Department, which manages the federal government’s $1.4 trillion student loan portfolio, declined to comment on the letter. That portfolio, which covers debt held by more than 40 million borrowers, makes up the bulk of the student loan debt in the United States.",
            "While many of the 64 congressional Democrats who signed the letter are liberals who have long pushed for action on student loan forgiveness, several moderate Democrats — including Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema and Connecticut Rep. Jim Himes — were also signatories.",
            "Reps. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) and Joe Courtney (D-Conn.) were the lead authors of the letter among House Democrats.",
            "Former President Donald Trump started the moratorium not long after the pandemic hit, and Biden extended it until the end of September on his first day in office. Whether to extend the moratorium further is a crucial decision facing Biden, Education Secretary Miguel Cardona and Federal Student Aid COO Richard Cordray.",

            "She also recently placed a hold on the nomination of James Kvaal, Biden’s pick for the third-highest ranking job at the Department of Education in hopes of forcing reforms to how the department manages student loans. (Politico first reported Warren’s move.)",

            "“We’ve been working with Senate offices and are encouraged by the conversations and developments around James Kvaal’s nomination,” the agency said. “We share the same goals around making the Federal Student Aid office more consumer friendly and an advocate for student borrowers, which is why we’ve taken multiple actions to achieve this goal, including providing nearly $3 billion in targeted loan relief and bringing on Richard Cordray as Chief Operating Officer.”",
            "The Department of Education and the White House are continuing to review whether Biden has the legal power to unilaterally forgive student loan debt, and whether doing so would be good policy. The president has been publicly dismissive of widespread debt forgiveness."

            "President Joe Biden’s administration will launch a new crackdown on illegal guns and funnel money to gun violence intervention groups across the country in response to soaring numbers of deadly shootings, administration officials told reporters on Tuesday night.",
            "Biden announced the steps Wednesday, shortly after meeting with mayors, police chiefs and community leaders who are struggling to contain the violence. Those present at Biden’s announcement included Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott, Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cara, New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal, and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Police Chief Murphy Paul.",
            "“Mayors have the power to help shape and enforce the laws in their cities, but they can’t control the laws in neighboring cities and states, even though the gun legally bought there often ends up in their streets,” Biden said, adding that Scott said 80% of guns in Baltimore were bought outside the city.",
            "Though crime statistics for 2020 remain incomplete, homicides rose 30% in big cities across the country, even as other types of crime appeared to fall. Those increases have continued in the first months of 2021.",
            "The administration has been working to develop policies to combat crime in recent weeks, emphasizing the ability of states and cities to use aid included in the administration’s coronavirus relief package to hire and retain police officers.",
            "Much of what Biden unveiled Wednesday is focused on stopping gun trafficking. He has directed the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) to immediately move to revoke the dealer licenses of gun shops that violate federal law by selling to a prohibited person or failing to run a required background check. (A USA Today investigation released last month found gun dealers routinely keep their licenses despite multiple violations.)",
            "“If you willfully sell a gun to someone who’s prohibited from possessing it, if you willfully fail to run a background check, if you willfully falsify a record ... my message to you is this: We’ll find you and we will seek your license to sell guns,” Biden said.",
            "“We will make sure you can’t sell death and mayhem on our streets.”",
            "In April, Biden nominated David Chipman as director of ATF, which hasn’t had a Senate-confirmed chief since 2015. While working at ATF, Chipman oversaw complex firearms trafficking cases, including breaking up organized groups involved in the transportation of guns to New York in exchange for drugs in the Tidewater area in Virginia. The Senate Judiciary Committee will vote on his confirmation Thursday.",
            "The administration plans to also assemble state attorneys general and state legislators to discuss ways to bypass federal laws designed to protect gun manufacturers from legal liability and instead hold gun manufacturers and dealers accountable for “improper conduct.”",
            "The Justice Department, meanwhile, is launching task forces aimed at stopping illegal gun trafficking in the corridors leading into New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay Area and Washington, D.C.",
            "“Working with our local partners to tackle violent crime is one of the Justice Department’s most important responsibilities,” said Attorney General Merrick Garland, who also attended Biden’s announcement. “Today, the department is taking another concrete step to address violent crime and illegal firearms trafficking. Our firearms trafficking strike forces will investigate and disrupt the networks that channel crime guns into our communities with tragic consequences.”",
            "Biden also not-so-subtly encouraged localities to use the $350 billion in state and local pandemic aid to combat crime. The Treasury Department plans to highlight how state and local governments can hire officials “even above pre-pandemic levels” with federal aid or use the money to pay for new technologies or additional overtime.",
            "The administration is also working to funnel money to gun violence intervention programs, which aim to work with potential offenders and victims to stop shootings before they happen. Studies have shown these efforts can reduce violence by 60% or more.",
            "“This announcement addresses the reality of gun violence in America, where nearly half of all homicides occur in just 127 cities and towns that contain only a quarter of the population and where Black men and boys from 15 to 34 comprised 37% of gun homicides, despite being less than 2% of the population,” Brady racial justice director Kelly Sampson said.",
            "“These statistics do not reflect a ‘culture of violence’ requiring ever more militant policing, as some suggest, but they instead reflect decades of racist policies, oppression and indifference.”",
            "The White House also announced a support group, led by domestic policy adviser Susan Rice and director of intergovernmental affairs Julie Chávez Rodríguez, for 14 cities that will use some of their American Rescue Plan aid to fund intervention efforts. Some of the nation’s largest nonprofit groups ― including Laurene Powell Jobs’ Emerson Collective, the Ford Foundation and Arnold Ventures ― will support those efforts financially.",
            "Lastly, the administration plans to take steps to make it easier for offenders to reenter society after prison by helping them find jobs and housing and to fund youth summer job programs.",
            "CORRECTION: A previous version of this article mistakenly associated Melinda Gates with the Emerson Collective, rather than Laurene Powell Jobs."

            "The paper’s closure comes as authorities crack down on dissent following months of anti-government protests in 2019. The announcement also coincided with the start of the first trial under the national security law, imposed by Beijing about a year ago.",
            "The widely expected move to close Apple Daily followed last week’s arrests of the five editors and executives, who were detained on suspicion of colluding with foreigners to endanger national security. Police cited more than 30 articles published by the paper as evidence of an alleged conspiracy to encourage foreign nations to impose sanctions on Hong Kong and China.",
            "It was the freezing of assets that spelled the paper’s demise. The board of directors had earlier this week written to Hong Kong’s security bureau requesting the release of some of its funds so the company could pay wages.",
            "Police earlier Wednesday arrested a 55-year-old man on suspicion of foreign collusion to endanger national security. According to Apple Daily, which cited unidentified sources, the man writes editorials for the newspaper under the pseudonym Li Ping.",
            "The police operation against Apple Daily drew criticism from the U.S., the E.U. and Britain, which say Hong Kong and Chinese authorities are targeting the freedoms promised to the city when the former British colony was returned to China in 1997.",

            "His trial will set the tone for how Hong Kong handles national security offenses. So far, more than 100 people have been arrested under the security law, including prominent pro-democracy activists such as media tycoon Jimmy Lai, the publisher of Apple Daily.",
            "The slogan “Liberate Hong Kong, the revolution of our times” was often chanted during anti-government demonstrations demanding broader democratic freedoms. Protests accuse Beijing of walking back on its promise at the 1997 handover of Hong Kong from Britain that the city could retain its freedoms not seen elsewhere in China for 50 years.",
            "China responded with tough measures silencing opposition voices, including the national security law.",

            "TOKYO (AP) — A limited number of local fans will be allowed to attend the Tokyo Olympics, organizers announced Monday as they tried to save some of the spirit of the Games where even cheering has been banned.",
            "Organizers set a limit of 50% capacity — up to a maximum of 10,000 fans — for each Olympic venue, and officials said that if coronavirus cases rise again the rules could be changed and fans could still be barred all together. Spectators from abroad were banned several months ago, and now some local fans who have tickets will be forced to give them up.",
            "The decision comes as opposition among Japanese to holding the Games in July remains high, though may be softening, and as new infections in Tokyo have begun to subside.",
            "Still, health officials fear that in a country where the vast majority of people have yet to be vaccinated, crowds at the Olympics could drive cases up. The country’s top medical adviser, Dr. Shigeru Omi, recommended last week that the safest way to hold the Olympics would be without fans. Allowing fans presents a risk not just at the venues but will also lead to more circulation on commuter trains, in restaurants and other public spaces.",
            "It’s already become clear that these Olympics Games will be unlike any others, but organizers have said they are determined to hold them and billions of dollars in broadcast rights and ticket sales are at stake. Still, much of the fanfare that surrounds them — people from around the world rubbing elbows, a celebratory atmosphere in the host city and the showcasing of the host country’s culture — will be off the table or far more muted this year.",
            "Seiko Hashimoto, the president of the Tokyo Olympic organizing committee, called the decision “the last piece for the Olympics” to proceed on July 23.",
            "But as with everything about these Olympics — the first postponed in the history of the Modern Games dating from 1896, though previous ones were canceled during both World Wars — the decision raised many questions.",
            "For one, it is not quite what it seems. Although a maximum of 10,000 fans will be allowed in any given venue, so-called stakeholders — including sponsors and sporting federation officials — will not be counted toward that total, according to organizing committee CEO Toshiro Muto. Japanese media, for instance, reported that up to 20,000 people might attend the opening ceremony, over and above athletes, though Muto said he thought it would be less than that.",
            "The decision on local fans was announced after so-called Five Party talks online with local organizers, the International Olympic Committee, the International Paralympic Committee, the Japanese government and the government of metropolitan Tokyo. A decision on the Paralympics comes on July 16.",
            "Hashimoto, meanwhile, left the door open for a no-fans Olympics if the conditions worsen around the pandemic.",
            "“We need to be very flexible. If there is any abrupt change in the situation, we will hold five-party meetings again to make other decisions,” Hashimoto said. “If there is an announcement of a state of emergency during the Games, all the options like no-spectator games will be examined.”",
            "Officials say local fans will be under strict rules. They will not be allowed to cheer, must wear masks, and are being told to go straight home afterward.",
            "“We would like people to go directly home from the venue without stopping by anywhere,” Muto said.",
            "He said 3.64 million tickets were already in the hands of Japanese residents. He indicated that was about 900,000 more than the seats likely to be available. That will mean a lottery to see who can attend.",
            "Tokyo organizers had expected about $800 million in revenue from ticket sales, but Muto said the actual figure would be no more than half that. Any shortfall will have to be picked by some Japanese government entity.",
            "The University of Oxford has said these are the most expensive Olympics on record. The official cost is $15.4 billion, but several government audits suggest it might be twice that much. All but $6.7 billion is public money.",
            "The IOC relies on selling broadcast rights for almost 75% of its income. Another 18% is from sponsors. A cancelation would cost the IOC an estimated $3 billion-$4 billion in lost broadcast income — an enormous blow especially at a time when its income flow has already been slowed by the pandemic.",
            "The decision comes just as Tokyo has emerged from a state of emergency as the curve of new cases has flattened. The seven-day average for new infections in the city is about 400 daily.",
            "The capital and other areas are now under “quasi-emergency” status until July 11. The new rules will allow restaurants to serve alcohol during limited hours, the main outcome from the reduced restrictions.",
            "Overall, more than 14,000 deaths have been attributed to COVID-19 in Japan, which has managed the pandemic better than many countries but not as well as some others in Asia. Its vaccination campaign remains behind many Western ones, with about 6.5% of Japanese fully vaccinated and 16.5% with at least one shot.",
            "Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, who has favored allowing fans, said before the official announcement that he would bar fans if conditions change. Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike echoed that.",
            "“If a state of emergency is necessary, I will be flexible and open to no fans in order to achieve that the Games give top priority to safety and security for the people,” Suga said.",
            "He said he took “seriously” Omi’s recommendations but did not follow them.",

            "All 50 Senate Republicans voted Tuesday to block debate on a sweeping reform bill covering voting rights, campaign finance, redistricting and government ethics that is the priority of congressional Democrats.",
            "The For the People Act was introduced as the first bill by Democrats in both the House and the Senate after they won control of both chambers in the 2020 election. It passed the House on a party-line vote in March with one Democrat voting no. But passage in the Senate was precarious as Democrats hold just 50 seats and the chamber’s rules allow the minority Republicans to block any bill that can’t receive 60 votes.",
            "Although all 50 Democrats ultimately voted to move forward with the bill, the GOP filibuster prevailed. Vice President Kamala Harris, who has been tasked with voting rights protection and expansion efforts, presided over the vote.",
            "“This is one of the most critical issues the U.S. Congress could take up, which is about the fundamental right to vote in our country,” Harris said after the vote. “This fight is not over.”",
            "The GOP-led filibuster tees up a question for the Senate Democratic caucus: Will it change the chamber’s filibuster rules to allow the bill to pass with a simple majority? Or will a small group of Senate Democrats choose to protect the filibuster over the right to vote in states run by Republicans?",
            "This is an urgent question to voting rights proponents who see the bill as the antidote to a wave of voter suppression bills. These bills were passed by Republican state legislatures to fulfill the wishes of ex-President Donald Trump, who falsely claimed that fraud cost him the 2020 election and tried to get all votes cast in majority-Black precincts in key swing states invalidated.",
            "Just before the vote, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) urged his Republican colleagues to stand up to Trump and vote to at least debate the bill to protect voting rights.",
            "“Are we going to let the most dishonest president in history continue to poison our democracy from the inside?” Schumer said. “Or will we stand up to defend what generations of Americans have organized, marched, fought and died for: the sacred, sacred right to vote?”",
            "The For the People Act, as it currently exists, would overturn many of the rollbacks to voter access contained in recent GOP-backed election laws by instituting a national floor for rules regarding early, absentee and in-person voting and voter registration. These provisions were originally introduced as legislation written by the late civil rights leader and Georgia congressman John Lewis (D). The bill, a combination of reform proposals developed over the past 15 years, would also limit partisan gerrymandering, create a voluntary public campaign financing system for congressional elections, ban undisclosed “dark” money, increase election cybersecurity and enhance foreign lobbying regulations, among many other things.",
            "Democrats were fully united on advancing the voting rights package, although Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) has expressed reservations with some of its provisions.",
            "Manchin, the lone Democrat who did not co-sponsor the bill, announced Tuesday that he will vote to begin debate on it with the understanding that the Senate will later vote on a “compromise” proposal he negotiated that includes a narrower selection of proposals from the For the People Act, plus a national voter identification provision, albeit one much looser than those instituted in many Republican-run states. He presented this compromise as something that could receive bipartisan support, but those ideas face fierce Republican opposition as well. His compromise was warmly received by President Joe Biden, former President Barack Obama and 2018 Democratic Georgia governor candidate and voting rights advocate Stacey Abrams.",
            "However, Manchin’s “compromise” amendment won’t get a vote on Tuesday because Republicans will block the underlying bill from proceeding.",
            "“Unfortunately, my Republican colleagues refused to allow debate of this legislation despite the reasonable changes made to focus the bill on the core issues facing our democracy,” Manchin said in a statement. “I remain committed to finding a bipartisan pathway forward because the future of our democracy is worth it.”",
            "While the For the People Act was introduced as S.1, the bill number reserved for the majority’s top priority, the bill that will go for a vote Tuesday was S.2093, which contained the original text of the For the People Act as amended in the Senate Rules Committee in May. The introduction of a new bill was deemed necessary by leadership as the committee vote on S.1 deadlocked 9-9 on a party-line vote. The Senate would need to first vote to bring the bill out of committee after such a deadlock before voting to proceed to debate. This eliminated the need for that vote. Any future bill incorporating changes that would win Manchin’s support, or for any other reason, would likely be introduced as yet another bill.",
            "The only way forward for the bill to pass if Republicans block it is for Senate Democrats to vote unanimously to change the chamber’s filibuster rules.",
            "Manchin has been adamant that he will never vote to eliminate the filibuster, the rule that requires 60 votes in the Senate to advance and pass legislation. In an April opinion piece published by The Washington Post, Manchin called the filibuster “a critical tool to protecting ... our democratic form of government.”",
            "“That is why I have said it before and will say it again to remove any shred of doubt: There is no circumstance in which I will vote to eliminate or weaken the filibuster,” he added.",
            "And it’s not just Manchin standing in the way of passing more parts of the Democrats’ agenda. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) has repeatedly praised the filibuster as a force for good in encouraging bipartisanship in the Senate. On Monday, the eve of the vote on the For the People Act, Sinema again defended the rule.",
            "“To those people who want to eliminate the legislative filibuster to pass the For the People Act (voting-rights legislation I support and have co-sponsored), I would ask: Would it be good for our country if we did, only to see that legislation rescinded a few years from now and replaced by a nationwide voter-ID law or restrictions on voting by mail in federal elections, over the objections of the minority?” Sinema wrote in an opinion piece published by The Washington Post.",
            "Manchin and Sinema aren’t the only ones who hold that opinion among the Democratic caucus, but they are the most vocal. Other Democratic senators who prefer to stay on the sidelines have issued vague statements in support of filibuster reform without taking a fulsome position that it needs to go.",
            "Biden, a longtime defender of the filibuster, expressed frustration with Republicans earlier this year over the rule, saying it is “being abused in a gigantic way.” Biden has expressed support for more narrow filibuster reforms but he too has not come out for doing away with it outright.",
            "“If the vote is unsuccessful tomorrow, we suspect it will prompt a new conversation about the path forward,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said during a Monday press conference when asked about the future of the For the People Act and the Senate filibuster.",
            "CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article said Tuesday’s vote is on S.2903. The correct bill is S.2093."

        "articleContent": [
            "The push to bring down prescription drug prices through government action will take a step forward Tuesday when a key lawmaker, Senate Finance Committee Chair Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), issues a loose framework for legislation he hopes the chamber will pass this year.",
            "The “principles of reform,” which Wyden’s office shared with HuffPost before publication, include several ideas that progressives have long championed ― among them, giving the federal government power to negotiate prices directly with drug manufacturers. The governments of other developed nations have this kind of authority, and it’s the main reason that the price of name-brand drugs overseas are so much lower than in the U.S.",
            "Other key principles include creating an inducement for drug manufacturers to negotiate, rebates to mitigate year-to-year price hikes and, most important, an extension of the negotiated prices beyond Medicare recipients to private insurers and their beneficiaries.",
            "That way even Americans who aren’t on Medicare would benefit through lower out-of-pocket prices at the pharmacy, lower insurance premiums or both.",
            "Wyden’s intentions matter because the Finance Committee’s jurisdiction over Medicare makes it the likeliest venue for crafting Senate legislation.",
            "And although Wyden has indicated support for most of these ideas in a variety of interviews and public appearances in the past few months, this new document formalizes his commitment to putting them in legislation.",
            "It also reflects Wyden’s sense that passing a bill with these features is possible, following what he described Monday as “a lot of sweat equity … into finding a majority on drug pricing in the Senate.”",
            "“I have had a lot of conversations with senators from both political parties,” Wyden said in an interview with HuffPost, “and I’m putting down on paper where I believe we need to go, to get a consensus to pass a bill in both chambers.”",
            "Clarity About Intentions But Not About Details",
            "That consensus still does not exist. And it takes only a quick glance at Wyden’s document to notice the lack of specifics.",
            "The principles don’t indicate, for example, exactly how Wyden thinks the federal government should go about negotiating drug prices. There are a variety of ways to do it, each one with its own pros and cons ― and each one with its own set of advocates and critics.",
            "An example is “international reference pricing,” a model that would use the prices that foreign governments pay for drugs as one guide for setting U.S. prices.",
            "The idea has the support of many progressives and is likely to be part of whatever prescription legislation emerges from the House, since international reference pricing was part of a prescription drug bill that passed that chamber back in 2019.",
            "That proposal died when the Senate, then under Republican control, refused to consider it. The hope is that a new version of the House bill can get through the Senate this time, now that Democrats are in the majority.",
            "But international reference pricing already has some strong critics among Senate Democrats, as Wyden confirmed in his interview.",
            "“I’ve heard from some of my colleagues that using international prices as a basis for negotiation is not their favorite approach,” Wyden said. “They consider it passing the buck. They want an American system for America.”",
            "But, Wyden added, “I want it understood: I’m not taking any policy approach off the table.”",
            "And if the Wyden document leaves open many questions about policy detail, it’s clarifying in another respect. It confirms that Wyden wants legislation that goes far beyond the bipartisan bill he negotiated previously with Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa), the ranking Republican on the Finance Committee.",
            "That bill included a measure to limit year-to-year inflation in drug prices but stopped short of more aggressive measures, including government negotiation of prices, because Republicans would not support them.",
            "As it turned out, even that scaled-back compromise bill was too much for GOP leaders. They refused to take up the Grassley-Wyden bill, just as they had refused to consider the one they got from House Democrats.",
            "Now that Democrats control the Senate, Wyden hopes the more ambitious legislation he has preferred all along can pass.",
            "One progressive activist who had seen an advance version of Wyden’s framework told HuffPost he was pleased with both the substance and the signal it sends.",
            "“The policy buckets are great,” said Alex Lawson, executive director of Social Security Works.",
            "Lawson noted in particular the commitment to both negotiated prices and extending those beyond Medicare, and making sure all Americans see savings at the pharmacy. “We have some details that we’re going to have to worry about,” Lawson said, “but this is as good a starting point as we could ask for in the Senate.”",
            "The Challenges Of Constructing A Majority",
            "Given the slim prospects of getting significant Republican support for the kind of legislation Wyden envisions, its most probable path to enactment would be through the “budget reconciliation” process, in which a simple majority can approve legislation that affects the federal budget with no threat of a filibuster.",
            "But because Democrats have exactly 50 seats in the Senate, a single defection could kill ambitious prescription drug reforms. And it’s easy to imagine that happening.",
            "In addition to conservative senators who are traditionally more skeptical of government intervention in the economy, there are Democratic senators, such as Tom Carper of Delaware and Robert Menendez of New Jersey, who represent states with large pharmaceutical manufacturers and who have close ties to the industry.",
            "Pulling in the opposite direction are more progressive lawmakers, like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who have long wanted to give the government more power to regulate drug prices.",
            "Forging agreement among these factions would almost certainly require a strong push from the White House. And President Joe Biden didn’t include specific figures for prescription drug legislation in his budget proposal, creating widespread doubt about his commitment to the project.",
            "But Biden endorsed ambitious reforms in his joint address to Congress in April, mentioning specifically that he wants to give the federal government the power to negotiate prices and that the private sector, not just Medicare, should be able to get those prices. Wyden on Monday said that statement was consistent with what he’s heard from Biden directly.",
            "“He was signaling ― and he’s told me ― that he’s going to be all in on this fight,” Wyden said.",
            "The Opportunity That Democrats Have",
            "One reason legislation has a chance of passing, despite all of the obstacles and the long history of failure, is that Democrats have extra motivation this time around.",
            "An effective bill would yield significant budget savings, on the order of hundreds of billions of dollars over 10 years, that Democrats can use ― and desperately need ― to finance other health care programs, such as adding a dental benefit to Medicare or insuring low-income residents in states where Republicans have blocked expansions of Medicaid.",
            "Another reason Democrats might succeed is that ideas like government negotiation of drug prices have proved consistently popular in the polls, even among Republican voters.",
            "Critics of the kind of legislation that Wyden envisions have long said that government limits on drug prices would reduce innovation by giving drug companies less incentive to invest in the development of new drugs.",
            "In both his document and in Monday’s interview, Wyden talked about the importance of innovation ― and the need to craft price negotiation policy carefully in order to take account of the actual value drugs provide. The document also mentions increasing government funding of research, with particular attention to small biotech firms that do much of the most important drug development nowadays.",
            "But Wyden on Monday emphatically rejected claims that negotiation would inevitably lead to fewer breakthroughs, arguing “industry overstates how innovative it is. It always equates innovation with the number of new treatments, regardless of whether they are me-too drugs or truly novel.”",
            "An example of a drug providing dubious value is a new Alzheimer’s treatment that got federal approval last week and that will sell for $56,000 a year, per patient, despite scant evidence that it slows disease progression.",
            "Wyden was among the first to call the price outrageous after Biogen announced it, and he explained to HuffPost why it made him so angry: His mother, a librarian, suffered from Alzheimer’s-related dementia in her final years.",
            "“I saw what a toll it was taking on her and others. This is deeply personal to me. I heard about this drug, I saw how skimpy the evidence was … the price to me is unconscionable for what was on offer.”"

            "News of the plan comes just days before state and federal eviction moratoriums are set to expire. These moratoriums, which end on June 30, do not cancel past-due rent. They only protect certain renters from being evicted from failure to pay.",

It also reimburses landlords for a portion of rent money owed to them. When this rent relief program was first opened to residents in March, there were an estimated 1.5 million people behind on rent in the state, according to the Business, Consumer Services and Housing Agency, which is overseeing the program.",
            "There have been complaints and concerns about the program’s ability to provide financial relief in a timely manner, however.

The ad uses Sinema’s opposition to changing filibuster rules against him. (The For The People Act would require groups like One Nation to disclose their big money donors.)",
            "While these advocacy campaigns ramp up, the real pressure on filibuster reform holdouts will come from their colleagues in Congress ― and possibly from President Joe Biden’s White House. This effort will have to find changes to the rules that holdouts could find agreeable.",
            "Between Manchin and Sinema, only Manchin, despite his current insistence on opposing limiting the filibuster, has a record of supporting changes to filibuster rules.",
            "In 2011, Manchin co-sponsored and voted for Senate rule changes that would have mandated a talking filibuster and eliminated the filibuster on motions to proceed to debate on the bill. It is notable that the Republican filibuster of the For The People Act on Tuesday was on the motion to proceed to debate.",
            "More recently, Manchin stated support in March for bringing back a talking filibuster, whereby those blocking debate would be required to hold the Senate floor and speak until one side pulled the bill or the other stopped speaking. That was before he flip-flopped to opposing filibuster rule changes.",
            "And while Sinema has not proposed, co-sponsored or voted for any prior filibuster rules changes, she did invite debate on the legislative filibuster in a Washington Post op-ed where she reiterated her opposition to changing the rules.",
            "“It is time for the Senate to debate the legislative filibuster, so senators and our constituents can hear and fully consider the concerns and consequences,” Sinema wrote on Monda. “Hopefully, senators can then focus on crafting policies through open legislative processes and amendments, finding compromises that earn broad support.”",
            "Other proposals to change the filibuster rules circulating among Democrats include requiring the filibustering minority to hold at least 40 senators on the floor continuously while blocking a bill or creating a filibuster carve-out for legislation that expands the right to vote. The latter proposal was first proposed in a 2018 op-ed in Slate by University of California, Irvine election law professor Rick Hasen.",
            "“This progressive version of electoral hardball — which would merely mean killing the filibuster for voting rights legislation — is an appropriate response to the hardball tactics Republicans have used to manipulate the U.S. political system in recent years,” Hasen wrote.",
            "There are already a number of exemptions to the filibuster carved out for specific categories of legislation or action. Bills related to the budget can go through the reconciliation process, which requires just 50 votes. The same is true for bills to override certain executive branch regulations.

            "In a June 17 Facebook post, actor Alan Muroaka said he was “honored and humbled” to have co-directed “Family Day,” which he described as “an important and milestone episode.”",
            "“‘Sesame Street’ has always been a welcoming place of diversity and inclusion,” wrote Muroaka, who also plays a character named Alan on the show. “Love is love, and we are so happy to add this special family to our Sesame family. Happy Pride to all!!!!”",

            "McDonough said in prepared remarks that the move was “the right thing to do,” and that it was part of an effort to overcome a “dark history” of discrimination against LGBTQ service members. The move is just the first step in what’s likely to be a yearslong federal rulemaking process to expand VA health benefits to cover the surgery, but McDonough said the VA will use the time to “develop capacity to meet the surgical needs” of transgender veterans.",
            "The decision, he said, will allow “transgender vets to go through the full gender confirmation process with VA by their side.” McDonough also referenced what he said were higher rates of mental illness and suicidal thoughts among LGBTQ veterans, and a fear of discrimination that prevents those veterans from seeking care.",
            "“We’re making these changes not only because they are the right thing to do, but because they can save lives,” he said.",
            "McDonough said the decision was based on the “recommendation of our clinicians, so this is a health care decision that has very real physical health care impacts as well as significant mental health impacts.”",
            "The National Center for Transgender Equality estimates that there are more than 134,000 transgender veterans and over 15,000 transgender individuals serving in the military today.",
            "McDonough’s announcement is the latest in a series of moves by the Biden administration to expand protections and benefits to transgender individuals in the military.",
            "Just days into his term, President Joe Biden signed an executive order overturning a Trump administration ban on transgender individuals serving in the military. And in February, McDonough ordered a review of the department’s policies to “ensure that transgender Veterans and employees do not face discrimination on the basis of their gender identity and expression.”"

            "CARLISLE, Pa. (AP) — The remains of 10 more Native American children who died more than a century ago at a boarding school in central Pennsylvania are being disinterred and will be returned to their relatives, authorities said.",
            "A team of archaeologists began work Saturday at the cemetery on the grounds of the Carlisle Barracks, which also houses the U.S. Army War College. Nine of the children were from the Rosebud Sioux tribe in South Dakota and one is from the Alaskan Aleut tribe.",
            "The cemetery contains more than 180 graves of students who attended the former Carlisle Indian Industrial School — a government-run boarding school for Native American children. This is the Army’s fourth disinterment project at the school in as many years.",
            "The school founded by an Army officer opened in 1879 and housed some 10,000 indigenous children before it shut down in 1918. Students were forced to cut their braids, dress in uniforms, speak English and adopt European names. Infectious disease and harsh conditions claimed the lives of many of the children buried there.",
            "The Army is fully funding the cost of the project — about $500,000 per year, including travel to the transfer ceremony as well as transport and reburial of the deceased children, said Barbara Lewandrowski of the Office of Army Cemeteries. The Carlisle Barracks Post Cemetery closed Monday and will likely remain closed until July 17.",
            "“The Army’s commitment remains steadfast to these nine Native American families and one Alaskan Native family. Our objective is to reunite the families with their children in a manner of utmost dignity and respect,” Karen Durham-Aguilera, Executive Director of Army National Military Cemeteries, said in a statement Tuesday.",
            "Since 2016, dozens of Native American and Alaskan Native families have requested that their ancestors be returned from Carlisle, Lewandrowski said.",
            "The children’s English names, and where available their Native Americans names, were: Dennis Strikes First (Blue Tomahawk), Rose Long Face (Little Hawk), Lucy Take The Tail (Pretty Eagle), Warren Painter (Bear Paints Dirt), Ernest Knocks Off (White Thunder), Maud Little Girl (Swift Bear), Friend Hollow Horn Bear, Dora Her Pipe (Brave Bull) and Alvan — also known as Roaster, Kills Seven Horses and One That Kills Seven Horses; and Sophia Tetoff of the Alaskan Aleut tribe on Saint Paul Island in the Bering Sea.",
            "The Carlisle Indian School Digital Resource Center archives at Dickinson College include newspaper clippings detailing the deaths of some students or identification cards with name, tribal affiliation, date of arrival and date of departure, with the reason for the latter often listed as “death,” the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported.",
            "Dennis Strikes First arrived Oct. 6, 1879 and died Jan.19, 1887 of typhoid pneumonia. A news item indicates that he was the son of Blue Tomahawk of Rosebud Agency, Dakota and calls him a “bright, studious, ambitious boy, standing first in his class, and of so tractable a disposition as to be no trouble to his teachers.”",
            "Another clipping detailed the Dec. 14, 1880, deaths of Ernest Knocks Off and Maud Little Girl, describing it as a “sad and mysterious coincidence.” Ernest was sent to the hospital in October to receive treatment for a sore throat, but he wouldn’t agree to take any medicine, leaving him “weak and exhausted.” Maud Little Girl was said to have died of pneumonia and was called a “bright, impulsive, warm-hearted girl, much beloved by her school mates.”"

            "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden is expected to fall short of his commitment to shipping 80 million COVID-19 vaccine doses abroad by the end of June because of regulatory and other hurdles, officials said as they announced new plans Monday for sharing the shots globally.",
            "The White House announced the final allocations for the doses, with 60 million shots going to the global COVAX vaccine sharing alliance and 20 million being directed to specific partners. But fewer than 10 million doses have been shipped around the world, including 2.5 million doses delivered to Taiwan over the weekend, and about 1 million doses delivered to Mexico, Canada and South Korea earlier this month.",
            "Officials said that while the U.S.-produced doses are ready, deliveries have been delayed due to U.S. and recipient legal, logistical and regulatory requirements. A White House official said shipments will go out as soon as countries are ready to receive the doses and the administration sorts out logistical complexities.",
            "The excess doses are not needed in the U.S., where demand for vaccinations has plummeted in recent weeks as more than 177 million Americans have received at least one shot.",
            "On May 17, Biden announced that “over the next six weeks, the United States of America will send 80 million doses overseas. This will be more vaccines than any country has actually shared to date — five times more than any other country — more than Russia and China, which have donated 15 million doses.”",
            "Earlier this month, Biden announced that on top of the 80 million, the U.S. was purchasing 500 million doses from Pfizer to donate globally over the coming year, with the first deliveries expected in August.",
            "Biden initially committed to providing other nations with all 60 million U.S.-produced doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, which has yet to be authorized for use in America but is widely approved around the world. The AstraZeneca doses have been held up for export by a weekslong safety review by the Food and Drug Administration.",
            "Given declining domestic demand, Biden was expected to be able to meet the full 80 million commitment without the AstraZeneca doses. The White House unveiled plans earlier this month for the first 25 million doses for export from existing federal stockpiles of Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines and some have already begun shipping.",
            "On Monday, it revealed plans for 55 million more shots.",
            "Through COVAX, the latest batch of doses will include about 14 million for Latin America and the Caribbean, including Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Paraguay, Bolivia, Uruguay, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Haiti, Dominican Republic, Panama and Costa Rica; approximately 16 million for Asia for India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Maldives, Bhutan, Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Laos, Papua New Guinea, Taiwan, Cambodia and the Pacific Islands; and about 10 million for Africa, with countries selected in concert with the African Union.",
            "About 14 million doses will be shared directly with Colombia, Argentina, Haiti, Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Panama, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, Cabo Verde, Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, Yemen, Tunisia, Oman, West Bank and Gaza, Ukraine, Kosovo, Georgia, Moldova and Bosnia."

            "“I know this is weird but this is my book,” the actor, using a Pixar-style Instagram filter, shared in a video over the weekend, as he showed off the memoir’s vibrant cover. “It’s been a labor of love. I’ve been working on it for the past two years and it’s finally ready.”",
            "While fans are likely already familiar with some of the actor’s backstory, the “brave and inspiring book” will dive deep into his rise from a Philadelphia teen to global superstar and chronicle the highs and lows of his trailblazing and decades-spanning career.",
            "Smith first broke onto the scene as part of the hip-hop duo DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince in the late ’80s, ultimately picking up a couple of Grammy Awards along the way.",
            "After making his mark with the iconic sitcom “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,” Smith went on to conquer the big screen and fronted a string of box-office hits, including “Bad Boys,” “Men in Black,” “Hitch” and “Independence Day.”",
            "“In ‘Will,’ one of the most dynamic and globally-recognized entertainment forces of our time opens up fully about his life, tracing his learning curve to a place where outer success, inner happiness, and human connection are aligned. Along the way, ‘Will’ tells the story in full of one of the most amazing rides through the worlds of music and film that anyone has ever had,” Penguin Press said in a press release.",
            "The 352-page memoir, which Smith wrote in collaboration with “The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck” author Mark Manson, was first announced by Penguin Random House back in 2018. The cover was designed by New Orleans-based visual artist Brandan “BMike” Odums.",
            "Described as a “product of a profound journey of self-knowledge,” the memoir also explores how Smith learned to “master his own emotions” and aims to help readers do the same.",
            "“It’s easy to maneuver the material world once you have conquered your own mind. I believe that. Once you’ve learned the terrain of your own mind, every experience, every emotion, every circumstance, whether positive or negative, simply propels you forward, to greater growth and greater experience,” Smith said in a statement. “That is true will. To move forward in spite of anything. And to move forward in a way that brings others with you, rather than leave them behind.”",
            "As of Sunday, “Will” had already topped Amazon’s list of actor and entertainer biographies, as Smith took to Instagram to thank his fans for supporting his new venture."

The union, which is part of the NewsGuild of New York, said most members would receive pay increases of at least 10%, while some would see raises of up to 63%.",
            "The deal also includes language on job security, severance pay in the event of layoffs, a ban on nondisclosure agreements and a system to compensate staffers for after-hours work, among other features.

Thank you for supporting me in this special project.”",

            "But on Thursday, the U.S. Supreme Court ordered Philadelphia to renew the Catholic Social Services foster care contract, effectively shielding CSS from Philadelphia’s anti-discrimination policies despite it being taxpayer-subsidized.",
            "The court didn’t say religious entities have the right to ignore anti-discrimination laws, however. Instead, it argued that Philadelphia law allows leeway for exemptions to some regulations and that the city didn’t pursue those options before ending the contract with CSS.",
            "In an opinion delivered by Chief Justice John Roberts, a majority on the Court agreed “CSS seeks only an accommodation that will allow it to continue serving the children of Philadelphia in a manner consistent with its religious beliefs; it does not seek to impose those beliefs on anyone else.”",
            "Throughout the day, groups focused on preserving LGBTQ rights measured their responses to the news, depicting the ruling’s preservation of anti-discrimination laws broadly as a win, but also pointing to CSS’s permitted discrimination as a potential harbinger of rulings to come.",
            "In a press release responding to the decision, the ACLU said the ruling was “narrow” and argued it merely forced the city to renew CSS’s foster care contract because Philadelphia is able to make some agencies exempt from certain regulations on a discretionary basis.",
            "“The court did not, however, establish a general right for religious organizations to violate non-discrimination laws,” the ACLU said.",
            "Lambda Legal, the prominent organization that challenges anti-LGBTQ discrimination in court, made a similar argument, spinning the court’s decision as narrow. “Today’s ruling by the Supreme Court is troubling but, importantly, it refused to give a free pass to people or agencies that want to discriminate against LGBTQ people for religious reasons and is limited to the specifics of Philadelphia’s foster care system,” Senior Counsel M. Currey Cook said in a statement.",
            "In his view, Fulton v. Philadelphia hinged on a technicality: The city hadn’t yet provided evidence that CSS had discriminated, it only learned CSS has a policy of anti-LGBTQ discrimination. He said if evidence of the agency’s discrimination was introduced, it would place pressure on the Court to take a historic look at the impact of discriminatory foster care policies.",
            "“When confronted with such facts in a future case, the Court will have to grapple for the first time with the ways such discrimination harms the foster children whose needs and best interests must always be paramount in child welfare cases,” he said.",
            "A statement from the National Black Justice Coalition, an organization focused on ending racism, homophobia and bias against same-gender couples, addressed the court pointedly and said its members were steeling themselves to fend off discriminatory rulings to come.",
            "“All nine Supreme Court justices voted to permit legal discrimination in the city of Philadelphia. This will only harm children in the foster care system, who are all worthy of loving and supportive homes,” said David Johns, executive director of the NBJC. “Children deserve more than such ignorance, bias, and hate.”",
            "In the U.S., there is a long history of racist bias in the foster care system, which has created barriers for Black foster parents and children hoping to be adopted. Black LGBTQ foster parents, in particular, have reported dealing with both racism and homophobia in their experiences trying to adopt.",
            "“Despite today’s loss, we are grateful that the Court’s ruling does not allow all governments to turn a blind eye to taxpayer-funded agencies who discriminate against LGBTQ+ people,” said Johns.",
            "“We will make our expectations clear to government service providers, businesses, employers, health care providers, and landlords. This fight is far from over.”"

            "Ashley Pearce’s daughter was set to start kindergarten last year in Maryland’s Montgomery County school system. But when it became clear that the year would begin online, Pearce found a nearby Catholic school offering in-person instruction and made the switch.",
            "Now Pearce is grappling with a big question: Should her child return to the local public school? She’s hesitant to uproot her daughter after she’s made friends, and Pearce worries that the district might go fully virtual again if there’s an uptick in coronavirus cases.",
            "“It’s going to be fine if we stay where we are, and that stability for my family is probably the way we’re going to go.”",
            "As many parents across the U.S. weigh the same concerns, school districts that lost enrollment during the pandemic are looking anxiously to the fall to see how many families stick with the education choices they made over the last year. In hopes of attracting students, many districts have launched new efforts to connect with families with young children, including blanketing communities with yard signs and enlisting bus drivers to call parents.",
            "There are early signs that enrollment may not fully rebound, and the stakes are high. If enrollment does not recover, public schools that lose students eventually could see funding cuts, though pandemic relief money is boosting budgets for now.",
            "Sustained drops in enrollment could also shift the demographics of America’s public schools. A first-of-its-kind analysis by Chalkbeat and The Associated Press found that enrollment declines varied by student race and ethnicity. Enrollment in preschool to 12th grade dropped by 2.6% across 41 states last fall, and the decline was steepest among white students, whose enrollment fell more than 4%.",
            "White families’ decisions seemed especially swayed by whether their child’s public school offered in-person learning. States where more students were learning fully virtually tended to see larger declines among white students, the Chalkbeat/AP analysis found.",
            "Meanwhile, the nation’s Hispanic student population saw the biggest shift from pre-pandemic trends, with enrollment dipping 1.5% last fall — a significant change, given that Hispanic students had been the country’s fastest-growing student group. That could be tied to some of the disruptions Hispanic families experienced during the pandemic, including higher rates of job losses and higher rates of death and hospitalization from COVID-19.",
            "The data underscores the complicated task ahead for schools trying to reconnect with families who left public schools for different reasons and ended up at a wide range of alternatives.",
            "“Districts might have this kind of ‘different strokes for different folks’ policy,” said Richard Welsh, an associate professor at New York University who’s studied student mobility. “‘We’re open for business and we’re committed to in-person learning’ could be more targeted to white families.”",
            "On the flip side, Welsh said, “when you have districts that are giving tours about their safety protocols, those might be targeted more to their Black and Latinx families” whose communities were hit harder by the pandemic.",
            "One such effort is underway in San Antonio, where the mostly Latino school district saw enrollment drop just over 5%. Officials there project that enrollment will rise this fall but not to pre-pandemic levels.",
            "To build trust with families worried about in-person learning, district officials have been hosting town halls where families can ask experts questions about COVID-19 vaccines. The district will also continue to offer a fully virtual schooling option.",
            "School officials are working to connect with every family who left or did not enroll their child in preschool or kindergarten, whether by phone or with a home visit, Superintendent Pedro Martinez said. The district has even tasked bus drivers with calling families between routes to encourage them to register their children.",
            "And while Martinez is focused on the early grades, where enrollment dipped the most, he has his eye on older students too. Nearly every student in the district is from a low-income family, and many got jobs to help their families weather the pandemic. He’s concerned that so many teens continued learning remotely all spring so they could continue to work, though he understands the financial pressure.",
            "“It’s so easy for a 16- or 17-year-old to prioritize work over school,” he said.",
            "Certain pandemic schooling options, like putting young children in child care instead of kindergarten, will likely fall by the wayside. But some families may stick with private schools, especially if, like Pearce, they see them as a way to avoid uncertainty.",
            "It remains unclear exactly how many students those schools absorbed. In some states that track it, like Delaware and New Hampshire, private school enrollment grew 5% or more this year, according to data obtained by Chalkbeat and the AP. But in several others, including New York, Louisiana, Indiana and Colorado, private school enrollment fell by 3% or more, indicating families didn’t switch en masse.",
            "Notably, it wasn’t just the wealthy who left public schools. There were significant enrollment declines among students from low-income families and more affluent ones in the 35 states that provided data.",
            "Other families might continue to home-school their children — a practice that shot up in the few states that tracked it. In New York and Virginia, for example, home schooling grew by more than 50% this year, though it remained a relatively rare choice.",
            "Regardless, districts are now ramping up their recruitment efforts, hoping to build on the small upticks they saw over the last few months as in-person learning became more widely available.",
            "In Spokane, Washington, enrollment fell by nearly 7% last fall, with the steepest declines among Asian, Black and white students. District officials have been reaching out to families via text messages and mailers and through community groups.",
            "They’ve been emphasizing the district’s plan to shrink class sizes this fall, which they see as a selling point for families who want more individual attention for their children and for those with lingering fears about the coronavirus. The district assures families that it will offer both full-time in-person instruction and a virtual option.",
            "“We want to create as much predictability, and try to mitigate a sense of unknown and fear, to the greatest extent possible,” Superintendent Adam Swinyard said, “and just let our families know that we’re ready and eager to be back.”",
            "Researchers who track student demographics are also watching closely to see who returns. By the fall, it will be clearer if the enrollment shifts carry longer-term implications.",
            "Some districts already expect the pandemic to have a lasting effect.",
            "In Denver, officials estimate that enrollment will drop by 6% in the coming years — a rate nearly double what was predicted before the pandemic. Declining birth rates and rising housing prices that drive families away are big factors, but officials believe the pandemic exacerbated those losses, especially in the youngest grades. Kindergarten applications are down considerably for the upcoming school year.",
            "The district’s planning director, Sara Walsh, said the total decline could be “pretty significant.” But she hasn’t given up on a turnaround: “I am hoping that maybe all of a sudden tons of kids show up.”\n\n___\n\nMelanie Asmar and Samuel Park of Chalkbeat contributed to this report."

            "JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel’s parliament approved a new coalition government on Sunday that sent Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu into the opposition after a record 12 years in office and a political crisis that sparked four elections in two years.",
            "Naftali Bennett, the head of a small ultranationalist party, was sworn in as prime minister after a narrow 60-59 vote in parliament. But if he wants to keep the job, he will have to maintain an unwieldy coalition of parties from the political right, left and center.",
            "The eight parties, including a small Arab faction that is making history by sitting in the ruling coalition, are united in their opposition to Netanyahu and new elections but agree on little else. They are likely to pursue a modest agenda that seeks to reduce tensions with the Palestinians and maintain good relations with the U.S. without launching any major initiatives.",
            "Netanyahu sat silently during the vote. After it was approved, he stood up to leave the chamber, before turning around and shaking Bennett’s hand. A dejected Netanyahu, wearing a black medical mask, briefly sat in the opposition leader’s chair before walking out.",
            "Netanyahu, who is on trial for corruption, remains the head of the largest party in parliament and is expected to vigorously oppose the new government. If just one faction bolts, it could lose its majority and would be at risk of collapse, giving him an opening to return to power.",
            "The country’s deep divisions were on vivid display as Bennett addressed parliament ahead of the vote. He was repeatedly interrupted and loudly heckled by supporters of Netanyahu, several of whom were escorted out of the chamber.",
            "Bennett’s speech mostly dwelled on domestic issues, but he expressed opposition to U.S. efforts to revive Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers.",
            "“Israel will not allow Iran to arm itself with nuclear weapons,” Bennett said, vowing to maintain Netanyahu’s confrontational policy. “Israel will not be a party to the agreement and will continue to preserve full freedom of action.”",
            "Bennett nevertheless thanked President Joe Biden and the U.S. for its decades of support for Israel.",
            "Netanyahu, speaking after him, vowed to return to power. He predicted the incoming government would be weak on Iran and give in to U.S. demands to make concessions to the Palestinians.",
            "“If it is destined for us to be in the opposition, we will do it with our backs straight until we topple this dangerous government and return to lead the country in our way,” he said.",
            "Yohanan Plesner, president of the Israel Democracy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, said the new government will likely be more stable than it appears.",
            "“Even though it has a very narrow majority, it will be very difficult to topple and replace because the opposition is not cohesive,” he said. Each party in the coalition will want to prove that it can deliver, and for that they need “time and achievements.”",
            "Still, Netanyahu “will continue to cast a shadow,” Plesner said. He expects the incoming opposition leader to exploit events and propose legislation that right-wing coalition members would like to support but can’t — all in order to embarrass and undermine them.",
            "The new government is meanwhile promising a return to normalcy after a tumultuous two years that saw four elections, an 11-day Gaza war last month and a coronavirus outbreak that devastated the economy before it was largely brought under control by a successful vaccination campaign.",
            "The driving force behind the coalition is Yair Lapid, a political centrist who will become prime minister in two years, if the government lasts that long.",
            "He called off a planned speech to parliament, instead saying he was ashamed that his 86-year-old mother had to witness the raucous behavior of his opponents. In a brief speech, he asked for “forgiveness from my mother.”",
            "“I wanted her to be proud of the democratic process in Israel. Instead she, along with every citizen of Israel, is ashamed of you and remembers clearly why it’s time to replace you,” he said.",
            "The new government is expected to win a narrow majority in the 120-member assembly, after which it will be sworn in. The government plans to hold its first official meeting later this evening.",
            "It’s unclear when Netanyahu will move out of the official residence. He has lashed out at the new government in apocalyptic terms and accused Bennett of defrauding voters by running as a right-wing stalwart and then partnering with the left.",
            "Netanyahu’s supporters have held angry protests outside the homes of rival lawmakers, who say they have received death threats naming their family members. Israel’s Shin Bet internal security service issued a rare public warning about the incitement earlier this month, saying it could lead to violence.",
            "Netanyahu has condemned the incitement while noting that he has also been a target.",
            "His place in Israeli history is secure, having served as prime minister for a total of 15 years — more than any other, including the country’s founder, David Ben-Gurion.",
            "Netanyahu began his long rule by defying the Obama administration, refusing to freeze settlement construction as it tried unsuccessfully to revive the peace process. Relations with Israel’s closest ally grew even rockier when Netanyahu vigorously campaigned against President Barack Obama’s emerging nuclear deal with Iran, even denouncing it in an address to the U.S. Congress.",
            "But he suffered few if any consequences from those clashes and was richly rewarded by the Trump administration, which recognized contested Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, helped broker normalization agreements with four Arab states and withdrew the U.S. from the Iran deal.",
            "Netanyahu has portrayed himself as a world-class statesman, boasting of his close ties with Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. He has also cultivated ties with Arab and African countries that long shunned Israel over its policies toward the Palestinians.",
            "But he has gotten a far chillier reception from the Biden administration and is widely seen as having undermined the long tradition of bipartisan support for Israel in the United States.",
            "His reputation as a political magician has also faded at home, where he has become a deeply polarizing figure. Critics say he has long pursued a divide-and-conquer strategy that aggravated rifts in Israeli society between Jews and Arabs and between his close ultra-Orthodox allies and secular Jews.",
            "In November 2019, he was indicted for fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes. He refused calls to step down, instead lashing out at the media, judiciary and law enforcement, going so far as to accuse his political opponents of orchestrating an attempted coup. Last year, protesters began holding weekly rallies across the country calling on him to resign.",
            "Netanyahu remains popular among the hard-line nationalists who dominate Israeli politics, but he could soon face a leadership challenge from within his own party. A less polarizing Likud leader would stand a good chance of assembling a coalition that is both farther to the right and more stable than the government that is set to be sworn in."

            "Interior Secretary Deb Haaland has advised President Joe Biden to reverse former President Donald Trump’s rollbacks of three national monuments, restoring them to their original boundaries and reinstating more stringent protections, according to media reports.",
            "The expected move, which The Washington Post first reported Monday and The New York Times later confirmed, is a first step toward fulfilling the president’s campaign promise to “reverse the Trump administration’s assaults on America’s natural treasures.”",
            "Biden tasked Haaland with reviewing Trump’s dismantling of protected monument sites — Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante in southern Utah and Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument off the Atlantic coast — and recommending whether to undo the changes.",
            "Haaland’s recommendations, detailed in a still-confidential report to the White House, include restoring the original boundaries of Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante, as well as reinstating fishing and deep-sea mining restrictions in Northeast Canyons, according to The Washington Post.",
            "The Interior Department declined to comment. The White House did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.",
            "Haaland traveled to Utah in April to tour the two monuments and meet with local stakeholders, including members of the Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition, which is made up of the five Native American tribes that petitioned the Obama administration to grant Bears Ears monument status. She submitted her report to the White House earlier this month, but it has not yet been made public.",
            "The recommended reversal comes nearly four years after the Trump administration conducted a sham review of more than two dozen national monument designations. That ultimately led to Trump carving more than 2 million acres from the southern Utah sites. The boundary of Bears Ears, a 1.35 million-acre landscape that several tribes consider sacred, was cut by 85%. Nearby 1.87 million-acre Grand Staircase-Escalante, the largest land national monument in the country and rich in both archeological and paleontological resources, was cut roughly in half.",
            "Trump, whose conservation record was nothing short of abysmal, tried to rewrite history ahead of the 2020 election, characterizing the monument rollbacks as good for his environmental legacy. “We did Bears Ears,” he said, proudly referring to gutting the boundary and opening the door for energy and mineral development. “The kind of things we’ve done are really record-setting.”",
            "In fact, it was the largest rollback of federal land protections in U.S. history — and not at all popular with the American public.",
            "As HuffPost has reported, the entire Trump-era monument review and rollback was built on a bogus claim: that early monument designations under the Antiquities Act were small and that recent presidents have abused the law to “lock up” massive landscapes.",
            "“Since the 1900s, when the [Antiquities] Act was first used, the average size of national monuments exploded from an average of 422 acres per monument,” Trump’s Interior Department wrote in an April 2017 press release. “Now it’s not uncommon for a monument to be more than a million acres.”",
            "The Trump administration never explained the 422-acre figure, despite HuffPost’s numerous requests, and there is seemingly no math of early monument sizes that comes close to such an average.",
            "Asked recently if the Biden team was able to identify the origin of the figure as part of its monument review, an Interior official said the agency could not verify or substantiate it.",
            "Along with dismantling Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante, Trump greenlit commercial fishing within Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument, a 4,900-square-mile protected site off the East Coast.",
            "Environmental groups were quick to celebrate Monday’s news.",
            "“If President Biden were to follow such recommendations, it would mark an encouraging step forward,” The Wilderness Society said in a statement. “Then, the next step should be expanding Bears Ears’ monument protection to cover the full area originally proposed by the Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition.”\n\nLocal tribes had petitioned for a 1.9 million-acre monument, much larger than the one that President Barack Obama designated in 2016."

            "The queen hosted the president and first lady Jill Biden at Windsor Castle, her royal residence near London. Biden flew to London after wrapping up his participation in a three-day summit of leaders of the world’s wealthy democracies in Cornwall, in southwestern England. He arrived at the castle aboard the presidential helicopter and was ferried to the queen in a black Range Rover.",
            "The 95-year-old monarch greeted the Bidens in the castle’s quadrangle, where she waited beneath a covered dais that shielded her from the sun on one of the hottest days of the year so far in the United Kingdom. Assembled soldiers from the Queen’s Company First Battalion Grenadier Guards gave a royal salute and the Bidens placed their hands over their hearts as the U.S. national anthem was played.",
            "The president was then led across the grass for an inspection of the Guard of Honor. He wore a stern expression on his face after he had removed his trademark sunglasses, but when the 78-year-old Biden got to the end of the row, he smiled for the soldier in front of him who held up a sword. The queen and Jill Biden remained on the dais.",
            "Biden returned to the dais and he, the first lady and the white-gloved woman who has held the British throne for nearly 70 years watched the military march past before they went inside for tea. As they left the dais, Biden offered the queen an elbow. She declined and stepped down on her own power, using the handrail.",
            "The Bidens emerged from the castle just shy of having spent a full hour with the queen and boarded the helicopter for the return trip to London.",
            "At Heathrow Airport, Biden talked about the queen with his traveling press corps, saying she was “very gracious,” that she asked him about Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping and that he had invited her to visit the White House.",
            "“I don’t think she’ll be insulted, but she reminded me of my mother,” Biden said before he boarded Air Force One for his next stop, Brussels.",
            "It generally is frowned upon for anyone to reveal the contents of their private talks with the queen.",
            "Biden is the 13th American president to meet the monarch. President Lyndon B. Johnson is the only one who did not make her acquaintance while he was in office.",
            "She has welcomed four other U.S. presidents to Windsor Castle, where she has been isolating during the coronavirus pandemic. They are Donald Trump in 2018, Barack Obama in 2016, George W. Bush in 2008 and Ronald Reagan in 1982.",
            "Biden’s first time meeting the queen came in November 1982, when as a U.S. senator he traveled to the United Kingdom for a meeting of the British-American Parliamentary Group, the White House said Sunday. Biden was part of a group that met with the monarch during that visit.",

            "A Virginia man’s decision to dump thousands of pennies on his ex-wife’s lawn as his final child support payment is being turned into some positive change, thanks to the generous actions of the woman and her teenage daughter.",
            "Avery Sanford spoke out about the nasty experience, telling local station WTVR that she had just turned 18 when her father rented a trailer last month to cart his final payment, in the form of more than 80,000 pennies, over to her and her mother’s home to dump in front of their yard.",
            "“It is really hurtful and damaging to your kids when you do things like that,” Sanford told the Richmond-based station of his action. “And it doesn’t matter how old your kids — it doesn’t matter if they’re a young child or an adult. The actions of your parents will always have some effect on you.”",
            "Though her father’s behavior didn’t add up, what did, she said, was donating it all to a local domestic violence shelter, ultimately turning a sad situation into a positive one.",
            "“It’s just incredible,” Cathy Easter, executive director of Safe Harbor in Richmond, told HuffPost Thursday of the donation.",
            "Easter said Safe Harbor received around $850 from the teen and her mother, but once word spread about their experience, others started to reach out and donate online as well. As of Thursday, the organization has received nearly $5,000 on the women’s behalf.",
            "“A friend of theirs matched the exact amount and then other people started making donations in their honor,” Easter said. “In the memo line, they’re saying they’re doing this in honor of Avery and her mom.”",
            "For Safe Harbor, which helps victims of domestic violence, sexual violence, and human trafficking, Easter said the donations couldn’t have come at a more critical time.",
            "“During the pandemic, incidents of domestic violence incidents have increased, people who have been abused, especially since the beginning, were trapped in their homes with their abusers and couldn’t leave,” she said. “Since restrictions started lifting, it’s like a tsunami wave of people reaching out for help at a time when federal funding has been cut, so this gift for us has been amazing.”",
            "Easter also expressed amazement at the mother and daughter’s ability to take a positive stance when faced with such hostility.",
            "“I think about Avery and her mother taking this really terrible and demeaning experience and turning it into something positive,” she said. “To me, it’s just a beautiful thing that they have done together as a mother and daughter.”",
            "Sanford’s father told WTVR off camera that his emotions got the best of him and that the last thing he wanted to do was create more of a divide between him and his daughter.",
            "The teen said she hasn’t spoken with her father in years and expressed disappointment in his actions. Still, she said, “you can learn a lesson from it.”",
            "Her mother contacted Henrico County police and filed a report over the incident. A representative with the police division confirmed the incident to HuffPost but said no charges were filed.",

            "Arizona state Senate Republicans’ “audit” of 2020 election results in Maricopa County is so unprofessional and illegitimate that many election officials won’t even refer to it as an audit.",
            "But the GOP’s audit fever is spreading nevertheless: Driven by the same lies about election fraud that underpin the Arizona audit, Republican lawmakers and conservative activists in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are clamoring for their states to launch their own sham reviews. Another so-called forensic audit ― a term veteran election officials have not used before ― could soon begin in Georgia’s largest county. Embattled Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz (R) visited Arizona last week with dreams of convincing his state ― which, unlike the others, former President Donald Trump won ― and others to replicate the process. Other GOP lawmakers, including several with plans to seek higher office next year, have flocked to Phoenix too.",
            "Not all Republicans are on board with the push to continue conducting conspiratorial reviews of the election. But those behind the Arizona audit, and the conservatives seeking to bring them to other states, are preying on a general misunderstanding of how election audits and reviews typically work to promote their own cynical political goals, undermining democracy and American elections in the process.",
            "“The fact of the matter is that in most states, there is already some sort of process in place post-election to ensure the accuracy and fairness of the results before those results are certified,” Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs (D) told HuffPost this week. “People screaming for this kind of audit don’t understand how those things work, and the systems that are already in place to ensure that there are checks and balances.”",
            "“We cannot continue to have people questioning these processes just because they don’t like the result,” she said.",
            "Independent observers and election officials from both parties and across multiple states have repeatedly said that the 2020 election was safer, more secure, and more audited than any contest in American history, thanks in part to increased reliance on mail-in ballots because of the COVID-19 pandemic. There have been numerous audits that follow typical standards and best practices in states and counties. None have turned up evidence of the sort of widespread fraud that Trump and his Republican supporters have insisted took place; neither did the New Hampshire audit to which Trump had pinned his hopes of surfacing evidence of the sort of malfeasance he claimed occurred.",
            "The Arizona audit, meanwhile, is being conducted by a firm that has no experience reviewing an election and has faced allegations that it has violated even the most basic standards and practices of typical audits. Observers have alleged that reviewers have improperly handled ballots; broken the chain of custody for how ballots should be reviewed, stored and transported; and potentially compromised voting machines and election integrity by having active Wi-Fi connections in the location of the audit. It is unclear who is paying for the process, a clear violation of normal standards of transparency for election reviews. And it has possibly compromised Maricopa County’s electronic voting machines, potentially costing local taxpayers the millions of dollars it will take to replace them.",
            "“Every single day there’s a new, ‘Oh my god, you can’t make this stuff up,’” Hobbs said.",
            "But none of that has swayed the Republican Party’s most zealous anti-democratic members. Instead, it seems to have made them even more giddy to copy the process.",
            "In late May, a Georgia judge authorized an “audit” of 147,000 absentee ballots in Fulton County, where Atlanta is. County officials have since sought to block the review from occurring.",
            "The claims behind the Fulton County review are no less conspiratorial than the Arizona GOP’s: Groups seeking the audit have asserted that Fulton County was home to “10,000 to 20,000 probably false ballots,” after a handful of poll watchers reported that many mail-in ballots appeared Xeroxed instead of filled out by hand.",
            "Both Republican and Democratic election officials have argued that Fulton County’s ballots have already been hand recounted, hand audited and re-scanned since the election. None of those typical audit practices revealed any evidence of fraud, much less enough to alter Biden’s 12,000-vote victory in Georgia. But Georgia politicians have also made the pilgrimage to Phoenix in the hopes of conducting an even more aggressive election review. Vernon Jones, a Republican running for governor in Georgia, visited the audit site this week and called on Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) to immediately “bring the Arizona playbook back home to Georgia.”",
            "In Pennsylvania, state Sen. Doug Mastriano and other Republican lawmakers are pushing GOP majorities to conduct a similar audit of the state’s elections, which Trump lost in November. Mastriano, who was at the Washington, D.C., rally that precipitated the U.S. Capitol insurrection on Jan. 6, called the Arizona review “the most comprehensive election audit in the history of the United States” after visiting the audit site. State Sen. Chris Dush (R), who traveled to Arizona with Mastriano, told The Associated Press that he “absolutely” wanted Pennsylvania to conduct a similar audit.",
            "Pennsylvania officials have stressed that the state’s election has already been audited twice, and neither review turned up any evidence of widespread fraud.",
            "Two Michigan GOP officials are hoping to pressure Republican legislative leaders there to launch their own “forensic audit” of election results: “I know this takes a bit of time and a bit of money – but this is what worked in AZ!” Tami Carlone, the Michigan GOP’s grassroots chair, wrote in a recent email to party delegates, the Lansing Journal reported this week.",
            "In April, the Michigan Bureau of Elections said that more than 250 post-election audits had taken place across the state, more than after any previous election.",
            "“The audits are concrete evidence that November’s election was fair, secure and accurate, and that the results reflect the will of Michigan voters,” Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson (D) said in a statement accompanying a report on the audits.",
            "Mastriano and Jones are not the only Republican officials who were in Washington on the day of the insurrection to travel to Arizona. Virginia state Sen. Amanda Chase, Colorado state Rep. Ron Hanks and Alaska state Rep. David Eastman were all in D.C. on Jan. 6 for the Trump rally, and have all since traveled to Arizona to observe the current audit. Chase, who lost her bid to win the GOP gubernatorial nomination in Virginia last month, tweeted that Republicans should ”#auditeverystate” after her trip to Phoenix.",
            "The Republican Party has coalesced around efforts to restrict voting rights in the wake of Trump’s election loss. But it is more divided over the push to replicate the Arizona audit: GOP leaders in Pennsylvania have resisted Mastriano’s push for a review and said that no new audits will take place. Michigan Republican leaders have not fully embraced the idea. (A Michigan state judge last month dismissed a lawsuit that sought an audit of one rural county’s ballots.) It’s unclear how many Georgia Republicans, who rammed through a sweeping package of voting restrictions in April, favor the push for an Arizona-style audit in that state, which Trump also lost.",
            "The Arizona Senate GOP’s audit effort caught officials there a little off guard, Hobbs said, because they had prepared for nearly every post-election challenge scenario but didn’t have an existing legal or statutory framework for how to combat such an unprecedented and obviously conspiratorial challenge. In retrospect, Hobbs said that local election officials in Arizona probably missed opportunities to try to stop the audit from proceeding, and that officials in other states should heed the warnings coming from Arizona.",
            "“My advice to other states is to take every legal opportunity you have to fight this from the start,” Hobbs said.",
            "There is no chance the Arizona audit will overturn the results of the state’s election, and none that audits will reverse the outcome anywhere else they might take place. But they are clearly meant to undermine faith in American democracy. The Arizona audit will have that effect no matter the outcome, election officials say, and no one will have learned much of anything about how elections or audits are supposed to work.",
            "“This is going to continue to undermine people’s trust in our democracy and our elections, and undermining confidence in our election system is in and of itself a tool of voter suppression,” Hobbs said. “It’s also a way to justify some of the really terrible laws that we’re seeing that severely hamper and restrict access to voting.”",
            "Hobbs is particularly concerned about Republican voters who have bought into Trump’s reported assertions that the Arizona audit will start a domino effect that culminates with his reinstatement to office in August, a scenario that is not possible — with or without the audits.",
            "“This misinformation is dangerous,” Hobbs said, “and the rhetoric is ramping up the same way it did after the November election.”",
            "But for many Republicans, using the audits to further erode faith in democratic institutions and elections seems to be the point. Several of the conservative lawmakers backing Arizona-inspired audit pushes are aiming to play an increasingly large role in the party’s future, and are betting that mimicking Trump and pushing baseless, anti-democratic conspiracies is the key to their political fortunes.",
            "Mastriano is considering a run for governor of Pennsylvania in 2022, and has also been mentioned as a potential candidate in next year’s GOP primary for the state’s open U.S. Senate seat. Jones, the GOP gubernatorial candidate in Georgia, this week blasted Kemp for not traveling to Arizona and endorsing the state’s audit. GOP lawmakers who attempted to overturn the election are pursuing secretary of state jobs in Georgia, Arizona, Michigan and Nevada.",
            "The audit’s ability to attract intrigue from ambitious conservative lawmakers like Mastriano and Jones has generated concerns among election officials that the Arizona audit could pave the way for even more zealous charades to become a normal feature of future elections. They worry that normal audits, which are common and follow set procedures based on best practices and state laws, will be replaced by shambolic efforts to overturn results losing candidates refuse to accept.",
            "“Since the 2020 election, we’ve seen local candidates in some states call for a Maricopa-style forensic audit because they don’t believe that they lost,” Tammy Patrick, a senior adviser for Democracy Fund, said during a recent press call. “If this is the precedent that we’re setting, that in any election someone who loses can drag the election through the mud for months after the fact, it’s going to taint the process, and turn people off on it.”"

            "Scientists have revived a handful of tiny, multicellular, freshwater creatures known as bdelloid rotifers after they spent 24,000 years frozen in Siberian permafrost.",
            "The findings, published Monday in the journal Current Biology, indicate the creatures can survive in a state of crytobiosis — where an animal responds to environmental stresses by essentially drying itself out and entering a dormant state — much longer than previously known. Earlier studies found bdelloid rotifers could survive extreme cold in a cryptobiotic state for at least six to 10 years.",
            "“Our report is the hardest proof as of today that multicellular animals could withstand tens of thousands of years in cryptobiosis, the state of almost completely arrested metabolism,” Stas Malavin, a co-author of the study and a researcher at Russia’s Institute of Physicochemical and Biological Problems in Soil Science, said in a press statement.",
            "For this new study, scientists took 11.5-foot-deep core samples from the Alazeya River in northeastern Siberia, where isolated microbes, including rotifers, were found frozen and dormant.",
            "Carbon-dating of the core indicates the rotifers were around 24,000 years old and had been trapped in the frozen soil since the Pleistocene epoch, which ended roughly 11,700 years ago.",
            "Once thawed, the creatures came back to life and began reproducing via parthenogenesis, an asexual process that creates clones of the original.",
            "“We revived animals that saw woolly mammoths,” Malavin told The New York Times, “which is quite impressive.”",
            "Although there’s no doubting the durability of the rotifer, the title of longest nap goes to the nematode. In 2018, scientists revived some of the microscopic worms ― also yanked out of the Siberian permafrost ― that had been frozen for 42,000 years."

            "My elder kid is chatty. Unless he is absorbed in a TV show, he’s often talking, and as he is now 6 years old and deeply into Pokemon, his conversations generally revolve around obscure facts about favorite characters I do not care about in the slightest. His running dialogue is both completely charming ... and completely nonstop. My husband and I sometimes joke that he must have come hardwired with an internal word count he has to hit every day.",
            "Of course, I never want to make my son feel bad about his chattiness. (Even now, writing this, I feel guilty.) Truly, I’m so happy he feels comfortable being talkative around us, and I know I’ll miss these conversations when he’s older. But sometimes — particularly during the COVID pandemic, when our family is still together a lot more than usual during the days — life with a nonstop talker is intense.",
            "It also so happens that I’m a true introvert who requires quiet and alone time to recharge, which doesn’t tend to jell well with a nonstop-talker. I’d like to be able to give my son my full attention when we’re really engaged in a dialogue together, but I’d also like to have some (not much!) peace and quiet throughout the day. What is a mom like me to do?",
            "Here’s what fellow parents of adorable-but-chatty kids need to know about getting some quiet time, without breaking anyone’s spirit.",
            "1. Have a go-to phrase that lets your child know you need a break",
            "When you’ve reached a point where you just need a break, you should absolutely tell your child that directly, Aubrey Hargis, a parent coach and educational consultant, told HuffPost. You’re not trying to hurt their feelings or stifle them; you’re setting boundaries in a clear and respectful way.",
            "“It helps to have a tried-and-true phrase in your back pocket to pull out when you’re feeling overwhelmed,” Hargis recommended. “One phrase that works well is: ‘I would love to hear more about that later. Right now I am ...’ or ‘What you have to say is important. I would love to listen to you when I am finished with ...’”",
            "Know that it might take a bit of practice for them to get the idea, but that’s OK. Ultimately, when you tell your child you need a break, you’re teaching about what it means to have a conversation with someone, which is not just talking at someone 24/7 because you can.",
            "“It’s important to remember that this time period is not only a time to nurture language development,” said Hargis, referring to the fact that many children have a real explosion in language skills around 18 months (that can continue on for years, in the case of really voluble kiddos). “It’s also a fabulous opportunity to teach children about respectful social communication.”",
            "2. Make a point of revisiting conversations later",
            "After you’ve told your child you need a break, it’s important to circle back on what they were saying to make sure they know you were listening — and that you’re still available to them.",
            "“Invite the conversation back in with, ‘Hey, you were going to tell me something important. I am finished, and I would like to talk to you about it now,’” Hargis recommended.",
            "What you’re making clear to your child is that you’re eager to engage with them and hear what’s on their mind, and that you weren’t cutting them off because you’re mean or you’re not interested in what they have to say.",
            "“This builds trust,” Hargis said, “and helps children recognize that conversations have a beginning ... and also an end!”",
            "3. Distinguish between narrative and conversation",
            "It’s totally normal for kids of all ages to engage in self-talk, and some research suggests it’s really beneficial for them. One study found, for example, that preschool-age children who talk to themselves tend to perform better on motor tasks than those who stay silent. Children use “private speech” to help themselves make sense of the world around them and what they’re doing at any given time.",
            "A challenge as a parent — particularly as a parent of young children — is figuring out what you actually need to pay attention to.",
            "“Distinguish between which chatter is self-talk that you actually don’t need to pay attention to and which chatter is intended to share excitement with you,” recommends a Parents.com article. “The second would be higher priority for some sort of response to indicate you care about what she has to say.”",
            "And help your kiddo figure that out, too. Make it clear that you won’t be offering a response to every thought that pops in her head, Parents.com says, and that there’s a difference between narrating and directly engaging with you.",
            "4. Cultivate a respect for silence — together",
            "Hargis often recommends that families cultivate a “shared appreciation of silence.” It doesn’t have to be an all-the-time thing, but consciously carve out times when you can be together quietly, and make it clear why it’s important to you.",
            "“It can be as simple as going out into nature and listening to the birds or the rustling of leaves,” Hargis said. “This helps children feel more comfortable with being together in silence, communicating nonverbally.”",
            "Also, quiet time is really important for overall physical and mental well-being, helping with everything from reducing heart rate and blood pressure to increased creativity and emotional connection. So teaching your child from a young age that silence really is golden isn’t mean; it’s an important lifelong gift."

            "After six months of Democratic control in Washington, the party’s progressive wing is growing increasingly restless as campaign promises go undone — blocked not only by Republican obstruction, but also by Democrats’ own inability to unite fully around priorities.",
            "The time ahead is pivotal for President Joe Biden and his allies in Congress to seize what some view as a transformative moment to rebuild the economy and reshape the country.",
            "“There’s a lot of anxiety,” said Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Ca., who had been a co-chair of Bernie Sanders’ presidential bid. “It’s a question really for President Biden: What kind of president does he want to be?”",
            "The summer work period is traditionally among the busiest for Congress, but especially sharpened this year as Democrats strain to deliver on Biden’s agenda. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer warned colleagues that June will “test our resolve” as senators returned Monday with infrastructure talks dragging and the limits of bipartisanship in the 50-50 Senate increasingly clear.",
            "The party suffered a debilitating blow over the weekend when Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., announced his opposition to the voting bill, titled S.1 because it is a top party priority. Many Democrats view it as crucial to protecting democracy and a direct response to restrictive new voting laws being passed in Republican-led states egged on by Donald Trump, the former president.",
            "“Do I feel discouraged? Yes,” said Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, warning of a failure of deliver on the promises. “We will lose voters for a generation.”",
            "Schumer, in setting the agenda, is challenging senators to prepare to make tough choices. But he is also facing a test of his own ability to lead the big-tent party through a volatile period of shifting priorities and tactics in the aftermath of the Trump era and the Capitol insurrection.",
            "While Democratic senators have been generating goodwill by considering bipartisan bills in the evenly split Senate, they face mounting pressure from voters who put them in office to fight harder for legislation that Republicans are determined to block with the filibuster. Democrats hold the edge in the Senate because Vice President Kamala Harris can break a voting tie.",
            "Fed up by the delays, some senators are ready to change the rules to eliminate the filibuster, which they blame for the inaction. The long-running Senate filibuster rules require 60 votes to advance most legislation, meaning as many as 10 Republicans would need to cross party lines to help Democrats achieve their priorities. Some senators propose reducing the voting threshold to 51.",
            "But Manchin, in announcing his opposition to the voting rights bill Sunday as the “wrong piece of legislation to bring our country together,” also restated his refusal to end the filibuster — for now, denying his party a crucial vote needed to make the rules change that could help advance its agenda.",
            "On Tuesday, leading civil rights figures including Rev. Al Sharpton and Marc Morial are scheduled to meet with Manchin in Washington. Biden urged them to visit the senator to discuss the voting bill and the legislative agenda. He encouraged them to keep the conversation constructive and not put pressure the senator — at least not yet, according to a person familiar with the discussion but not authorized to speak about private conversations.",
            "While Manchin has talked about supporting another voting bill, the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, advocates of S.1 say both pieces of legislation are needed. Biden agrees Congress should move forward with both, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday.",
            "At the same time, Democratic groups supporting S.1 vowed to continue with a $30 million campaign pressing Democratic senators to rewrite filibuster rules and pass the bill — including with TV ads in Manchin’s West Virginia.",
            "But it’s not just Manchin who opposes changing the filibuster laws. Without support from him or other filibuster defenders, like Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., Democratic senators will be forced to confront the limits of their fragile majority. If Democrats decided to go it alone on the big infrastructure bill, as talks with Republican senators stall, they would need to be unified because they would have no votes to spare.",
            "Failing to deliver on campaign promises that are popular with voters could exacerbate party divisions and expose Democrats to criticism from their own ranks as well as from Republicans eager to show that Biden’s party cannot govern.",
            "“We need to move the ball,” said Yvette Simpson, CEO of Democracy for America, a liberal advocacy organization.",
            "“We told everyone to come out against all odds in the pandemic and vote,” she said about the 2020 election. The promise was that with Democrats in power, ”we’re going to have all these great things happen, their lives are going to be better. And what they’re finding is that it looks like Washington as usual.”",
            "Schumer has been laying the groundwork for this moment since he became majority leader in January, trying to build the case that bipartisanship can work in some cases — with passage of an Asian hate crimes bill or a water public works package. But he also recognizes that it has limits, according to two Democratic aides granted anonymity to discuss the private strategy.",
            "The Democrats’ weekly closed-door policy caucus lunches have been intense, particularly during the two special sessions they have held to privately debate the path forward on the voting rights bill, one of the aides said.",
            "Rather than force reluctant senators to fall in line, Schumer is trying to lead Democrats to their own conclusion — either bipartisan deals with Republicans are possible or they have no choice but to go it alone on infrastructure or other priorities, the aides said.",
            "One aide suggested Schumer is no arm-twisting leader in the style of Lyndon Johnson, who before he became president was famous for his hardball cajoling as majority leader.",
            "Khanna said the president, however, can have a big role. “This would be his LBJ moment — can he pick up the phone and work his magic to get his Democrats on board?”",

            "“It isn’t that I enjoy saying: ‘Doom, doom, doom,’” he continued. “On the contrary, I’d much rather [say]: ‘Enjoy, take thrill, excitement, pleasure, joy, joy, joy, joy.’ But if you’ve got any sense of responsibility, you can’t do that.”",
            "The documentarian’s comments come amid ongoing and increasingly dire warnings from the planet’s scientists that climate change is largely continuing unabated. A report released last month by the Environmental Protection Agency detailed a disturbing shift in the United States caused by a warming world: The destruction of permafrost in Alaska, a spike in heat waves nationwide and longer-lasting wildfire and pollen season.",

            "The bipartisan report authored by the Senate’s Homeland Security and Rules committees laid out the events of Jan. 6 in the greatest detail to date. But it still came up short on answers to key questions, such as why it took so long for authorities to mobilize. The report’s authors concluded that “no one could explain why [the D.C. National Guard] did not deploy until after 5:00 p.m.,” when a mob of rioters had breached law enforcement barricades and broken into the Capitol around three hours earlier to disrupt official certification of President Joe Biden’s election win.",
            "Included in the report is more complete information about what law enforcement knew about the potential for violence that day from social media posts and maps of the Capitol complex’s tunnel systems posted online.",
            "Multiple organizations ― including the FBI and Department of Homeland Security ― failed to fully comply with requests for information, the report notes.",
            "Schumer said that he “reserves the right to bring legislation for an independent bipartisan commission to the Senate floor for another vote.” He said the same thing in a letter to colleagues shortly before Memorial Day, noting only that he would do so “at the appropriate time.”",
            "Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) remarked Tuesday that he would continue to oppose the commission because he felt currently available information to be sufficient.",
            "“Today’s report is one of the many reasons I’m confident in the abilities of the existing investigations to uncover all actionable facts about the events of January 6,” McConnell said. “I’ll continue to support these efforts over any that seek to politicize the process, and I would urge my colleagues to do the same.”",
            "Last month, led by McConnell, Republicans successfully prevented the chamber from taking up House-passed legislation that would authorize an independent commission ― the first use of the filibuster in Biden’s presidency. The Republicans did so despite emotional pleas from some of the officers who fought back against the mob and while ignoring negotiations that had taken place between Republicans and Democratic leadership.",
            "The partisan move has heaped pressure on Biden and Democratic leadership to quash the filibuster. But advocates face an uphill battle, as one key holdout, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), recommitted to opposing to the anti-filibuster movement this week."

            "Here’s an idea that would make anyone beam with pride.",
            "Memo Fachino, a 35-year-old from Racine, Wisconsin, was informed late last month by his homeowners association that he and his husband, Lance Mier, 36, were no longer allowed to fly their Pride flag — despite it hanging on their porch since 2016.",
            "“We believe it’s important to express ourselves, and to have visible representation,” Fachino told HuffPost via email.",
            "Fachino also explained that the flag has had a significant ripple effect. He noted that, a few years ago, he received a letter “expressing gratitude” for their flag from a neighbor who was “struggling with gender identity” at the time.",
            "“It gave them hope that, even if they weren’t finding the acceptance they needed in their current home, they knew they would be able to find that in the community,” Fachino said.",
            "Fachino explained in a now-viral Reddit post that due to other homeowners displaying Black Lives Matter, “Thin Blue Line” and other “opinion” flags around his neighborhood, his HOA had decided to ban any flag other than the American flag from being displayed in front of homes.",
            "“The board did express that if we, or anyone for that matter, could come up with wording that would allow neighbors to fly opinion or political flags without controversy, that they were open to reviewing the rule,” Fachino told HuffPost. “This is, as you can imagine, not super easy, as what one considers ‘controversial’ can be quite subjective.”",
            "Fachino said that he has no malice toward his HOA and does not “feel targeted or attacked” by the board, but the couple found having to remove their flag right before Pride month to be disappointing.",
            "“We wanted to have a Pride display for June, and we wanted to abide by the rules,” Fachino said. “So we found a way to do both.”",
            "Fachino said a few days after he and Mier took down their Pride flag, they had a lightbulb-over-the-head moment.",
            "They looked through their HOA’s new rules and noticed “that removable lights are permitted without restriction.”",
            "So Fachino and Mier decided to buy six different colored floodlights and “washed our house in Pride colors.”",
            "“A little less subtle than our simple flag,” Fachino wrote on Reddit. “A lot more fun for anyone complaining about the flag itself and what it represents.”",
            "Fachino added to HuffPost that he felt the lights were “cheerful, didn’t hit any other homes … and allowed us to be more expressive on our stand.”",
            "He also said that his neighbors love the lights as well.",
            "“A neighbor shared the story on our Facebook page, and all the comments we received have been positive and supportive,” he told HuffPost.",
            "Fachino also noted that he and Mier “love” their neighborhood that they’ve been living in for roughly five years — and feel “fortunate” to display their Pride lights “safely.”",
            "“We are proud to be able to do this,” Fachino told HuffPost, adding, “We recognize this privilege. We feel strongly that diversity and self-expression enhances the neighborhood and makes it a more inclusive place to live.”"

            "SAN MIGUEL, EL Salvador (AP) — Rejected by her family, Zashy Zuley del Cid Velásquez fled her coastal village in 2014, the first of a series of forced displacements across El Salvador. She had hoped that in the larger city of San Miguel she could live as a transgender woman without discrimination and violence, but there she was threatened by a gang.",
            "She moved away from San Miguel then back again in a series of forced moves until the 27-year-old was shot dead on April 25, sending shockwaves through the close-knit LGBTQ community in San Miguel, the largest city in eastern El Salvador.",
            "“Zashy was desperate; her family didn’t want her because of her sexual preference and the gangsters had threatened her,” said Venus Nolasco, director of the San Miguel LGBTQ collective “Pearls of the East.” “She knew they were going to kill her. She wanted to flee the country, go to the United States, but they killed her with a shot through her lung.”",
            "One day after Del Cid’s murder, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris identified anti-LGBTQ violence in Central America as one of the root causes of migration in the region during a virtual meeting with the president of neighboring Guatemala, Alejandro Giammattei. She is scheduled to visit Guatemala and Mexico this week.",
            "Transgender migrants were present in the Central American caravans that attempted to reach the United States border in recent years, fleeing harassment, gang extortion, murder and police indifference to crimes against them. Even in those large migrant movements say they faced harassment.",
            "Things had been rough during Del Cid’s first stint in San Miguel. She and Nolasco had been living in a neighborhood where, as in many parts of the country, the MS-13 gang was the ultimate local authority. Gang members began to harass her, then brutally beat her, breaking her arm in 2015, Nolasco said.",
            "“They warned her to leave, but she didn’t listen,” Nolasco said.",
            "Instead of leaving, Del Cid moved in with Nolasco in the same neighborhood. One day, the gang grabbed Del Cid again.",
            "“They took her, they wanted to kill her,” Nolasco said. “I begged them not to kill her, to let her go and she would leave the neighborhood.”",
            "Del Cid moved back to her hometown, but her family rejected her again. She tried to please them, but she couldn’t, Nolasco said. Del Cid joined a church, got a girlfriend, had a baby girl, but could not maintain that life, she said.",
            "She returned to San Miguel, where initially things seemed to go better. In 2020, Del Cid received humanitarian and housing support from COMCAVIS TRANS, a national LGBTQ rights organization, and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.",
            "Del Cid rented a home and opened a beauty salon there. She hired another woman to help her and was participating in a entrepreneurship program. She was preparing a business proposal to move the salon out of her home into its own space.",
            "But Del Cid was shot in the back walking alone at night down the street. Passersby tried to help her and took her to a local hospital where she died. So far, police have made no arrests and Nolasco believes that like other hate crimes in the country, “it will be forgotten; they’re not interested in what happens to us.”",
            "Laura Almirall, UNHCR representative in El Salvador, said Del Cid’s killing frightened her community and saddened everyone who knew her.",
            "“She was excited about her new plans and her new life. And unfortunately and tragically, everything came to an end,” she said.",
            "Nolasco said that in San Miguel, some 90 miles (150 kilometers) east of the capital, the transgender community endures constant harassment from intolerant residents and gangs. They have rocks thrown at them, are beaten and extorted. If they go to police to make a report, they are insulted and demeaned. “Don’t come here to claim rights, because there are no rights for you,” police tell them, Nolasco said.",
            "The “Pearls of the East” group has a parade squad in which Del Cid participated. It started with some 50 people, but crime and forced displacement have shrunk it to 35, Nolasco said.",
            "“No one does anything here to protect us,” Nolasco said.",
            "Bianka Rodríguez, director of COMCAVIS TRANS, said the forced displacement of transgender people in El Salvador increases each year. Even though a law exists to protect people displaced by violence, it hasn’t been effective, she said.",
            "A report prepared by the organization found that gangs were responsible for nearly two-thirds of the violence against the LGTBQ community, while government authorities accounted for another 21%. Since 1993 in El Salvador, a country of only 6.5 million inhabitants, more than 600 LGBTQ people have been killed, according to their tally.",
            "They registered 84 cases of internal displacement in 2019 and another eight who left the country, but were deported and needed protection.",
            "“Regrettably, (multiple displacements) are very common not only for the LGBTI community, but thousands of people in El Salvador have been displaced because of gang violence and often we find that displacement does not occur only once, but families and individuals are displaced more than once,” Almirall, the UNHCR representative, said.",
            "Del Cid “was displaced so many times in the country and finally she managed to get a new life project and to be part of the community again and everything ended so abruptly and so tragically,” Almirall said.",

            "There are other differences as well, including a small violet patch at the edge of the newly discovered frog’s eyes. The chocolate frog is also smaller.",

            "The area where the frog was found is fairly inhospitable to people, which may be why scientists didn’t know about the frog before, Australian herpetologist Steve Richards told the Manning River Times.",

            "The researchers believe that the little brown frog may be fairly widespread in New Guinea, according to Science Alert. The frog’s scientific name is a tribute to the surprise the scientists felt at the discovery, Oliver said in a Griffith University statement.",
            "“We named this new Litoria frog species Mira, which means surprised or strange in Latin, because it was a surprising discovery to find an over-looked relative of Austalia’s well-known and common green tree [frog] living in the lowland rainforests of New Guinea,” he said."

            "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration says it is canceling or reviewing a host of actions by the Trump administration to roll back protections for endangered or threatened species, with a goal of strengthening a landmark law while addressing climate change.",
            "The reviews by the U.S Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service are aimed at five Endangered Species Act regulations finalized by the Trump administration, including critical habitat designations and rules defining the scope of federal actions on endangered species. The Fish and Wildlife Service also said Friday it will reinstate the so-called “blanket rule,” which mandates additional protections for species that are newly classified as threatened. Under former President Donald Trump, those protections were removed.",
            "Habitat designations for threatened or endangered species can result in limitations on energy development such as mining or oil drilling that could disturb a vulnerable species, while the scoping rule helps determine how far the government may go to protect imperiled species.",
            "Under Trump, officials rolled back protections for the northern spotted owl, gray wolves and other species, actions that President Joe Biden has vowed to review. His administration already has moved to reverse Trump’s decision to weaken enforcement of the century-old Migratory Bird Treaty Act, which made it harder to prosecute bird deaths caused by the energy industry.",
            "The decision on the bird law was among more than 100 business-friendly actions on the environment that Trump took and Biden wants reconsidered and possibly revised or scrapped. The reviews announced Friday follow through on that executive order.",
            "“The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is committed to working with diverse federal, tribal, state and industry partners to not only protect and recover America’s imperiled wildlife but to ensure cornerstone laws like the Endangered Species Act are helping us meet 21st century challenges,” said Martha Williams, principal deputy director of the Fish and Wildlife Service.",
            "The agency looks forward to “continuing these conservation collaborations and to ensuring our efforts are fully transparent and inclusive,″ Williams added.",
            "The reviews announced Friday will take months or years to complete. Many rules targeted by Trump originated with former President Barack Obama and took him years to undo, continuing a decades-old, back-and-forth between Democratic and Republican administrations with starkly differing approaches to environmental regulation.",
            "Industry groups and Republicans in Congress have long viewed the Endangered Species Act as an impediment to economic development and under Trump they successfully lobbied to weaken the law’s regulations. Environmental groups and Democratic-controlled states battled the moves in court, but those cases remained unresolved when Trump left office in January.",
            "Noah Greenwald with the Center for Biological Diversity said the environmental group was grateful to see the Trump rules being canceled or changed, particularly a rule that would have denied blanket protections for threatened species.",
            "“We hope they move quickly so more species aren’t harmed,” Greenwald said.",
            "Earthjustice attorney Kristen Boyles, who was involved in legal challenges to the Trump rules, said Friday’s announcement covered major changes under the previous administration that needed to be addressed. But Boyles said questions remain about what will happen while the new proposals go through a lengthy rule-making process.",
            "“These will take time, and in the interim we don’t want the harm to continue,” she said.",
            "Jonathan Wood, a lawyer for the Pacific Legal Foundation, a conservative law firm that advocates for property rights, said the Biden proposals could backfire by removing incentives for landowners to cooperate in helping imperiled wildlife.",
            "“There were some things in the Trump rules that were right,” Wood said, citing regulations that he said offered needed flexibility and better incentives to recover endangered species.",
            "“This looks basically like a 180-degree reversal,″ he said. “Once again we’re going to yo-yo back and forth on what the rules are.″",
            "The Biden administration said in January it was reconsidering a Trump rule that removed federal protections for wolves across most of the Lower 48 states, but officials so far have not backed away from the Trump rule and continue to defend it in court. Wildlife advocates have pressed to revive the federal protections for gray wolves across the Northern Rockies and Upper Midwest after Republicans in Idaho, Montana and other states made it much easier to kill the predators.",
            "In the final days of the Trump administration, the Fish and Wildlife Service cut by one-third the amount of protected federal old-growth forest used by the spotted owl, a move that was cheered by the timber industry and slammed by Democrats and environmental groups.",
            "The Biden administration has temporarily delayed putting the Trump-era rules into effect in order to review the decision.",
            "Last week, the Biden administration proposed federal protections for the lesser prairie chicken, saying its habitat across five states is in danger of becoming more fragmented, with a further toll expected from the effects of climate change and drought. The chicken’s habitat spans parts of New Mexico, Colorado, Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas ― including a portion of the oil-rich Permian Basin.",
            "The administration said this week that an extremely rare wildflower that grows only in Nevada’s high desert should be protected under the Endangered Species Act. The Tiehm’s buckwheat flower grows where an Australian mining company wants to dig for lithium."

That means that the moon will move between the Earth and the sun, but the moon will be far enough away from Earth that it won’t completely block the sun. Instead, it will look like a dark circle inside a bright disc ― hence the “ring of fire” moniker.",
            "Unfortunately for those who don’t dwell in the far north, the spectacle will only be visible to people in parts of Canada, Greenland and northern Russia. However, some other locations ― including the Midwest, Northeast, Southeast and northern Alaska in the U.S. ― will still be able to see a partial solar eclipse, meaning that the moon will cast a partial shadow over the sun, it just won’t be a perfect ring.",
            "NASA noted that in many of these places, the eclipse will happen “before, during, and shortly after sunrise,” but the space agency has also made an interactive map where you can check out when it will be visible in a particular area.",
            "This is probably as good a time as any to mention that you should never look directly at the sun, because doing so can cause permanent eye damage. You can learn more about how to view an eclipse safely here.",

            "The folks at Honest Paws based the report on Google search trends over the course of 12 months.",

Only 24 breeds had a first-place ranking in at least one state.",

            "Vice President Kamala Harris’ new job leading the White House’s voting rights effort has given advocates renewed assurance the Biden administration plans to wage political war against Republican restrictions around the country, even as they acknowledge the path to federal-level legislation protecting the franchise remains difficult.",
            "Harris, who asked for the job and discussed its parameters with President Joe Biden over the past month, is expected to focus on building outside support for voting rights ― including by enlisting the help of corporations ― as much as she will focus on trying to woo the few congressional Democrats who remain reluctant to pass the party’s wide-ranging democracy reform bill, H.R. 1, or a revitalization of the Voting Rights Act named after the late civil rights icon and Georgia Rep. John Lewis.",
            "“This is not just a federal government approach,” said a White House aide, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss Harris’ plans, which are unlikely to be wholly finalized until after she returns from her first foreign trip as vice president next week. “There’s a lot of work to be done at the state level.”",
            "The aide said it was possible Harris will travel to states where GOP-controlled legislatures are working to restrict voting rights. Republicans, inspired by former President Donald Trump’s escalation of long-standing GOP lies about widespread voter fraud, have introduced more than 300 pieces of legislation aiming to restrict voting in more than 40 states, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. While most of those proposals are unlikely to become law, Florida, Georgia and Texas have already seen major political showdowns over voting rights this year.",
            "These laws have often targeted Black voters or those living in major urban areas, and have frequently given state legislators far more power to overturn election results ― something Trump called on Republicans to do after his clear loss to Biden last November.",
            "The activists who have been fighting those efforts see Harris as a necessary and crucial political cavalry. Many are hopeful she can work with Kristen Clarke, the newly confirmed assistant attorney general for civil rights, to bring the federal government fully into the fray.",
            "“We’ve been playing whack-a-mole filing lawsuits or being party to lawsuits across the landscape,” said Derrick Johnson, the president of the national NAACP. “There is no way, considering the rapid pace in which legislative bodies are seeking to suppress the Black vote, that we will be able to keep up all our efforts without support from this administration and the federal government stepping in and pushing back on these efforts.”",
            "Two calls Harris made in recent days show how her attention could split between duties inside Washington and outside them. She talked to both Johnson, a prominent activist and civil rights leader, and to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), who will be her most important ally in the efforts to woo Democratic Sens. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Joe Manchin of West Virginia.",
            "The most immediate effect of Harris’ appointment was to reassure voting rights activists and government reformers of the administration’s commitment to a full-fledged effort to pass H.R. 1 and the Voting Rights Act. While Biden has repeatedly declared his support for voting rights as president, some have seen him as less focused on these issues than some of his rivals in the 2020 Democratic Primary, including Harris.",
            "“They’ve been saying all the right things, but they could flex their muscle a bit more,” said one Democratic strategist directly involved in the effort to pass a new voting rights act and H.R. 1, who requested anonymity to discuss intra-party dynamics. “This seems like the beginning of making it a priority.”",
            "The selection of Harris to lead Biden’s efforts on voting rights is also seen positively on Capitol Hill, where Democrats had been waiting for robust White House involvement.",
            "“It’s a valuable sign that the White House determined that the vice president is the point person,” a senior Senate staffer said. “And, not for nothing, she’s a multiracial woman who went to an HBCU who can speak on a personal level about what the fight for voting rights has meant historically.”",
            "With little hope of wooing Republicans, passage of the For The People Act rests on the whim and interest of Manchin and Sinema.",
            "Manchin is the lone Democrat to not co-sponsor the bill. He initially released a statement of support for elements of the bill with a declaration that he intended to find bipartisan support because he believed Republicans would agree to certain aspects of the bill in good faith. But, after the bill did not receive any Republican votes in committee, he declared that he no longer supported the bill. Republicans are universally opposed to the bill, including the provisions that he indicated support for in his initial statement.",
            "Schumer plans to bring the bill to the Senate floor on the week of June 21. For the bill to reach the floor, all 50 Democrats will need to vote to discharge from committee after the Senate Rules Committee deadlocked in a 9-9 vote on party lines. That means they need Manchin’s support. But the senator has not indicated what would be needed from his own party for it to obtain his support in bringing the bill to the floor. He has not even met with Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), one of the bill’s two lead sponsors, to discuss any objections, concerns or questions about the bill.",
            "Even if the bill were to be discharged from committee to the floor, it will face a Republican filibuster. The only way the bill could pass, whether as it is currently structured or in a slimmed-back capacity, is if Democrats change the Senate’s filibuster rules. But both Manchin and Sinema have declared an unwillingness to do so.",
            "A campaign by the White House, amid an onslaught of Republican filibusters, to pass the bill would heighten the pressure on filibuster reform holdouts to toe the party line. Some voting rights advocates hoped Harris would travel to Sinema and Manchin’s home states to build pressure.",
            "Nse Ufot, the CEO of the New Georgia Project, advocated that Harris travel to the home states of lawmakers like Sinema and Manchin, since it would be “taking the fight to them.”",
            "“It’s working to recruit their donors, their voters, and making the case in their local papers, and in their backyards, about why this has to happen and why their senators need to show up for American democracy in this moment. This is hand-to-hand combat time,” Ufot added.",
            "But Harris is unlikely to focus most of her time on wooing Manchin or Sinema, neither of whom she is seen as particularly close to. Manchin famously bristled when the administration sent Harris to make media appearances in West Virginia without alerting him first.",
            "One thing Harris will do, according to the White House aide: try to enlist corporations in the fight to protect voting rights.",
            "“We saw how powerful companies holding the state accountable can be,” the aide said, pointing to corporations in Georgia who spoke out against GOP legislation. “That’s going to be huge when it comes to this fight.”",
            "Ufot said such an approach, enlisting almost all of civil society to stand up for voting rights and democracy, was necessary to combat the GOP’s efforts.",
            "“We’re talking about the press. We’re talking about corporations. We’re talking about activists and organizers, the civil rights groups. We’re talking about state elected officials. We’re talking about the federal administration,” she said. “This is an ‘all hands on deck’ moment, and all hands aren’t on deck yet. But my hope is that they will be in advance of this vote.”",

            "A Serbian volleyball player has apologized after she was caught on camera making a racist gesture toward her Thai opponents.",
            "Sanja Djurdjevic pulled her eyelids apart to make a slant-eye gesture during the televised FIVB Volleyball Women’s Nationals League match against the Thai team in Italy on Tuesday night after a Thai player failed to win a point.",
            "The moment prompted outrage online. The clip was shared alongside hashtags to stop Asian hate, a tagline born to address a steep rise in anti-Asian hate crimes and harassment tied to the coronavirus pandemic and racist rhetoric about its origins.",
            "It’s not the first time the Serbian team has caused a furor over this gesture. In 2017, the team posed for a group shot pulling back their eyes to celebrate securing Serbia’s place in the 2018 FIVB Women’s World Championship, which would take place in Japan.",
            "Djurdjevic apologized in an Instagram post, then deactivated her account.",
            "“I am aware of my mistake and I immediately after the match apologized to the whole Thailand team,” Djurdjevic said, according to Vice News and a screengrab shared by a Twitter user. “I only wanted to address my teammates with the message: ‘now, we will start playing defense like them’, I didn’t mean to disrespect anyone.”",
            "“Of course, it was unfortunate and not so smart gesture from my side,” she continued, adding that she was sorry to people around the world “who are offended by this.”",

            "The Volleyball Federation of Serbia issued a strange apology statement, asking the public not to blow the incident out of proportion.",
            "It said the federation was “deeply saddened” by the “unfortunate gesture.”",
            "“We apologize sincerely to the Thailand team, people of Thailand and to all of you affected by this,” it said.",
            "“But, please, don’t blow this out of proportion! Sanja is aware of her mistake and she immediately apologized to the whole Thailand team. She only wanted to show her teammates “let’s start playing defense like them now”, she didn’t mean any disrespect.”",
            "The apologies from Djurdjevic and Serbia’s volleyball federation did not satisfy critics. An online petition was established Thursday calling for the FIVB to formally discipline the player for failure to adhere to its code of ethics, which prohibits racial discrimination.",
            "“FIVB already failed in 2017, when they not only did not discipline the Serbian Volleyball Team for the entire team posing with the slanted-eye gesture after a win, they used it on their website to announce the win (since replaced),” it said.",
            "“Sports happens on a global stage with millions of people watching often viewing athletes as role models. When athletes and teams violate the most basic ethics of respect, governing bodies must set the right example to protect the disrespected and marginalized to maintain their standards and integrity.”",
            "The FIVB said in a statement that it had submitted a case to the disciplinary panel subcommittee regarding the incident and would not comment further until the subcommittee reached its final decision.",
            "“The FIVB is committed to fostering understanding, solidarity and unity against all forms of discriminatory behaviour,” the statement said. “The FIVB will continue to work tirelessly with all of its National Federations to ensure that these values are reflected across the whole community.”"

            "Former Arizona Attorney General Grant Woods, who prominently backed Kyrsten Sinema’s election to the Senate, is now saying she doesn’t belong in office anymore unless she helps abolish the filibuster.",
            "Woods, a former Republican, was attorney general from from 1991-1999 and worked for the late Sen. John McCain (R). In 2018, he switched parties and became a Democrat.",
            "That year, he also endorsed Sinema, and the campaign even featured him in one of its ads saying, “We need more people who are not just politicians who will say or do anything to get elected.”",
            "But on Friday, Woods was much less enthusiastic about Sinema in comments to HuffPost. He said he feels very strongly about passage of H.R. 1 ― Democrats’ For the People Act, a democracy reform and voting rights bill ― and believes the Senate must abolish the filibuster, which is something Sinema has said she is adamantly against. (Sinema is, however, a co-sponsor of the For the People Act.)",
            "“I do think that Sen. Sinema and every senator should support ending the filibuster for the voting rights bill,” he said, adding, “To keep the Jim Crow filibuster while losing some of these basic voting rights that are central to our democracy is preposterous.”",
            "“Sen. Sinema should know that, so should Sen. Manchin,” Woods said, referring to West Virginia Democrat Sen. Joe Manchin, who also opposes removing the filibuster. “At the end of the day, I’m very hopeful that they’ll come around and do the right thing. But if they don’t, then I don’t think they belong in the Senate anymore.”",
            "Woods had also tweeted his thoughts about the filibuster on Thursday, without directly naming Sinema.",
            "Sinema’s office did not immediately return a request for comment.",
            "Until now, Woods has been a strong defender of Sinema. In March, when Sinema received widespread Democratic criticism for voting against a $15/hour minimum wage with an exaggerated thumbs down, Woods stood by her.",
            "But this week, Sinema reiterated her refusal to abolish the filibuster, which remains a major impediment to passing much of President Joe Biden’s agenda.",
            "“It is a tool that protects the democracy of our nation,” Sinema said Tuesday in Tucson, at an event with Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas). “Rather than allowing our country to ricochet wildly every two to four years back and forth between policies, the idea of the filibuster was created by those who came before to create comity and to encourage bipartisanship and work together.”",
            "But as New York Times columnist Michelle Goldberg noted Friday, Sinema’s history is inaccurate.",
            "“The filibuster was created by mistake when the Senate, cleaning up its rule book in 1806, failed to include a provision to cut off debate. (A so-called cloture rule allowing two-thirds of senators to end a filibuster was adopted in 1917; the proportion was reduced to three-fifths in 1975.) The filibuster encouraged extremism, not comity: It was a favorite tool of pro-slavery senators before the Civil War and segregationists after it,” Goldberg wrote.",
            "Last week, Republicans successfully filibustered their first piece of legislation in the Biden administration. They blocked the formation of a bipartisan independent commission to investigate the Jan. 6 Capitol riot."

        "articleContent": [
            "When scientists set out to develop a vaccine for COVID-19, they hoped to create a shot that was at least 50% effective. That efficacy would be enough to get some control over the pandemic and work our way out of it.",
            "As the clinical trials advanced, scientists were stunned to see the vaccines not only hit that 50% benchmark, but were far surpassing it. And when the shots started rolling out in the real world, the data held up.",
            "The vaccines aren’t perfect — no vaccine is. But the COVID shots come pretty close. So much so that we’re already seeing some clear signs that the vaccines have the power to defang the coronavirus, allowing us to go out and safely resume living our lives again.",
            "Here’s how we know the vaccines are working:",
            "Infections are free-falling as vaccinations increase",
            "We are now seeing the lowest number of COVID cases since June 2020. On May 26, the United States reported a seven-day average of 23,162 cases — that’s a huge drop (that’s still falling) from early January, when the seven-day average was 259,614.",
            "Cases in the U.S. started declining when about 40% of the population was vaccinated with at least one dose, which happened around April 14, said Monica Gandhi, an infectious diseases specialist at the University of California, San Francisco. Infectious diseases experts call this moment the inflection point — when there was enough immunity in the population to change the tide of the pandemic.",
            "Israel saw an inflection point early March, when 40% of the adult population became fully vaccinated. After the inflection points in Israel and the U.S., cases have steadily declined day after day, week after week.",
            "“It takes a certain amount of vaccination for cases to start going down,” Gandhi said.",
            "Hospitalizations and deaths are down",
            "As soon as we started vaccinating the most vulnerable people in our population — the elderly and people with chronic health conditions — hospitalization and death rates plummeted.",
            "“You started seeing the death and hospitalization rate come down once we got the majority of those over 65 vaccinated,” since they were the people who were most susceptible to severe disease, Gandhi said.",
            "Clinical data showed us that the vaccines essentially take death and severe disease off the table, according to Lucy McBride, a practicing internal medicine physician in Washington, D.C. Real-world data shows the vaccines are highly effective at preventing people from being hospitalized or dying — even when there are variants.",
            "“The real-world drop in hospitalizations and deaths is proof positive of the vaccines’ power against COVID-19,” McBride said.",
            "Cases among kids are declining as more adults get vaccinated",
            "Over the past four weeks, there’s been a 50% reduction in children’s cases in the U.S., which can be linked to an increase in adult (and young adult) vaccinations. This played out in Israel, too.",
            "Vaccines decrease transmission and reduce the viral burden within communities. This is the concept of herd immunity — when there’s enough immunity in a population, through previous infection and vaccination, there are fewer opportunities for a disease to spread.",
            "“Even though children aren’t vaccinated, the way that the unvaccinated get protected in our society is increasing rates of vaccination or infection ― whatever it is ― immunity in the rest of us,” Gandhi said.",
            "Vaccinated people directly exposed to COVID-19 aren’t getting sick",
            "We often hear about rare breakthrough infections in people who are fully immunized, but we rarely talk about all the times vaccinated people didn’t get sick after they were directly exposed to someone infected with COVID.",
            "Vaccines were rolled out in the middle of an ongoing pandemic, when infections were actively spreading. That’s never been done before. Because of that dynamic, a good portion of vaccinated people have likely been exposed to COVID-19.",
            "Just look at the data: Of the over 123 million people who’ve been vaccinated, there have only been about 1,600 serious breakthrough cases reported. “Almost by definition, people were exposed,” Gandhi said. COVID is still spreading, but the vaccines are preventing tons of infections from occurring.",
            "A Kentucky nursing home outbreak didn’t lead to serious illness for the majority of those who were exposed",
            "There was an outbreak at a nursing home in Kentucky in which a handful of fully vaccinated and unvaccinated residents and staff members got COVID-19. It might not sound like a win for vaccines at first. But if you dig into the data, it’s clear the vaccines worked wonderfully.",
            "The person who brought COVID into the facility was unvaccinated — a reminder to get your shots, McBride said. COVID spreads fiercely in close quarters like nursing homes, so outbreaks in these types of settings are to be expected. But even so, the vast majority of those who were vaccinated in the nursing home were well protected.",
            "“The Kentucky nursing home story is another vaccine success story. The majority of residents who got infected after vaccination did not have symptoms or did not get sick,” McBride said.",
            "The same happened with an outbreak on the New York Yankees",
            "Last but not least, the Yankees outbreak: Eight players and staff members who had received the one-dose Johnson & Johnson shot tested positive for COVID-19 in mid-May. Of the eight people who got infected, only one developed symptoms; the other seven were asymptomatic (a sign the vaccines did their job). Even the person who was symptomatic had a pretty mild illness (another sign the vaccine did its job).",
            "Many doctors say a positive diagnostic test doesn’t necessarily equate to an infection. The positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests were probably just picking up on little bits of virus that their immune systems were clearing out (thanks to the help from the vaccines). According to McBride, the Yankees players and staff members could have gotten a lot sicker — and maybe even required hospitalization ― if they hadn’t been vaccinated.",
            "Get those vaccines; they’re working. And the more people who take them, the better the results for all of us.",
            "Experts are still learning about COVID-19. The information in this story is what was known or available as of publication, but guidance can change as scientists discover more about the virus. Please check the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the most updated recommendations."

            "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Florida’s Republican governor signed a bill Tuesday barring transgender females from playing on public school teams intended for student athletes born as girls, plunging the state into the national culture war over transgender rights.",
            "“In Florida, girls are going to play girls sports and boys are going to play boys sports,” Gov. Ron DeSantis said as he signed the bill into law at a Christian academy in Jacksonville. “We’re going to make sure that that’s the reality.”",
            "The new law, sure to be challenged as unconstitutional, inflames an already contentious discussion unfolding nationally as Republican-controlled states move to limit the rights of LGBTQ people. It also could impose severe financial consequences on Florida.",
            "The NCAA, which oversees college athletics, has threatened to relocate key games from states that discriminate against certain athletes. When the Florida Legislature was considering the measure in April, the NCAA said it would commit championship games to “locations where hosts can commit to providing an environment that is safe, healthy and free of discrimination.”",
            "High-profile athletic events, such as football bowl games and basketball tournaments, generate millions of dollars for local communities.",
            "The measure approved by the GOP-led Legislature takes effect July 1. It says a transgender student athlete can’t participate without first showing a birth certificate saying she was a girl when she was born. It’s not clear whether all females must show their birth certificates, or only those whose gender is questioned. The proposal allows another student to sue if a school allows a transgender girl or woman to play on a team intended for biological females.",
            "The final wording of the “Fairness in Women’s Sports Act” stripped away some of its most contentious elements, including a requirement that transgender athletes in high schools and colleges undergo testosterone or genetic testing and submit to having their genitalia examined.",
            "But the legislation signed by the governor advances an underlying principle asserted by supporters: Biological differences between males and females make it unfair for athletes identified as boys at birth to compete on teams for girls and women. The law would not bar female athletes from playing on boys’ or men’s teams.",
            "Human Rights Campaign President Alphonso David said the new law would not only harm transgender girls. “All Floridians will have to face the consequences of this anti-transgender legislation ― including economic harm, expensive taxpayer-funded legal battles, and a tarnished reputation.”",
            "Democrats and LGBTQ advocates said the law is plainly discriminatory and will be challenged in court as unconstitutional.",
            "“This is yet another hate-driven attack from the governor and Republican legislators, and it’s insulting that they’ve staged this morning’s photo-op on the first day of Pride Month,” said state Sen. Shevrin Jones after the bill’s signing. “At the end of the day, transgender kids are just kids.”",
            "The ban was tucked at the last minute of the legislative session into a measure allowing public universities and colleges to sponsor charter schools — a point the governor did not mention during the bill signing. It was the transgender athletes provision that was front and center in Tuesday’s rhetoric.",
            "“This bill is very simply about making sure that women can safely compete, have opportunities and physically be able to excel in a sport that they trained for, prepared for and work for,” said state Sen. Kelli Stargel, a Republican who championed the bill.",
            "“This is nothing about anybody being discriminated against,” she said. “It’s solely so that women have an opportunity to compete in women’s sports.”",
            "The Florida law mirrors an Idaho law, the first of its kind when enacted last year, that is now mired in legal challenges. Republican governors in Arkansas, Mississippi and Tennessee recently signed similar measures."

            "The announcement comes days after Biden administration drew outrage from climate and environmental groups after throwing its support behind the so-called Willow Project, a massive, 30-year oil and gas project in Alaska’s National Petroleum Reserve. Many view that project as wildly out of sync with Biden’s pledge to transition the country away from planet-warming fossil fuels.",
            "Former President Donald Trump and his team made greenlighting oil development in the Arctic refuge a top priority, and in its final two weeks in office followed through on selling off drilling rights. The lease sale was a major flop, with just three entities — two small oil companies and an Alaska state-owned economic development corporation ― bidding on roughly half of the 1.09 million acres up for grabs. The sale brought in just $14.4 million, less than 1% of the administration’s estimate that oil and gas development in the refuge would generate $1.8 billion in federal revenue over a decade.",
            "The Biden review will determine whether approved leases “should be reaffirmed, voided, or subject to additional mitigation measures,” the Interior Department said in its announcement.",
            "The refuge, often described as “America’s Serengeti,” covers more than 19 million acres. It is home to polar bears, caribou, moose and hundreds of species of migratory birds and is sacred to the Gwich’in people, an Indigenous tribe of northern Alaska and Canada.\n\nRepublicans and energy companies have tried for decades to gain access to the oil reserves beneath the refuge’s coastal plain, known as the “1002 Area.” The GOP tax law that Congress passed in late 2017 included a provision, introduced by Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), requiring the Interior Department to approve at least two lease sales for drilling — each covering no less than 400,000 acres.",
            "Indigenous and conservation groups applauded Tuesday’s news as a step in the right direction, but urged Biden to make it permanent.",
            "“The Gwich’in Nation is grateful and heartened by the news that the Biden administration has acted again on its commitment to protecting sacred lands and the Gwich’in way of life,” Bernadette Demientieff, executive director of the Gwich’in Steering Committee, said in a statement. “After fighting so hard to protect these lands and the Porcupine caribou herd, trusting the guidance of our ancestors and elders, and the allyship of people around the world, we can now look for further action by the administration and to Congress to repeal the leasing program.”",

            "Starbucks used to be a coffee shop. Sure, it’s still technically a coffee shop, but there are so many fruity drinks currently on the menu that it may want to consider rebranding as a juice bar.",
            "And fans of the ever-present mermaid chain are loving it, even taking to TikTok to spread the word about fun, custom drinks that likely would never have occurred to the research and development folks at Starbucks HQ. Scroll through TikTok and you’ll be bombarded with sweet, fruit-forward (and often visually stunning) iced drinks that baristas are now whipping up constantly.",
            "Some of the drinks are so complicated that they’ve caused quite a stir, leading to the firing of a barista and making people wonder whether it’s rude to place such an order. But there are more reasonable drinks that baristas actually want you to order. And because there’s no better time than spring and summer to enjoy a fruity beverage, we asked baristas across the country about the drinks that’ll make everyone happy.",
            "The baristas’ names in this story have been changed because they were not authorized to speak to the media.",
            "Iced Guava Passionfruit",
            "Main ingredients: white grape juice flavored with real guava, coconut milk, pineapple ginger syrup",
            "Considering the tenuous state of world travel at this moment, it may just be easier to order a fruity drink like this, close your eyes and imagine you’re on an island. What’s not to love about a drink with flavors like guava, pineapple, ginger and coconut? “I love the Iced Guava Passionfruit,” said Brian, a barista in Franklin, Tennessee. “It’s got a nice tropical flavor, which is something we don’t have a whole lot of. It uses the pineapple ginger syrup really well, too.” And if you’re sugar-conscious, Brian says he orders it with one less pump of said syrup, which reduces the 33 grams of sugar found in a grande. Greg from Wichita, Kansas, also sings the praises of the pineapple ginger syrup in the Guava Passionfruit, saying it adds a serious “fruity punch.” Strangely, not many of the custom drinks we spoke to baristas about used this syrup, so if you’re looking to create an inventive custom drink of your own, it may be worth a look.",
            "Very Berry Hibiscus",
            "Main ingredients: white grape juice flavored with a mix of real berries, freeze-dried blackberries",
            "A grande Peppermint Mocha Frappuccino has 64 grams of sugar, according to Starbucks’ menu. So when you consider that there are only 14 grams of sugar in a grande Very Berry Hibiscus, it’s not so bad. And that’s important to Paul, a barista in Tallahassee, Florida. “It’s one of my favorites on the menu. And while I think it’s good any time of day, I usually like to drink it in the afternoon,” he said. “It’s a little bit sweet, and I try to avoid sugar in the morning.” Even though many of the TikTok-famous custom drinks at Starbucks add multiple pumps of syrup, many of the drinks the brand has been introducing lately ― like the now completely sold-out Iced Brown Sugar Oatmilk Shaken Espresso, with 13 grams of sugar ― have been noteworthy because of the relatively low sugar content. If you’re watching your sugar intake, this is one more option on the Starbucks menu.",
            "Custom Pink Drink",
            "Main ingredients: white grape juice flavored with real strawberry and acai, coconut milk, freeze-dried strawberries",
            "The Pink Drink became a viral phenomenon in 2017 after ingenious Starbucks fans decided to swap coconut milk for water in the Strawberry Acai Refresher. It became so popular, the brand added it to the menu permanently. And people are not done futzing with the Strawberry Acai Refresher base, as you’ll see below. This Pink Drink customization is a favorite of Dublin, Ohio, barista Kaylinn because of its similar taste to a now-discontinued Life Savers brand called Creme Savers. “I like a Pink Drink with three pumps of white mocha in it,” Kaylinn said. “It tastes exactly like those old strawberry creme-flavored candies.” If history is any indication, perhaps a White Mocha Pink Drink will be introduced to the menu soon.",
            "Custom Strawberry Acai Drinks",
            "Main ingredients: white grape juice flavored with real strawberry and acai, assorted add-ins",
            "We’ve already discussed how the Pink Drink is just a Strawberry Acai Refresher with coconut milk. But if coconut milk isn’t your thing, the Refresher base still offers a solid canvas on which to add other delicious flavors. One idea is from Amelia in Lansing, Michigan, a barista who likes the Strawberry Acai Lemonade Refresher with four pumps of raspberry syrup to boost the berry flavors quite a bit. Julie, a barista in Atlanta, also loves the Strawberry Acai, but instead of adding fruit flavors and making it even sweeter, she adds a hit of earthiness to the drink. “I love substituting green tea for the water in the Strawberry Acai drink,” she said.",
            "Sunset Drink",
            "Main ingredients: white grape juice flavored with a mix of real berries, lemonade, passion tea, cold foam",
            "Sometimes Starbucks introduces limited-time-only drinks that don’t quite catch on enough to make it onto the permanent menu. But that doesn’t mean they’re not worth ordering. Daphne, a barista in Henderson, Nevada, still loves the Sunset Drink that debuted back in 2018, as it’s a mashup of cold foam (prominently featured in its iced coffee line) and the fruit-forward drinks popping off today. “For aesthetic purposes, I love the Very Berry Hibiscus Lemonade with none of the inclusions” ― if you’re ordering in the app, just remove the freeze-dried blackberries ― “cold foam and a splash of passion tea,” she said. “It’s supposed to resemble a sunset. I’ve also tried it, and it’s pretty good!”"

            "BEIJING (AP) — China’s ruling Communist Party said Monday it will ease birth limits to allow all couples to have three children instead of two in hopes of slowing the rapid aging of its population, which is adding to strains on the economy and society.",
            "The ruling party has enforced birth limits since 1980 to restrain population growth but worries the number of working-age people is falling too fast while the share over age 65 is rising. That threatens to disrupt its ambitions to transform China into a prosperous consumer society and global technology leader.",
            "A ruling party meeting led by President Xi Jinping decided to introduce “measures to actively deal with the aging population,” the official Xinhua News Agency said. It said leaders agreed ”implementing the policy of one couple can have three children and supporting measures are conducive to improving China’s population structure.”",
            "Leaders also agreed China needs to raise its retirement age to keep more people in the workforce and improve pension and health services for the elderly, Xinhua said.",
            "Restrictions that limited most couples to one child were eased in 2015 to allow two, but the total number of births fell further, suggesting rule changes on their own have little impact on the trend.",
            "Couples say they are put off by high costs of raising a child, disruption to their jobs and the need to look after elderly parents.",
            "Comments on social media Monday complained the change does nothing to help young parents with medical bills, low incomes and grueling work schedules known popularly as “996,” or 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week.",
            "“Every stage of the problem hasn’t been solved,” said a post on the popular Sina Weibo blog service signed Tchaikovsky. “Who will raise the baby? Do you have time? I go out early and get back late. Kids don’t know what their parents look like.”",
            "Another, signed Hyeongmok, joked bitterly: “Don’t worry about aging. Our generation won’t live long.”",
            "China, along with Thailand and some other Asian economies, faces what economists call the challenge of whether they can get rich before they get old.",
            "The Chinese population of 1.4 billion already was expected to peak later this decade and start to decline. Census data released May 11 suggest that is happening faster than expected, adding to burdens on underfunded pension and health systems and cutting the number of future workers available to support a growing retiree group.",
            "The share of working-age people 15 to 59 in the population fell to 63.3% last year from 70.1% a decade earlier. The group aged 65 and older grew to 13.5% from 8.9%.",
            "The 12 million births reported last year was down nearly one-fifth from 2019.",
            "About 40% were second children, down from 50% in 2017, according to Ning Jizhe, a statistics official who announced the data on May 11.",
            "Chinese researchers and the Labor Ministry say the share of working-age people might fall to half the population by 2050. That increases the “dependency ratio,” or the number of retirees who rely on each worker to generate income for pension funds and to pay taxes for health and other public services.",
            "Leaders at Monday’s meeting agreed it is “necessary to steadily implement the gradual postponement of the legal retirement age,” Xinhua said.",
            "It gave no details, but the government has been debating raising the official retirement ages of 60 for men, 55 for white-collar female workers and 50 for blue-collar female workers.",
            "The potential change is politically fraught. Some female professionals welcome a chance to stay in satisfying careers, but others whose bodies are worn out from decades of manual labor resent being required to work longer.",
            "The fertility rate, or the average number of births per mother, stood at 1.3 in 2020, well below the 2.1 that would maintain the size of the population.",
            "China’s birth rate, paralleling trends in other Asian economies, already was falling before the one-child rule. The average number of children per Chinese mother tumbled from above six in the 1960s to below three by 1980, according to the World Bank.",
            "Demographers say official birth limits concealed what would have been a further fall in the number of children per family without the restrictions.",
            "The ruling party says it prevented as many as 400 million potential births, averting shortages of food and water. But demographers say if China followed trends in Thailand, parts of India and other countries, the number of additional babies might have been as low as a few million.",

            "KAMLOOPS, British Colombia (AP) — The remains of 215 children, some as young as 3 years old, have been found buried on the site of what was once Canada’s largest Indigenous residential school — one of the institutions that held children taken from families across the nation.",
            "Chief Rosanne Casimir of the Tk’emlups te Secwépemc First Nation said in a news release that the remains were confirmed last weekend with the help of ground-penetrating radar.",
            "More bodies may be found because there are more areas to search on the school grounds, Casimir said Friday.",
            "In an earlier release, she called the discovery an “unthinkable loss that was spoken about but never documented at the Kamloops Indian Residential School.” It was the once the site of Canada’s largest residential school.",
            "From the 19th century until the 1970s, more than 150,000 First Nations children were required to attend state-funded Christian schools as part of a program to assimilate them into Canadian society. They were forced to convert to Christianity and not allowed to speak their native languages. Many were beaten and verbally abused, and up to 6,000 are said to have died.",
            "The Canadian government apologized in Parliament in 2008 and admitted that physical and sexual abuse in the schools was rampant. Many students recall being beaten for speaking their native languages; they also lost touch with their parents and customs.",

            "A report more than five years ago by a Truth and Reconciliation Commission said at least 3,200 children had died amid abuse and neglect, and it said it had reports of at least 51 deaths at the Kamloops school alone between 1915 and 1963.",

            "“Given the size of the school, with up to 500 students registered and attending at any one time, we understand that this confirmed loss affects First Nations communities across British Columbia and beyond,” Casimir said in the initial release issued late Thursday.",

            "Nicole Schabus, a law professor at Thompson Rivers University, said each of her first-year law students at the Kamloops university spends at least one day at the former residential school speaking with survivors about conditions they had endured.\n\nShe said she did not hear survivors talk about an unmarked grave area, “but they all talk about the kids who didn’t make it.”\n\nAustralia also apologized for its so-called Stolen Generations - thousands of Aborigines forcibly taken from their families as children under assimilation policies that lasted from 1910 to 1970.\n\nCanada offered those who were taken from their families compensation for the years they attended the residential schools. The offer was part of a lawsuit settlement."

            "WASHINGTON ― Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.) was elected to office the day before supporters of former President Donald Trump attacked the U.S. Capitol to prevent the certification of Joe Biden’s presidential win.",
            "Warnock, the first Black senator from Georgia, was born while his state was still represented by segregationists. He won in a runoff election system that racists created during the Jim Crow era, and he’s currently supporting voting rights legislation blocked by a Senate procedure long used to stop the advancement of civil rights in the United States.",
            "On Friday, moments after Senate Republicans used their first filibuster of Biden’s presidency to block debate on a bill to establish a bipartisan commission to investigate the Jan. 6 attack, Warnock stood off the floor of the Senate and reflected on the moment. Standing in a Senate hallway not far from where a mob of Trump supporters chased Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman up the stairs after they smashed out windows of the Capitol and broke into the building, Warnock said he worried his colleagues may have grown cynical and prioritized short-term political gains at a time when the future of American democracy is on the line.",
            "“Sometimes we’re standing in the midst of a defining historical moment, and we miss the magnitude of it all,” said Warnock, the pastor of the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. grew up listening to his father preach.",
            "“I think there were some people who slept through the civil rights movement, quite frankly, who didn’t understand that in a real sense it was a fight to save the country. Not just the South, not just Black people, but the country,” Warnock said. “We are in a renewed, 21st-century fight to defend our democracy so that we might pass on a future that’s worthy of all our children.”",
            "Warnock said the country is in the middle of a “historic abandonment” of the “basic democratic framework” in statehouses across the country, as supporters of former President Trump move to pass restrictive voting laws because of his election lies. Jan. 6 was not only a violent physical attack on the U.S. Capitol, Warnock said, it was “an attack on the votes of the people of Georgia and people all across this country.” But most Republican senators, Warnock said, have decided they are unwilling to do the right thing to stand up for American democracy.",
            "“All of us are here as representatives of a democracy that folks on the other side have decided they’re not willing to defend. Some things ought to be bigger than politics. This is about truth,” Warnock said.",
            "“It’s ironic that this would happen [on Memorial Day] weekend, because all of us will go back to our home districts, and we will celebrate great patriots who paid the ultimate price to defend our democracy on bloody battlefields, and we have politicians who are not even willing to stand up on the Senate floor for what’s obviously right,” he added.",
            "Jan. 6, Warnock said, “was an unabashed exercise in attempted disenfranchisement, and now we have seen that attack metastasize to state capitals all across the country” as Trump-supporting legislatures throughout the country pass legislation that will make it more difficult to vote because their supporters believe the former president’s lies about a stolen election.",
            "“This is a defining moment. Somebody’s got to stand up and defend our democracy,” Warnock said.",
            "“The integrity of the democracy is at stake,” Warnock said. “Let’s have the arguments about the size of government, let’s have the arguments about health care, taxes, education, infrastructure. But what has made this country work, with all of those challenges, is that we have a general framework in which those arguments take place, and what we are witnessing in this moment is a historic abandonment of that basic democratic framework.”"

            "ROME (AP) — The three suspects in Italy’s cable car disaster that killed 14 people were allowed to leave prison Sunday after a judge indicated that most of the blame fell on just one of them: a service technician who intentionally disabled the car’s emergency brake because it kept locking spontaneously.",
            "Judge Donatella Banci Buonamici said there wasn’t sufficient evidence suggesting the owner of the Mottarone cable car company, Luigi Nerini, or the maintenance chief, Enrico Perocchio, knew that the technician had deactivated the brake on several occasions even before the May 23 disaster.",
            "After evaluating prosecutors’ request for continued detention of the three, Buonamici ordered the managers freed while allowing the technician, Gabriele Tadini, to leave under house arrest. The three men, who remain under investigation, left Verbania prison early Sunday, accompanied by their lawyers.",
            "Fourteen people were killed when the lead cable of the Mottarone funicular overlooking Lake Maggiore in northern Italy snapped and the emergency brake failed to prevent the cable car from reeling backward down the support line. The cable car pulled off the line entirely when it hit a support pylon, crashed to the ground and then rolled down the mountain until it was stopped by a stand of trees.",
            "The lone survivor, 5-year-old Eitan Biran, remains hospitalized but conscious, with his aunt looking after him. Eitan’s parents, his younger brother and his great-grandparents were killed in the disaster.",
            "It is not known why the pulling cable snapped.",
            "The Italian region of Piedmont observed a minute of silence at noon Sunday, and flags flew at half-staff to mark the moment one week ago when the disaster struck.",
            "Tadini admitted during questioning that he had left a fork-shaped bracket on the cable car’s emergency brake to disable it because it kept locking on its own while the car was in service, said his lawyer, Marcello Perillo.",
            "Speaking to reporters outside Verbania prison, Perillo said Tadini never would have left the bracket in place if he thought doing so might endanger passengers.",
            "“He is not a criminal and would never have let people go up with the braking system blocked had he known that there was even a possibility that the cable would have broken,” Perillo said. “He can’t even begin to get his head around the fact that the cable broke.”",
            "Prosecutors had hypothesized that Tadini’s managers knew about the jerry-rigged brake and had an economic reason in using it to keep the funicular running. Prosecutor Olimpia Bossi said the owner would have had to have taken the whole lift out of service for the more extensive, “radical” repairs that were necessary to fix the faulty emergency brake.",
            "The lift only reopened on April 26 after a lengthy COVID-19 shutdown and was gearing up for the summer tourist season in a picturesque part of northern Italy.",
            "But lawyers for Nerini and Perocchio said the two denied knowing anything about Tadini’s maneuver and said they had no reason to let a cable car without a brake system operate.",
            "Nerini’s attorney, Pasquale Patano, said the owner “had no interest in not repairing the cable car” since he paid a flat fee of 150,000 euros ($183,000) a year for unlimited maintenance from an outside company to keep the funicular safe and operational.",
            "Perocchio similarly denied any knowledge of Tadini’s maneuver, according to his lawyer Andrea Da Prato, who suggested his client had been arrested because the prosecutor felt pressure to produce quick results in the investigation into the tragedy.",
            "As he left the prison, Perocchio said he was “desperately sad” for the victims and never would have authorized disabling the emergency brake.",
            "“I’ve been working in cable cars for 21 years and I know there’s no reason in the world to do that,” he told reporters."

            "Jones, who helped build the state’s online presentation of its COVID-19 data, received national attention a year ago when she sowed doubt about the information being reported by the state when Florida was an epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic. She suggested that Health Department managers wanted her to manipulate information to paint a rosier picture and that she pushed back.",
            "A letter from Inspector General Michael J. Bennett, the Herald reported, said Jones’ complaint demonstrates “reasonable cause to suspect that an employee or agent of an agency or independent contractor has violated any federal, state or local law, rule or regulation.”",

            "MacLeod died early Saturday, his nephew, Mark See, told Variety. MacLeod’s health had been poor recently but no cause of death was given, the trade publication reported.",
            "Known to sitcom fans for his bald head and wide smile, MacLeod toiled in near anonymity for more than a decade, appearing on dozens of TV shows and in several movies before landing his “Mary Tyler Moore” role in 1970.",
            "He had originally tested for Moore’s TV boss, Lou Grant, a part that went to Ed Asner. Realizing he wasn’t right for playing the blustery, short-tempered TV newsroom leader, MacLeod asked if he could try instead for the wisecracking TV news writer, his jokes often at the expense of the dimwitted anchorman Ted Baxter.",
            "“The Mary Tyler Moore Show” was a smash from the start and remains a classic of situation comedies. It produced two spinoffs, “Rhoda” and “Phyllis,” starring Valerie Harper and Cloris Leachman, who had portrayed Mary’s neighbors.",
            "It was still top-rated when Moore, who played news producer Mary Richards, decided to end it after seven seasons.",
            "MacLeod moved on to “The Love Boat,” a romantic comedy in which guest stars, ranging from Gene Kelly to Janet Jackson, would come aboard for a cruise and fall in love with one another.",
            "Although scorned by critics, the series proved immensely popular, lasting 11 seasons and spinning off several TV movies, including two in which MacLeod remained at the cruise ship’s helm. It also resulted in his being hired as a TV pitchman for Princess Cruise Lines.",
            "“The critics hated it. They called it mindless TV, but we became goodwill ambassadors,” he told the Los Angeles Times in 2013.",
            "Among his final TV credits were “Touched by An Angel,” “JAG” and “The King of Queens.”",
            "MacLeod’s lighthearted screen persona was in contrast to his private life. In his 2013 memoir, “This Is Your Captain Speaking,” MacLeod acknowledged that he had struggled with alcoholism in the 1960s and ’70s. He also wrote that losing his hair at an early age made it hard for him to find work as an actor.",
            "“I went all over town looking for an agent, but no one was interested in representing a young man with a bald head,” he wrote. “I knew what I needed to do. I needed to buy myself a hairpiece.” A toupee changed his luck “pretty quickly.” By middle age, he didn’t need the toupee.",
            "MacLeod, whose given name was Allan See, took his first name from a French movie and his last from a drama teacher at New York’s Ithaca College who had encouraged him to pursue an acting career.",
            "After college, the Mount Kisco, New York-native became a supporting player in “A Hatful of Rain” and other Broadway plays, and in such films as “I Want to Live!” and “Operation Petticoat.”",
            "He made guest appearances on TV shows throughout the 1960s, including “Hogan’s Heroes,” “Hawaii Five-O” and “The Dick Van Dyke Show.” He also appeared on “McHale’s Navy” from 1962 to 1964 as seaman Joseph “Happy” Haines.",
            "One major role he auditioned for: Archie Bunker in “All in the Family.” But he quickly realized that the character, immortalized by Carol O’Conner, was wrong for him. “Immediately I thought, ‘This is not the script for me. The character is too much of a bigot.’ I can’t say these things,” MacLeod wrote in his memoir.",
            "Other movie credits included “Kelly’s Heroes,” “The Sand Pebbles” and “The Sword of Ali Baba.”",
            "MacLeod had four children with his first wife, Joan Rootvik, whom he divorced in 1972. He was the son of an alcoholic and his drinking problems helped lead to a second divorce, to Patti Steele. But after MacLeod quit drinking, he and Steele remarried in 1985.",

            "For several years now, New York City has been the beating heart of the American left ― a place that showed what was possible when progressive reformers, democratic socialists and Black Lives Matter activists actually gained power.",
            "Voters in the nation’s largest city sent Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Jamaal Bowman to Congress, won some temporary cuts to the police department budget, and elected a new crop of state lawmakers who strengthened rules protecting renters and raised taxes on the rich.",
            "It comes as something of a surprise then that candidates backed by the city’s activist left are now underdogs in the Democratic mayoral primary on June 22. The winner of that contest is all but assured to win the general election in the solid blue city.",
            "The top two contenders for chief executive of the Big Apple are former presidential candidate Andrew Yang and Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams ― moderate Democrats cozy with the city’s business elite and supportive of traditional policing.",
            "Former city sanitation department commissioner Kathryn Garcia got her first lead in the polls on Tuesday two weeks after picking up the endorsement of The New York Times. She too is running in the moderate lane.",
            "There are three main progressive candidates: New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer; former counsel to the mayor Maya Wiley; and former nonprofit executive Dianne Morales.",
            "The left-leaning contenders have thus far struggled to break double digits in public polls. (Two other candidates, Citigroup executive Ray McGuire and former U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan, are not in serious contention.)",
            "Given the number of voters telling pollsters they are still undecided and the unpredictability of the city’s new ranked-choice voting system, progressives haven’t yet given up hope of sending one of their own to City Hall.",
            "But the left’s difficulties gaining traction in the race reflect real challenges for advocates of transformative change in New York City in particular, and the country in general.",
            "Those obstacles include backlash to current mayor and erstwhile progressive, Bill de Blasio; a violent crime wave sparking calls for tougher policing; skepticism of the left’s managerial chops; the failure to develop a clear plan to stop Yang’s and Adams’ rise; and a sexual misconduct allegation against a leading candidate.",
            "“We have a quote-unquote blue city. But we know that there are several shades of blue when it comes to Democrats in New York,” said Christina Greer, a political scientist at Fordham University and co-host of the “FAQ NYC” podcast about city politics. “New York’s not as progressive as it purports to be.”",
            "The De Blasio ‘Residue’",
            "The election of Bill de Blasio as mayor in 2013 marked a major leftward turn in New York City politics. The former public advocate and city councilman was not only the city’s first Democratic mayor in two decades, but also a decidedly progressive Democrat. He ran on enacting universal prekindergarten, taxing the rich and ending the police practice of “stop and frisk.”",
            "De Blasio’s policy proposals and a viral TV advertisement featuring his biracial son Dante gave liberals hope that the reactionary city politics of the 1980s and ’90s were finally coming to an end.",
            "Once in office, de Blasio won praise early on for several major achievements, including the adoption of universal pre-K and a continuously declining crime rate despite reforms like the near-elimination of stop and frisk.",
            "But in his second term, de Blasio received more and more flak for his feckless governing style.",
            "New Yorkers grew frustrated with what they saw as the declining efficiency of city services, the negative effects of his feud with Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D), multiple official investigations into the mayor’s campaign-finance tactics, a vanity-fueled run for president, and of course, his lengthy daily car rides to Park Slope, Brooklyn, to work out.",
            "“The left’s residue is Bill de Blasio: corruption, malfeasance, a sense that the city is out of control,” said Hank Sheinkopf, a moderate New York City Democrat and public-relations specialist whose clients include labor unions, trade groups and business interests. “The public does not like being shot or seeing garbage on the streets or seeing a general sense of disorder and chaos.”",
            "Conservative forces in the city ― from big business and the police unions to news outlets like the New York Post ― have had it out for de Blasio from the beginning.",
            "Still, the recent uptick in violent crime, part of a national spike, appears to have increased the resonance of these detractors’ criticism.",
            "“There’s a pendulum swinging the other way, in terms of public policy, and against the left, because de Blasio is seen as a progressive guy,” said Sal Albanese, a Democratic city council candidate in Staten Island, who twice ran against de Blasio for mayor.",
            "At the same time, since the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis a year ago, de Blasio has also faced fierce criticism from his left for failing to adequately curb police misconduct.",
            "To these left-wing critics, de Blasio’s problem was not that he was too progressive, but that he was not progressive enough ― whether it comes to reforming policing or making housing more affordable.",
            "But even they concede that those nuances are lost on a segment of the Democratic electorate that already stereotypes liberals as ill-suited to the managerial duties of an executive office.",
            "“He soured people on the idea that progressives can govern effectively,” said a progressive elected official who spoke on condition of anonymity.",
            "What’s more, because of de Blasio’s egocentric style and poor record as a manager, he failed to cultivate a bench of qualified politicians capable of using his legacy to launch their own careers in elected office.",
            "The large field of candidates to succeed de Blasio includes just two alumni of his administration: Garcia and Wiley.",
            "Both women have actively distanced themselves from their former boss. Wiley, who is running on a more progressive platform than de Blasio ever did and would be the city’s first Black female mayor, boasts that she “voted with [her] feet” when she left de Blasio’s team in 2016. (Morales, a Black Latina Brooklyn native who has excited the left-wing grassroots, would also make history as the city’s first Black female mayor and Latina mayor.)",
            "Meanwhile, Garcia, who also quit the de Blasio administration in protest and has earned a reputation as a competent manager, is running as a center-left technocrat. She has broken with de Blasio’s more traditional liberalism on matters like public education, expressing support for lifting the cap on the number of city charter schools.",
            "Cea Weaver, the campaign coordinator for Housing Justice for All, a state-level advocacy group, maintains that the absence of accomplished technocrats with more progressive ideals ― say, a left-wing version of Garcia ― reflects the growing pains of social movements more accustomed to pressuring government from the outside.",
            "It’s one reason, Weaver said, that the socialist left, in particular, has had more success to date winning state legislature and city council seats.",
            "“The next step for left governance is, ‘We are the thing. We’re running the thing,’” said Weaver, an active member of the Democratic Socialists of America’s NYC chapter, which has not endorsed in the mayoral race. “We need to become the thing that we’re used to targeting and build institutions that are not just outside of government, but are governing institutions.”",
            "The Scott Stringer Mess",
            "As the mayoral election kicked into gear last fall, Stringer, a former Manhattan borough president and state assemblyman for Manhattan’s Upper West Side, quickly locked up the support of some of New York’s most prominent progressive politicians, including Rep. Bowman and state Sens. Alessandra Biaggi, Julia Salazar and Jessica Ramos.",
            "The New York Working Families Party, a major power base for the city’s nascent left wing, followed suit in April, ranking Stringer first as part of a top-three, ranked-choice ballot endorsement. Morales and Wiley nabbed the second and third spots, respectively.",
            "The left’s marriage with Stringer was not exactly a union of passion. He’s an uncharismatic white man with a record that is far more moderate than that of many of his farther-left backers.",
            "Still, Stringer’s appeal was clear. He shared de Blasio’s mainstream progressive positions while making fewer enemies than the current mayor and eliciting a reputation for basic administrative competence.",
            "As comptroller, Stringer could point with pride to his divestment of the city’s pension funds from the private prison and fossil fuel industries. As a would-be mayoral candidate on the left, he made a point of endorsing some of the city’s most celebrated ― and controversial ― left-wing candidates, including the DSA-backed Salazar and Tiffany Cabán, a far-left defense lawyer who nearly won a race for Queens district attorney in 2019.",
            "And unlike Wiley and Morales, Stringer boasted the government experience, established political base, and mainstream credibility that the activist left saw as its most plausible ticket to City Hall.",
            "Then, on April 28, Jean Kim, a lobbyist who worked on Stringer’s 2001 campaign for NYC public advocate, accused Stringer of kissing and groping her without her consent during the 2001 race.",
            "Stringer immediately denied the allegation while affirming Kim’s right to come forward. He insisted that Kim ― who was in her 30s at the time ― had been a “peer” who had volunteered for the campaign, rather than an “intern” as Kim claimed to have been. He said that they had a brief, consensual romantic relationship, remained friends in subsequent years, and had a falling out only after he failed to offer her job on his 2013 campaign for comptroller. (The day after the allegations, Stringer’s team also provided the press with an email exchange showing she had asked for a job on the 2013 campaign, contrary to Kim’s claims.)",
            "Although a group of women supporting Stringer called for a “full, impartial accounting of the facts and the corroborating evidence,” the WFP and virtually all of the left-wing lawmakers who endorsed Stringer withdrew their support less than a week after Kim made the allegation. (The WFP has now switched to an equal co-endorsement of Wiley and Morales.)",
            "The New York WFP framed its decision as a stand for survivors of sexual assault, but some observers think that the organization had other motives in mind. “I don’t think their heart was in it for Scott,” said a progressive New York policy consultant, who requested anonymity for fear of professional repercussions. “Clearly, none of them really felt any loyalty to him.”",
            "Sheinkopf was more blunt. “He thought he could get away with renting the left for a period of time, but in fact what they did was kill him,” he said.",
            "A few days later, The Intercept confirmed key elements of Stringer’s story and unearthed some information that cast additional doubt on Kim’s. The Intercept confirmed that, contrary to Kim’s claims, she had been an adult volunteer for Stringer rather than intern and remained a dues-paying member of their mutual Democratic club after the alleged incident. The outlet also reported that former New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who resigned amid allegations of domestic abuse, had not introduced Kim to Stringer as Kim claimed.",
            "Of course, there is no way to prove or disprove Kim’s claims definitively, and discrepancies in those details don’t mean the crux of her allegations are untrue. In a subsequent interview with The New York Times, Kim stuck to her story.",
            "To some progressive veterans of New York City politics though, Stringer’s endorsers backed away too hastily. The WFP, in particular, which prides itself on transmitting institutional knowledge from one generation of progressives to the next, should have waited for more information to emerge before making a decision, these critics lament.",
            "A progressive New York City political strategist who asked for anonymity to protect professional relationships and does not have any affiliation with Stringer, compared the case to other allegations of sexual misconduct that remained inconclusive or withered under scrutiny, such as the charges against President Joe Biden, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison and Massachusetts congressional candidate Alex Morse.",
            "Each of those cases is unique; for example, it emerged that Morse’s accuser was trying to curry favor with a rival campaign.",
            "But the strategist worried that progressive Democrats in particular are making themselves vulnerable to bad-faith attacks.",
            "“Are we just going to allow any unsubstantiated allegation to destroy any viable progressive?” the strategist said. “If so, the center has a playbook.”",
            "Stanley Fritz, New York state political director for Citizen Action of New York, a WFP member group, rejected the claim that bad-faith allegations are a real threat to progressive interests.",
            "“We should be doing the work to dismantle patriarchy and you don’t have to worry about quote-unquote bad actors,” he said.",
            "The WFP told HuffPost that the group’s officers had reached the decision unanimously after it became clear that Stringer’s planned response was to try to discredit Kim.",
            "“We approached the moment with the deliberate reflection, discussion and input from members and leaders it required, and our officers came to a unanimous decision that we feel is in the best interest of our membership and our city,” Sochie Nnaemeka, director of the New York WFP, said in a statement.",
            "A Stringer ally disputed the suggestion that the campaign sought to discredit Kim.",
            "“We never once commented on Kim’s character, on her motivations, or on anything besides the allegations she made and what she said about her connection to Scott ― but there were multiple, demonstrable falsehoods in those statements,” said the Stringer ally, who asked for anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the matter.",
            "For his part, Stringer retains the support of Rep. Jerry Nadler (D), American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten and the city’s teachers union. He has also picked up the endorsements of several more labor unions since the scandal broke.",
            "And while none of the Stringer supporters who abandoned him have returned to his side, Bowman told a group of progressive activists that he “sometimes” regrets the decision, according to an article in Politico on Wednesday. Ramos, the first lawmaker to withdraw support from Stringer, told Politico that Stringer is “still the most qualified person running for mayor.”",
            "Some critics also wish that New York’s progressive institutions had at least developed a clearer strategy for blocking Yang or Adams. The progressive NYC political strategist suggested that the WFP and other groups should try to clarify for like-minded voters which of the two candidates is worse for progressive priorities, and whether to rank them fifth on a ranked-choice ballot or omit them altogether.",
            "In Bowman’s comments to activists, he seemed to be hoping for an alternative plan to stop Yang that is not forthcoming. “I hope that we’re able to get to a place where we can figure something out so that doesn’t happen,” he said.",
            "Nnaemeka of the New York WFP did not answer directly when asked why the group had not listed its fourth and fifth choices for mayor.",
            "“New Yorkers will have the option to vote for multiple progressive candidates on election day, and we are using our multicandidate endorsement as an opportunity to educate voters about ranked-choice voting, what to expect, how it will work, and why ranking progressive candidates is so critical,” she said.",
            "Silver Linings For The Left",
            "Several left-wing New York power brokers insisted that the poor standing of their preferred candidates in the polls is not entirely unexpected.",
            "“We always knew that this work was going to be a marathon, not a sprint,” Fritz said.",
            "After all, the post-2016 left’s biggest wins have been in districts that comprise smaller, more progressive sections of the city.",
            "And for all of de Blasio’s flaws, no progressive candidate in the current field is in a position to replicate his success uniting college-educated liberals, Black voters, and members of labor unions behind the same candidate.",
            "“Is it the case that we don’t have progressive institutions with the combination of power, a breadth of support, enough discipline, and an ability to navigate the coalition that we have in a way to contest strongly for majority support in New York City?” the official said. “It’s hard not to look at the moment we’re in and not conclude that that’s true.”",
            "It’s one reason why New York City’s DSA chapter decided to sit out the mayoral race this cycle. The organization, whose strength is in its army of door knockers, does not think it has the resources to compete in a citywide race defined by expensive media advertisements.",
            "“We’re trying to be really strategic and realistic about how many races we can fully participate in each year,” said Sumathy Kumar, co-chair of NYC DSA.",
            "In addition, the left’s success in Albany has taken some of the pressure off of city politics. For years, the city government was at the mercy of Cuomo, who seemed to relish using the state’s control over taxing and spending policy to deprive the city of essential resources.",
            "With Cuomo weakened by scandals and Democrats enjoying veto-proof majorities in both legislative chambers, the state legislature expanded funding for public schools and other priorities by increasing taxes on the state’s wealthiest households.",
            "Progressives have “spent the last two years laser-focused on getting the legislature to stand up to Cuomo,” Weaver of Housing Justice for All said. “I think we’ve done a tremendous job.”",
            "At the city level, the WFP and other left-wing lawmakers are still hoping that Brad Lander can win the primary for comptroller, and that Tahanie Aboushi, a civil rights attorney and Muslim, can clinch the Democratic nomination for Manhattan district attorney.",
            "Although polling is scarce in those races, election watchers believe that Lander is an underdog against the better-funded city council speaker, Corey Johnson. Aboushi is also struggling to break through against the field’s top fundraisers, prosecutor Tali Farhadian Weinstein, and former deputy state attorney general Alvin Bragg, who is backed by a host of labor unions and liberal Manhattan elected officials.",
            "In the 51-seat city council, though, where term limits have prompted numerous retirements and smaller districts play to the left’s strengths, progressive fortunes are looking up. DSA is backing six candidates and the WFP has endorsed 28 candidates, including four people that the DSA is backing as well. For example, Cabán, the former DA candidate, is in a strong position to fill an open council seat in Astoria, Queens, with both organizations’ support.",
            "Even Sheinkopf concedes that the next city council is likely to be a major force in city governance.",
            "“Mayor Yang or Mayor Adams will be dealing with a restive, left-wing city council with a very different agenda,” he said. “I’m not convinced the left is done yet.”"

            "You don’t pay Lisa Kudrow a reported $2.5 million to appear at the “Friends” reunion special and not have her sing the defining ballad of our time, “Smelly Cat.”",
            "Thankfully, she got by with a little help from a different friend, Lady Gaga, who joined the actor in the HBO Max special, which reunited all six cast members on screen for the first time since the beloved sitcom wrapped 17 years ago,",
            "First performed in an early episode in the show’s second season, “Smelly Cat,” an ode to an especially pungent pet, became a pop culture phenomenon and a bonafide hit for Kudrow, who co-wrote the song’s lyrics and once performed the acoustic number on stage with Taylor Swift.",
            "So, she was well-primed to duet with Gaga during “Friends: The Reunion” for the ultimate tribute to the so-bad-it’s-good earworm. Sitting on the couch of the Central Perk set, Kudrow sings the opening lines before Gaga enters, guitar in hand.",
            "Dressed in her Phoebe Buffay finest, Gaga takes a seat next to Kudrow, telling her it’s “one of my favorite songs,” before asking if she can “take ‘Smelly Cat’ for a spin?”",
            "Gaga proceeds to belt out the song, much to the delight of Kudrow, who jokingly tells her, “That’s not bad.”",
            "“You may not be a bed of roses / You’re not friend to those with noses,” Gaga continues, before gesturing to her own nose à la “A Star Is Born.” (For what it’s worth, this performance would absolutely be Jackson Maine-approved.)",
            "But, remember, this special has a budget, so before long a gospel choir emerges to provide some background vocals and give the song some extra oomph, as Gaga and Kudrow finish it off with some final flourishes.",
            "The bit ends on a heartfelt note, with Gaga telling Kudrow just how much her character meant to viewers all these years.",
            "“Can I just say something? Thank you for being the person for all of us on Friends … I don’t know if this is the right way to say it, but the different one or the one that was really herself,” Gaga told Kudrow.",
            "“Thank you,” the actor said in return. “And thanks for carrying it along.”",
            "Gaga, who was among a slew of famous guests to appear in the special, apparently “jumped at the chance” to sing with Kudrow, despite having little rehearsal time.",
            "“I said to Lisa, ‘Would you be prepared to sing it?’ And she was like, ‘Yeah, that would be fun,’” director Ben Winston recalled to Variety. “We went through a few names, and we both agreed that Gaga, if we could get her, would be the ultimate one because she associates with and feels close to Phoebe in so many ways, as Gaga says on the show. That was a really beautiful moment.”",

To add to the intrigue of this maybe love affair, recent photos caught the pair in Miami. And some of those shots show what some people think is a telling detail.\n\nOn Sunday, the Twitter account @jloaffleck, which tracks updates of Affleck and Lopez’s goings-on, tweeted that Affleck seems to be wearing the same chain-link watch he wore when he and Lopez began dating the first time around in the early-2000s.",
            "The watch is particularly significant because Affleck rocked it in the iconic music video he starred in with Lopez for “Jenny from the Block” all the way back in October 2002. You can see it below in this screenshot:",
            "@jloaffleck noted late on Monday that Affleck has been seen wearing the watch at other times ― specifically in 2018. Still, fans are loving that the watch has made a reappearance in Affleck’s newest outings with Lopez.",

            "Adam Weibling, a 38-year-old Texas man, made no secret in recent months of his contempt for the FBI, likening its agents to Nazis and “terrorists” in a series of conspiracy-laden tweets. His dislike for them surely grew on Tuesday when they arrested him for storming the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.",
            "FBI agents arrested Weibling in Katy, Texas, on charges of unlawfully entering restricted grounds and engaging in disorderly conduct inside the Capitol, according to court records. His first virtual appearance in D.C. court is scheduled for June 3.",
            "According to an affidavit filed May 19 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia and signed by an FBI task force officer, Weibling can be seen in video recorded by a reporter pushing his way past police in riot gear to get inside the Capitol around 2:30 p.m. on Jan. 6.",
            "Capitol surveillance video showed Weibling looking “disheveled” as he strolled into the building’s Rotunda following his encounter with the police officer, “often placing his hand on his head as if checking for a wound,” the affidavit stated.",
            "He moved in and out of the Rotunda, often interacting with other protesters, until police officers later took control of the crowd, according to the affidavit.",
            "FBI agents were tipped off to Weibling’s participation in the riot by two people who recognized him from the reporter’s video and separately reached out to the bureau on Jan. 19. Flight records and other records confirmed Weibling and his wife were in Washington during the attack.",
            "Neither Weibling nor his attorney immediately responded to HuffPost’s requests for comment.",
            "Weibling, who used the Twitter handle @AdamWeibling, is a prolific tweeter. According to the FBI, his tweets between Dec. 22 and Jan. 15 indicated his “skepticism in the results of the election” and “discontent with Congress.” He also tweeted his intention to travel to Washington to participate in the Jan. 6 rally in support of then-President Donald Trump.",
            "HuffPost analysis of Weibling’s tweets revealed a man who frequently engaged with conservative figures and outlets online through baseless rants about the media and a “stolen” election, but drew little if any engagement himself.",
            "“No one ransacked, people walked around and took pictures, that’s it,” Weibling tweeted around 9:30 p.m. on Jan. 6. “Media is making things up.”",
            "“Enough with the hysterics, these people were really peaceful, at worst this was breaking and entering,” he tweeted minutes later in response to another Twitter user calling the riot “domestic terrorism.”",
            "“No one from our side was biting, it was breaking and entering, that’s it,” Weibling tweeted the next day. “No one swinging, no one shooting, no looting or arson or theft. Not biting at all, just civil disobedience.”",
            "In another tweet, Weibling stated that “these people had every right to break into” the Capitol.",
            "At least five people died during or shortly after the Capitol riot, including one police officer. Two other officers who responded to the attack died by suicide days later. Dozens of law enforcement officers were injured during the incident.",
            "Video and photos taken during the attack showed protesters damaging and stealing items from the Capitol, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-Calif.) lectern.",
            "“FBI are the terrorists, bunch of scum,” Weibling tweeted on Jan. 12 in response to another Twitter user writing about the FBI’s search for Capitol siege participants.",
            "“The FBI deserves a special place in hell for covering for the elite ... for persecuting patriots and allowing deadly actual terrorist riots by [Black Lives Matter] and Antifa,” he wrote in a later tweet. “The FBI are not that different from Hitler’s SS.”",
            "In February, Weibling tweeted that there was “nothing inherently wrong with violence.”",
            "“Not a single thing,” he wrote while replying to a tweet sent by right-wing commentator Mike Cernovich. “In fact sometimes violence is a good thing.”",
            "Federal authorities have arrested and charged more than 400 defendants in connection with the Jan. 6 Capitol attack, and hundreds of additional arrests are likely on the way. The charges against Weibling are on the less serious side, and there’s no current evidence that he actually engaged in any of the more extreme violence he seemed to endorse on social media.",
            "Weibling’s Twitter attacks on the FBI mirrored the rhetoric of the former president he came to D.C. to support on Jan. 6. Trump regularly attacked the FBI over the course of his presidency, and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani ― a former federal prosecutor who has himself since run into trouble with the FBI ― compared FBI special agents to “storm troopers,” a reference to Nazi soldiers.\n\nThe rhetoric from Trump and his political allies convinced millions of Trump supporters that the generally conservative-leaning bureau was part of the “deep state” and out to get the former president. The extraordinary attacks on the bureau had real world consequences: Republican voters’ confidence in the FBI plummeted, and federal prosecutors had to deal with jury pools in conservative-leaning states that were inclined to believe that members of the nation’s premier law enforcement agency were corrupt.\n\nFBI officials knew that Trump’s attacks would have long-term effects on the bureau. But they couldn’t have imagined the current scenario: that the FBI would face additional attacks from Republicans because the bureau is charged with identifying and arresting the hundreds of Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol to stop the certification of President Joe Biden’s election win."

            "NEW DELHI (AP) — Doctors in India are fighting a fatal fungal infection affecting COVID-19 patients or those who have recovered from the disease amid a coronavirus surge that has driven the country’s fatalities to nearly 300,000.",
            "The life-threatening condition, known as mucormycosis, is relatively rare but doctors suspect that the sudden increase in the infection could further complicate India’s fight against the pandemic.",
            "India has reported more than 26 million confirmed cases of the coronavirus since the pandemic began, with almost half occurring in the past two months. On Sunday, the Health Ministry reported 3,741 new deaths, driving India’s confirmed fatalities to 299,266.",
            "It also reported 240,842 new infections, as daily cases remained below 300,000 for a week. The numbers are almost certainly undercounts, with many cases likely being missed due to limited testing.",
            "Experts say new infections in India, which had been rising steeply, may finally be slowing. But there are some early indications that mucormycosis, also known as “black fungus,” is fast becoming a cause of worry.",
            "Mucormycosis is caused by exposure to mucor mold, which is commonly found in soil, air and even in the nose and mucus of humans. It spreads through the respiratory tract and erodes facial structures. Sometimes, doctors have to surgically remove the eye to stop the infection from reaching the brain.",
            "On Saturday, federal minister Sadananda Gowda said nearly 9,000 cases had been reported in India so far, leading to a shortage of Amphotericin B, the drug used to treat the condition.",
            "Gowda didn’t share the number of fatalities, but local media have said more than 250 have died because of the disease.",
            "Health officials were working to alleviate the drug shortage, which comes at a time when the country is already short on supplies of oxygen and other health care needs, Gowda said.",
            "Mucormycosis has a high mortality rate and was already present in India before the pandemic. It is not contagious but its frequency in the last month has left doctors shocked.",
            "“It is a new challenge and things are looking bleak,” said Ambrish Mithal, the chairman and head of the endocrinology and diabetes department at Max Healthcare, a chain of private hospitals in India.",
            "Mithal said the fungal infection preys on patients with weakened immune systems and underlying conditions, particularly diabetes, and irrational usage of steroids. Uncontrolled blood sugar can put immunocompromised people at a higher risk of contracting the disease.",
            "“Earlier I used to come across just a few cases every year but the current infection rate is frightening,” said Mithal.",
            "The latest surge of coronavirus infections in rural India has already taken a toll. Now heath experts are worried that over-the-counter medication, including steroids, can increase the prevalence of mucormycosis.",
            "SK Pandey, a medical officer at Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital in Uttar Pradesh state’s Lucknow city, said that unqualified doctors were giving steroids to patients in many rural areas without giving a thought whether they require it or not.",
            "“This has led to increase in black fungus cases in smaller cities where the patient has not even been hospitalized,” he said.",
            "India’s Health Ministry on Thursday asked states to track the spread of the condition and declare it an epidemic, making it mandatory for all medical facilities to report the cases to a federal surveillance network.",
            "Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday called the disease a “new challenge.”"

            "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration is facing new pressure to resolve a mystery that has vexed its predecessors: Is an adversary using a microwave or radio wave weapon to attack the brains of U.S. diplomats, spies and military personnel?",
            "The number of reported cases of possible attack is sharply growing and lawmakers from both parties, as well as those believed to be affected, are demanding answers. But scientists and government officials aren’t yet certain about who might have been behind any attacks, if the symptoms could have been caused inadvertently by surveillance equipment — or if the incidents were actually attacks.",
            "Whatever an official review concludes could have enormous consequences. Confirmation that a U.S. adversary has been conducting damaging attacks against U.S. personnel would unleash calls for a forceful response by the United States.",
            "For now, the administration is providing assurances that it takes the matter seriously, is investigating aggressively and will make sure those affected have good medical care.",
            "The problem has been labeled the “Havana Syndrome,” because the first cases affected personnel in 2016 at the U.S. Embassy in Cuba. At least 130 cases across the government are now under investigation, up from several dozen last year, according to a U.S. defense official who was not authorized to discuss details publicly. The National Security Council is leading the investigation.",
            "People who are believed to have been affected have reported headaches, dizziness and symptoms consistent with concussions, with some requiring months of medical treatment. Some have reported hearing a loud noise before the sudden onset of symptoms.",
            "Particularly alarming are revelations of at least two possible incidents in the Washington area, including one case near the White House in November in which an official reported dizziness.",
            "The new higher number of possible cases was first reported by The New York Times. CNN first reported the case near the White House and an additional incident in November.",
            "Advocates for those affected accuse the U.S. government of long failing to take the problem seriously or provide the necessary medical care and benefits.",
            "“The government has a much better understanding of it than it has let on,” said Mark Zaid, a Washington lawyer who represents several people affected. Zaid has obtained National Security Agency documents noting it has information dating to the late 1990s about an unidentified “hostile country” possibly having a microwave weapon “to weaken, intimidate, or kill an enemy over time.”",
            "Chris Miller, the acting defense secretary during the last months of the Trump administration, created a Pentagon team to investigate the suspected attacks. That was after he met a soldier late last year who described how, while serving in a country Miller wouldn’t identify, he had heard a “shrieking” sound and then had a splitting headache.",
            "“He was well-trained, extremely well-trained, and he’d been in combat before,” Miller told The Associated Press. “This is an American, a member of the Department of Defense. At that point, you can’t ignore that.”",
            "Defense and intelligence officials have publicly promised to push for answers and better care for people with symptoms. Lt. Col. Thomas Campbell, a Defense Department spokesman, said the causes of any incidents “are areas of active inquiry.” Officials have not identified a suspected country, though some people affected suspect Russian involvement.",
            "CIA Director William Burns testified before Congress that he would make the investigation “a very high priority to ensure that my colleagues get the care that they deserve and that we get to the bottom of what caused these incidents and who was responsible.”",
            "Burns receives daily updates on the investigation, which covers employees who have reported cases this year. He has met with those reporting injuries as have other top CIA officials. The agency has worked to reduce the wait time for its employees to receive outpatient treatment at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.",
            "The CIA also replaced its chief medical officer with a doctor seen internally as more sympathetic to possible cases.",
            "“We were treated so awfully in the past,” said Marc Polymeropoulos, a 26-year CIA veteran who was diagnosed with a traumatic brain injury following a 2017 visit to Russia. “Now they’re putting people in place who not only believe us but are going to advocate for our health care.”",
            "One key analysis identified “directed, pulsed radio frequency energy” as the most plausible culprit. Published in December by the National Academy of Sciences, the report said a radio frequency attack could alter brain function without causing “gross structural damage.” But the panel could not make a definitive finding on how U.S. personnel may have been hit.",
            "And a declassified 2018 State Department report cited “a lack of senior leadership, ineffective communications, and systemic disorganization” in responding to the Havana cases. The report says the cause of the injuries was “currently unknown.” The document was published by George Washington University’s National Security Archive.",
            "The report also noted that the CIA ultimately closed its Havana station, a victory for a potential adversary.",
            "Dr. James Giordano, a neurology professor at Georgetown University, consulted with the State Department on the Havana cases and has been briefed on more recent incidents in the U.S. and abroad. In reviewing records of people affected in Havana, Giordano noted evidence of neurological injuries in several people, suggesting they may have been hit with radio waves.",
            "He identified two possible culprits: a device intentionally used to target potential victims or a tool that used directed energy waves to conduct surveillance that may have unintentionally harmed the people targeted. One of the November attacks outside the White House had “substantial similarities” to the Havana cases, Giordano said, adding that he was not authorized by the government to be more specific.",
            "“It’s very difficult, if not impossible, to fake or misrepresent certain findings to objective clinical evaluations,” Giordano said. “I mean, there are certain things you can’t make your nerves do or not do.”",
            "Other scientists remain skeptical. Dr. Robert Baloh of the University of California, Los Angeles, argued that scans of healthy people’s brains sometimes display mini-strokes and that any possible weapon would be too large or require too much power to be deployed without detection.",
            "Baloh said the growing number of cases considered directed energy attacks is actually linked to “mass psychogenic illness,” in which people learning of others with symptoms begin to feel sick themselves.",
            "“Many people are hearing about it and that’s how it gets propagated,” Baloh said.",
            "Lawmakers from both parties are pushing the Biden administration to take this seriously. A bill introduced in both the House and Senate on Wednesday would bolster the payment of disability benefits for traumatic brain injuries suffered in the incidents.",
            "“There’s no greater priority than ensuring the health and safety of our people, and the anomalous health incidents that have afflicted our personnel around the world are of grave concern,” said Rep. Adam Schiff, the California Democrat who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, in a statement. Rep. Devin Nunes, the committee’s top Republican, said the people reporting symptoms “were apparently subject to attack.”",
            "Polymeropoulos, the former CIA officer, said he believed the U.S. would ultimately identify what was behind the incidents and who is responsible.",
            "“The actual intelligence is going to take us to the truth on this,” he said. “If we find that a certain adversary did this, there’s going to be uncomfortable decisions on what to do.”"

            "After an all-night rescue operation in freezing temperatures involving more than 700 personnel, rescuers were able to confirm that 151 people were safe, out of a total of 172 participants. Twenty-one had died, according to the official Xinhua News Agency, which said the runners suffered from physical discomfort and the sudden drop in temperature.",
            "The runners were racing on an extremely narrow mountain path at an altitude reaching 6,500-9,800 feet. The 60-mile race was held Saturday in the Yellow River Stone Forest tourist site in Baiyin city in Gansu province.",
            "Participants were not rookies. One of the deceased was a well-known runner Liang Jing, who had won a 62-mile race in Ningbo, reported the Paper, a state-backed newspaper based in Shanghai.",
            "A woman who worked for the race organizer, Gansu Shengjing Sports Culture Development Co., said there were no predictions of extreme weather for the day of the race, according to Beijing News, a paper owned by the Beijing city government.",
            "However, Baiyin city’s local branch of the National Early Warning Information Center had warned for the past three days of hail and strong winds.",
            "The race also followed a relatively established course, having been held four times, according to an account posted online by a participant in the race who quit and managed to make his way to safety.",
            "But the weather caught them off guard, and on the morning of the race Saturday, he already sensed things were not normal. The runners were not dressed for winter-like conditions, many wearing short-sleeved tops.",
            "“I ran 2 kilometers before the starting gun fired to warm up ... but the troublesome thing was, after running these 2 kilometers, my body still had not heated up,” the competitor said in a first-person account that has been viewed more than 100,000 times on his WeChat account “Wandering about the South.”",
            "He later told the Paper that the forecast the day prior to the race did not predict the extreme weather they encountered.",
            "The most difficult section, from mile 15 to mile 22, climbed 3,280 feet. There, he said the path was just a mix of stones and sand, and his fingers grew numb from the cold.",
            "When he finally decided to turn back, he already felt dazed. He said he was able to make it to safety and met a rescue crew. He did not respond to a request for comment left on his social media account.",
            "Some runners farther along the course had fallen off the trail into deep mountain crevices, according to a reporter for state broadcaster CCTV. It was not clear how many of them survived.",
            "Video footage showed rescuers in winter jackets in the pitch-dark night searching with flashlights along steep hills and narrow paths. Search operations ended by noon Sunday, rescuers told Xinhua.",
            "Online, some wondered what, if any preparations organizers had made in the event of an emergency. The race organizer did not immediately respond to calls seeking comment Sunday.",
            "Baiyin city Mayor Zhang Xuchen held a news conference later Sunday and profoundly apologized as the organizer of the event. The government promised a full investigation.",

            "Husam El-Qoulaq was about to board a plane home to Los Angeles last week when he received a text from a friend. The friend had seen names on a Gaza casualty list with the surname El-Qoulaq. He’d wondered if they were family.",
            "El-Qoulaq began to frantically search through Arabic press on the Israeli forces’ recent bombing over Gaza. Then, he found the names ― 14 of them, all members of his extended family who died when airstrikes decimated their four-story apartment building.",
            "The list of names has only grown since then, to 22. The youngest was 6 months old and the eldest, 90.",
            "“When these buildings crumble, they bury entire families underneath them. And then the loved ones of that family arrive to dig through the rubble for hours and hours to try and locate anybody that they can find,” El-Qoulaq told HuffPost. “The number just kept climbing as people were converted from missing to dead.”",
            "The death toll across Gaza continued to rise this week. Israeli forces carried out the deadliest single attack last Sunday, killing more than 200 people, including 61 children, according to Gaza’s health ministry. Succumbing to international pressure, Israel finally agreed to a cease-fire in Gaza on Thursday despite initial resistance from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who vowed to prolong the military attack for “as long as necessary.”",
            "For Palestinians in the United States, the violence has been a reminder that the occupation hits close to home, even when they are thousands of miles away. Several Palestinian Americans described the turmoil of the last week: mourning the deaths of loved ones, waiting for news about whether family members had survived, and reliving their own trauma as displaced refugees. For some, it has triggered intense survivor’s guilt and a feeling of complicity as taxpayers. Many said the violence is a grim part of what it means to be Palestinian.",
            "“For me as a Palestinian American, there’s a sense that I’ve failed my family,” said El-Qoulaq, who anguishes over taxpayer money used to fund bombings like the ones that killed his family.",
            "Waiting For The Worst",
            "Violence in the region has escalated over the last few weeks as Palestinian families in Sheikh Jarrah, a neighborhood in east Jerusalem, faced possible evictions if their homes were granted to Israeli settlers. During the holy month of Ramadan, which ended last week, Israeli security forces threw tear gas and fired rubber bullets inside the Al-Aqsa Mosque where Muslims were praying, sparking more outrage. On Eid, the Muslim holiday marking the end of Ramadan, dozens of Palestinians, including children, were killed amid Israeli aerial bombardment over Gaza.",
            "And for a second week, the Palestinian militant group Hamas fired dozens of rockets into Israel as retaliation, bringing the reported death toll in Israel to 12.",
            "Survivor’s guilt has haunted Alaa Hammouda, a 30-year-old Palestinian from Gaza living in North Carolina.",
            "Hammouda was in Gaza during the 2014 war in which more than 2,000 Palestinians were killed, including nearly 500 children, during Israel’s Operation Protective Edge, a military offensive that drew international condemnation.",
            "Hammouda was nine months pregnant when her house was bombed. She told HuffPost that she barely escaped. Her two cousins, ages 8 and 10, did not survive.",
            "“It was the most terrifying experience I’ve ever had in my life,” Hammouda said.",
            "These days, she regularly texts her family back in Gaza, terrified that they won’t respond.",
            "“Every night, I wake up in the middle of the night to just text them and ask, ‘Are you still alive?’ There is not much conversation beyond whether they are still alive or not,” Hammouda said. “I just need to make sure they did not die.”",
            "Her husband’s cousin, a newlywed and a father to a 4-month-old, was killed Wednesday when airstrikes hit their house in northern Gaza. Her mother-in-law was also sent to the hospital due to injuries sustained from the bombs. And now, her father, four brothers, three sisters and dozens of nieces and nephews are all scattered, living with neighbors or other family members.",
            "“There is no safe place to go,” Hammouda said. Schools, hospitals and shelters are all susceptible to strikes. “I wish that no one is in my position because it’s the hardest feeling ever when you’re watching your loved ones suffer and then you just can’t do anything about it. You’re just helpless.”",
            "Children At The Forefront Of The War",
            "Children have borne the brunt of the violence in Gaza. Of the more than 220 people killed since Wednesday, at least 63 were children. Eleven of them were participants in an international program that helps children deal with trauma. In Israel, two children were also killed.",
            "Eman Mohammed, a 33-year-old Palestinian American residing in Washington, D.C., remembers the day she almost lost her daughter.",
            "She had been covering the war in Gaza as a photojournalist in 2014 when her neighborhood was bombed. Mohammed rushed back home to her children, where she found her 1-year-old bleeding in her crib. Mohammed frantically tried to find help, but hospitals in Gaza were overloaded. Mohammed and her daughter, who was suffering from internal bleeding, were only able to get help when Americans were evacuated to the United States.",
            "She hasn’t been back to Gaza since, and she worries constantly about her mother, whom she was forced to leave behind. During their phone calls, she sometimes hears the bombs in the background.",
            "“It’s one of the most inhumane mental torture for anyone to have to watch and hear their loved ones calling for help and calling for rescue. I know that the airplanes that are bombing around her are American-made and tax dollar-funded,” Mohammed said. “I feel like I’m almost part of the problem and part of what equips this war to keep going, and it just shatters my heart. It’s a difficult reality.”",
            "Like many families and lawmakers, Mohammed is critical of the U.S.’s sale of weapons to Israel despite documented evidence of human rights abuses. President Joe Biden faced backlash from both activists and House Democrats after he approved the potential sale of a $735 million weapons deal to Israel earlier this week. On Thursday, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) introduced a resolution condemning the sale.",
            "“At a moment when U.S.-made bombs are devastating Gaza and killing women and children, we cannot simply let another huge arms sale go through without even a congressional debate,” Sanders said.",
            "This also weighs heavily on El-Qouloq’s mind as a U.S. citizen.",
            "“There’s a feeling of complicity,” he said. “I don’t want to fund the massacre of my family, and I hope other Americans don’t want that either.”",
            "Fighting For Change",
            "Tariq Haddad, a 46-year-old cardiologist who lives in Virginia, recalled so much about his childhood in Gaza ― including the time he had to hide in a chicken coop to dodge Israeli rubber bullets, and when he was strip searched at a checkpoint.",
            "He lost 11 cousins during the 2014 war, including a 4-year-old. All of them died while they were running out of their home after a warning shot struck the dwelling.",
            "“There were just beautiful, beautiful little children, and they just obviously didn’t deserve to go through what they went through,” Haddad said. “It honestly flavors everything that has happened since then. It’s just been very, very difficult.”",
            "For Haddad, being a Palestinian in the United States comes with complications — dealing with their own trauma, constant worry for family left behind, and an exhausting cycle of hoping that with each presidential administration, change will come.",
            "Nadia Hararah, a 34-year-old digital marketing manager, said she’s not hopeful much will change under the Biden administration but that she credits the social justice movement for sparking a national conversation about the Israeli occupation. Gaza is one of the most densely populated cities in the world and faces high levels of poverty, lack of access to clean water and frequent electricity shortages.",
            "Israel restricts travel outside the Gaza Strip and also maintains an air, land and sea blockade that makes it nearly impossible for Palestinians to access basic food supplies and medical equipment. The Israeli government justifies this as an attempt to weaken Hamas, the militant group that controls the Gaza Strip and is designated as a terrorist organization by the U.S. and Israel.",
            "“I think [the U.S.] has gone through an awakening and we’ve gone through an education process understanding what oppression means and what it means to be an ally,” Hararah said. “People are familiar with terms like ‘apartheid,’ ‘oppression,’ ‘occupation’ and ‘discrimination.’”",
            "Ahmed Mansour, a 29-year-old filmmaker from Gaza who immigrated to the United States in 2015 for college, said he has no choice but to be hopeful.",
            "He lived through the second intifada, the 2008 Gaza war and the 2014 war. He lives in Maryland now, just outside of Washington, D.C., but for the past few weeks, he’s been traveling nonstop to join the Palestinian solidarity protests that have broken out across the country.",
            "“I am only 6 miles from [the White House], where they are sending weapons to drop it on my family. I’ve never expected this scenario in my life,” said Mansour, who was once hopeful of a Biden presidency.",
            "All of his immediate family members are still in Gaza. During group calls, he listens quietly as they discuss whose house was recently destroyed and which neighbors were killed.",
            "“Something that Gaza teaches you is that you have to cling onto a string of hope, even if it’s not real,” he said."

            "The former Florida star and 2007 Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback signed a one-year contract with the Jacksonville Jaguars on Thursday and will attempt to revive his pro career as a tight end. The move also reunites two of college football’s most polarizing figures over the past 15 years.",
            "The 33-year-old Tebow is returning to the NFL after five years (2016-20) in the New York Mets’ organization and he’ll be playing for Meyer for the first time since his senior year in 2009.",
            "“I know it will be a challenge, but it is a challenge I embrace,” Tebow said in a statement. “I am dedicated to taking the direction of our coaching staff and learning from my teammates. I appreciate everyone’s support as I embark on this new journey.”",
            "He will be on the field with his new team Thursday and wearing No. 85 for a voluntary, closed workout. Tebow is not expected to have any media availability until training camp, at the earliest, in hopes of minimizing the media circus that follows the devout Christian who has received rock star treatment at every NFL stop.",
            "His comeback is unprecedented because of his age, his new position and the fact that he last played in a regular-season game in 2012, with the New York Jets.",
            "Several teams suggested Tebow make the position change years ago, but he declined.",
            "He finally switched after retiring from baseball in February. He worked out for the Jaguars the following week, the first of two exploratory sessions that came to light hours before the start of the NFL draft on April 29.",

            "For the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic began, vaccination isn’t just a hypothetical for a lot of parents; it is now a real option for children ages 12 and up, and many parents have jumped at the chance. According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data, more than 600,000 kids between 12 and 15 received the Pfizer vaccine in the first week it was available.",
            "And experts also now believe that by the start of the new school year in the fall, younger children could be eligible for vaccination as well.",
            "But there have been — and will continue be — a lot of parents who opt out. In one recent survey, 25% of parents said they have no intention of getting their children vaccinated, while another 18% said they’d do it only if their children’s school requires it. (It remains unclear whether schools legally can.)",
            "As we enter this next phase of the COVID-19 pandemic and the vaccine rollout to children, parents will need to start having conversations with each other about what their plans are — and disagreements will certainly arise. So HuffPost Parents asked pediatricians who are experienced in having conversations with vaccine-hesitant parents and caregivers about some best practices to keep in mind.",
            "First and foremost: Know it’s totally OK to ask parents their vaccination plans.",
            "“I really want to empower parents to ask,” said Dr. Edith Bracho-Sanchez, a pediatrician with Columbia University in New York. “I think sometimes we don’t want to say the wrong thing or hurt people’s feelings, but when you’re talking about your child’s health — especially if they’re going to be in a place where they’re exposed to other people for a prolonged period of time, like summer camp or a sleepover — it is absolutely OK to ask.”",
            "Keep it simple. Something like: “What have you decided for your family about vaccines?” is a good way in, Bracho-Sanchez said. Or even just “is your family vaccinated?” And “are you going to get vaccinated?” she recommended.",
            "Remember: Other people’s vaccination decisions have a direct impact on your own family’s health. Even if you’re vaccinated and you have an adolescent who is also vaccinated, you might have a younger child at home who could still be exposed.",
            "“If you are asking from a place of caring and curiosity, that sets the tone and you very rarely can go wrong,” said Bracho-Sanchez.",
            "Strive for empathy.",
            "If you are eager to get your own child vaccinated against COVID-19, you might find it mind-blowing (or worse) to realize a fellow parent you like and respect has other thoughts.",
            "But remember: “Keeping empathy at the forefront of our conversations with others is essential,” said pediatrician Dr. Kelly Fradin, who runs the popular Instagram account Advice I Give My Friends and authored the recent book “Parenting in a Pandemic.”",
            "“All parents have had a rough year, and many who are hesitant to get vaccinated immediately may feel scared,” she said.",
            "And indeed it does look as though there is a sizable group of parents — about 25% — who say they just really want to wait and see how the vaccine is working beyond the initial clinical trials.",
            "“Excessive pressure can backfire and lead individuals to really cement in their decisions,” Fradin warned. “A few more months of data and millions of kids doing well following vaccination may be all the evidence these individuals need to jump on the bandwagon.”",
            "Share why you’re vaccinating your own kid.",
            "Research has shown that a factor that can actually help sway vaccine-hesitant parents are conversations with people they trust, particularly pediatricians, but also friends and family.",
            "“If you are choosing to vaccinate and others around you aren’t, share your reasoning and your confidence,” Fradin urged — though she warned parents to avoid the tendency to be overly “instructive.”",
            "Fradin said she is hearing from a lot of parents who are worried that COVID-19 vaccines are being pushed on their children only to help achieve herd immunity. Groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics have really pushed back on the idea that vaccinating kids is only about the greater good, emphasizing that there are real benefits to individual children. “While fewer children than adults have suffered the most severe disease, this is not a benign disease in children,” the president of the AAP said in a recent statement.",
            "“Children will reap substantial direct benefits from vaccination,” echoed Fradin — not least of which is that they’ll be able to go mask-free in many settings and resume a lot of their normal activities.",
            "Personalizing all of this, and talking about why you believe the COVID-19 vaccine will help your own child, might make fellow parents think of the potential benefits to their own kid. Studies show, for example, that when pediatricians talk to vaccine hesitant parents, those parents are most swayed by doctors’ personal beliefs and experiences — like telling patients that they’ve had all their own children immunized. Personalizing all of this can be powerful.",
            "Brush up on some basic facts.",
            "Before you have a conversation with another parent about COVID-19 vaccines, it’s a good idea to do a little planning.",
            "“Think ahead to have some way to respond to whatever you hear,” Bracho-Sanchez said.",
            "Maybe study up on some of the most common myths surrounding kids and COVID-19 vaccination that might be putting parents off, like unfounded fears about future fertility or that the vaccine is dangerous to kids.",
            "“The most common message I hear from parents is it feels too soon or rushed,” Fradin said.",
            "To those parents, the term “warp speed” suggests the process was shortened in a way that sacrificed safety, and they’re simply frightened the vaccine could hurt their kids.",
            "Again, this is where curiosity, empathy and some basic knowledge can be really helpful. (The websites of the AAP and CDC are great sources of information.)",
            "Ultimately, remember: It’s not your responsibility to try to convince other parents, and research suggests that pediatricians (i.e., probably not you!) really are the single most important factor in getting parents to accept vaccines. So pick your battles, then do what you need to do to keep your own child healthy and safe."

        "articleContent": [
            "An array of progressive groups sent President Joe Biden a letter on Monday, calling for him to resist efforts to fill key intellectual property posts with allies of the pharmaceutical industry or other patent hawks.",
            "The letter, spearheaded by the Demand Progress Education Fund, wants Biden’s appointments to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and the National Institute for Standards and Technology to reflect the concerns of antimonopoly advocates and patients’ and consumers’ rights groups ― rather than just brand-name drug companies, Silicon Valley tech titans and other business interests that rely heavily on intellectual property regimes.",
            "The coalition’s message, which is also addressed to White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain, praises Biden for his decision to support a waiver of the patents and other trade-related aspects of intellectual property for COVID-19 vaccines. It also asks him to continue crafting intellectual property policy in that spirit.",
            "“A willingness to be appropriately flexible around intellectual property enforcement during times of great crisis must be understood to be an aspect of pandemic preparedness,” the letter says. “We need people in these posts who will understand consideration of global health to be a serious aspect of their charges, and who can be expected to strike the right balance on intellectual property rights in times of great global distress.”",
            "The letter’s signatories, which include the Revolving Door Project and the Action Center for Race and the Economy, don’t specify whom they would like Biden to appoint to head the USPTO and NIST.",
            "Mainly, the antimonopoly coalition sought to emphasize the types of people they do not want Biden to heed when deciding whom to appoint. The groups warn Biden that relying on the advice of corporate-friendly Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), both of whom opposed the COVID-19 vaccine IP waiver, could jeopardize the waiver’s success and the ability of the Biden administration to increase the affordability of prescription drugs more broadly. (As commerce secretary, Raimondo would supervise the heads of the two agencies.)",
            "“As determinations are made about whom to install to lead USPTO and NIST, we urge you to ensure that the administration overrules any efforts by Raimondo, Coons, or any other relevant officials to install people who are aligned with the pharmaceutical industry or other intellectual property maximalists,” the letter says.",
            "The USPTO and NIST play a key role in granting and protecting brand-name pharmaceutical companies’ patents, copyrights and other intellectual property.",
            "Through the USPTO, the federal government processes requests for patents that effectively grant companies monopolies on production of certain products or features, theoretically as an incentive to invest in innovation.",
            "The main function of NIST is to conduct technological research and collaborate with industry on improving performance.",
            "However, NIST is also the agency responsible for invoking so-called march-in rights. This power allows the federal government to “march in” and effectively suspend the patent of a product that was developed with federal funding if the government decides the product is not available to the public on “reasonable terms.”",
            "The two agencies, which coordinate closely with business sectors that rely on intellectual property, have traditionally been home to some of the most corporate-friendly figures in both Republican and Democratic presidential administrations.",
            "But antimonopoly activists in general, and patients’ rights groups in particular, have long lamented what they consider the excessive acquisition of patents and other intellectual property monopolies well past the point that is needed to encourage research and innovation. They would also like to see the federal government invoke march-in rights for medicines like insulin and EpiPens.",
            "These advocates, including antitrust experts at the American Economic Liberties Project, which also signed the letter, are eager for Democrats to begin prioritizing affordable medicine and other social causes not just through legislation, but through executive branch appointments as well.",
            "Just as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s scrutiny of federal financial regulators gave her the inspiration for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and progressive attorney Ady Barkan turned democratizing the Federal Reserve into a workers’ rights cause, longtime critics of the pharmaceutical industry and Big Tech want the left to pay more attention to obscure agencies like the USPTO and NIST.",
            "“Every time we go to the pharmacy and pay for our medicines, we are feeling the effects of the patent system,” said Priti Krishtel, a co-founder of the Initiative for Medicines, Access & Knowledge, which did not sign Monday’s letter.",
            "In a way, the letter confirms the pharmaceutical industry’s fears that the Biden administration’s support for waiving intellectual property protections for the COVID-19 vaccine would undermine their patent regimes in other instances.",
            "But advocates like Krishtel insist that the waiver fight simply heightens awareness of the ways that the intellectual property system no longer serves the public as it was intended.",
            "“Companies are too slow to share their intellectual property, their knowledge, to transfer their technology,” she said. “What we need is to show that intellectual property exists to serve people, not the other way around.”"

            "SAN DIEGO (AP) — The Biden administration has agreed to let about 250 people a day through border crossings with Mexico to seek refuge in the United States, part of negotiations to settle a lawsuit over pandemic-related powers that deny migrants a right to apply for asylum, an attorney said Monday.",
            "The government also said it would stop flying migrant families from Texas’ Rio Grande Valley to El Paso, Texas, and San Diego to then be expelled to Mexico under pandemic powers, said Lee Gelernt, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, which has sued in federal court in Washington, D.C. The government has reserved rights to resume flights “if it deems the circumstances warrant.”",
            "The government concessions would dramatically reshape exercise of powers known as Title 42, named for a section of an obscure 1944 law that former President Donald Trump used to let the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention effectively end asylum at the border while it sought to prevent the coronavirus from spreading.",
            "Biden has exempted unaccompanied children from Title 42 but kept it for single adults and many families. He has come under criticism from progressives for keeping asylum off-limits to many and for encouraging some parents to send children across the border alone. Enforcement-minded critics say exempting children traveling alone led to record numbers crossing and that lifting restrictions more will invite many more people to come.",
            "The government and the ACLU agreed to “a streamlined process for assessing and addressing exemption requests brought by particular vulnerable families and other individuals,” Gelernt said. Once fully up and running, an estimated 250 particularly vulnerable individuals will be allowed in daily to seek humanitarian protection through a consortium of nongovernmental organizations. They must test for COVID-19 before entering the country.",
            "About 2,000 people have already been allowed to enter the country, exempted from the pandemic-related powers to pursue asylum or other forms of protection while in the United States, Gelernt said.",
            "“While these concessions will hopefully save lives, they are not a substitute for eliminating Title 42 and restoring asylum processing fully,” Gelernt said.",
            "The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday night.",
            "Immigration advocates have ratcheted up pressure to lift pandemic-related powers entirely, arguing that they cannot be defended solely on grounds of protecting public health. Migrants are typically expelled to Mexico within two hours of getting picked up by Border Patrol agents.",
            "Administration officials, while insisting that the powers are in place for public health reasons, have repeatedly said they need more time to develop the “humane” asylum system that Biden promised during his campaign.",
            "The Biden administration has been running daily flights for up to 135 people from Brownsville, Texas, to El Paso and San Diego since Mexican authorities in Tamaulipas state sharply limited the number of Central American families it would take back, citing a law in Mexico that took effect in January against detaining migrant children. Families are expelled from El Paso and San Diego, border cities where Mexican authorities have been more amenable to taking them back than in Texas’ Rio Grande Valley, the busiest corridor for illegal crossings.",
            "The Border Patrol’s more than 173,000 encounters with migrants on the Mexican border in April were the highest level since April 2000, though the numbers aren’t directly comparable because more than six of 10 were expelled under pandemic-related powers. Being expelled carries no legal consequences, so many people try to cross multiple times.",
            "Authorities encountered 17,171 children traveling alone in April, down from an all-time high of 18,960 in March.",
            "There were about 50,000 people encountered in families in April. About one of every three in families was expelled to Mexico. The rest were allowed to remain in the United States to seek asylum."

            "Americans with disabilities were more satisfied than ever with their voting experiences during the 2020 elections as a raft of changes meant to make elections safer during the COVID-19 pandemic made casting ballots easier for a population that has struggled for decades to easily access polling sites.",
            "But a wave of voting restrictions that Republicans have proposed or already passed across the country is threatening to not just halt that progress but significantly reverse it.",
            "Some of these proposals specifically targeted people with disabilities. Texas’ SB 7, a sweeping package of voting restrictions that the state Senate passed in April, initially would have required people to prove that they have a disability to vote by mail. A similar bill that passed the Texas House in early May didn’t go quite as far but, like the Senate legislation, originally sought to place new restrictions on people who assist voters who have disabilities before certain provisions were amended or removed from the bill at the last moment.",
            "But virtually all of the new voting restrictions, including the laws Georgia and Florida Republicans have enacted, will likely reduce people with disabilities’ access to the ballot, advocates say, because any voting restriction tends to have a disproportionate effect on voters with disabilities.",
            "“A lot of the more restrictive laws that we see proposed don’t directly mention people with disabilities,” said Michelle Bishop, who works on voting and election access policy at the National Disability Rights Network in Washington. “But whether or not people with disabilities are being targeted, they are living with the consequences.”",
            "About 13% of the U.S. population, or roughly 41 million people, identify as having a disability, according to the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. But the number of Americans with a disability is likely far higher because many elderly Americans with visual and physical issues, and others with chronic degenerative diseases, such as multiple sclerosis or rheumatoid arthritis, often don’t consider themselves as having a disability. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 61 million adults, or about 25% of the adult population, live with some sort of disability.",
            "Millions of voters, as a result, likely don’t realize that they are legally entitled to accommodations and assistance at polling sites and in elections, or that there are existing carve-outs in many election laws that allow people with disabilities to more easily vote by mail or use other options. Longer voting lines and tighter restrictions on alternative voting options are likely to make casting a ballot harder for them or even deter many from voting at all.",
            "Voting has always been harder for people with disabilities. In 2012, nearly one-third of voters with disabilities reported difficulties voting, according to a survey conducted by researchers at Rutgers and Syracuse universities. Turnout for the 2012 election was nearly 6% lower among voters with disabilities than among the general public, the equivalent of 3 million missing votes.",
            "“The Americans With Disabilities Act is 30 years old, and the majority of polling places in the United States are still not fully accessible, even for traditional in-person voting,” Bishop said. “We’ve made a lot of progress, but we just haven’t necessarily solved this issue yet.”",
            "During the pandemic, in the face of fears that voting would be unsafe and carry health risks, state and local election officials instituted a wide array of changes to make voting more accessible, including the broader adoption of no-excuse mail-in voting, curbside voting, ballot drop boxes, early voting and provisions that allow time for voters to fix errors made on absentee ballots. Many states also automatically sent mail-in ballots to registered voters, removing a step that required voters to fill out forms requesting such ballots.",
            "Just 18% of voters with disabilities reported difficulties last year, a steep drop from just eight years ago, a survey conducted by Lisa Schur and Douglas Kruse, the co-directors of Rutgers’ Program for Disability Research, found. Many of the gains came from improvements at in-person polling places, but the increased number of options certainly contributed to the progress: Three-quarters of voters with disabilities voted early or cast mail-in ballots last year, compared with roughly two-thirds of the general electorate. Among the voters with disabilities who voted by mail, nearly 16% used drop boxes. Just 5% of those who voted by mail reported any difficulties.",
            "“There isn’t one type of disability, so it’s not one-size-fits-all in terms of accessibility for people with disabilities,” Schur said. “What we found is most helpful is for people with disabilities to have a lot of different options. The more options, the better.”",
            "The pandemic-inspired increase in voting options was popular among the general public, polls have shown, but voters with disabilities appear to have enjoyed them even more: While half of voters with disabilities said they’d prefer to vote in person in future elections, 32% would like to keep voting absentee. By contrast, 60% of voters without disabilities would rather vote in person, and just 19% preferred mail-in ballots.",
            "And though advocates have for decades fought for voting changes specifically meant to benefit people with disabilities, the 2020 election bolstered another argument that they have made to policymakers for years: Making it easier for all voters to cast ballots can have an especially positive effect on voters with disabilities.",
            "“The best thing we can do in the world of elections is to offer as many options as possible for all voters,” Bishop said. “And then every method of voting needs to be fully accessible to people with disabilities as well.”",
            "But the reverse is also true: Any change that makes it harder for voters as a whole to cast ballots will inherently have an ever larger effect on people with disabilities. Black people, Latinos and Native Americans, who bear an unequal brunt of voting restrictions, are also all disproportionately likely to have disabilities, so any new limit on voting hits disabled members of those communities doubly hard. During the 2020 elections, Black voters with disabilities had to wait twice as long in line at in-person polling places as white voters with disabilities, the Rutgers survey found.",
            "Many states have sought to enshrine pandemic-driven changes into law for future elections, and lawmakers in Massachusetts, Montana and Virginia have all passed new laws specifically meant to improve accessibility for voters with disabilities. But Republican state legislatures across the country have taken aim at the most popular and beneficial pandemic-inspired reforms from 2020, a push fueled by the lie that voting by mail, curbside voting, drop boxes and other changes inspired widespread fraud that cost former President Donald Trump the election. (No such fraud occurred.)",
            "Republicans in the Texas Senate passed a bill in April that would ban drive-thru voting and bar local officials from mailing out request forms for absentee ballots unless they’re specifically requested each election. Texas is already one of the most restrictive states for voting; in order to acquire an absentee ballot, voters must be older than 65 or have a disability. The legislation originally would have changed the law to require that people requesting an absentee ballot provide written proof of their disability status, a reform GOP lawmakers argued is necessary because “folks claiming disability who do not in fact have a disability” are the biggest source of “mail ballot fraud,” as one Republican state senator told Spectrum News.",
            "Though there is one criminal case involving disability-related mail ballot fraud proceeding in Texas, there is “no hard evidence” that it is a widespread practice, said Jeffrey Miller, a policy specialist at Disability Rights Texas, which helps monitor an election-related hotline for voters with disabilities.",
            "The bill also would have initially required anyone who helps a voter fill out a ballot to attest to their relationship and why assistance was necessary on a separate form, out of apparent fears that such assistance is routinely used to “exploit” people with disabilities, another GOP lawmaker argued to Spectrum. The House passed a slightly different voting restriction bill that would not require proof of disability to obtain an absentee ballot but originally contained similar provisions on assistance. Failing to fill out the required assistance form would have carried criminal penalties, which, along with provisions that allow for increased numbers of poll watchers, could create “a chilling effect” for both voters with disabilities and the people who assist them, Miller said.",
            "Texas Republicans were, in effect, trying to fix an imaginary problem instead of taking aim at the issues voters with disabilities face at the polls each election. Most of the specific disability-related provisions were stripped from both bills before they passed, according to the Texas Tribune, although disability advocates like Miller worry they could resurface during a conference committee to reconcile the two pieces of legislation. But even without those provisions, other restrictions in the bills ― like its ban on drive-thru voting, a change Republicans are seeking largely because it was utilized last year in heavily Democratic Harris County, where Houston is located ― would also negatively affect voters with disabilities.",
            "“There are definitely going to be new barriers for voters with disabilities,” Miller said. “Both of these bills have lots of problems on their own and would definitely impact voters with disabilities just because they reduce options for people.”",
            "Other new laws, like those in Florida and Georgia, will have a similar effect, as GOP lawmakers seek to ban or limit curbside voting, roll back vote-by-mail programs, institute even tougher photo identification requirements and enact other restrictions, such as limits on third-party ballot submission.",
            "It’s too early, experts say, to predict how much of a burden these changes could have on voters with disabilities, especially compared with last year’s election. But curbside voting, drop boxes and mail-in ballots all provide options to in-person voting that improve access for people with mobility-related disabilities, while automatic voter registration or permanent vote-by-mail lists, like the one some Arizona Republicans wanted to eliminate, reduce burdens on voters with cognitive, visual, mental and physical disabilities by requiring them to go through the process of registering and obtaining ballots only once.",
            "People with disabilities are also less likely to drive, and thus less likely to have a driver’s license or other form of photo identification. Enhanced voter ID laws disproportionately affect their ability to vote, and place new barriers in front of them, especially because government facilities where IDs can be obtained are often difficult to access for many people with disabilities. Aggressive signature matching requirements on absentee ballots, meanwhile, are often more difficult to meet for people with disabilities, a problem exacerbated by many GOP lawmakers’ opposition to “ballot curing” processes that allow voters to fix problems that arise instead of having their ballots tossed out.",
            "“Something that might just be a nuisance for someone without a disability can really be a burden for someone with a disability,” Schur said.",
            "The 2020 election was far from perfect, and no single change made for it will, by itself, make elections fully equitable. People with disabilities were still more likely to report difficulties voting ― the number who had difficulties voting by mail was still more than twice as high as among those without disabilities, according to the Rutgers survey. Though it makes it easier for many voters to avoid problems that typically arise at polling places, absentee voting can be more difficult for people with visual and cognitive disabilities, so programs like vote-by-mail, as well as newer initiatives, like online registration and voting, still need improvements to make them fully accessible.",
            "Because most voters with disabilities would still like to vote in person, states and localities need to continue making polling places and voting machines more accessible. And election processes overall need to be designed and implemented with people with disabilities in mind, not merely “retrofitted” in a last-minute effort to accommodate them, Bishop said. And many of the technologies and practices meant to help people with disabilities ― like machines with larger text that are easier to read and use for people with visual impairments ― would also have major benefits for people without disabilities and people who do not identify as disabled, she said.",
            "For all its flaws, though, the bevy of voting options may have provided an even bigger boost for voters with disabilities than it did for voters overall. But instead of using last year’s election as a springboard for further progress, many Republican lawmakers across the country are going backward again.",
            "“We’ve spent the last 20 years fighting for more accessible voting systems and more accessible polling places,” Bishop said. “But I don’t know what good that does to someone who’s in line for several hours in the Georgia heat and no one’s allowed to give them water.”"

            "The Minneapolis suburb where police recently killed 20-year-old Daunte Wright has approved a package of proposals meant to begin making changes to public safety and violence prevention in the city.",
            "The Brooklyn Center City Council voted 4-1 on Saturday to pass a resolution called the Daunte Wright and Kobe Dimock-Heisler Community Safety & Violence Prevention Act. Mayor Mike Elliott introduced the resolution last week, naming it after two men who abruptly died at the hands of police ― one of whom was killed just last month.",
            "“This will transform public safety in our city, honoring two young men who were robbed of their futures,” Elliott tweeted. “This is just the first step in a long road ahead ― but that is work that we as a city are ready to do with our community. There will be lots of questions to answer, lots of learning, and lots of opportunity for the community to be at the center of this change.”",
            "The resolution does not make any immediate sweeping changes, but rather gives the city a road map to overhaul its policing system. It creates an oversight office that would monitor the city’s police, fire and two new city departments ― Traffic Enforcement and Community Response.",
            "The Traffic Enforcement Department will be made of unarmed civilians responsible for non-moving traffic violations, while the Community Response Department will consist of trained medical, social work and mental health professionals for incidents where a resident is experiencing a medical, mental health or other behavioral or social need.",
            "By passing the package of proposals, the City Council also commited to creating a committee mostly made up of residents who have been arrested, detained or incarcerated before. The committee would review city safety data and make recommendations on how to modify or launch programs to improve community safety and prevent violence. This will allow such a committee to look at criminal codes and recommend decriminalizing or completely repealing certain offenses, as well as have a say in police’s response to protests and the the police union’s contract with the city.",
            "The resolution also limits instances in which police can arrest people, and requires more de-escalation tactics before using deadly force. Offices will be required to issue citations by mail for traffic violations, non-felony offenses and non-felony warrants.",
            "“It is time,” said councilmember Marquita Butler, who, along with Elliott and colleagues April Graves and Dan Ryan, voted to pass the resolution, according to the Star Tribune.",
            "“We’ve been talking about these reforms for quite a while, more specifically since last June, after the death of George Floyd,” Butler said. “And we didn’t have as much urgency around it as we probably should have.”",
            "Then-Brooklyn Center Officer Kim Potter shot and killed Wright on April 11 after he was pulled over for a non-moving traffic violation. Body camera footage shows Potter drawing her service weapon while repeatedly yelling “Taser!” before fatally shooting Wright. Since then, Potter, the police chief and the city manager have all left their posts. Potter is charged with second-degree manslaughter, and her killing Wright reignited protests against police brutality and backlash against low-level traffic stops that disproportionately impact Black drivers and other people of color.",
            "In 2019, Brooklyn Center police shot and killed Kobe Dimock-Heisler, who had a mental illness and was on the autism spectrum. The 21-year-old’s grandfather made a mental health call to police after fearing that Dimock-Heisler might hurt himself when he grabbed a knife, but then tried to reverse the call after saying the situation was resolved, according to KARE-11.",
            "Police arrived anyway, and while their body cameras were off as they interrogated ― and likely agitated ― Dimock-Heisler, footage shows them trying to shock the crying young man and then repeatedly shooting at him when he runs toward his grandmother. Police were not charged in the incident.",
            "Dozens of people reportedly spoke at the council meeting, including the families of the young men who were killed. Daunte Wright’s mother, Katie Wright, said that she believes her son would still be alive if the resolution that passed had existed earlier, according to The Associated Press.",
            "Police groups and unions have raised concerns about the resolution, saying it will put public safety at risk. But the American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota said that the resolution is a move toward alternatives to traditional policing that has too often harmed people of color.",
            "“I am so proud of Brooklyn Center for remaking their public safety system,” Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) tweeted. “This gives [a] roadmap to other cities across the country on necessary steps towards creating a more just system.”"

            "GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli airstrikes on Gaza City flattened three buildings and killed at least 42 people Sunday, Palestinian medics said, in the deadliest single attack in the latest round of violence. Despite the toll and international efforts to broker a cease-fire, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signaled the fourth war with Gaza’s Hamas rulers would rage on.",
            "In a televised address, Netanyahu said the attacks were continuing at “full-force” and will “take time.“ Israel “wants to levy a heavy price” on the Hamas militant group, he said, flanked by his defense minister and political rival, Benny Gantz, in a show of unity.",
            "Hamas also pressed on, launching rockets from civilian areas in Gaza toward civilian areas in Israel. One slammed into a synagogue in the southern city of Ashkelon hours before evening services for the Jewish holiday of Shavuot, Israeli emergency services said. No injuries were reported.",
            "In the Israeli air assault early Sunday, families were buried under piles of cement rubble and twisted rebar. A yellow canary lay crushed on the ground. Shards of glass and debris covered streets blocks away from the major downtown thoroughfare where the three buildings were hit over the course of five minutes around 1 a.m.",
            "The hostilities have repeatedly escalated over the past week, marking the worst fighting in the territory that is home to 2 million Palestinians since Israel and Hamas’ devastating 2014 war.",
            "“I have not seen this level of destruction through my 14 years of work,” said Samir al-Khatib an emergency rescue official in Gaza. “Not even in the 2014 war.”",
            "Rescuers furiously dug through the rubble using excavators and bulldozers amid clouds of heavy dust. One shouted “Can you hear me?” into a hole. “Are you OK?” he asked. Minutes later, first responders pulled a survivor out. The Gaza Health Ministry said 16 women and 10 children were among those killed, with more than 50 people wounded.",
            "Haya Abdelal, 21, lives in a building next to one that was destroyed and said she was sleeping when the airstrikes sent her fleeing into the street. She accused Israel of not giving its usual warning to residents to flee before launching such an attack.",
            "“We are tired,” she said, “We need a truce. We can’t bear it anymore.”",
            "The Israeli army spokesperson’s office said the strike targeted Hamas “underground military infrastructure.” As a result of the strike, “the underground facility collapsed, causing the foundation of the civilian houses above them to collapse as well, leading to unintended casualties.”",
            "Among those reported killed was Dr. Ayman Abu Al-Ouf, the head of the internal medicine department at Shifa Hospital and a senior member of the hospital’s coronavirus management committee. Two of Abu Al-Ouf’s teenage children and two other family members were also buried under the rubble of their home.",

            "Gaza’s health care system, already gutted by an Israeli and Egyptian blockade imposed after Hamas seized power from rival Palestinian forces in 2007, had been struggling with a surge in coronavirus infections even before the latest conflict.",
            "Israel’s airstrikes have leveled a number of Gaza City’s tallest office and residential buildings, alleging they contain Hamas military infrastructure. Among them was the building housing The Associated Press office and those of other media outlets.",

            "Asked if he had provided any evidence of Hamas’ presence in the building in a call Saturday with U.S. President Joe Biden, Netanyahu said, “we pass it through our intelligence people.”",
            "Buzbee called for any such evidence to be laid out.",

            "The AP has operated from the building for 15 years, including through three previous wars between Israel and Hamas. The news agency’s cameras, operating from its top floor office and roof terrace, offered 24-hour live shots as militants’ rockets arched toward Israel and Israeli airstrikes hammered the city and its surroundings.",
            "“We think it’s appropriate at this point for there to be an independent look at what happened yesterday — an independent investigation,” Buzbee said.",
            "The latest outbreak of violence began in east Jerusalem last month, when Palestinians clashed with police in response to Israeli police tactics during Ramadan and the threatened eviction of dozens of Palestinian families by Jewish settlers. A focus of the clashes was the Al-Aqsa Mosque, a frequent flashpoint located on a hilltop compound revered by both Muslims and Jews.",
            "Hamas began firing rockets toward Jerusalem on Monday, triggering the Israeli assault on Gaza.",
            "At least 188 Palestinians have been killed in the hundreds of airstrikes in Gaza, including 55 children and 33 women, with 1,230 people wounded. Eight people in Israel have been killed in some of the 3,100 rocket attacks launched from Gaza, including a 5-year-old boy and a soldier.",
            "Hamas and the Islamic Jihad militant group have acknowledged 20 fighters killed in the fighting. Israel says the real number is far higher and has released the names and photos of two dozen alleged operatives it says were “eliminated.”",
            "The assault has displaced some 34,000 Palestinians from their homes, U.N. Mideast envoy Tor Wennesland told the Security Council on Sunday.",

            "On Sunday, a driver rammed into an Israeli checkpoint in the east Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah — where the Palestinian families had been threatened with eviction — injuring six officers before police shot and killed the attacker, Israeli police said.",
            "The violence also sparked pro-Palestinian protests in cities across Europe and the United States.",
            "Israel appears to have stepped up strikes in recent days to inflict as much damage as possible on Hamas as international mediators work to end the fighting and stave off an Israeli ground invasion in Gaza.",
            "The Israeli military said it destroyed the home Sunday of Gaza’s top Hamas leader, Yahiyeh Sinwar, in the southern town of Khan Younis. It was the third such attack in the last two days on the homes of senior Hamas leaders, who have gone underground.",
            "Egypt and the U.S. were involved in cease-fire efforts, but it wasn’t clear if they were making progress, in light of Netanyahu’ statement that the campaign is continuing. The U.N. Security Council was also meeting Sunday, and Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for an end to the “senseless cycle of bloodshed, terror and destruction.”",

            "When he arrived on the set of “High School Musical: The Musical: The Series” to film the show’s second season last year, Joshua Bassett felt determined to send “laughter, joy and relief” to viewers grappling with pandemic fatigue.",
            "It’s safe to say he and his cast mates have delivered. For Season 2, “High School Musical: The Musical: The Series” has upped the ante both visually and dramatically. The Disney+ series — which puts a mockumentary twist on 2006’s “High School Musical,” which starred Zac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens — follows a group of young thespians at Utah’s fictional East High School.",
            "This time around, the teen troupe is at work on a production of Disney’s “Beauty and the Beast,” though that tale as old as time can’t compare to the behind-the-scenes drama taking place on the show. Offstage romances abound, most notably between skateboarder-turned-leading man Ricky Bowen (played by Bassett) and theater devotee Nini Salazar-Roberts (Olivia Rodrigo).",
            "“In Season 1, Ricky did a lot of running away from his problems, and I think in Season 2, he’s really trying to face his fears,” Bassett, 20, told HuffPost. “Even though he’s trying his best, he falls on his face, but really does have the best intentions. He’s still a teenage boy who’s figuring this whole high school thing out.”",
            "The choice of “Beauty and the Beast,” meanwhile, turned out to be a full-circle moment for the actor, who played Chip in a community production when he was 11. (Spoiler alert: In the first three episodes screened for press, his role this time around will involve a giant fur wig.) “That show has a special place in my heart,” he said. “So I’m super stoked to bring those songs back and do them in our own ‘HSM’ way.”",
            "By all accounts, “High School Musical: The Musical: The Series” has been a star-making vehicle for Bassett, who made his television acting debut in Fox’s short-lived “Lethal Weapon” series in 2017. The Oceanside, California, native has spent the first half of 2021 amid a frenzy of media scrutiny after Rodrigo released her smash single, “Drivers License,” in January.",
            "Many fans interpreted the song as an ode to a real-life, behind-the-scenes romance between her and Bassett, and their subsequent breakup. (Rodrigo’s subsequent singles, “Deja Vu” and the just-released “Good 4 U,” also allude to heartbreak and have kept the TikTok crowd buzzing.)",
            "And earlier this week, Bassett — who has been romantically linked with “Girl Meets World” actor Sabrina Carpenter — went viral after he gushed over “hot” Harry Styles in an interview with Clevver News that he deemed “my coming out video.”",
            "On Tuesday, he posted a note to his social media platforms clarifying his remarks somewhat but notably did not label his sexuality. “It’s OK to still be figuring out who you are,” he said at the time.",
            "Fortunately, Bassett doesn’t seem fazed by the attention. “People are going to have their opinions on who Ricky and Nini should be with,” he said. “It starts to bleed into real life, and people make assumptions about what they want to happen. I can’t take it personally, because it’s not founded in truth. Most people are making theories up. They’re just not informed.”",
            "Fans seeking insight into his life, he said, would be best served by checking out his new music. In March, he released his six-song debut EP, and last week, he showcased his musical versatility with the anthemic, made-for-summer single, “Feel Something.”",
            "“Music has always been fundamental to who I am,” he said. “It’s cool to go from playing Ricky to making honest songs from my perspective and get into the part of my life that’s emotional and difficult. When you’re writing music, you have a chance to really say something. It’s forced me to grow in a lot of ways. I’m really not afraid to throw paint at the wall and try a bunch of new things.”",
            "And, of course, there’s Season 2 of “High School Musical: The Musical: The Series,” which Bassett hopes will resonate with those who’ve experienced a “perspective shifter” of a year amid the COVID-19 crisis.",
            "“I’m thankful to have this group of people and the foundation we have as a family,” he said when asked about the challenges of filming in a pandemic. “We had each other and had to push through and make some sacrifices, but it was worth it because of how special the show is, how special our family is.”",
            "“This season is about what really matters outside of competition and education at the end of the day,” he added. “That’s family, the people you love and who you really are, who you choose to be every single day.”",
            "New episodes of “High School Musical: The Musical: The Series” premiere Fridays on Disney +."

            "GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israel slammed the Gaza Strip with airstrikes, in a dramatic escalation that included bombing the home of a senior Hamas leader, killing a family of 10 in a refugee camp — most of them children — and pulverizing a high-rise that housed The Associated Press and other media.",
            "The Hamas militant group continued a stream of rocket volleys into Israel, including a late-night barrage on Tel Aviv. One man was killed Saturday when a rocket hit his home in a suburb of the seaside metropolis.",
            "With a U.S. envoy on the ground, calls increased for a cease-fire after five days of mayhem that have left at least 145 Palestinians dead in Gaza — including 41 children and 23 women — and eight dead on the Israeli side, all but one of them civilians, including a 5-year-old. President Joe Biden, who has called for a de-escalation but has backed Israel’s campaign, spoke separately by phone with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.",
            "Still, Israel stepped up its assault, vowing to shatter the capabilities of Gaza’s Hamas rulers. The week of deadly violence, set off by a Hamas rocket Monday, came after weeks of mounting tensions and heavy-handed Israeli measures in contested Jerusalem.",
            "Early Sunday, Israeli warplanes struck several buildings and roads in a vital part of Gaza City. Photos circulated by residents and journalists showed the airstrikes created a crater that blocked one of the main roads leading to Shifa, the largest hospital in the strip.",
            "The Health Ministry said the latest airstrikes left at least two dead and 25 wounded, including children and women. There has been no immediate comment from the Israeli military.",
            "On Saturday, Israel bombed the home of Khalil al-Hayeh, a senior figure in Hamas’ political branch, saying the building served as part of the group’s “terrorist infrastructure.” There was no immediate report on al-Hayeh’s fate or on any casualties.",
            "The bombing of al-Hayeh’s home showed Israel was expanding its campaign beyond just the group’s military commanders. Israel says it has killed dozens in Hamas’ military branch, though Hamas and the smaller group Islamic Jihad have only acknowledged 20 dead members.",
            "Since the conflict began, Israel has leveled a number of Gaza City’s tallest office and residential buildings, alleging they house elements of the Hamas military infrastructure. On Saturday, it turned to the 12-story al-Jalaa Building, where the offices of the AP, the TV network Al-Jazeera and other media outlets are located, along with several floors of apartments.",
            "“The campaign will continue as long as it is required,” Netanyahu said in a televised speech on Saturday evening. He alleged that Hamas military intelligence was operating inside the building. Israel routinely cites a Hamas presence as a reason for targeting certain locations in airstrikes, including residential buildings. The military also has accused the militant group of using journalists as human shields, but provided no evidence to back up the claims.",
            "The AP has operated from the building for 15 years, including through three previous wars between Israel and Hamas, without being targeted directly. During those conflicts as well as the current one, the news agency’s cameras from its top floor office and roof terrace offered 24-hour live shots as militants’ rockets arched toward Israel and Israeli airstrikes hammered the city and its surroundings.",
            "In the afternoon, the military called the building’s owner and warned a strike would come within an hour. AP staffers and other occupants evacuated safely.",
            "Soon after, three missiles hit the building and destroyed it, bringing it crashing down in a giant cloud of dust.",
            "“The world will know less about what is happening in Gaza because of what happened today,” AP President and CEO Gary Pruitt said in a statement. “We are shocked and horrified that the Israeli military would target and destroy the building housing AP’s bureau and other news organizations in Gaza.”",
            "“This is an incredibly disturbing development. We narrowly avoided a terrible loss of life,” he said, adding that the AP was seeking information from the Israeli government and was engaged with the U.S. State Department to learn more.",
            "Mostefa Souag, acting director-general of Al-Jazeera Media Network, called the strike a “war crime” aiming to “silence the media and to hide the untold carnage and suffering of the people of Gaza.”",
            "Later in the day, White House press secretary Jen Psaki tweeted that the U.S. had “communicated directly to the Israelis that ensuring the safety and security of journalists and independent media is a paramount responsibility.”",
            "In the early hours Saturday, another airstrike hit an apartment building in Gaza City’s densely populated Shati refugee camp, killing two women and eight children.",
            "Mohammed Hadidi told reporters that his wife and her brother’s wife had gathered at the house with their children to celebrate the Eid al-Fitr holiday ending the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. The only survivor was Hadidi’s 5-month-old son, Omar.",
            "The blast left the children’s bedroom covered in rubble and smashed the salon. Amid the wreckage were children’s toys, a Monopoly board game and, sitting on the kitchen counter, unfinished plates of food from the holiday gathering.",
            "“There was no warning ... You filmed people eating and then you bombed them?” a neighbor, Jamal Al-Naji, said, referring to Israel’s surveillance over the Gaza Strip.",
            "The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
            "In his call with Netanyahu, Biden expressed his “strong support” for Israel’s campaign but raised concern about civilian casualties and protection of journalists, the White House said.",
            "U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin tweeted Saturday that he had spoken again with Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz and reaffirmed Israel’s right to defend itself and condemned “Hamas’ deliberate targeting of Israeli citizens.” Austin added: “I also expressed my hope that calm can be restored soon.”",
            "The bombings took place a day after U.S. diplomat Hady Amr arrived in Israel as part of Washington’s efforts to de-escalate the conflict. Israel turned down an Egyptian proposal for a one-year truce that Hamas rulers had accepted, an Egyptian intelligence official said Friday on condition of anonymity to discuss the negotiations.",
            "Mediators from Egypt, which works closely with Israel on security issues and shares a border with the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip, appeared to be growing alarmed. The intelligence official said Egypt hopes the U.S. intervention could halt the Israeli assault. The U.N. Security Council was set to meet Sunday.",
            "The tensions began in east Jerusalem earlier this month, when Palestinians protested attempts by settlers to forcibly evict a number of Palestinian families from their homes and Israeli police measures at Al-Aqsa Mosque, a frequent flashpoint located on a mount in the Old City revered by Muslims and Jews.",
            "Hamas fired rockets toward Jerusalem late Monday, triggering the Israeli assault on Gaza. Since then, Hamas has fired more than 2,000 rockets, though most have either fallen short or been intercepted by anti-missile defenses. Israel’s warplanes and artillery have struck hundreds of targets around blockaded Gaza, where some 2 million Palestinians live.",
            "The turmoil has also spilled over elsewhere, fueling protests in the occupied West Bank and stoking violence within Israel between its Jewish and Arab citizens, with clashes and vigilante attacks on people and property.",
            "Palestinians on Saturday marked the Day of al-Nakba, or “the Catastrophe,” commemorating the estimated 700,000 people who were expelled from or fled their homes in what was now Israel during the 1948 war surrounding its creation. Thousands of Arab Israelis marched in a Nakba rally in the northern Israeli city of Sukhnin, and scattered protests took place in the West Bank.",

            "An unprecedented wave of Black candidates are running in statewide Democratic primaries throughout the country, providing a political test for Democrats’ party-wide commitment to racial equality heading into the 2022 midterms.",
            "Black candidates have emerged as major contenders for the Democratic nomination in the party’s three best opportunities to pick up Senate seats in 2022, and in four of the party’s best chances to flip Republican-held gubernatorial mansions. As the party heads into a midterm election where history suggests they will struggle, Black candidates could end up leading the party’s ticket in both diversifying Sun Belt states and Midwestern battlegrounds.",
            "A paltry number of Black candidates have won statewide elections. Just two Black men, and no Black women, have ever won gubernatorial elections in the United States ― Deval Patrick in Massachusetts and Doug Wilder in Virginia. Only seven Black people have won election to the U.S. Senate since the end of Reconstruction more than 150 years ago.",
            "But the Democratic Party’s full-scale rhetorical embrace of racial justice following the murder of George Floyd at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer last year, along with recent victories for candidates like Sen. Raphael Warnock (Ga.) and Rep. Lauren Underwood (Ill.), has spurred Black candidates to step forward.",
            "“The reckoning we’ve had over systemic racism and 400 years of American history has prompted a lot of people who might not otherwise have thought to run for statewide office to do so,” said John King, who was education secretary for the last two years of the Obama administration and is running for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in Maryland. “This is a long overdue correction to the historic underrepresentation of Black officials at the state level.”",
            "The trend is strong enough that some races are now seeing multiple Black candidates, leading to fears that candidates could split the vote. In other cases, Black candidates are testing both establishment and progressive groups’ commitments to racial justice, challenging white candidates with better track records on traditional measures of electability.",
            "And those candidates are introducing themselves to a Democratic Party apparatus that’s far less skeptical about the electoral viability of Black candidates than even a few years ago.",
            "“We’re in a moment where people fundamentally believe Black candidates can win statewide races,” said Adrianne Shropshire, the executive director of BlackPAC. “We’re in an era of uncertainty, and when there’s uncertainty, people are open to different options.”",
            "State Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta, who is running for Senate in Pennsylvania, said the idea that a Black candidate couldn’t win statewide there has very little traction among the party faithful.",
            "“The only folks saying that are the ones going off the record because they support another candidate,” Kenyatta said.",
            "The strength of this year’s group of Black candidates has already played a role in prompting the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee to adopt a more deliberative approach to endorsements, according to two Democratic sources who have discussed the matter with committee officials.",
            "While the committee is not ruling out endorsing candidates in Democratic primaries, it’s likely to give races this cycle more time to develop than it has in the past. Critics have long accused the committee of endorsing front-running candidates too early, arguing the committee is effectively shutting down races before they begin.",
            "“There’s going to be a very different take from the DSCC and others about going in and putting their finger on the scale this cycle,” Shropshire said. “That impacts people’s ability to raise money.”",
            "The party committee’s decision to endorse two white candidates in Texas and Kentucky last cycle, for instance, may have tipped the scales against Black candidates in both states. (One of those candidates, Kentucky’s Charles Booker, narrowly lost to Amy McGrath. He’s expected to run for Senate again in 2022 against incumbent Republican Sen. Rand Paul.)",
            "“At this stage we are carefully assessing the candidate fields, keeping open lines of communication with candidates and working to build the infrastructure we’ll need to win the general election,” DSCC spokesperson David Bergstein told HuffPost.",
            "This cycle, Democrats could nominate Black candidates for GOP-held seats in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and North Carolina ― the three states broadly seen as their best chances to gain ground in a Senate that is now evenly split.",
            "Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes is expected to run in Wisconsin, while Kenyatta and state Sen. Sharif Street have both launched campaigns in Pennsylvania. In North Carolina, former state Supreme Court Chief Justice Cheri Beasley and former state Sen. Erica Smith are each campaigning.",
            "The latter two races show how the emergence of additional Black candidates is creating political quandaries for some Democratic groups. In Pennsylvania, two progressive groups, the Working Families Party and Democracy for America, have endorsed Kenyatta, to the annoyance of supporters of Lt. Gov. John Fetterman.",
            "Both Kenyatta and Fetterman are broadly considered progressives, and could find themselves competing for liberal votes in a primary that could see multiple well-funded candidates. Kenyatta, who is just 30 years old, pitches himself as having authentic working-class experience that Fetterman lacks.",
            "“I learned very early on the economy wasn’t set up for families like mine. Being a working person is not about how you dress, it’s about what you’ve been through,” Kenyatta said ― a not-so-subtle shot at Fetterman, who is known for forgoing ties and stands out for his many tattoos and his 6-foot-8-inch frame.",
            "Kenyatta and his allies have already begun aggressively attacking Fetterman for an incident where he detained a Black jogger while holding a shotgun in 2013. Fetterman has repeatedly denied that race played any role in the incident.",
            "Fetterman’s allies argue that his national fundraising base and his history of winning statewide make him progressives’ best chance in years to win a swing-state Senate seat. In the first quarter of 2021, he was able to raise $4 million. Kenyatta brought in less than $400,000, according to Federal Election Commission records.",
            "“At the end of the day, the progressive movement needs victories,” said Sean McElwee, a progressive strategist who supports Fetterman. “For the first time in recent Senate primary history, a progressive is entering the race with establishment levels of name ID and fundraising capabilities. I don’t think progressives should turn that away.”",
            "In North Carolina, where two Black women appear set to share the ballot, both EMILY’s List, which backs Democratic women who support abortion rights, and Collective PAC, which supports Black candidates, have endorsed Beasley over Smith.",
            "Smith was on the ballot in 2020, but gained little traction and raised little money in a primary race against the DSCC-endorsed Cal Cunningham. (Most of her monetary support actually came from a super PAC funded by allies of GOP Sen. Mitch McConnell, who believed she would be an easier opponent to defeat in the general election.) Collective PAC said Beasley’s past successes, winning statewide multiple times before losing narrowly in 2020, meant she merited the endorsement.",
            "“It’s a new problem for us,” said Quentin James, the founder of Collective PAC, referring to choosing between multiple Black candidates in key races. “When we launched in 2016, we were scrambling for Black candidates to run. Period.”",
            "The problem may not be isolated to North Carolina. The Maryland gubernatorial primary, likely the party’s best chance to pick up a governor’s seat, could see three or more Black candidates. King, former Prince George’s County Executive Rushern Baker, author and nonprofit executive Wes Moore and current Prince George’s County Executive Angela Alsobrooks could all run.",
            "“If we aren’t careful, if we aren’t strategic, then that narrative of us splitting the Black vote could become more and more common,” said James, pointing to this year’s Virginia gubernatorial race, where three Black candidates have struggled to gain traction against former Gov. Terry McAuliffe in the state’s Democratic primary.",
            "And the structural barriers to Black candidates’ success have obviously not disappeared. In Florida, Rep. Charlie Crist, a former governor and Republican-turned-Democrat, has already announced a bid to challenge GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis.",
            "Some Democrats worry that Crist’s name-identification advantage ― he’s previously run statewide three times, and Florida is notoriously expensive to campaign in ― will give him a leg up over Rep. Val Demings, a Black former Orlando police chief who is expected to announce her own gubernatorial bid.",
            "“She’s a rising star in Democratic politics,” James said. “It’s really important that the party, and everyone in the progressive movement, show their values.”",
            "The highest-profile Black candidates are almost certain to be in Georgia, where Sen. Warnock has to run for reelection and former state lawmaker Stacey Abrams is set for a rematch with GOP Gov. Brian Kemp. In Massachusetts, where Democrats are hoping GOP Gov. Charlie Baker retires, Harvard Professor Danielle Allen has already announced a campaign.",
            "While the overwhelming majority of Black Americans support Democrats, Republicans are also likely to see a number of Black candidates running for statewide office. Vernon Jones ― a former Georgia state representative who switched parties after endorsing then-President Donald Trump for reelection ― is challenging Kemp in a primary. In Georgia’s Senate race, businessman Kelvin King has already announced a run, and Trump has encouraged former University of Georgia football legend Herschel Walker to do the same.",
            "In Michigan, former Detroit police Chief James Craig and former Senate candidate John James are both weighing challenges to Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.",
            "Republicans made small gains with Black voters in 2020, a trend Democrats are hoping to reverse. But their bigger immediate concern may be preventing the drop-off in Black and young voter turnout that doomed the party during the 2010 and 2014 midterms. The desire to avoid those Obama-era shortfalls has given Black candidates a chance to pitch themselves as electable.",
            "“The real question is who can bring the band back together,” Kenyatta said, referring to the coalition that lifted President Joe Biden to victory around the country. “When Black folks are on the ballot, more Black people vote. When young people are on the ballot, more young people vote.”"

            "As Israel bombarded the Gaza Strip in response to rockets fired by the Palestinian militant group Hamas on Thursday night, Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a Detroit Democrat and Congress’ only Palestinian American, delivered a tearful appeal on the House floor for solidarity with Palestinians living under Israeli military occupation.",
            "“Help me understand the math: How many Palestinians have to die for their lives to matter?” Tlaib asked while wearing a traditional Palestinian “keffiyeh” scarf around her neck. “Life under apartheid strips Palestinians of human dignity.”",
            "Democratic Reps. Mark Pocan (Wis.), Ayanna Pressley (Mass.), Ilhan Omar (Minn.), Betty McCollum (Minn.), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.), Cori Bush (Mo.), André Carson (Ind.), Jesús “Chuy” Garcia (Ill.), Joaquin Castro (Texas) and Jan Schakowsky (Ill.) all joined Tlaib in delivering critical remarks over the course of what may have been Congress’ first-ever hour of Palestine solidarity speeches.",
            "This group of 12 lawmakers ― Rep. Marie Newman (Ill.) also co-sponsored the speeches in absentia ― made a point, at times, of objecting to Palestinian militant groups’ targeting of Israeli civilians.",
            "But their chief diversion from traditionally bipartisan, pro-Israel orthodoxy was that the United States must use its power as Israel’s chief benefactor to stop, to the extent possible, disproportionate retaliation by Israeli forces and encourage an end to the ethnocratic occupation of territory captured in 1967. Omar, never one to mince words, dubbed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a “far right ethno-nationalist.”",
            "The pro-Palestinian speeches ― and a series of other statements, bills and other efforts to shape policy ― reflect a growing sympathy for the Palestinian cause among Americans in general, and Democrats in particular, that is finally manifesting on Capitol Hill.",
            "The changes are not yet transformative. Proponents of unconditional support for Israeli government policy continue to call the shots. The prospect of a U.S. president or Congress willing to even threaten the withholding of the financial or diplomatic aid to Israel in the interest of curbing the growth of settlement in the occupied Palestinian territories, or other practices that violate international law, remains a dim fantasy.",
            "But there is a growing bloc of pro-Palestinian dissenters in Congress that marks a tidal shift from just a few years ago, advocates for Palestinian freedom say.",
            "“There is a far stronger cohort of Democrats in the House and the Senate making statements that have not been made in the past. And that’s noticeable,” said James Zogby, founder and president of the Arab American Institute. “It’s reflective of the shifting demographics within the party, and shifting attitudes within the party.”",
            "Perhaps no lawmaker more embodies that shift than Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). In Aug. 2014, Warren shocked many progressives with her impassioned defense of Israeli bombardments of Gaza, including the targeting of schools and hospitals, on the grounds that Palestinian militants used those sites to launch attacks. The position put her to the right of then-President Barack Obama’s administration, which said it was “appalled” by the Israeli bombing of a United Nations school in Gaza.",
            "Warren also expressed skepticism of the idea of imposing tougher conditions on U.S. aid to Israel to get it to change its policies.",
            "Nearly seven years later, Warren has undergone an about-face. In late April, she expressed openness to restricting military aid to Israel as a way to bring about a two-state solution, calling it “irresponsible not to consider all of the tools we have at our disposal.” A few weeks later, she was one of just a handful of members of Congress to forthrightly condemn the Israeli government’s expulsion of Palestinian families from their homes in the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah.",
            "Meanwhile, in Congress, efforts to condition aid to Israel are picking up steam, however modestly. Newman, a freshman progressive lawmaker who ousted a more conservative Democrat with help from Chicago’s Arab American and Muslim community, spearheaded a letter with 24 co-signers calling for Biden to pressure Israel to halt the evictions in Sheikh Jarrah that helped set off the current round of violence. (More than 100 prominent progressive groups, including MoveOn and the Arab American Institute, have sent a similar letter to Biden.)",
            "And McCollum has once again introduced a bill that would “ensure that United States taxpayer funds are not used by the Government of Israel to support the military detention of Palestinian children, the unlawful seizure, appropriation, and destruction of Palestinian property and forcible transfer of civilians in the West Bank, or further annexation of Palestinian land in violation of international law.” The bill has 19 co-sponsors; Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) signed on to it on Wednesday.",
            "In late April, about three-quarters of the House, including a majority of Democrats, signed a letter promoted by the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) reiterating their belief that the United States’ annual $3.8-billion aid to Israel should remain unconditional.",
            "Still, some pro-Palestinian advocates took heart in the fact that more than 75 Democrats refused to sign the letter, which likely would not have been the case in the past.",
            "And in light of recent events, Zogby ventured, “You would not get that same number of signatures on that AIPAC sign-on letter today.”",
            "Progressive Middle East experts believe that a number of factors explain the small but growing faction of unabashed Israel critics in Congress.",
            "Perhaps the biggest reason is the dramatic rightward shift of Israeli politics under the 12-year premiership of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.",
            "Netanyahu’s disavowal of a two-state solution and efforts to capitalize on racism toward the country’s minority of Arab citizens during a 2015 reelection campaign prompted criticism from some Democratic lawmakers. The prime minister’s decision, a few months later, to thumb his nose at Obama by delivering a speech to Congress opposing the Iran nuclear agreement in 2015 was a key turning point that bothers many Democrats to this day.",
            "And Netanyahu’s strong partnership with President Donald Trump only cemented his status as a right-wing bogeyman whom liberals could feel comfortable denouncing as “racist” without fear of major political blowback.",
            "What’s more, Netanyahu’s hold on power reflects a broader reactionary turn in Israeli politics that makes it harder for the Israeli government to sell Americans on the country’s status as an LGBTQ- and vegan-friendly oasis of liberalism.",
            "For example, in 1988, the Israeli Knesset banned the political party of far-right extremist Rabbi Meir Kahane based on an Israeli law prohibiting explicitly racist parties.",
            "Now some of Kahane’s followers not only hold seats in the Knesset but are poised to serve in Netanyahu’s next governing coalition. Young Jewish supremacists aligned with Kahane were also leading the charge to expel Palestinians in Sheikh Jarrah and later to terrorize Palestinian citizens in cities near Tel Aviv.",
            "“The face of Israeli politics has become increasingly, brazenly racist,” said Yousef Munayyer, a Palestinian activist in Washington who was born in the ethnically mixed Israeli city of Lod. “The whole Israeli political spectrum is dominated by the right now.”",
            "The changing political winds in Israel have made it easier for the American public to see what many Palestinians say was the reality all along: That Israel’s occupation of the Palestinian territories and discrimination against Arab citizens contradict American values of freedom, equality and individual rights regardless of race and background.",
            "Since so much of the Israeli government’s argument relies on painting the two nations’ bond as emerging from a shared set of liberal, democratic values, the deterioration of Israel’s image as a liberal bastion has had political consequences.",
            "“The myth of shared values is coming to an end,” Munayyer said.",
            "At the same time, a nascent left wing in America energized in recent years by the presidential candidacy of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and the Black Lives Matter movement has mobilized to show that pro-Palestinian voters are also a constituency capable of wielding influence.",
            "In particular, the emergence of a vocal and organized community of Jewish Israel critics, ranging from the moderate group J Street to more radical factions, like IfNotNow and Jewish Voices for Peace, has created space for Arab Americans and other non-Jews to criticize the Israeli government with less fear of being brand an antisemite, according to Zogby.",
            "“If it weren’t for young, Jewish progressives … we would be in a very different place right now,” Zogby said.",
            "Sanders, a secular Jew who spent time on an Israeli kibbutz as a young man, has spoken with equal passion about his pride in being Jewish and his support for Palestinian rights and statehood. He surprised many observers with his pointed criticism of the Israeli government during a presidential primary debate with Hillary Clinton in Brooklyn in 2016, and remains one of Congress’ leading voices for a more even-handed U.S. approach in the region.",
            "Of course, the Democrats whose views on Israel-Palestine matter most remain much more conservative.",
            "President Joe Biden’s White House, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) all still embrace the Israeli government’s narrative that its conduct is exclusively that of an ordinary, liberal nation-state defending its citizens from terrorism.",
            "And before the pro-Palestinian group of Democrats spoke on the House floor on Thursday, a different bloc of more moderate Democrats delivered speeches fiercely defending Israel’s conduct.",
            "There are signs of wavering confidence in the pro-Israel wing of the party, however.",
            "Playing its usual role as a diplomatic shield for Israel, the U.S. government has sought to block a United Nations security council statement on the escalating violence in Israel and Gaza. Under pressure, it nonetheless agreed to a security council meeting about the conflict this Sunday.",
            "And on Monday, State Department spokesperson Ned Price appeared flustered when asked to defend the Israeli military’s killing of Palestinian children in airstrikes.",
            "“I understand we don’t have independent confirmation of facts on the ground yet, so I’m very hesitant to get into reports that are just emerging,” he replied with evident discomfort. “Obviously, the deaths of civilians, be they Israeli or Palestinians, are something we would take very seriously.”",
            "Right-leaning pro-Israel advocates have correctly identified bipartisan support for Israel as a key bulwark against tighter conditions on U.S. aid to Israel and other deviations from the blanket-level U.S. support that these advocates see as essential to Israel’s security.",
            "Faced with the prospect of more strident Israel critics gaining even a toehold within the Democratic Party, pro-Israel donors across the country have scrambled to intervene against left-leaning Democrats in several pivotal primary elections.",
            "The Democratic Majority for Israel, a super PAC run by Democratic pollster Mark Mellman, spent $1.4 million attacking Sanders in the 2020 presidential primary.",
            "While Sanders ended up losing ― for other reasons entirely ― these right-leaning pro-Israel groups have had a number of high-profile defeats in other races. DMFI’s largesse failed to keep then-House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel from losing to Israel critic Jamaal Bowman in New York’s Democratic primary last June, notwithstanding the district’s large and active Jewish community.",
            "And pro-Israel attorney Antone Melton-Meaux failed to unseat Omar in Minnesota’s Democratic primary in August despite an infusion of cash from pro-Israel political action committees.",
            "Now DMFI and the like-minded Pro-Israel America have stepped in to the contentious Democratic primary to succeed Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia Fudge in Ohio’s 11th Congressional District. The pro-Israel groups are backing Cuyahoga County Councilwoman Shontel Brown against former Ohio state Sen. Nina Turner, a Sanders ally who supports imposing tighter conditions on U.S. aid to Israel.",
            "Turner enjoys a major fundraising advantage, but DMFI’s status as a super PAC not subject to ordinary campaign fundraising limits could help balance the scales.",
            "A victory for Turner in the Aug. 4 primary would be another major blow to the historically dominant pro-Israel consensus inside the Democratic Party.",

            "It was one of the few genuinely positive stories to come out of the COVID-19 crisis: At the height of the pandemic, with so many of us working from home, animal shelters across the nation reported that they didn’t have enough dogs to meet the demand.",
            "Now as people return to the office and pre-pandemic life, some of those dogs are being left behind.",
            "Aron Jones, executive director of Moms and Mutts Colorado Rescue (MAMCO), told HuffPost her group has seen “an unprecedented number of returns” recently.",
            "“The majority of adopters use the ‘I no longer have time’ excuse while others claim they can no longer ‘handle’ their dog,” Jones said.",
            "Early on in the pandemic, Jones said her group changed its adoption application to include questions directly related to the quarantine situation: “How will you transition your dog to being alone once you return to work?” for instance, or “How will you accommodate your dog’s training and exercise needs during and after quarantine?”",
            "Even so, some dog adopters have struggled to navigate that transition with their pets. Since the last week in February, MAMCO has had 62 dogs returned to its rescue. Of these dogs, 39 had been adopted between March and July of 2020.",
            "In a typical 12-month period, Jones said, the group has an average of 50 returns overall. Roughly half of those are dogs or puppies that were adopted up to four weeks earlier ― not a year later, as the group is seeing now among pandemic adopters.",
            "What worries Jones is when the dogs end up at the shelter rather than back at the rescue group.",
            "“Most adopters follow the contract and return the dogs to us, but on occasion we will get a call from a shelter because one of our dogs has been surrendered,” Jones said. “This is terrifying, since shelters can euthanize any dog due to behavioral issues, and many dogs show fear aggression when entering the shelter.”",
            "That said, a shelter is clearly a much better option than abandoning a dog or selling a pet online to a stranger.",
            "Since the pandemic began, the rescue group The Las Vegas Trapping Girls has seen an uptick in dogs dumped around the city or in the desert. In November, the group told KVVU-TV in Las Vegas that it has also seen more “free” dog listings online, which can be dangerous for a pet because it’s impossible to know who will end up with the dog. (In the worst-case scenario, a dog offered up for free could be used for dogfights or as a bait dog.)",
            "Pet shelters and rescue groups want people to come to them first.",
            "“We would much rather pet owners do the responsible thing of contacting a rescue center than putting a pet’s welfare at risk by selling it online or abandoning it somewhere,” said Rob Young, the head of center operations at Battersea Dogs & Cats Home in London. “We aren’t ever here to judge people for the reasons behind giving up their pet.”",
            "Of course, even returning a pet to a rescue center or no-kill shelter can be traumatic, said Nicole Ellis, a dog trainer and pet lifestyle expert at Rover, a dog-sitting and dog-walking app.",
            "“Most of the time, adopted pets have built up their trust and love in you and their new routine,” she told HuffPost. “To be taken away and put into a noisy shelter, filled with smells and sights they’re unfamiliar with, is a tough transition.”",
            "As a result, some dogs become fearful and erratic when introduced to any new situation, according to Ellis. The dogs may take longer to bond with a new owner, or they may pick up new behaviors to signal their distress: barking, pacing and self-harming behavior, such as excessive licking.",
            "“Just as if our world got turned upside down we would be confused, so too are dogs, except they don’t understand why this is happening,” Ellis said. “They believe they are part of the family, and no family member should go through that.”\n",
            "Though many shelters have reported seeing an uptick in pet surrenders in recent weeks, national shelter data has yet to show a statistically significant number of returns, according to data from the animal welfare group Best Friends Animal Society.",
            "Best Friends Animal Society hopes to convince uncertain pet owners that they have other options: Dogs can absolutely adjust to their owner’s return to the office. With the right training and preparation, it really doesn’t need to be a huge ordeal, said Holly Sizemore, the chief mission officer for the group.",
            "“By now, many people have undoubtedly discovered the secret reality of what dogs and cats really do all day. Whether there are people around or not, they mostly sleep, with a bit of eating and playing mixed in ― all things that they can do just as easily without human companionship,” Sizemore said.",
            "Below, pet experts like Sizemore offer realistic advice on how to continue to care for your pup ― and how to handle rehoming them if that really is the best option for both of you.",
            "Recognize that the pandemic has had a stressful effect on all pets, not just yours.",
            "Dogs, just like humans, are enduring a really stressful time right now. If your dog is exhibiting behavioral problems, know that that’s very common.",
            "As the COVID-19 restrictions begin to lift around the country, Jones said, her group is seeing a ton of what she calls “pandemic puppies.”",
            "“These are dogs who were raised in quarantine situations by people who were not able to take the dogs to training, dog parks or to socialize with other people,” she said.",
            "Jones likens the dogs to teenagers who lack social skills.",
            "“Many were paired with people who also were not able to be trained in dog behavior because of social distancing,” she said. “Dog training is actually more for people than it is for dogs, so now both dog and owner are overwhelmed.”",
            "Look into a good trainer.",
            "Jones tells stressed-out new pet owners to take a deep breathe and realize there’s outside help available. Pet owners just need to be willing to take a new approach with a trainer.",
            "“Contact the rescue or shelter you adopted from and ask for trainer recommendations,” she said.",
            "Now that so many of us are vaccinated, it’s a great time to let your pet get social, too.",
            "“If your puppy/dog is fully vaccinated (the other kind!) start going to off-leash dog parks and socialize your dog,” Jones said. “Go to a park that has an extremely large, grassy area and costs a fee to enter, since that usually deters people who have aggressive dogs.”",
            "Anticipate that your dog may have some separation anxiety.",
            "Erin Katribe, medical director of Best Friends Animal Society, suggests pet owners know the signs of separation anxiety and prepare for it before work schedules change.",
            "Separation anxiety is common among pets that are overly attached or dependent upon their owner. After more than a year of lockdown, that probably describes most dogs right now.",
            "When pets with separation anxiety are left by their owners, they experience high levels of distress and anxiety, which often manifests in some telltale behavior: barking or whining when you leave, scratching or chewing on furniture, over-grooming or a change in appetite.",
            "“Most pets don’t like sudden and abrupt changes,” Katribe said. “Instead, try starting now to get your pet ready and ease them back to your previously ‘normal’ routine more easily.”",
            "To get dogs prepared for more alone time, the vet suggested a few things:",
            "Create a safe, comfy place where they can have peaceful, relaxing alone time. Maybe it’s a quiet room off to the side in your home or a crate filled up with some Kongs and other toys to keep them busy. (You also might want to buy or make some hidden treats in boxes and food puzzles for mental stimulation)\n\nWhile you’re gone, play soothing music or podcasts (think reggae, smooth jazz, classical or radio stations like the BBC or NPR). This will keep them from being startled by outside noises. You can also try a white noise machine.\n\nReward your pup for calm, independent behavior, especially if they’re usually clingy. Usually, pet owners pay the most attention to their dogs when they’re active or even misbehaving. What you want to reward is calm and chill behavior.\n\nPractice leaving for short periods of time to run errands or go for a walk. To reinforce the idea that you’ll always come back, tell them you’ll be back later while leaving and announce that you’re back when you get home.",
            "Make sure your dog is getting a good walk and playtime before you leave for work or when you come home.",
            "Providing a pet with exercise, stimulation and a potty break throughout the day can work wonders, Ellis said.",
            "“When you get home, consider some one-on-one time to do a little training together,” she said. “Ten to 15 minutes can go a long way in fixing or preventing behavioral issues, and you’ll find that it will really strengthen the human-animal bond.”",
            "For a dog with a lot of energy, consider day care or midday walks from dog walking platforms, such as Wag or Rover, if you can swing it.",
            "If you need financial resources to afford training or food, reach out to a local rescue group or your city.",
            "If you need financial resources to afford training or food, reach out to a local rescue groups and your city’s animal services office.",
            "For instance, in Colorado, where Jones’s group is located, there are a lot of resources at pet owners’ disposal to help with food, training and other costly ventures.",
            "In Los Angeles, there’s a Safety Net Foster program, which offers short-term foster care for pets whose families are facing a crisis. The program gives pet owners the time that they need to address and resolve their crisis, with the knowledge that they’ll be able to reunite with their pet once they’re back on their feet.",
            "What’s available in your state? The animal welfare nonprofit RedRover has a running list of resources listed state by state.",
            "If it’s not possible to keep your pet, make sure you return it to a safe rescue or shelter center.",
            "Even if there have been some hiccups between the two of you, your pet has no doubt provided you with companionship and comfort through this difficult year. Try to honor the commitment you made at adoption, Sizemore said.",
            "That said, it might still be the case that finding a new home for a pet may be the best option for your and/or the pet if you’ve exhausted other options and your pet’s quality of life is at stake.",
            "“In those cases, we’d encourage you to reach out to your network of friends and family as well as to your local shelter or animal welfare organization for advice on resources available to rehome your pet,” Sizemore said.",
            "Keep in mind that some shelters are still faced with having to euthanize incoming pets simply because they don’t have the resources to guarantee a positive outcome.",
            "“That means that anything you can do to relieve that potential burden from your local shelter and ensure your pet isn’t put at risk is absolutely imperative,” she said.",
            "Regardless of your dog-owning status, use Best Friends Animal Society’s Pet Lifesaving Dashboard to find out if a shelter near you needs help in saving the animals in their care. If your local shelter experiences an influx of “pandemic pet” returns, your donation could make a big difference."

            "MILWAUKEE, Wis. — The American Rescue Plan included a $28.6 billion lifeline for restaurants, but business owners are already worried the money will run out before they get any aid.",
            "Bounce Milwaukee is one of those businesses. In 2014, Becky Cooper-Clancy opened a party space with laser tag, rock climbing, ax throwing, arcades, bounce houses and a restaurant and bar. Think Chuck E. Cheese, but locally owned, with a community justice mission and fun for kids and adults alike.",
            "In 2019, the business made more than $1 million. Last year, by attempting a takeout pizza and parking lot drive-in movie business, it barely scraped together $200,000. It has been fully shut down since August, volunteering its building to a mutual aid organization.",
            "Cooper-Clancy was able to get around $150,000 from the Paycheck Protection Program, and she took out an Economic Injury Disaster Relief Loan. She and her husband stopped paying for their personal medical insurance just to save a couple hundred dollars per month. The bank account has run dry and she has twice the debt she had when she opened the business.",
            "The day the Restaurant Revitalization Fund launched last week, Cooper-Clancy found herself refreshing the Small Business Administration website page to submit her application.",
            "“If we are approved for the Restaurant Revitalization Fund I think we will be OK and we will make it through. If we don’t get that, because it’s really underfunded, I think we have just delayed the inevitable,” Cooper-Clancy said. “It’s been weird to have to come to terms with the idea of closing up the business and giving up on this baby that we’ve nurtured for nearly seven years. Coming to terms with that and then having this new burst of maybe it will work out after all has been a huge roller coaster.”",
            "The Restaurant Revitalization Fund ― part of the American Rescue Plan signed into law by President Joe Biden in March ― restores restaurants’ lost revenue during the pandemic up to $10 million (or $5 million per physical location). As long as businesses use the money before 2023, they don’t have to pay it back. Women- and minority-owned businesses are prioritized for the funds in the first 21 days.",
            "Within the first three days, the Biden administration announced that the program had received more than 180,000 applications. By this week, the SBA had approved more than 16,000 businesses for funds.",
            "Already, restaurants are warning it’s not enough money. And the administration seems aware that demand is bigger than the fund itself.",
            "In a webinar with the U.S. Black Chambers about the money, Patrick Kelley, who runs the SBA’s Office of Capital Access, made clear that there “is probably not going to be enough funds, in all likelihood, for the demand that’s out there.”",
            "“Please apply so we can send a strong statement to Congress and the administration that there is demand and hopefully we will act as a country as we did over the last year to provide additional funds,” Kelley told the participants.",
            "The fund was designed to course-correct after the messy rollout of the Paycheck Protection Program, the forgivable business loans passed under the CARES Act last year. The government has given out more than $780 billion under the PPP program to date; the latest extension of the program under Biden has already run out of money.",
            "Small businesses, and restaurant owners in particular, are quick to say that the PPP program was flawed. The quick rollout left many banks in the dark, unable to help clients. The rules around the loans kept changing. And many businesses couldn’t access the program, disproportionately leaving minority- and women-owned businesses to fall through the cracks. Large corporations and businesses received the majority of the funding.",
            "Even those who were able to get PPP money say it was a slog.",
            "“We just needed direct aid much sooner and it was really difficult to stay afloat in that way and have so much uncertainty and chaos,” Cooper-Clancy said. “The first PPP loan, I think I spent three or four full days trying to get the information I needed and get it through our bank, and no one had any answers.”",
            "Part of the battle now is ensuring restaurant owners know a new fund is available.",
            "A.J. Dixon, chef and owner of Milwaukee restaurant Lazy Susan MKE, has taken it upon herself to educate business owners around her, hosting webinars on the Restaurant Revitalization Fund for women- and Black-owned businesses.",
            "Before Wisconsin had stay-at-home orders, Dixon told her employees to start applying for unemployment insurance just to get into the system early in case she’d have to shut down. Now her message to Congress is that this can’t be the last lifeline. And, she said, because relief came so late, restaurants are digging out of a bigger hole than expected.",
            "“This is going to be a slow process,” Dixon said. “It’s not a matter of just everywhere opens doors again and everything is going to be OK. There’s still going to be people who are hesitant to go out, and that is affecting the economy.”",
            "“A lot of this industry lives paycheck to paycheck. The amount of disregard to help us sooner was bullshit, and that’s on every party’s count,” Dixon said. “There’s no reason why this should have taken that long.”",
            "The Restaurant Revitalization Fund has been popular with both Republicans and Democrats ― even though every single Republican in Congress voted against the rescue package that included the money. That inconvenient fact hasn’t stopped Republicans from touting it and encouraging their constituents to apply, allowing them to look like they are helping restaurants in their districts get much-needed funds.",
            "But the urgency of passing more COVID-19 relief has disappeared in Congress. Democrats are laser-focused on the president’s infrastructure proposal. Meanwhile, Republicans have been advocating to cut off additional federal unemployment insurance. There’s been little bipartisan appetite to add more money to the PPP program, which has already run dry, let alone consider additional targeted relief down the road.",
            "It’s a reality that scares restaurant owners who are hopeful but realistic that this summer won’t bring them the same revenue as past years. Running a business is more expensive now, said Melissa Buchholz, co-owner of Milwaukee restaurant Odd Duck.",
            "“Restaurants, a lot of us, lose money in the winter, and we depend on the summer to get us through the winter,” Buchholz said. “Well, this summer, it’s going to be better than before, but it’s going to be like an old winter. So if operating at full capacity is our slowest month, it’s hard to imagine a way the business survives with double the debt.",
            "Costs are going up, she said. Food is more expensive, transportation costs have gone up and supply chain disruptions have increased her costs across the board. Buchholz, who owns 50% of the business will have to wait out the first 21 days of the Restaurant Revitalization Fund until she’s eligible for funds. This week, she opened her restaurant to indoor dining for the first time during the pandemic.",
            "There’s a tangible sense of exhaustion. She, like many other small business owners, has been reinventing the wheel for the past 14 months to keep business afloat and as many workers employed as possible. She’s done takeout, take-home party boxes and farmers market baskets.",
            "“I’m paying for a whole retraining of a staff that I normally wouldn’t have to do. Those are huge costs,” Buchholz said. “Restaurants typically only make single-digit profit margins.”",
            "Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), who spent the weekend touring Madison, Wisconsin, restaurants trying to stay open during the pandemic, wouldn’t commit to supporting additional funds for the program in any of the upcoming bills, but said she was monitoring progress.",
            "“It’s unclear what legislation bill will be used to continue to look at small business assistance,” Baldwin said, adding that she hopes some state and local funding can also be directed toward small business relief. “The record shows we have adapted and adapted and added more funds, and [adding more funds] is certainly a possibility.”",
            "For now, restaurants just have to wait and see if they make the cut.",
            "“It feels like a crapshoot,” said Caleb Nicholes, co-owner of a Madison coffee shop."

            "As rising utility rates start to squeeze working-class New Yorkers and as power plant owners seek to build new fossil fuel infrastructure, calls have mounted in the nation’s largest city to remove the profit motive altogether and seize the means of electricity production.",
            "But a government takeover of the city’s utility infrastructure would be no simple feat ― steep costs, lengthy legal battles, and that’s before you get to the challenge of replacing fossil fuels with cleaner alternatives. Blackouts, electrical accidents and pollution would become a political liability for anyone in power.",
            "But Brad Lander, the progressive Brooklyn city councilman now running for comptroller, thinks he’s found a way to skip past that and start generating clean, publicly owned electricity almost immediately.",
            "Lander envisions spending $500 million over the next eight years to install 25,000 solar panels on rooftops citywide. The city would own and operate the panels through a municipally run utility that, given how much electricity it would generate, could negotiate better rates with Consolidated Edison, the private utility giant that controls the city’s transmission lines.",
            "The new city-owned entity would pay rent to landlords and homeowners in exchange for rooftop space and take on all the installation costs, making it an easy sell.",
            "“It seems so obvious, yet no one in the U.S. that I can find at any scale is doing this,” Lander said. “It seems so straightforward, given, on the one hand, an appetite for public power and, on the other, the clarity that we need to do a giant expansion of rooftop solar.”",
            "New York City is far from the only place where progressive advocates are demanding a public takeover of utilities. Similar campaigns are underway in places such as San Diego, Chicago, and parts of Maine.",
            "But the five boroughs face unique challenges. A dense urban landscape with fickle weather and limited green space, the chain of islands and peninsulas that make up New York City offers few ideal spaces for big renewable plants. The city’s top source of zero-carbon electricity, the nuclear plant at Indian Point Energy Center, shut down permanently last month. Meanwhile, it will be at least three years until a series of offshore wind turbines come online off the coast of Long Island.",
            "That means the city is more dependent than before on fossil fuels at a moment when slashing emissions from buildings’ heating systems or from automobiles require electrifying appliances and cars ― adding even more demand to the grid.",
            "Against that backdrop, Lander’s proposal looks like “an exciting plan,” said Ashley Dawson, a professor at the City University of New York and author of a new book on publicly owned utilities, ”People’s Power.”",
            "“It’s dead right about all the obstacles to installing solar in NYC, and about the consequent slow build-out in the city,” Dawson said. “The financing ideas seem reasonable, the incentives to homeowners seem strong, the green jobs promise will be enticing for unions and climate justice organizations, and of course the idea of creating a public alternative to Con Ed is very much in line with the Public Power NYC campaign.”",
            "The proposal promises to create “thousands” of jobs, streamline the city’s permitting process for solar panels, and work with the fire department to create new rules for installing and using batteries to store extra electricity. It’s the second major climate pitch from Lander, who put out the first decarbonization plan of the 2021 election late last year and won the progressive climate group Sunrise Movement’s endorsement last month.",
            "The plan does not address the more than a dozen privately owned power plants in city limits that burn fuel oil or gas and come online when demand eclipses supply on the grid. But the new supply would almost certainly make the city less reliant on them. Many of the details would need to be worked out with the next mayor. But as the city’s finance czar, the comptroller would wield direct control over the program’s funding, which Lander said could come largely from bonds, the city’s pension funds, or federal infrastructure grants.",
            "“There is nothing needed from Albany to implement this program,” Lander said.",
            "Negotiating rates with Con Edison, which would still need to distribute the electricity the panels generated, and pressuring other city agencies to update regulations would be a natural outgrowth of the new municipal utility’s size and influence in the city, Lander said.",
            "But assuming that Con Edison would be a pliable dealer with a new publicly owned entity may be wishful thinking, warned Pol Lezcano, a solar analyst at the energy research firm BloombergNEF.",
            "“Candidly, this sounds really good as a political proposal, but once you dig a little bit under the surface, you’ll find a lot of shortfalls,” he said. “Ultimately, the reliance on Con Edison is going to be there no matter what, unless they want to essentially buy all the poles and distribution lines and manage all the flow of electricity in the city, which I don’t think they’re ready for.”",
            "Instead, Lezcano said the next comptroller could set up a buyer’s program where the city would negotiate cheap bulk prices for solar panels and installation and allow homeowners and landlords to sign up. Nonprofits like the Washington, D.C.-based Solar United Neighbors, for example, have lowered prices for panel installations by about 20%, he said.",
            "“If you had half a billion dollars for solar in New York City, maybe instead you’d want to fully pay for a small number of demonstration projects in underserved communities,” said Noah Ginsburg, a director at the nonprofit Solar One, which helps install panels in low-income neighborhoods and housing projects. “But I do love the idea.”",
            "But as the city looks offshore for the bulk of its renewable energy to be generated by giant turbines, Lander said it’s important to consider that two of the biggest companies selected to build those windmills are owned by their respective governments. The Danish government controls just over 50% of shares in Ørsted. The Norwegian government owns a 67% stake in Equinor.",
            "“The fact is that we’re talking about offshore wind being delivered by companies that are publicly owned, just not by our government,” Lander said. “The Europeans are doing it and they’re not just doing it with the power in Europe but with the power being generated with New York City’s wind.”",
            "Public ownership of electricity, he said, could start with rooftop solar, but could eventually house more of the city’s energy system.",
            "“If you did municipalize our utilities tomorrow, you’d have a transmission system system that would be perfectly appropriate to have publicly owned, but you’d be buying your power overwhelmingly from fossil fuel plants, and you still wouldn’t have the capacity in the city to generate much clean energy,” Lander said. “Hopefully with this we’d be building something that could grow and scale.”"

            "The Biden administration’s announcement last Wednesday that it planned to support waiving intellectual property (IP) protections for COVID-19 vaccines prompted praise from global public health advocates and outcry from the pharmaceutical industry and corporate America more broadly.",
            "But the historic statement of support, issued by U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai, does not make the waiver a done deal. Even if successful, the availability of vaccines could vary greatly based on the final details of the waiver.",
            "The World Trade Organization requires unanimous consensus to both proceed with the discussion of changes to intellectual property agreements and to adopt those changes.",
            "The United States’ declaration of support for a waiver merely unblocks a negotiation process at the WTO that the international body’s director-general, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, estimated could take until December.",
            "“The declaration of support for a waiver of intellectual property rights for vaccines by Ambassador Tai, is momentous, but is only a first step,” said Asia Russell, executive director of Health GAP, an affordable medicines advocacy group founded to expand access to HIV treatments in low-income countries. “What comes next is that the U.S. must deliver on the substance of Ambassador Tai’s statement, not merely the letter.”",
            "A business lobbyist involved in fighting the waiver confirmed to HuffPost that the pharmaceutical industry plans to try to stop the waiver’s adoption, or short of that, limit the policy’s scope as much as possible.",
            "“This is a terrible precedent, a terrible precedent ― not just on COVID,” said the lobbyist, who asked for anonymity to speak freely. “But if the U.S. takes the position, that, ‘Hey, when the going gets tough, we’re going to waive IP,’ that’s tough.”",
            "Already, leaders of Germany and the European Union ― who jointly rank just behind the U.S. in terms of influence at the WTO ― have expressed skepticism of the waiver bordering on opposition.",
            "And the December limit on a resolution is a source of concern for Russell and her allies, who note that the WTO has been willing to reach agreements over urgent priorities over much shorter time periods in the past.",
            "Finalizing negotiations in December would be “outrageous,” Russell said.",
            "Referring to WTO director-general Okonjo-Iweala’s remarks, she continued, “The WTO leadership needs to slam on the gas and that’s exactly what Ambassador Tai’s announcement should have enabled.”",
            "Every day that passes without an agreement delays not only the legal freedom foreign companies need to mass-produce the vaccine, but also the process of scaling up the manufacturing capacity to make the vaccines in developing countries, according to proponents of the vaccine IP waiver.",
            "And even if a strong waiver is implemented, global public health advocates see it as the first step in a three-part approach that must also include the transfer of technological know-how and the subsidization of industrial capacity in the developing world.",
            "Gregg Gonsalves, an epidemiologist at the Yale School of Public Health, said releasing the intellectual property associated with vaccines but failing to include additional investments was like distributing copies of a cookbook without providing the tools or cooking know-how to make the dishes in the book.",
            "“You can’t just open up the ‘Art of Cooking.’ You have to have Julia Child come into your kitchen,” he said. “This is the next battle. You don’t get to say, ‘We supported the TRIPS waiver. Didn’t you get what you wanted?’ No. We want vaccine doses and we want them before 2022.”",
            "‘A Wartime Effort’",
            "To pharmaceutical companies and their allies, Gonsalves’ admission that the waiver is insufficient might sound, in itself, like an indictment of the waiver.",
            "The U.S. and Europe-based vaccine manufacturers and the organizations that represent them have been arguing that the implementation of the waiver would undermine intellectual property rights while doing little to alleviate the shortage of vaccines.",
            "“There is more to developing any kind of product than just what is patented. What about the underlying know-how and technology?” said Daniel Staudt, president of the Intellectual Property Owners Association, a Washington trade group that advocates for pharmaceutical companies and other corporations that rely on intellectual property regimes.",
            "But Gonsalves, Russell and others push back on these claims, arguing that the lack of capacity is at once exaggerated ― the AP identified three vaccine factories in the developing world ready to mass-produce the vaccines if given the chance ― and a reflection of the intellectual property restrictions discouraging countries and companies from developing production infrastructure that they would not legally be able to use.",
            "What’s more, the waiver’s proponents note, pharmaceutical companies in the United States also initially lacked the capacity to develop the vaccine without a massive infusion of research funding from the U.S. and German government and billions of dollars in guaranteed pre-orders. Within months, Moderna, in particular, used its shell-factory model to develop two state-of-the-art facilities in Switzerland and New Hampshire.",
            "Scaling up similar operations in the developing world, these advocates maintain, is an enormous challenge, but one that is necessary to confront the scale of the pandemic.",
            "“We need a wartime effort and other powers of the U.S. government to be invoked,” Gonsalves said.",
            "It’s clear that the global supply of vaccines is inadequate for the need. Global vaccine production capacity is currently at 3.8 billion doses a year, according to the World Trade Organization’s estimate. And since vaccinations began in December, over 1.3 billion shots have been administered, suggesting that the world is very far from achieving its 10-billion dose target.",
            "Pharmaceutical companies maintain that forcing them to partner with generic drug makers in developing countries on a greater scale than they are already doing will invariably result in a decline in quality and an inability to police counterfeits. They also warn against encouraging competition for scarce raw materials that could jeopardize the ability of established firms in wealthy nations to produce effective vaccines in time and even increase vaccine hesitancy.",
            "“The consequences of this are enormous and the benefits of this are minimal ― short of the political benefit, to show, ‘We poked our finger at the biopharma guys and Doctors without Borders, who want to waive IP on everything, we got them on our side,’” the lobbyist opposed to the waiver said.",
            "But Gonsalves said the lipids that encase the vaccine itself are just one example of a product for which production capacity exists — but that a patent, separate from the patents on the mRNA vaccine itself, prevents from being utilized.",
            "Critics of pharmaceutical companies suspect they are so fiercely opposed to the IP waiver not because of legitimate concerns about safety, but because they would rather invest their resources on booster shots they can charge more money for in Western countries than engage in less-lucrative partnerships in developing nations.",
            "The waiver could also break their monopoly on new mRNA research, allowing greater competition in the development of the next generation of mRNA products from drug companies in countries like India.",
            "“I don’t think Pharma cares whether India supplies Africa with this specific vaccine,” said David Barclay, an attorney who has brought antitrust lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies. “It’s more about the precedent of opening up IP.”",
            "Barclay predicted that the threat of the waiver would make brand-name U.S. drugmakers “come to the table more” in the hopes of negotiating voluntary licensing agreements with foreign manufacturers that could also protect some of their interests.",
            "The business lobbyist opposed to the waiver doesn’t see any more licensing deals coming from the threat of the waiver, though he said companies might agree to export more vaccines produced by proprietary facilities or existing licensees to low- and middle-income countries.",
            "Lessons From The HIV Fight",
            "One reason proponents of the waiver are confident in their course of action is that compelling drugmakers to loosen their grip on IP succeeded in expanding access to HIV drugs in developing countries in the early 2000s.",
            "After years of outcry at how patents and other intellectual property were making life-saving HIV drugs inaccessible to African nations plagued by the virus, the WTO finally agreed in November 2001 to adopt language recognizing member nations’ right to compel generic drug production to address public health crises.",
            "Gonsalves, who has been an advocate for affordable HIV medicines for decades, conceded that the science behind the COVID-19 vaccines is different and more complex than the science behind the HIV drugs.",
            "The commonality between now and then is that wealthy nations and their brand-name pharmaceutical companies offered the same pessimistic warnings that scaling up production and making drugs cheaper through competition was unrealistic.",
            "“‘HIV and vaccines are not the same’ ― well, they are the same in that you said it couldn’t be done,” Gonsalves said.",
            "The doomsayers were wrong. The cost of a year’s supply of first-line HIV treatment drugs went from $10,000 per person in 2000 to less than $100 per person in 2012, according to UNAIDS, a United Nations program aimed at ending AIDS. The number of people in sub-Saharan Africa receiving HIV treatment drugs grew 100-fold over this period, the U.N. group wrote.",
            "Gonsalves believes that they proved the pessimists wrong because people like him seeing the mass deaths on the ground in countries like South Africa ― years after witnessing something similar in the United States in the1980s and ’90s ― made it so failure was not an option.",
            "To people saying, “Sorry, you don’t understand the constraints on the global health systems,” Gonsalves recalled responding: “Fuck you, we’re going to figure out how to make it work.”",
            "The 2001 intellectual property agreement, adopted at a meeting in Doha, Qatar, and updated at subsequent meetings, was the result of years of pressure from developing countries and activists.",
            "But the negotiations came together relatively quickly, making them a model for the type of action that can be taken when wealthy nations feel sufficient pressure to act with urgency.",
            "Developing countries proposed new language creating exceptions to the WTO’s Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS) agreement that would enable the production of cheaper HIV drugs in June 2001. A deal was finally reached five months later, but most of the negotiating occurred over a six-day period at the Doha meeting itself.",
            "By contrast, if the COVID-19 TRIPS waiver only gets finalized in December, it will have been more than a year since developing countries proposed the idea in October 2020 and almost two years since the COVID-19 pandemic began spreading across the world.",
            "“That is completely inconsistent with the timeline that was driving the Doha declaration,” Russell said. “If not now, when?”",
            "The Coming Battles",
            "Representatives of the pharmaceutical industry acknowledge that proponents of waiving vaccine IP have the upper hand in the public relations battle.",
            "The lobbyist maintains that many Democrats in Congress privately agreed with arguments against the IP waiver, but were afraid not to support it for political reasons.",
            "“Many of them said, ‘We understand that the substance on this thing ― there may not be the greatest causal link between waiving IP and driving up actual access and supply, but the politics of it is so challenging for us, we felt like we had to sign the letter,’” he said, referencing a letter to Biden calling for the waiver signed by a majority of the House Democratic Caucus. “In fact, several people said, ‘Gosh, we had to sign the letter, because there was so much political pressure coming down on us.’”",
            "In the process, though, the pharmaceutical industry identified adversaries and champions on the Democratic side ― the latter, a necessity for any interest group right now, given the party’s unified control of the federal government.",
            "U.S. Trade Representative Tai, national security adviser Jake Sullivan and White House chief of staff Ron Klain are all believed to have pushed for the waiver in internal discussions, according to the lobbyist.",
            "On the other hand, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), a Biden confidant and top recipient of contributions from pharmaceutical company political action committees, opposed the waiver, the lobbyist and other people familiar with Biden administrations discussions confirmed.",
            "In Congress, as HuffPost first reported, Democratic Reps. Scott Peters (Calif.) and Ron Kind (Wis.), who are also major recipients of pharmaceutical company PAC contributions, led efforts to solicit signatures for a letter opposing the IP waiver.",
            "Peters and nine other centrist Democrats, including freshman Reps. Jake Auchincloss (Mass.), Marilyn Strickland (Wash.) and Frank Mrvan (Ind.), are now rallying opposition to a bill that Democrats passed last Congress that empowers the federal government to negotiate lower prices on an array of prescription drugs, according to a Politico report on Tuesday.",
            "In a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), the Democrats, who effectively have the votes to kill a party-line bill, insist on adopting a more modest, bipartisan measure that would “preserve our invaluable innovation ecosystem.”",
            "In addition, the pharmaceutical industry and other corporate sectors that rely on intellectual property hope that Biden will appoint a strong supporter of the current corporate-friendly intellectual property regime as director of the U.S. Patent Office (PTO), who will serve under Raimondo in the Commerce Department. At the top of Biden’s list are Ellisen Turner and Jannie Lau, two patent lawyers who have worked for companies that watchdogs have described as “patent trolls,” according to an Ars Technica report.",
            "At the same time, progressive critics of the pharmaceutical industry see a chance for Biden to build on his support for the COVID-19 vaccine IP waiver with an appointee more committed to considering public health and patent abuse concerns, as well as corporate demands for innovation. Two names that come up on their shortlist are Duke University law professor Arti Rai and Santa Clara University law professor and former Obama administration PTO official Colleen Chien. (Biden is considering Chien as well, according to Ars Technica.)",
            "“Intellectual property exists to serve people, not the other way around,” said Priti Krishtel, a co-founder of the Initiative for Medicines, Access, and Knowledge (iMAK), which is leading efforts to turn the PTO appointment into a progressive priority. “There are boundaries to the rights of private actors that have to be balanced for the greater public good.”",
            "Krishtel, who has worked on drug affordability since the HIV treatment battles of the early 2000s, believes that without reforms to the United States’ intellectual property regime as a whole, the world will be faced with similar shortages and affordability issues during the next major epidemic.",
            "“We have to figure out how not to just make this about waiving specific patents for a specific disease,” she said. “It has to be systemic ― we can’t go through this for each pandemic.”"

Four months later, that individual has still eluded authorities.",

            "The Biden administration is holding tens of thousands of asylum-seeking children in an opaque network of some 200 facilities that The Associated Press has learned spans two dozen states and includes five shelters with more than 1,000 children packed inside.",
            "Confidential data obtained by the AP shows the number of migrant children in government custody more than doubled in the past two months, and this week the federal government was housing around 21,000 kids, from toddlers to teens. A facility at Fort Bliss, a U.S. Army post in El Paso, Texas, had more than 4,500 children as of Monday. Attorneys, advocates and mental health experts say that while some shelters are safe and provide adequate care, others are endangering children’s health and safety.",
            "“It’s almost like ‘Groundhog Day,’” said Southern Poverty Law Center attorney Luz Lopez, referring to the 1993 film in which events appear to be continually repeating. “Here we are back to a point almost where we started, where the government is using taxpayer money to build large holding facilities ... for children instead of using that money to find ways to more quickly reunite children with their sponsors.”",
            "A U.S. Department of Health and Human Services spokesman, Mark Weber, said the department’s staff and contractors are working hard to keep children in their custody safe and healthy.",
            "A few of the current practices are the same as those that President Joe Biden and others criticized under the Trump administration, including not vetting some caregivers with full FBI fingerprint background checks. At the same time, court records show the Biden administration is working to settle several multimillion-dollar lawsuits that claim migrant children were abused in shelters under President Donald Trump.",
            "Part of the government’s plan to manage thousands of children crossing the U.S.-Mexico border involves about a dozen unlicensed emergency facilities inside military installations, stadiums and convention centers that skirt state regulations and don’t require traditional legal oversight.",
            "Inside the facilities, called Emergency Intake Sites, children aren’t guaranteed access to education, recreational opportunities or legal counsel.",
            "In a recent news release, the administration touted its “restoration of a child centered focus for unaccompanied children,” and it has been sharing daily totals of the number of children in government custody as well as a few photos of the facilities. This reflects a higher level of transparency than the Trump administration. In addition, the amount of time children spend, on average, inside the system has dropped from four months last fall to less than a month this spring, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.",
            "Nonetheless, the agency has received reports of abuse that resulted in a handful of contract staffers being dismissed from working at the emergency sites this year, according to an official who wasn’t authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
            "Attorneys say sometimes, even parents can’t figure out where their children are.",
            "José, a father who fled El Salvador after his village was targeted in a massacre, requested asylum in the U.S. four years ago. He had hoped to welcome his wife and 8-year-old daughter to Southern California this year, but the pair were turned around at the border in March and expelled to Mexico. The little girl crossed again by herself and was placed in the government shelter in Brownsville, Texas, on April 6. José called a government hotline set up for parents seeking their migrant children repeatedly but said no one would tell him where she was.",
            "“I was so upset because I kept calling and calling and no one would tell me any information about where she was,” said José, who asked to be identified only by his first name out of fear of endangering his immigration case. “Finally they told me I had to pay $1,300 to cover her airplane ticket and if I didn’t pay, I would have to wait a month more, and I was so anxious.”",
            "For nearly three weeks, his daughter was held inside the Brownsville facility before finally being released to him in late April after an advocacy organization intervened to get the government to foot the bill for her airfare, as is required by the agency.",
            "HHS declined to say whether there are any legally enforceable standards for caring for children housed at the emergency sites or how they are being monitored. The Biden administration has allowed very limited access to news media once children are brought into facilities, citing the coronavirus pandemic and privacy restrictions.",
            "“HHS has worked as swiftly as possible to increase bed capacity and to ensure potential sponsors can provide a safe home while the child goes through their immigration proceedings,” HHS spokesman Weber said in a statement. “As soon as wrap around services — on-site primary care, including childhood immunizations and physicals, case management, phone calls to family members, education, recreation etc — become available as a result of additional infrastructure and staff, they are provided as part of the operation.”",
            "Weber confirmed a number of specific shelter populations from the data the AP obtained.",
            "Of particular concern to advocates are mass shelters, with hundreds of beds apiece. These facilities can leave children isolated, less supervised and without basic services. The AP found about half of all migrant children detained in the U.S. are sleeping in shelters with more than 1,000 other children. More than 17,650 are in facilities with 100 or more children. Some shelters and foster programs are small, little more than a house with a handful of kids. A large Houston facility abruptly closed last month after it was revealed that children were being given plastic bags instead of access to restrooms.",
            "“The system has been very dysfunctional, and it’s getting worse,” said Amy Cohen, a child psychiatrist and executive director of the nonprofit Every. Last. One., which works to help immigrant families fleeing violence in Central America. Although there have been large numbers of children arriving in the U.S. for years, Cohen said she’s never seen the situation as bad as it is today.",
            "Cohen described parents receiving calls from people refusing to identify themselves. They are told to be at an airport or bus station in the next two hours to pick up their children, who have been held for more than a month without notice, or they wouldn’t be released. Some parents are told to pay a travel agency thousands of dollars to have their child sent to them, she said.",
            "“The children are coming out sick, with COVID, infested with lice, and it will not surprise me to see children dying as a consequence, as we saw during the Trump years,” Cohen said. “The Biden administration is feverishly putting up these pop-up detention facilities, many of which have no experience working with children.”",
            "One reason so many children are now arriving without their parents dates back to a 2020 Trump administration emergency order that essentially closed the U.S.-Mexico border to all migrants, citing public health concerns about spreading COVID-19.",
            "That emergency order still applies to adults, but the Biden administration has begun allowing children traveling without their parents to stay and seek asylum if they enter the country. As a result, some parents are sending their kids across the border by themselves.",
            "Most already have a parent or other adult relative or family friend, known as a sponsor, in the U.S. waiting to receive them. But first they are typically detained by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, or CBP, then turned over to a government shelter.",
            "“As much as having children spend days on end at CBP is unacceptable, so, too, is having children spend weeks on end in unlicensed Emergency Intake Sites,” said National Center for Youth Law attorney Neha Desai. “With every passing day, it is increasingly critical that these children are released to sponsors or transferred to licensed facilities.”",
            "Over the course of 2019, the federal government held nearly 70,000 children in a system of contracted shelters, mass detention camps and foster parents. This year those numbers are expected to be even higher.",
            "Some of the facilities holding children these days are run by contractors already facing lawsuits claiming that children were physically and sexually abused in their shelters under the Trump administration, while others are new companies with little or no experience working with migrant children. Collectively, the emergency facilities can accommodate nearly 18,000 children, according to data the agency provided earlier this month.",
            "“There are a lot of questions about are there standards and who is ensuring that they are meeting them, and what kind of transparency and accountability will there be,” said Jennifer Podkul, a vice president at Kids in Need of Defense, which represents children in immigration court.",
            "The Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project is one of several organizations that filed legal claims against the federal government seeking hundreds of millions of dollars in damages for parents who said their children were harmed while in government custody after being forcibly separated at the border under Trump administration policies. In some lawsuits, families claim children suffered physical and sexual abuse while in government custody, at both foster homes and private shelters.",
            "“If those children were able to come in with their parents, they could be released with their parents and not placed in government custody,” said Conchita Cruz, co-executive director at the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project. “This administration should lift the current policy in order for families to seek asylum together.”",
            "Biden’s Justice Department is defending the government against these claims, which were filed in 2019 under the Trump administration. But the federal response has been mixed since the change in leadership. Some cases continue to be argued, while others are in settlement discussions.",
            "In a recent filing in one case currently in litigation, federal attorneys agreed with the assertion that these policies indeed inflicted harm.",
            "“President Biden has ‘condemned the human tragedy that occurred when our immigration laws were used to intentionally separate children from their parents or legal guardians ... including through the use of the “Zero Tolerance Policy” during the Trump administration,’” Justice Department attorneys wrote.",
            "The judge in the case granted a joint request to pause the litigation until June 2 “while the parties explore settlement.”",
            "“We want to make sure there is adequate oversight and transparency for these new structures and make sure that children can get out,” said Podkul, whose organization has been holding “know your rights” training with children in the emergency sites. “If kids are there for more than 48 hours, kids need to know what to expect.”",
            "As for the 8-year-old girl, her father, José, said she is adjusting to life in Los Angeles, enjoying playing with her older brother and, bit by bit, opening up.",
            "“She keeps asking me where her mom is, and I keep telling her not to worry, that she is in Mexico and she is OK,” he said. “Soon I hope she’ll tell me what it was like inside.”",

        "articleContent": [
            "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump’s acting defense secretary during the Jan. 6 Capitol riots plans to tell Congress that he was concerned in the days before the insurrection that sending troops to the building would fan fears of a military coup and could cause a repeat of the deadly Kent State shootings, according to a copy of prepared remarks obtained by The Associated Press.",
            "Christopher Miller’s testimony is aimed at defending the Pentagon’s response to the chaos of the day and rebutting broad criticism that military forces were too slow to arrive even as pro-Trump rioters violently breached the building and stormed inside. He casts himself as a deliberate leader who was determined that the military have only limited involvement, a perspective he says was shaped by criticism of the aggressive response to the civil unrest that roiled American cities months earlier, as well as decades-old episodes that ended in violence.",
            "The Defense Department, he will tell members of the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday, has “an extremely poor record in supporting domestic law enforcement,” including during civil rights and anti-Vietnam War demonstrations in the 1960s and 1970s.",
            "“And some 51 years ago, on May 4, 1970, Ohio National Guard troops fired at demonstrators at Kent State University and killed four American civilians,” Miller will say, adding, “I was committed to avoiding repeating these scenarios.”",
            "He will also deny that Trump, criticized for failing to forcefully condemn the rioters, had any involvement in the Defense Department’s response and will say that Trump had even suggested that 10,000 troops might be needed for Jan. 6.",
            "Miller, expected to testify alongside former acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and District of Columbia Police Chief Robert Contee III, will be the most senior Defense Department official to participate in congressional hearings on the riots. The sessions have been characterized by finger-pointing by officials across agencies about missed intelligence, poor preparations and an inadequate law enforcement response.",
            "The Capitol Police have faced criticism for being badly overmatched, the FBI for failing to share with sufficient urgency intelligence suggesting a possible “war” at the Capitol, and the Defense Department for an hourslong delay in getting support to the complex despite the violent, deadly chaos unfolding on TV.",
            "Rosen, for his part, is expected to tell lawmakers that the Justice Department “took appropriate precautions” ahead of the riot, putting tactical and other elite units on standby after local police reports indicated that 10,000 to 30,000 people were expected at rallies and protests, according to prepared remarks obtained by the AP.",
            "Miller’s testimony will amount to the most thorough explanation of Pentagon actions after months of criticism that it took hours for the National Guard to arrive.",
            "In his remarks, he defends his resistance to a heavy military response as being shaped by public “hysteria” about the possibility of a military coup or concerns that the military might be used to help overturn the election results. Fearful of amplifying those suspicions — as well as the chance that a soldier might be provoked into violence in a way that could be perceived as an attack on First Amendment activities — he says he agreed in the days before the insurrection to deploy soldiers only in areas away from the Capitol.",
            "“No such thing was going to occur on my watch but these concerns, and hysteria about them, nonetheless factored into my decisions regarding the appropriate and limited use of our Armed Forces to support civilian law enforcement during the Electoral College certification,” Miller will say. “My obligation to the Nation was to prevent a constitutional crisis.”",
            "Democrats have signaled that they intend to press Miller on why it took so long for the National Guard to arrive despite urgent plans for help. Miller will contend that those complaints are unjustified, though he also concedes that the Guard was not rushed to the scene — a decision that he maintains was intentional.",
            "“This isn’t a video game where you can move forces with a flick of the thumb or a movie that glosses over the logistical challenges and the time required to coordinate and synchronize with the multitude of other entities involved, or with complying with the important legal requirements involved in the use of such forces,” he will say.",
            "Even after the Guard was requested, he said he felt compelled to send them “in with a plan to not only succeed but that would spare them unnecessary exposure and spare everyone the consequences of poor planning or execution.”",
            "“We appreciated the seriousness of the situation, but we did not want to piece-meal National Guard forces into the zone of conflict,” Miller will say.",
            "Although the timeline Miller offers in his remarks generally matches up with that provided by other high-ranking leaders, he notably puts himself at odds with William Walker, who as commanding general of the D.C. National Guard testified to what he said were unusual Pentagon restrictions that impeded his response and contributed to a three-hour delay between the time he requested aid and the time it was received. Walker has since become the House sergeant-at-arms, in charge of the chamber’s security.",
            "Miller will say that Walker was given “all the authority he needed to fulfill the mission” and that before Jan. 6 he had never expressed any concern about the forces he had at his disposal. He contends that he authorized the deployment of 340 National Guard personnel, the total amount Walker had said would be necessary, and authorized him to use a 40-member quick reaction force provided that Walker could provide him with a so-called concept of operations.",
            "Miller said he approved the activation of the Guard at 3 p.m.. He said that though that support did not arrive at the Capitol complex until 5:22 p.m., the coordination, planning and deputizing of personnel by civilian law enforcement all took time.",
            "Miller, a Green Beret and retired Army colonel, served as a White House counterterrorism adviser under Trump before being tapped as acting defense secretary for the final months of the Trump administration. He replaced Mark Esper, who was fired after the election after being seen by Trump as insufficiently loyal.",
            "The abrupt appointment raised concerns that Miller was in place to be a Trump loyalist. In his opening statement, though, he will say that he believes Trump “encouraged the protesters” but declines to say if he thinks the president bears responsibility. He recounts a conversation on Jan. 5 when Trump, struck by a crowd of supporters at a rally that day, told him that 10,000 troops would be needed the next day.",
            "“The call lasted fewer than thirty seconds and I did not respond substantively, and there was no elaboration. I took his comment to mean that a large force would be required to maintain order the following day,” Miller says in his statement.",

            "Dr. Anthony Fauci on Sunday said he has “no doubt” that the number of Americans killed by COVID-19 is much higher than what has been officially reported, after a recent study counted nearly double the amount recorded by federal health officials.",
            "“We’ve been saying — and the CDC has been saying all along — that it is very likely that we’re undercounting,” Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, said in an interview with NBC’s “Meet the Press.”",
            "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has placed the number of deaths in the U.S. at around 577,800. In comparison, a study from the University of Washington released Thursday tallied around 905,000 deaths.",
            "“That’s a bit more than I would have thought the undercounting was,” Fauci said of that difference. “I think there’s no doubt ... that we are and have been undercounting. What that tells us is something that we’ve known. You know, we’re living through a historic pandemic, the likes of which we haven’t seen in over a hundred years.”",
            "He went on to stress the need for people to get vaccinated, which he said will help prevent another surge in infections this fall and winter.",
            "“The larger proportion of the population that’s vaccinated, the less likelihood that a season like the coming fall or winter you’re going to see a significant surge,” he said.",
            "About one-third of Americans have been fully vaccinated and almost half have been at least partially vaccinated, according to CDC data released Saturday. President Joe Biden has set a goal of getting 70% of Americans vaccinated by July 4, which Fauci said he believes will be reached.",
            "In addition to stressing the need for more people to be vaccinated, Fauci highlighted the importance of wearing masks, and credited their use to a drop in other respiratory diseases, such as the flu. With more people becoming comfortable wearing them, he said masks may become a seasonal item to help prevent disease spread.",
            "“We’ve had practically a non-existent flu season this year merely because people were doing the kinds of public health things that were directed predominantly against COVID-19,” he said. “So it is conceivable that as we go on, a year or two or more from now, that during certain seasonal periods when you have respiratory-borne viruses like the flu, people might actually elect to wear masks to diminish the likelihood that you’ll spread these respiratory-borne diseases.”"

            "No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, and Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told reporters in a message that only the Islamic State group could be responsible for such a heinous crime. Mujahid also accused Afghanistan’s intelligence agency of being complicit with IS, although he offered no evidence.",

            "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department on Friday released a proposed rule that would broaden the definition of a firearm, requiring some gun-making kits to include a serial number as the Biden administration moves forward to combat so-called “ghost guns.”",
            "It comes several weeks after President Joe Biden promised a crackdown on “ghost guns,” homemade firearms that lack serial numbers used to trace them and are often purchased without a background check.",
            "For years, federal and local law enforcement officials have been sounding the alarm about what they say is a loophole in federal firearms law, allowing people who are generally prohibited from owning guns to obtain them by making the weapons themselves. Ghost guns have increasingly been turning up at crime scenes and being purchased from gang members and other criminals by undercover federal Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agents.",
            "The Justice Department estimates that more than 23,000 weapons without serial numbers were seized by law enforcement from 2016 to 2020 and were identified in connection with 325 homicides or attempted homicides.",
            "It’s legal to build a gun in a home or a workshop, and advances in 3-D printing and milling have made it easier to do so. Ready-made kits can be purchased for a few hundred dollars online without the kind of background check required for traditional gun purchases.",
            "But under the proposed rule, retailers would be required to run background checks before selling some of those kits that contain the parts necessary for someone to readily make a gun at home.",
            "The rule sets forth several factors to determine whether the unfinished receivers could be easily convertible into a finished firearm, a senior Justice Department official said. If they meet that criteria, manufacturers would also be required to include a serial number, the official said. The rule also would require serial numbers to be added to homemade, un-serialized weapons that are traded in or turned into a federal firearms dealer.",
            "The official could not discuss the matter ahead of a public announcement and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity. Once the proposed rule is published in the Federal Register, the public will have 90 days to submit comments.",
            "The critical component in building an untraceable gun is what is known as the lower receiver, a part typically made of metal or polymer. An unfinished receiver — sometimes referred to as an “80% receiver” — can be legally bought online with no serial numbers or other markings on it, no license required.",
            "Converting the piece of metal into a firearm is relatively simple and takes only a few hours. A drill press or a metal cutting machine known as a Computer Numeric Control, or CNC, is used to create a few holes in the receiver and well out a cavity. The receiver is then combined with a few other parts to create a fully functioning semi-automatic rifle or handgun.",
            "“Criminals and others barred from owning a gun should not be able to exploit a loophole to evade background checks and to escape detection by law enforcement,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. “This proposed rule would help keep guns out of the wrong hands and make it easier for law enforcement to trace guns used to commit violent crimes, while protecting the rights of law-abiding Americans.”"

            "BUCHAREST (AP) — Romanian police will investigate a possible poaching case involving an Austrian prince who is reported to have “wrongly” killed a massive male bear in a trophy hunt on a visit to the country’s Carpathian Mountains in March, authorities said Wednesday.",
            "Official hunting documents seen by The Associated Press confirms that Prince Emanuel von und zu Liechtenstein was granted a four-day hunting permit in March in Romania’s Covasna County and that on March 13 he “harvested” a 17-year-old brown bear, for which he allegedly paid the princely sum of 7,000 euros ($8,400).",
            "A senior official from Romania’s environmental ministry, Octavian Berceanu, told the AP that an investigation into the case was launched on April 29 and that poaching is the one of the suspicions in the case.",
            "“All of the papers from National Environmental Guard will go to the police,” he said, referring to a branch of the ministry.",
            "Berceanu also said that some official papers that are required after a bear kill are missing.",
            "“The local environment agency should inform the Environmental Guard after the shooting, but this didn’t happen,” Berceanu said.",
            "Repeated attempts to contact the prince’s estate were unsuccessful. Switzerland’s Blick newspaper quoted the prince as saying he wouldn’t comment on the matter.",
            "Agent Green, an environmental nongovernmental organization that monitored the large male bear they called “Arthur” for nine years, says that it lived “deep in the wild” and had no contact with human settlements.",
            "Romania officially banned trophy hunting in 2016, but hunting permits for “problematic” bears — ones that damage things such as farm crops or domestic animals — can be issued to hunting associations but only as a last resort, after relocation measures fail. These permits are then sold to trophy hunters.",
            "But Agent Green claims that the environment authorities issued the hunting permit based on a complaint about a “problematic” cub-rearing female bear that had caused damage in the village of Ojdula in Transylvania last summer.",
            "“It was always about shooting the biggest bear and not about solving the problem of the community,” Gabriel Paun, president of Agent Green, told the AP. “I wonder how the prince mistook the biggest male living deep in the wild against the much smaller female next to the village.”",
            "Due to Arthur the brown bear’s large size, it was considered in hunting parlance a “Golden” trophy, prized specimens which can fetch upward of 20,000 euros (nearly $25,000).",
            "“Every farmer I spoke to in the village of Ojdula said that nothing had changed since the male bear was shot and that the female bear continues to come daily to the households. This is poaching as the prince shot the wrong bear — it was murder,” Paun said.",
            "Environment Minister Barna Tanczos told local media on Wednesday that determining whether the correct bear was killed was “extremely complicated.”",
            "A petition launched yesterday by Agent Green calling for a total trophy hunting ban in Romania has garnered more than 13,000 signatures.",
            "For brown bear expert Csaba Domokos of the nature conservation NGO Milvus Group, the killing of Arthur “is nothing exceptional.” He also said that for many hunters, killing a female with cubs would go against hunting “ethics.”",
            "“The hunting associations use damages as a pretext to shoot the trophy bears. The exceptions are the cases when they use it to shoot a problematic bear,” Domokos told The Associated Press.",
            "“They just get someone from a village to give some evidence that there was a bear causing problems … then a (hunting permit) is given out and they just go and shoot a big bear because they get more money than shooting a smaller one,” he said.",
            "Romania is home to Europe’s biggest population of brown bears, officially around 6,000. But some scientists dispute these figures claiming that the methodology behind the count was inadequate.",
            "The killing of the large carnivore took place in a protected Natura 2000 Site, areas of special natural interest and home to some of Europe’s most valuable and threatened species, protected under EU law.\n\n“The current law is poor, there are too many gray areas and it’s facilitating trophy hunters to come to Romania,” Paun said.\n\n“At the moment anyone can make a fake complaint about a bear and send it to a hunting association who will do all the necessary work to obtain a hunting permit — then a hunter comes and shoots any bear they wish.”"

            "Plaza, 36, and Baena, 43, have been linked since 2011, according to People. And although fans may be upset that Plaza didn’t get hitched to Michael Cera — a former co-star, whom she dated for a year and a half — or Chris Pratt (who played April Ludgate’s goofball of a husband in “Parks and Rec”), Baena seems like a good match for her, if his movies are any indication.",
            "Plaza has starred in two of Baena’s offbeat films, “Life After Beth” (2014) and “The Little Hours” (2017), the latter of which is about a convent of foul-mouthed, emotionally unstable and lustful nuns. The former involves a woman turning into a zombie.",
            "Both films also share several of the same cast members, including Molly Shannon, John C. Reilly and Paul Reiser. According to Plaza’s post on Friday, Shannon will be involved in Baena’s upcoming movie “Spin Me Round” — as will Fred Armisen, Lauren Weedman and Alison Brie, who were all also in “The LIttle Hours.”",
            "Plaza and Baena appear to enjoy working together. The “Ingrid Goes West” star will make her directorial debut in Showtime’s new found footage anthology series “Cinema Toast,” created by Baena. They worked on the series together at home during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
            "“We were quarantined for months and months like everybody else,” Plaza recently told People. “And we did enjoy it. I think it was, obviously other than all of the catastrophic things happening in the world, just on a personal level, relationship level, was kind of nice to just be forced to be in one place for that long. Could have gone either way, I guess.”",
            "Here’s just hoping that Plaza and Baena’s wedding was as random and wonderful as April and Andy’s:"

            "WASHINGTON ― Four months after inciting a violent attack on the Capitol in a last-ditch attempt to retain power, former President Donald Trump on Wednesday demonstrated his continued grip on his party, as House GOP officials prepared to purge Wyoming’s Liz Cheney from her leadership role for criticizing him.",
            "The move, the latest assault on one of the few elected Republicans to publicly argue that Trump’s actions in the weeks leading up to and on Jan. 6 should ban him from public life, alarmed authoritarian experts who pointed out disturbing historical parallels.",
            "Tom Nichols, a scholar of the old Soviet Union and a professor at the U.S. Naval War College, said the situation has a familiar ring. “The whole atmosphere is one of loyalty to the leader and to the party, and none to principle or policy,” he said.",
            "And Jonathan Weiler, a University of North Carolina authoritarianism expert, found parallels going back to Nazi Germany. “It’s interesting that Cheney is condemning Trump specifically for his use of the term ‘the Big Lie’ to push his false claim that the 2020 election was stolen,” he said. “The ‘Big Lie’ itself is a term often attributed to chief Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels ― the idea being that if you push relentlessly and totally a falsehood you can get ordinary people to believe it.”",
            "House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) in recent days both signaled their desire to push out Cheney as House Republican Conference chair and a readiness to replace her with Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), who has repeatedly spread Trump’s lies about the election.",
            "Trump himself followed up with press releases Wednesday attacking Cheney, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) and his own former vice president, Mike Pence, for failing to go along with his false claims that he had won the election but that it was stolen from him.",
            "“Had Mike Pence referred the information on six states (only need two) back to State Legislatures, and had gutless and clueless MINORITY Leader Mitch McConnell (he blew two seats in Georgia that should have never been lost) fought to expose all of the corruption that was presented at the time, with more found since, we would have had a far different Presidential result,” Trump said in a statement that was simultaneously posted to his new blog.",
            "“The idea that something as preposterous as the stolen election claim would itself become a loyalty test for mainstream GOPers is disturbingly reminiscent of the ways fascism demanded fealty to its cause,” Weiler said.",
            "Cheney has been among the two dozen or so congressional Republicans who have refused to go along with Trump’s election lies, and among the 17 who voted to impeach or convict him for inciting the Jan. 6 attack on the election certification.",
            "Cheney spokesman Jeremy Adler said the lawmaker is not backing down. “This is about whether the Republican Party is going to perpetuate lies about the 2020 election and attempt to whitewash what happened on Jan 6. Liz will not do that. That is the issue,” he said.",
            "As to the likely attempt to vote her out of her No. 3 position at next week’s House Republican Conference meeting, Adler said Cheney is not yet commenting. “Liz will have more to say in the coming days. This moment is about much more than a House leadership fight,” he said.",
            "Trump spent months before the election telling his followers that the only way he could possibly lose reelection was if Democrats cheated. Trump lost the Nov. 3 election by 7 million votes, but his lies that he had actually won in “a landslide” began in the wee hours of Nov. 4 and continued through dozens of failed lawsuits to overturn his losses in various states, through the Electoral College vote on Dec. 14, and then right into Jan. 6, when he repeated them during a rally he staged near the White House.",
            "There, he encouraged the thousands in attendance to march to the Capitol to intimidate Pence and Congress into reversing his 306-232 Electoral College loss and let him retain power, and then watched from the White House as hundreds of them stormed the building. After Trump tweeted that Pence had “lacked the courage” to overturn his loss, many in his mob began chanting “hang Mike Pence” as they searched for him.",
            "Seven people, including three police officers, died that afternoon and in the following days, two by suicide.",
            "While at first a host of Republicans, including McCarthy, blamed Trump for inciting the attack and failing to stop it once it began, most have since backed away from any criticism, and Trump has renewed his lying about the election ― lying that House Republican leadership appears to have made the official caucus policy.",
            "Neither McCarthy’s nor Stefanik’s office responded to HuffPost queries Wednesday.",
            "Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a history professor at New York University and fascism expert, said their fealty to Trump is more proof of where the party is headed. “The move to purge Liz Cheney is another example of the authoritarian-style party discipline adopted by Trump’s GOP. It is more evidence that the GOP has become a far-right party beholden to a leader cult,” she said.",
            "The only saving grace, said Nichols, is Trump’s lack of competence, even at being an effective authoritarian. “The Soviets banished people from the party, or worse, for disloyalty,” he said. “The best the GOP can do is run a primary election against Cheney while an old crank in Florida issues angry memos that no one is going to read.”"

Harry was seen filming for “Vax Live” last weekend, but Meghan, who is expecting the couple’s second child, is expected to appear in a pretaped segment. It’s unclear if Archie will make an appearance.",
            "The Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s son made a brief appearance on his parents’ Archewell Audio holiday special on Spotify in December, and in home footage shown during the couple’s interview with Oprah Winfrey in March.",
            "During the CBS prime-time special, Harry spoke about his love of going on walks and hanging out at the beach with his family.\n\n“I guess the highlight for me is sticking him on the back of a bicycle in his little baby seat and taking him on these bike rides, something which I was never able to do when I was young,” Harry told Winfrey at the time. “I can see him on the back and he’s got his arms out and he’s like ‘Oooh!’ Chatting, chatting, chatting, ‘palm tree, house’ and all this sort of stuff, and I do, I think to myself ‘Wow.’”",
            "Meghan chimed in to add that Archie had added the word “hydrate” to his vocabulary, which she described as “just hysterical.” Harry said Archie also liked to tell people to “drive safe.”\n\nIt’s not known what sort of gifts the toddler received on his birthday, but Harry told James Corden in February that Archie had gotten a waffle-maker from Queen Elizabeth II for Christmas that he loves."

            "The Biden administration plans to support a temporary waiver on patents and other intellectual property rules preventing developing countries from mass-producing generic COVID-19 vaccines, United States Trade Representative Katherine Tai announced on Wednesday.",
            "A group of developing countries led by India and South Africa was pushing for the move, which comes as a relief for global public health advocates.",
            "“The Administration believes strongly in intellectual property protections, but in the service of ending this pandemic, supports the waiver of these protections for COVID-19 vaccines,” Tai said in a statement.",
            "The United States does not have the power to unilaterally enact the patent waiver, nor did Tai commit to the version of the waiver currently drafted by India and South Africa. Instead, she pointed to the need for further negotiations.",
            "But Tai’s remarks signal the end of American leadership of a bloc composed primarily of wealthy nations that has prevented the World Trade Organization from reaching the unanimous consensus needed to even begin negotiations over the terms of a waiver.",
            "Because the U.S. — which is home to some of the world’s most lucrative pharmaceutical companies — has historically been a major obstacle to patent liberalization, American support for the waiver is widely viewed as a sign that it will eventually be adopted.",
            "It is an outcome that the pharmaceutical industry has fought hard to prevent, deploying more than 100 lobbyists in the first few months of 2021 to pressure lawmakers. Shares of Pfizer, BioNTech, Novavax and Moderna fell following Tai’s announcement.",
            "The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the country’s largest pharmaceutical trade organization, issued a scathing statement claiming that the waiver would do more harm than good.",
            "“In the midst of a deadly pandemic, the Biden Administration has taken an unprecedented step that will undermine our global response to the pandemic and compromise safety,” PhRMA president and CEO Steve Ubl said. A patent waiver, Ubl argued, “flies in the face of President Biden’s stated policy of building up American infrastructure and creating jobs.”",
            "But public health experts say that failure to prioritize vaccinations for populations around the world as fast as possible will end up hurting Americans, dragging the pandemic on and creating opportunities for new variants to arise. When the coronavirus spreads unchecked, it can mutate, leading to variants that could be more resistant to already-developed vaccines, requiring even more global resources to end the pandemic.",
            "For-profit drug makers deployed a variety of talking points against the waiver. They argued that it could lead to faulty drug production, allow China or Russia to steal valuable intellectual property, or disincentivize further development of treatments related to COVID-19. Yet many proponents of the waiver argue that the huge sums of public money pumped into the pharmaceutical industry to develop COVID-19 treatments and vaccines weakens companies’ arguments about intellectual property.",
            "The pharmaceutical industry has claimed that the current dearth of vaccine supplies is due to a lack of raw materials and industrial capacity in developing countries, rather than the lack of legal freedom to use and replicate patented technologies.",
            "Tai addressed the high demand for raw materials, saying that the administration would work to alleviate supply shortages where they crop up. Coronavirus vaccines can require more than 200 individual materials sourced from a variety of countries, and there is currently very little transparency in the supply chain.",
            "Public health advocates noted that several pharmaceutical companies have also already partnered with drug makers in developing nations to manufacture smaller batches of vaccines, and companies in countries like Bangladesh said they are ready to mass produce the shots the moment a waiver takes effect.",
            "While there is already a global initiative funded by the U.S. and other high-income countries that aims to bring vaccines to low-income countries (COVAX), experts say it does not have enough resources to completely solve the problem of vaccine inequity.",
            "Tai, who is representing the U.S. at a WTO meeting in Geneva on Wednesday and Thursday, emphasized that hammering out the details of a waiver could be a long, complex process.",
            "“We will actively participate in text-based negotiations at the World Trade Organization (WTO) to make that happen,” she said in her statement. “Those negotiations will take time given the consensus-based nature of the institution and the complexity of the issues involved.”",
            "Still, the Biden administration’s decision marks a dramatic finale to a months-long pressure campaign for Biden to reverse his predecessor’s opposition to allowing talks over a waiver to begin, and is a victory for progressive lawmakers.",
            "In October, India and South Africa wrote a letter asking that WTO member states enact a waiver on patents and other intellectual property protections “until widespread vaccination is in place globally.”",
            "As vaccines have become more available in the United States and the COVID-19 pandemic has intensified in the developing world, calls for the temporary waiver from public health advocates and progressive politicians across the world have intensified.",
            "In mid-April, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and nine other senators signed a letter addressed to Biden calling for the waiver. Sanders applauded the administration’s decision on Wednesday, saying that “putting people over profits” was necessary to end the pandemic.",
            "And on Tuesday, Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.) unveiled a similar letter in the House with the support of a majority of the House Democratic Caucus. The letter included the signatures of a number of moderate Democrats from swing districts, such as Reps. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan and Jared Golden of Maine.",
            "In a press conference touting the letter on Tuesday, Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee’s subcommittee on trade, framed the issue as a question of self-interest in protecting Americans from additional spread of the COVID-19 virus.",
            "“It is beyond comprehension that we’re not doing everything we can to make sure that we break this vicious cycle of reinfections,” he said, before expressing confidence that Tai knew how to “thread the needle” between the concerns of drug makers and the need to combat the pandemic.",
            "Even Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), a moderate with ties to the pharmaceutical industry, noted that funding from the U.S. government that helped support vaccine research should entitle the global public to lower drug prices.",
            "In the end, it was Biden’s own remarks that may have had the greatest effect. Before he was elected in November, he told terminally ill activist Ady Barkan that waiving the patent rules would be “the only humane thing in the world to do.”",
            "The White House was increasingly at pains to explain the discrepancy between Biden’s remarks then and his inaction up until now.",
            "“The president spoke about his support for this type of a waiver back during the campaign,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Wednesday before Tai’s announcement. “But ... we have been running a process in the administration that includes all stakeholders in the administration, and he is somebody who has welcomed people of different views.”",

            "Earlier this year, a dispute between LG Chem and SK Innovation, two South Korean battery manufacturers, boiled over when the U.S. International Trade Commission ruled in LG Chem’s favor, deciding to ban the other firm from importing the raw materials needed to make the lithium-ion units that power electric vehicles.",
            "In response to the ruling, SK Innovation said it would likely need to shutter a $2.6 billion battery factory complex in Commerce, Georgia, unless Biden issued a rare presidential veto of the ITC decision. Industry analysts warned that without the factory, LG Chem could gain a near-monopoly hold on the electric vehicle market, granting it the ability to dictate prices. Trade hawks argued vetoing the ITC decision risked weakening the U.S. stance on IP protections.",
            "Hours before Biden faced a legal deadline to decide on the veto, SK Innovation and LG Chem reached a settlement, allowing the White House to avoid the decision altogether.",

            "AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Republican Susan Wright of Texas, the widow of the first member of Congress to die after contracting COVID-19, advanced to a U.S. House runoff for her late husband’s seat Saturday night.",
            "But who she will face remained too early to call. With nearly all votes counted, Republican Jake Ellzey led Democrat Jana Lynne Sanchez by 354 votes in the race for the second runoff spot in Texas’ 6th Congressional District, which has long been GOP territory.",
            "Ellzey is a state lawmaker who narrowly lost the GOP nomination for the seat in 2018 and carried the backing of former Texas Gov. Rick Perry. It is the second time Sanchez has run for the seat after losing to Ron Wright in 2018.",
            "The date of the runoff has not yet been announced.",
            "Just weeks into his second term, Rep. Ron Wright died in February after being diagnosed with COVID-19. He was 67 and had also been battling lung cancer. Susan Wright, a GOP activist, was quickly seen as a favorite after entering the race and was endorsed by former President Donald Trump days before the election. She led with more than 19% of the vote.",
            "The North Texas district includes the booming corridor between Dallas and Fort Worth, but it also extends to rural counties that have helped the GOP maintain control. But Trump also saw his support in the district plummet in last year’s election, carrying the district by just three points — a sharp fall from his double-digit advantage there in 2016.",
            "Sanchez was among 10 Democrats in the running, but the race attracted virtually no attention from the party nationally after its massive expectations for Texas in 2020 foundered.",
            "Most of the Republicans in the running had made flagrant appeals to Trump and his supporters in a race that at times has resembled a typical Texas GOP primary. The lone exception was Michael Wood, a combat veteran whose campaign was an early test for Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, who is trying to lead a revolt in his party away from Trump.",
            "But Wood saw few voters answering his call to reject Trumpism, hovering at around 3% of the vote."

            "Adam Briggle’s son loves sports. He’s good at them, too; the 13-year-old just mastered his double backflip in gymnastics and earned his second-degree black belt in taekwondo.",
            "The boy is also trans and lives in Texas. To say the last few months have been stressful for the Briggle family would be an understatement.",
            "When it comes to the wave of bills targeting transgender youth filed in more than 30 state legislatures this year, Texas might be the boldest in its proposals.",
            "More than 120 bills in different parts of the country would directly affect trans youth by attempting to criminalize parents or doctors for providing gender-affirming medical care, as well as by banning trans children from competing in sports.\n\nThe proposed legislation goes against recommendation from the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Psychiatric Association ― groups that recognize the significant mental health harms from such laws. (As a demographic, trans youth has suicide attempt rates as high as 40% ― though a recent Harvard Medical School study showed that laws that work to limit transgender discrimination result in a drastic decrease in suicidal thoughts and plans.)\n\nAmong the most talked-about legislation are bills that seek to ban transgender girls from competing on girls’ sports teams in public schools. Such measures have been enacted in Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee and Mississippi, and implemented in South Dakota by an executive order from Republican Gov. Kristi Noem.\n\nIn the Briggles’ home state of Texas, a similar bill drew criticism from more than 1,000 employers across the state and the NCAA, which threatened to cancel future sports championships in the state if it were enacted.",
            "Some bills threaten to define gender-affirming treatment and medical care as child abuse. For instance, Texas’s SB1646, which gained initial passage from the state Senate, would make it a crime for parents to allow their transgender kids to get gender-affirming medical procedures.",
            "“It’s hard not to talk about some of this with our son and our daughter, who’s 8,” Briggle said. “My wife, Amber, and I could go to jail and have our son taken away from us. This has caused a great deal of stress and anxiety [in our home].”",
            "They don’t just talk about the legislation at home, they take action.",
            "“Our family organized a rally in front of the office of our state representative, who’s a co-sponsor of one of the child abuse bills,” Adam Briggle said. “We got 150 people to come out in support of trans rights. My daughter was on the front lines, standing up for her brother. My son made a sign that said, ‘My parents are NOT child abusers.’” Briggle’s daughter also wrote an email to their state representatives.",
            "As parents, Briggle said he and his wife “try to shield our children from the emotional burden of the situation but without dismissing its seriousness or invalidating their worries.”",
            "In these uncertain, worrying times for trans kids, that’s the right balance to strike, said Alexis Bleich, a social worker and the clinical director of Kip Therapy, a New York City therapy group specializing in gender, sexual and racial identities.",
            "“You don’t want to try to hide what’s happening,” she told HuffPost. “You can make current events and politics a topic of discussion in age-appropriate ways while not letting your worries and fears for your child become their worries and fears.”",
            "Once a trans child recognizes they have an ally and support system in their parents, there are other actionable steps parents can take to support and protect their children. Here’s what therapists and parents like Briggle say they’re doing right now.",
            "Remind kids that they’re loved unconditionally and that you and many others are fighting for their rights.",
            "For Briggle and his family, much of this last year has been spent reminding his son of a few core truths: First, that he is loved unconditionally by his family, friends and community; and second, that advocates and activists are doing all they can to fight for kids like him.",
            "“We remind him that many allies are working hard to oppose these bills, and they’ve got your back, too,” the dad said.",
            "Briggle also reminds his son that many marginalized people in American history have had to fight very hard for their basic rights ― “even the right to exist.”",
            "“I try to look at this as an opportunity for us to gain both greater understanding of those struggles and draw inspiration from people in the past,” he said. “As I tell my son, we have to hope that the arc of the moral universe bends toward justice, but we also have to realize that we have a responsibility to act.”",
            "Identify and focus on things they do have control over.",
            "One of the most effective ways to bolster mental health for kids when they feel as if so much is out of their control is to help them identify and focus on areas in their life where they do possess some power, Bleich said.",
            "“In my practice, we look at micro, meso, and macro areas of control ― think about self, family and friends, and the larger community ― to help clients identify where they can have self-efficacy and agency,” the therapist said.",
            "For example, a teen might choose to take a break from social media and the news so that their thoughts and feelings aren’t saturated by unnerving, alarming information. Or an elementary schooler who’s feeling alienated can ask their parent to arrange to spend some time with friends, family or groups that make them feel safe and supported, Bleich said.",
            "Bleich also recommends taking a Fred Rogers “look for the helpers” approach to helping a trans child feel supported.",
            "“We can look at the many parents and legislators and public figures who are speaking out against these laws, raising money to fight these laws in legislatures and in the courts,” she said. “The ACLU in particular is doing amazing work on this, and watching some videos about the cases and people the organization is championing can help provide some concrete examples of what helpers are doing.”",
            "Remind your kids that this is less about them and more about politics.",
            "Right now, it’s important for your trans child or teen to know that there’s nothing dangerous or wrong about being trans ― and that this current legislative battle is less about them and more about ongoing cultural wars, said Jesse Kahn, the director and a sex therapist at The Gender & Sexuality Therapy Center in New York City.",
            "“Hearing about all of the different ways trans people are under attack can naturally make them feel shame or fear,” Kahn said. “You can approach this by helping them understand that the anti-trans legislation is not based in facts about trans people, but rather it’s being used as part of a tool in a political struggle for power.”",
            "If kids ask, “Why is this anyone’s business?” Kahn recommends saying, “Of course it’s not their business.” Then ask kids to consider another question: What is someone gaining out of making this their business?",
            "“This takes the burden and shame off of trans youth and places it back where it should be, onto those pushing the anti-trans legislation,” he said.",
            "Explain the push for this kind of legislation in age-appropriate ways.",
            "For younger kids, Bleich recommends explaining the push for these anti-LGBTQ bills in the simplest way possible. She recommends something like:",
            "“When people are faced with something that they don’t understand, they can become scared and angry. Sometimes this is because not understanding something or noticing that things around you are changing a lot can make people feel small and powerless. And that feeling can make them want to lash out at other people or at what is making them feel this way. It’s not fair and it’s not nice. What we can focus on as a family is how we will keep you safe and how we can join the work of keeping other kids safe too.”",
            "Older kids may already sense that some of these laws are being pushed forward because they give politicians an edge with certain groups. That adds an extra level of difficulty to these already challenging conversations, said Jessica, mother of a 16-year-old trans child in Colorado who chose to use her first name only for privacy.",
            "“What’s especially hurtful to my child is that they understand that most of the lawmakers pushing these laws don’t really care about these issues that much and that they are using trans kids as a political tool.”",
            "“It’s really devastating to our whole family to think that the most vulnerable kids in our country are being used as a political cudgel, and these legislators don’t care,” the mom said.",
            "To counter that hostility, Jessica said she tries to give the teen lots of space and support. She also reminds them that no matter what laws are passed, she and her husband’s priority is getting affirming appropriate health care for the teen.",
            "“I let my child know that mom and dad will make sure that happens and that they never have to worry about having to figure it out on their own,” she said.",
            "Give your kid a chance to just be a kid, too.",
            "It’s important to keep a close eye on your child’s moods and habits ― and even consider a mental health day off from school if they need one ― and it’s equally important to maintain as much normality as possible, Briggle said.",
            "“I want to allow space for my son to process but avoid him spiraling into doom and depression,” he said.",
            "To that end, the family has tried to lean into doing things they know the 13-year-old loves.",
            "“There’s been lots of tacos and ice cream,” he said. “Whatever you do for family time, be more intentional about creating those fun spaces where our kids can just be kids.",
            "Talk to them even when you’re not sure they’re listening.",
            "April, a mom of an 11-year-old son who’s trans, lives in Texas. Right now, her son is afraid that he’s not going to be able to go on testosterone at 16 like he had planned. The family has also been saving for top surgery.",
            "“Dysphoria is such a big hurdle for us,” said April, who asked to use only her first name to protect her family’s privacy. “We have to compromise on showers because some days he just can’t manage to look at himself. I allow him to wear oversized clothing that helps hide his body.”",
            "She’s made a point to check in with him even more than usual to see how he’s handling hearing about these new proposals. The mom admits she doesn’t have all the answers all the time, but she tries to find them. She casually checks in with her son even when she’s not sure if it’s making a dent.",
            "“Until recently I thought he believed we were just talking, then he came to me and said thank you, just out of the blue. When I asked what for, he told me for making sure he’s OK and for caring about his emotions,” she said.",
            "“I may not have all the answers or do everything right, but I knew that day that I was at least on the right track,” she added.",
            "Remind them that the majority of Americans oppose anti-transgender laws.",
            "Emphasize to your kids that Americans are coming around to trans rights: Two-thirds of Americans are against this current wave of legislation restricting trans rights, according to a new PBS NewsHour/NPR/Marist poll. That opposition includes majorities of every political ideology, from liberal to conservative, and every age group.",
            "According to the Human Rights Campaign, 7 in 10 voters support the Equality Act, which would explicitly extend the nondiscrimination protections enshrined in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to the LGBTQ community, ensuring that people are legally protected from being discriminated against based on their sexual orientation and gender identity.",
            "“As a parent, you need to shift attention away from the few bullies and toward the bigger picture,” Briggle said.",
            "As the dad sees it, the support for transgender rights grows as more and more people get to know someone who is transgender.",
            "“Support is strongest among younger generations,” he said. “Remind your kids that these bills are the dying gasps of an old, exclusionary world order.”"

            "What we know about COVID-19 seems to change by the minute.",
            "It’s understandable, given the massive scale of the pandemic. Right now, more than 150 million cases have been confirmed around the world. And even a year into the pandemic, the virus and ways to address it are still relatively new to the medical world, so researchers are learning as they go.",
            "The amount of information out there about the coronavirus is dizzying. It’s hard to keep track of what’s known, what’s a myth and what guidance we should follow. That’s why we’ve rounded up five of the most important new things we learned about COVID-19 in April:\n\n1. That blood clots have been linked to the Johnson & Johnson vaccine — but they’re extremely rare.\n\nThe single-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine grabbed a lot of headlines in April when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Food and Drug Administration called for a temporary pause on distribution of the vaccine.\n\nThe groups stated that “out of an abundance of caution” they were looking into a handful of incidents in which some recipients (all women, most under the age of 50) developed a rare disorder involving blood clots and low blood platelets within two weeks of receiving their shot.\n\nThe CDC and FDA have now reported that there are 15 known cases of women who have experienced this extremely rare outcome within two weeks of vaccination. That means it is an outcome seen in 1.9 people per every million people given the shot.\n\nGiven how rare the cases are — and the risk that COVID-19 continues to pose — the groups reapproved the vaccine, though it now carries a warning about the extremely rare outcome.\n\n“The benefits of the vaccine continue to outweigh these risks, and we now have detailed information in the labeling that alerts to these risks,” EMA Executive Director Emer Cooke said. “We’re confident that it can be rolled out appropriately.”\n\n2. There *could* be a link between vaccination and menstrual cycle changes.\n\nIn April, many anecdotes began bubbling up on Twitter and in news stories about women who have experienced period-related changes after vaccination. Specifically, some women report they are experiencing increased flow as well as late menstrual cycles.\n\nHealth experts don’t really have much (or really any) concrete information about a possible vaccination/menstruation link at this point, in part because period-related symptoms weren’t tracked during the clinical trials. But also, periods can be a really challenging thing to study.\n\n“Menstruation is a complex process, which can be influenced by many factors, such as environmental changes, stress, sleep and some medications,” Dr. Danielle Jones, a board-certified obstetrician-gynecologist based in Texas, previously told HuffPost.\n\nUltimately, while the potential changes are something that women’s health experts are paying more attention to, and that women themselves might want to be aware of, there’s no real concern that these could be lasting, serious changes.\n\nIn general, women who do experience heavier menstrual cycles after they receive the COVID-19 vaccine should stick to what’s typically recommended when grappling with a heavy period, like taking an anti-inflammatory over-the-counter medication or applying heat.\n\nIn addition, anyone who experiences intense symptoms after their vaccine is encouraged to submit a report via the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).\n\n3. Pregnant women may be at higher risk for serious outcomes from COVID-19 than previously thought.\n\nCOVID-19 might pose a greater risk to pregnant women and their babies than previously understood, an April study warned.\n\n“Women with COVID-19 during pregnancy were over 50% more likely to experience pregnancy complications (such as premature birth, pre-eclampsia, admission to intensive care and death) compared to pregnant women unaffected by COVID-19,” said study researcher Dr. Aris Papageorghiou, a professor of fetal Medicine at the University of Oxford in England in a press statement.\n\nNewborns whose mothers were infected with COVID-19 were also nearly three times more likely to develop severe medical complications, most of which were due to preterm birth.\n\nHowever, those increased risks appear to be concentrated in women who develop symptomatic COVID-19.\n\n“The good news, however, is that the risks in symptomless infected women and non-infected women were similar,” Papageorghiou added.\n\nAnd experts stress that COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective for pregnant women.\n\n4. Younger children really are less likely to spread the virus.\n\nUnfortunately, much of the conversation about children and COVID-19 that has been happening at a policy level and on social media lacks nuance — especially when it comes to how much risk children pose to others.\n\nNew research published in April that looked at data from Israel — where schools have opened and closed several times during the pandemic — added some clarity to the the question of how much children contribute to the spread of the coronavirus in their community, finding that younger students (up to age 9) have very low rates of transmission.\n\n“Our study’s findings suggest that children aged 0 to 9 years did not have substantial rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection during school attendance periods, and it may be assumed that they did not have a substantial role in COVID-19 spread either during this period,” the researchers wrote.\n\nThey could not, however, confirm that the same was true of adolescents, and recommended that: “It is probably safer to resume school attendance for youths aged 10 to 19 years only when the epidemic is under control and after implementation of steps to decrease spread in schools.”\n\n5. COVID-19 vaccines don’t pose an increased risk for facial paralysis.\n\nIn initial clinical trials for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, a handful of participants developed Bell’s palsy — a condition that causes sudden weakness on half of the face, often in response to a viral infection.\n\nBecause of that, the FDA has been monitoring people who’ve received those vaccines for potential instances of paralysis since last winter, while emphasizing all along that it does not consider Bell’s palsy to be a side effect of the vaccines.\n\nNew research published in April supports that claim, finding there is no sign that COVID-19 vaccines should increase a person’s risk for developing facial paralysis, or related events (like facial spasms). The researchers analyzed more than 133,000 instances of adverse vaccine reactions that were reported to the World Health Organization, and found that less than 1% were related to facial paralysis.\n\nThey note that that is on par with what is reported in relation to other viral vaccines, as well as among those who receive the flu shot.\n\n“The risk,” the researchers wrote in the JAMA Internal Medicine, “is likely very low, as with other viral vaccines.”\n\nExperts are still learning about COVID-19. The information in this story is what was known or available as of publication, but guidance can change as scientists discover more about the virus. Please check the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the most updated recommendations."

            "Vice President Kamala Harris and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi made history on Wednesday, marking the first time two women shared the stage sitting behind President Joe Biden during his first congressional speech.",
            "“Madame Speaker, Madame Vice President,” Biden began his speech, gesturing to the women behind him. “No president has ever said those words from this podium, and it’s about time.”",
            "Harris has already made history during Biden’s presidency by becoming the first Black person, Indian American and woman to hold the position of the vice presidency.",
            "During a president’s speech to the joint session of Congress, it is custom for two politicians in power to sit behind him: the vice president and the speaker of the House. Should the president be unable to carry the duties of his office, the constitutional line of succession begins with the vice president ― in this case, Harris, a woman ― and then the House speaker ― in this case, Pelosi, also a woman.",
            "“It says a lot about a country, and a lot about Joe Biden, and it says certainly a lot about both women who have made it to that place. It’s going to be very emotional for me,” former Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), who once served alongside Pelosi in the House and whose Senate seat Harris filled when she retired, told CBS.",
            "Both Pelosi and Harris grew their political careers in California’s Bay Area, and knocked down systemic barriers meant to prevent women ― particularly women of color ― from rising in the ranks. Pelosi grew up with a father and brother who both served as Baltimore’s mayor, and a mother who stayed politically active by organizing Democratic women.",
            "Harris, whose political experiences were also shaped by her upbringing, was the daughter of Indian and Jamaican civil rights activists who met each other while out protesting. The vice president has repeatedly said that her mother would often tell her: “You may be the first to do many things. Make sure you’re not the last.”",
            "Earlier Wednesday, Pelosi told MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell that the historic nature of two women sitting in their respective positions for the speech is “pretty exciting.”",
            "“It’s wonderful to make history. It’s about time,” she told Mitchell. “I made history when I was the first speaker to be standing behind President [George W.] Bush. And he made note of that. Now this is just so exciting.”",
            "The California Democrat served as speaker from 2007 to 2011, and then again in 2019 when Democrats regained control of the House. Republicans John Boehner and Paul Ryan served in the position between Pelosi’s speakership.",
            "“For our daughters and granddaughters, today we have broken the marble ceiling,” she said when elected speaker for the first time in 2007. “Now the sky is the limit. Anything is possible.”",
            "About 200 people attended Biden’s congressional speech ― largely due to the pandemic ― a change from the usual 1,600 people who are present for the event. It’s also the first time in several years that the president, vice president and speaker all belong to the same political party."

            "Biden made 67 false and misleading statements in his first 100 days in office, according to a report Monday from The Washington Post’s fact checker. That compares to 511 such comments from his predecessor Donald Trump in his first 100 days.",
            "The Post’s fact checkers characterized the Biden era as “a return to a more typical pattern when it comes to a commander in chief and his relationship with the facts — one that features frequent spin and obfuscation or exaggeration, with the occasional canard.”",
            "The team analyzed Biden’s every speech, interview, tweet or public statement, following the same methodology as the database that tallied more than 30,500 false or misleading claims over the course of Trump’s four years in office.",
            "The Post made several notes on the difference between the two presidents.",
            "Biden has spoken around 40% fewer words than Trump had by this point in his presidency. His public remarks are typically prepared, in contrast to Trump, who was known for his lengthy, stream-of-consciousness-style speeches.",
            "Biden has also tweeted considerably less than his predecessor and tends not to repeat his false claims if they’ve been fact-checked and shown to be false.",
            "Two of Biden’s falsehoods have earned the Post’s “Four Pinocchio” rating, designated for “whoppers.” He claimed several times that Georgia’s GOP-led election law will end voting hours early. It won’t. The other is Biden’s claim that federal government contracts awarded to foreign companies went up by 30% under Trump, when in fact it was likely much less.",
            "The fact-checking analysts noted that when Biden made exaggerated claims, he would often amend his wording in subsequent addresses in apparent response to news coverage.",
            "Trump’s tally grew at a dramatically faster rate as his presidency progressed. Toward the end of his term, he was making around twice as many false claims a month as he did in his entire first year in office. On Nov. 2, the day before the election, Trump made 504 false claims in a day, nearly the same amount he made in his first 100 days.",

The ads will run in Arizona, Virginia and West Virginia ― states with moderate Democratic senators whose support, or lack of it, could determine the bill’s fate.",
            "All members of the Senate’s Democratic caucus have co-sponsored the bill except for Sens. Mark Kelly and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Mark Warner of Virginia. Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia said last week that he will support the bill.",

            "Here’s the ad that’s running in Arizona:",
            "The theme of the ad campaign is “getting a return on your hard work shouldn’t be this hard.” John Weber, an AFL-CIO spokesperson, said that in addition to local TV advertising, the federation will be running digital ads across the country urging people to call their senators.",
            "“We’re taking nothing for granted,” Weber said in an email. “The PRO Act is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to give working people a stronger voice on the job.”",
            "The PRO Act would make for the most dramatic overhaul of U.S. labor law in more than 70 years. The bill would ramp up penalties against employers that illegally break unions; make it harder for employers to bog down organizing campaigns through litigation; overturn “right-to-work” laws that weaken unions; and make it easier for workers to secure their first union contracts, among other significant changes.",
            "The snowballing support behind the PRO Act has created a lot of excitement in labor circles, although the path for passage remains extremely narrow. The bill has already passed the House this year, but Democrats hold a bare 50-50 majority in the Senate with Vice President Kamala Harris casting the tie-breaking vote.",
            "To pass their version, Senate Democrats would need to get every member of the caucus on board, then either dispense with the legislative filibuster or find a way to make the proposal work under reconciliation rules.",
            "For now, the priority for unions is getting the last Democratic holdouts to sign on to the legislation. They recently gained the support of Sen. Angus King, a Maine independent who caucuses with Democrats, after pressure from a coalition of labor groups and phone calls from members of the Democratic Socialists of America.",
            "Much of the advocacy behind the PRO Act has been driven by the AFL-CIO and one of its member unions, the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades. IUPAT and other backers of the law have called for Democrats to end the filibuster to make its passage more possible.",
            "Union density in the U.S. has fallen dramatically in recent decades, with only around 1 in 10 workers now belonging to a union. That’s about half of what the rate was in 1983 when the federal government first started tracking.",
            "Labor groups and academics have complained for years that the playing field is tilted to the advantage of employers, who now aggressively beat back organizing drives with anti-union campaigns. PRO Act backers are citing the recent failed unionization effort at an Amazon warehouse in Alabama, where the retail giant hired “union avoidance” consultants, as a prime example of why labor laws should be reformed."

He repeated Trump’s false assertion that a number of states had “unconstitutionally violated election law” as the reason for his actions. “I will always receive an A rating defending the Constitution,” he said.",
            "Trump lost the Nov. 3 election to Democrat Joe Biden by more than 7 million votes nationally and lost 306-232 in the Electoral College. He nonetheless started lying in the wee hours of Nov. 4 that he had won in “a landslide” and that his victory was being stolen from him.",
            "Those lies culminated Jan. 6 in a violent attack on the U.S. Capitol, which was incited by Trump’s request that the followers he had urged to come to Washington that day march on the building to intimidate his vice president and Congress into voiding enough states that Biden had won to allow Trump to be declared the winner.",
            "The scheme failed when Mike Pence refused to go along with it and followed the Constitution to declare Biden the new president.",
            "The “GOP Democracy Report Card,” released Monday, lets voters quickly see whether and to what extent their particular members of Congress went along with Trump’s attempts to overturn the election result and hang on to power despite losing. The Republican Accountability Project, an outgrowth of the same group that aired millions of dollars of “Republican Voters Against Trump” ads in the last election, looks at four specific criteria: whether they signed onto the Texas lawsuit that tried to let Trump “win” by canceling tens of millions of votes in four states won by Biden; whether they voted against certifying the results of the election; whether they made public statements supporting Trump’s election lies; and whether they voted to impeach or, for senators, convict Trump for inciting the Jan. 6 riot.",
            "One hundred and twenty-six GOP House members signed an amicus brief backing the Texas lawsuit; 139 Republican House members and eight senators voted to block certifying at least one state, even after the attack on the Capitol; and only 10 GOP House members voted to impeach Trump over the Jan. 6 attack and just seven senators voted to convict him.",
            "Troye said the rating used the members’ public statements in addition to concrete actions because they contributed to many Republican voters’ loss of confidence in the country’s elections. “You are going along with the big lie. You are contributing to the undermining of our democracy by doing that,” she said."

            "A juror in Derek Chauvin’s trial said the former Minneapolis police officer showed no remorse during the high-profile proceedings for murdering George Floyd.",
            "Brandon Mitchell, one of the 12 jurors who convicted Chauvin last week, told CNN that Chauvin seemed confident at the start of the trial, but that changed as the nearly 40 prosecution witnesses took the stand.",
            "“As the case went on, his demeanor kind of changed to more of a confused look as this isn’t how it’s supposed to go,” said Mitchell, a 31-year-old basketball coach. “I didn’t see any remorse.”",
            "The 12 jurors and two alternates were anonymous and referred to only by their juror numbers during the trial. Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill on Friday ordered that the jurors’ identities remain sealed for at least six months, citing concerns for potential harassment and unwanted publicity.",
            "The jury selection process revealed Mitchell ― known publicly at that point only as Juror No. 52 ― was a Black man in his 30s who described himself as a friendly, positive person, reported The Associated Press. He told the court at the time that he had neutral opinions on Chauvin and Floyd.",
            "Mitchell, the first juror who decided Chauvin’s guilt to speak publicly, described the trial as “dark” and “stressful.”",
            "“It felt like every day was a funeral and watching someone die every day,” he told CNN. “It was tense every day. I wasn’t nervous, but it was stressful. It was a lot of pressure.”",
            "After a weekslong trial and about 10 hours of deliberation, the jury found Chauvin guilty of second- and third-degree murder as well as second-degree manslaughter. Chauvin is being held in solitary confinement in Minnesota’s maximum-security prison as he awaits sentencing. He faces decades in prison.",
            "Mitchell gave his first TV interview since the trial on Wednesday, telling ABC’s “Good Morning America” that the deliberation process was “straightforward” with “a few hiccups” regarding jury instructions and legal terminology.",
            "Asked if the protests sparked by Floyd’s death and other police killings of Black men influenced the jury’s decision, Mitchell said no.",
            "“We weren’t watching the news, so we don’t know what was going on,” he said. “You’re watching somebody die on a daily basis, so that stress alone is enough to take your mind away from whatever is going on outside the four walls of the courtroom.”",
            "Like alternate juror Lisa Christensen, who spoke out last week, Mitchell said testimony from Dr. Martin Tobin, a pulmonologist who served as an expert for the prosecution, played a major role in Chauvin’s conviction. Tobin, using video of Floyd’s arrest, explained to jurors exactly how Floyd died while his neck was pinned to the pavement by Chauvin’s knee.",
            "“I thought that really solidified the prosecution’s case,” Mitchell said.",
            "Mitchell said Chauvin’s choice not to testify “definitely” affected the outcome of the trial.",
            "“A few people ... were curious on what his thoughts might have been throughout,” Mitchell said. “It probably was to his detriment that he didn’t take the stand.”",
            "Floyd’s family and their supporters cheered Chauvin’s conviction last week and encouraged Americans to continue fighting for systemic change in policing practices and demanding accountability for deaths at the hands of police.",
            "Mitchell said Wednesday that Floyd’s legacy will “hopefully” create change.",
            "Floyd’s “name is going to live on,” he said. “His legacy is now cemented in history.”"

            "Fossil fuel trade groups in Louisiana and New Mexico rallied Democratic governors in opposition to President Joe Biden’s executive order pausing new oil and gas leasing on federal lands and in offshore waters, newly released emails show.",
            "The Biden administration paused new leases on Jan. 27 and launched a major review of the federal oil and gas leasing program. Interior Department officials have said the program currently is “not serving the American public well.”",
            "The behind-the-scenes lobbying included the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil & Gas Association (LMOGA) introducing top energy officials in Louisiana and New Mexico to each other. LMOGA also provided the Louisiana official with industry talking points about how restricting oil and gas development would hurt the state’s economy, and it helped ghostwrite a letter that Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards (D) sent to Biden arguing, among other things, that confronting climate effects depends on continued offshore fossil fuel development.",
            "The communications highlight the growing role regional industry associations play in fighting climate action as pressure mounts on big-name companies and highly visible national groups to put a softer face on regulatory obstruction.",
            "Edwards and New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham (D) have both spoken out against the Biden administration’s leasing freeze, publicly and in letters to the president. Louisiana joined more than a dozen other states in suing the administration over the executive order, and Lujan Grisham requested New Mexico be exempt from the pause because of its climate change initiatives and greenhouse gas emission reductions. Both states are major oil and gas producers and rely heavily on revenue from fossil fuel development.",
            "“These documents show that the Lujan Grisham and Bel Edwards administrations are valuable assets in the oil industry’s fight against President Biden’s public lands policies,” said Jesse Coleman, a senior investigator with the watchdog group Documented.",
            "Documented and the Energy and Policy Institute, another watchdog organization, obtained the communications via state public records requests and shared them exclusively with HuffPost.",
            "The day before Biden was expected to sign his order, Lori LeBlanc, vice president of LMOGA, emailed an Edwards staffer to request a meeting to “discuss the federal executive orders around the leasing and drilling permit bans on federal lands and offshore,” falsely characterizing the upcoming order as an all-out ban. Documents show she and other representatives of the oil trade group had a Zoom meeting Jan. 27 with Edwards’ staff, including Thomas Harris, secretary of Louisiana’s Department of Natural Resources, and Chip Kline, executive assistant to the governor for coastal activities and the chair of the state’s Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority Board.",
            "The following day, LMOGA President Tyler Gray copied Harris in an email to Ryan Flynn, executive director of the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association (NMOGA).",
            "“Perhaps there’s a way that NMOGA and LMOGA can work with the governors of New Mexico and Louisiana to approach the Administration in a collaborative way to give consideration for the critical importance of the natural gas and oil industry in our respective states,” Gray wrote.",
            "Harris promptly responded, thanking Gray for connecting him with the New Mexico trade group. “I appreciate the introduction and look forward to working with NMOGA and Governor Grisham’s staff,” he wrote. “We certainly share a common interest.”",
            "Things progressed quickly from there. Flynn connected Harris with Harris’s counterpart in New Mexico, Sarah Propst, secretary of the state’s Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department, as well as Adriene Sandoval, director of the department’s Oil Conservation Division. Propst and Harris agreed to meet the following week, on Feb. 3.",
            "“I believe that New Mexico and Louisiana have many shared interest [sic] and that we can work together cooperatively on this and on future issues,” Harris wrote to Propst. The heads of both industry trade groups were copied on emails throughout the exchange.",
            "On Feb. 4, LMOGA connected Harris to the Petroleum Association of Wyoming, which in 2019 joined a lawsuit aimed at allowing the government to greenlight oil and gas development on federal lands without considering the effects on the climate. That same day, Harris spoke at a webinar that LMOGA hosted. During the event, he outlined Edwards’s efforts to push back against the leasing freeze and convince the Biden administration that “cutting domestic production is NOT the path forward,” according to prepared talking points obtained through records requests. That effort, he told the industry group, included “listening to the concerns of CEOs and industry representatives,” as well as reaching out to governors, members of Congress and the Biden administration.",
            "Instead of making “public, inflammatory comments that would impair his effectiveness in getting a seat at the table and having our legitimate concerns heard,” Edwards “is trying [to] have actual influence on Federal Energy Policy moving forward,” Harris’s prepared remarks read. “Toward that goal, we would certainly welcome any information, data or talking points that your companies believe might help in that cause. Gov. Edwards is planning to speak to Biden’s [Department of Energy] secretary nominee Jennifer Granholm next week and it is not too late to update his talking points.”",
            "The document goes on to note that during a meeting with LMOGA’s president and other industry leaders the day before, Edwards “instructed” Harris to “work with Tyler [Gray] in drafting a letter for [Edwards’s] signature,” in which the governor would ask the administration to continue issuing permits on existing leases. “We are working with LMOGA staff to craft language for that letter,” Harris’s document says.",
            "Shauna Sanford, a spokesperson for Edwards, told HuffPost the governor’s team regularly seeks input from stakeholders, including industry leaders and community groups, as it works to understand and assess potential effects of federal policy decisions.",
            "“The Louisiana Dept. of Natural Resources has expertise in many aspects of the exploration and production but does not regulate or directly interact with [outer continental shelf] energy activity,” she said in an email. “Therefore, Secretary Tom Harris and his staff did vet and make use of information provided by LMOGA that appeared to be verifiable and relevant in creating a draft letter for the Governor’s review. LMOGA was one source of several used by the state in drafting letters written on the subject.”",
            "Sanford confirmed that LMOGA assisted with the letter Edwards sent to Biden on Feb. 19, in which the governor swung back against the leasing pause and touted the state’s efforts to address climate change and reduce emissions.",
            "“I urge you to keep in mind that our ability to address Louisiana’s climate related challenges, improve our structural resilience to catastrophic weather events, combat coastal land loss, and reduce our carbon footprint relies heavily on sustainable and predictable oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico,” Edwards wrote. The pause, he added, “creates uncertainty in our coastal planning process.”",
            "Of course, business-as-usual fossil fuel production could lock in potentially catastrophic economic and environmental damage not only in Louisiana but also across the globe.",
            "In New Mexico, Lujan Grisham’s staff communicated “frequently with large operators and the trade associations,” including NMOGA and the Independent Petroleum Association of New Mexico, Caroline Buerkle, one of the governor's top staffers, wrote in a March 12 email response to a county official who reached out about Biden’s executive orders.",
            "Though it was LMOGA and NMOGA that connected the New Mexico administration to Louisiana officials, the documents HuffPost reviewed do not show industry associations directly shaping New Mexico’s response in the way that they did Louisiana’s.",
            "“NMOGA and other industry groups have not been involved at all in New Mexico’s response to the Biden administration’s policies and directives,” Nora Meyers Sackett, a spokeswoman for Lujan Grisham, said in an email response. “State officials frequently and productively communicate and collaborate with other states, nonprofits, local government officials as well as industry groups as we not only develop and execute innovative clean-energy policies but ensure federal regulations do not overly or unnecessarily burden New Mexico’s budgetary outlook.”",
            "In addition to a letter Lujan Grisham sent to Biden on March 15, Propst wrote to top Interior Department officials in February informing them that the leasing pause had resulted in “on-the-ground uncertainties that undermine our ability to safeguard New Mexico’s economy and environment.”",
            "Around the same time that NMOGA was communicating with Lujan Grisham’s office about Biden’s order, the industry association was celebrating its success in lobbying for changes to a proposed state rule regulating methane pollution, as The Guardian reported last week. During a Feb. 10 presentation to its board, NMOGA said the state had accepted 72 of its 173 suggested changes to the rule.",
            "The “process has been fruitful,” the group wrote in its presentation, adding that there had been “significant changes in favor of industry.”",

            "DIXON, Illinois ― President Joe Biden’s administration is set to push to make community college tuition-free across the country, a potentially revolutionary policy that could nonetheless disappoint progressives who hope to persuade him to turn a campaign plan to make four-year public colleges free into a reality.",
            "On Monday, first lady Jill Biden and Education Secretary Miguel Cardona traveled to Sauk Valley Community College here to extol the virtues of the nation’s community colleges as economic boosters and institutions open to all economic and social classes. It’s a familiar role for Jill Biden, a longtime professor at Northern Virginia Community College who has spent much of the past decade pushing to make community colleges free.",
            "“Community colleges are our future,” Biden said, without ever directly mentioning her husband’s yet-to-be-formally-unveiled plan to make them tuition-free. (The president is expected to lay out his proposal, part of the broader American Families Plan, during a Wednesday address to Congress.)",
            "There is relatively little intra-Democratic debate over free community college. Progressives and moderates have both embraced the idea, which has broad support in public surveys. More than a dozen states, including several controlled by Republicans, have made attending the two-year schools free over the past decade, and mounting evidence suggests the programs have enticed more low-income students to earn associate’s degrees or complete job-training programs that are often essential to economic survival in 21st-century America.",
            "“We are reimagining our education system from pre-school to college,” Biden said, adding later: “We can’t continue to exclude some people from continuing their education just because they’re from the wrong income bracket.”",
            "But there is some fear among progressives that the administration could use successful passage of free community college to avoid more controversial moves to make higher education more affordable.",
            "“It’s fantastic that community colleges have won the lottery and have a tremendous advocate in the first lady,” said Melissa Byrne, a former staffer for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign who has pushed the White House to cancel student debt. “But that doesn’t mean we have to have a decade where we just have free community college, then move on to free four-year institutions.”",
            "The White House declined to specify what would be in the plan rolled out this week, with an official promising only that it would “focus squarely on creating economic security for the middle class through investments in childcare, education, and other areas.”",
            "This past week, Sanders and Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) introduced legislation to make public colleges and universities, along with historically Black colleges and universities and other schools focused on serving racial minorities, free for all families making less than $125,000 a year. The federal government would pick up 75% of the cost ― paid for with a tax on financial transactions that Sanders says would raise $2.2 trillion over the next decade ― with states picking up the remaining 25% of the tab.",
            "The legislation closely tracks a plan then-candidate Biden rolled out not long after locking up the Democratic nomination, when he was courting supporters of Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. The idea would also almost certainly generate resistance.",
            "Sanders pitched the idea of tuition-free college to Cardona during a call earlier this month, according to a Democratic aide. But while lobbying efforts have emerged to include progressive health care priorities in the American Families Plan, no similar effort has emerged to include free four-year colleges so far.",
            "Instead, most progressive efforts on higher education since the beginning of Biden’s presidency have focused on convincing his administration of the political, legal and policy merits of a mass cancellation of billions of dollars of already-existing student debt. Warren and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) have led a push to convince Biden to cancel up to $50,000 of student debt per person.",
            "The White House has directed Cardona to review the administration’s options. During the campaign, Biden supported canceling up to $10,000 of student debt per person ― but through congressional action, not by a unilateral presidential move.",
            "Still, progressives are saying any action on student debt needs to be paired with efforts to make college cheaper now, in order to avoid the need for future mass cancellations.",
            "“You can’t do one without the other. You can’t just cancel, and you can’t just make college free,” said an aide to a progressive Democratic senator who requested anonymity to discuss intraparty dynamics. “You’ll just end up in the same situation you are, with a matching debt crisis in a decade.”",
            "But both doing mass debt forgiveness and pushing for tuition-free college would require a massive investment of political capital from Biden, particularly when compared to making community college tuition-free.",
            "“There’s no political downside to doing community college,” said Lanae Erickson, the vice president for social policy at Third Way, a moderate Democratic think tank, noting community colleges tend to be popular with nearly every segment of the electorate.",
            "Another Democratic operative noted free community college could put some House Republicans on the defensive. Many of the nation’s largest community colleges, including Miami-Dade College in Florida, the College of Southern Nevada in Las Vegas and Lone Star College in Houston, are located in areas with multiple swing-seat House districts.",
            "Erickson noted Biden would likely also move to increase funding for Pell Grants to help low-income students attend college.",
            "“There’s not an unlimited amount of federal higher education investment to go around,” she said. “It’s an easier lift.”",
            "In a supplemental budget released earlier this month, Biden proposed a $400 increase to the maximum Pell Grant, bringing the top value of the yearly grant to nearly $7,000.",
            "While both increased Pell Grants and free community college are political winners and potential policy game-changers, neither is likely to satisfy progressives who view Biden’s presidency as a once-in-generation opportunity to transition away from a debt-financed higher education system to once primarily funded by the government.",
            "“This White House is really committed to educational equity,” Byrne said. “But we just need to make clear to them they don’t need to take baby steps.”",
            "Biden is off to a strong start with young voters ― 59% of Americans aged 18-29 approved of his job performance in a Harvard Institute of Politics survey released this week. But Ben Wessel, the former executive director of NextGen America, which focuses on youth voter turnout, said not doing more on college affordability could be a risk.",
            "“He’d piss off activists that he does not need to piss off,” Wessel said, “and he’d miss a chance to inspire young voters who otherwise might not be paying attention.”"

            "An effort to recall California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) officially qualified for the state’s ballot on Monday, thrusting him into a fight for his job midway through his first term in office.",
            "To make it onto the ballot, the Republican-led recall petition needed signatures from just shy of 1.5 million people, equal to 12% of the number of voters in the last election for the office. Supporters had until March 17 to meet that threshold, but election authorities just finished tallying. In the end, recall supporters submitted 1.626 million valid signatures.",
            "Officials have not yet set a date for the election, which will ask voters two simple questions: Do they want to recall the governor? And if so, who would they like to replace him? The election will likely take place later this year.",
            "The recall election comes with a price tag, too. Some officials have estimated it will cost $400 million, or about $18 per California voter. That’s more than double what was spent on the state’s elections in 2018.",
            "Newsom, who won office by a landslide in 2018 and has some not-so-secret presidential aspirations, saw his popularity plummet during the COVID-19 pandemic. While the petition began circulating before the virus began spreading last year, the crusade grew teeth as the pandemic raged across California throughout the winter, while the state’s vaccine rollout ranked among the nation’s slowest.",
            "Newsom became the target of frustrated Californians, particularly regarding business and school closures. He previously said he wouldn’t force teachers to return to in-person instruction, which teachers unions across the state say its members will not do until a certain vaccine threshold had been met. Educators opposed to hasty reopenings pointed to outbreaks across the country linked to in-person learning and noted that the risk of disease is higher for low-income students of color.",
            "Though Newsom’s popularity bounced back to more normal levels as vaccination rates increased and schools reopened, Republicans eager to unseat him seized on the school debate, promising they would do things differently. Former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer, a Donald Trump supporter who finished two terms as mayor last year, kicked off his campaign against Newsom in early February with that talking point.",
            "“Parents across California are fed up, and they are demanding that their kids be back in school. Public schools should start safely reopening now. Not next month. Not next year. Now,” said Faulconer, who arrived to his campaign announcement by school bus.",
            "Newsom’s office slammed Faulconer, his most serious challenger yet, as an obvious opportunist.",
            "“Trying to exploit a global pandemic to advance a political career exposes his craven ambition,” the governor’s chief strategist, Dan Newman, told HuffPost earlier this month.",
            "Unseating Newsom may be a long shot now, polling shows. He has a solid majority of support among likely Democrat voters, and the improved state of the pandemic, the Public Policy Institute of California found, “is likely to determine the fate of the 2021 recall.”",
            "Orange County, a traditionally red region of the state, is among the biggest contributors to the recall effort. Officials tallied more than 200,000 signatures from the 3 million-person county alone.",
            "Other Republicans who have said they plan to challenge Newsom include businessman John Cox, who lost to the governor in 2018, the far-right conspiracy theorist Mike Cernovich, and athlete-turned-reality star Caitlyn Jenner. No serious Democratic challenger has entered the race ― yet.",
            "Newsom must also contend with voters angry that he recently did allow for some parts of the economy, including outdoor dining, to reopen in January when case rates were still high across the state. He’s also haunted by an upscale, multi-household dinner he was photographed attending in November. Though it was allowed under the guidelines at that time, he admitted that “the spirit of what I’m preaching all the time was contradicted.”",
            "This marks the second time in the last 20 years ― and only the second time ever ― that a gubernatorial recall effort has made its way onto the ballot in California, which is one of just 19 states that allow voters to oust state officials before the end of their term.",
            "California voters angry over an electricity crisis and a car tax increase did just that in 2003 and replaced Gov. Gray Davis with the actor Arnold Schwarzenegger. He was one of a staggering 135 candidates to qualify for the race (including HuffPost founder Arianna Huffington), which doesn’t require a majority to win and simply hands the victory to whoever rakes in the most votes. Schwarzenegger, a Republican, ascended to power with just 48.6% support and went on to serve two terms in the deep blue state.",
            "But the circumstances are different today. While Davis won his election by a mere five-point margin in 2002, Newsom won by 24 points. Moreover, the Democratic Party now has a stronger foothold in California than it did at the time, going from a nine-point edge then to a 22-point edge today."

            "Shock G, who blended whimsical wordplay with reverence for ’70s funk as leader of the off-kilter Bay Area hip-hop group Digital Underground, has died. He was 57.",
            "Nzazi Malonga, a longtime friend who served as head of security and helped manage the group, said the rapper-producer was found unresponsive Thursday in a hotel room in Tampa, Florida. Malonga said the performer, born Greg Jacobs, had struggled with drug addiction for years.",
            "The group found fame with the Billboard Top 10 hit “Humpty Dance” in 1990, as Jacobs donned a Groucho Marx-style fake nose and glasses to become one of his many alter egos, Humpty Hump. He initially maintained the flamboyant Humpty was a separate person, doing in-character interviews and sometimes having his brother Kent Racker play the part.",
            "“Same Song” a year later served as 2Pac’s introduction to music fans, with Shock G handing the baton to the future megastar, who had been working as a roadie for Digital Underground: “2Pac, go ’head and rock this.”",
            "Jacobs was an introverted “technical wizard” adept at arranging samples who played keyboards and drums, said Digital Underground co-founder Jimi Dright, known as Chopmaster J. Dright met his future bandmate while buying equipment at a music store in San Leandro, California, where Jacobs was working.",
            "Big Boi, Chuck D, Snoop Dogg and Busta Rhymes were among those posting online tributes to Jacobs, with many expressing pain after the deaths earlier in the month of rappers DMX and Black Rob. “Our brother Shock G was a GIANT. There’s not one aspect of what we do musically that this man has not influenced,” wrote Talib Kweli.",
            "“The Humpty Dance” invited an audience of awkward youth into hip-hop with its embrace of misfits and outcasts. “Stop whatcha doin’ / ’Cause I’m about to ruin / The image and the style that ya used to,” Shock G rapped with lighthearted bravado. “I’m crazy / Allow me to amaze thee / They say I’m ugly but it just don’t faze me.”\n\n”‘The Humpty Dance’ spoke to all the people that were like him — the fat people, the unattractive people. If you moved like him, you could be whatever you want,” said Malonga.\n\nThe group’s platinum-selling debut album “Sex Packets” was titled after an imagined “sex in a pill” product product that Dright said was a response to the AIDS crisis. It was followed by the gold-selling “This is an EP Release” and “Sons of the P.”",
            "Jacobs, whose partner-in-rhyme was the smooth-voiced Money-B, was most comfortable performing in disguise and often struggled privately with the spotlight. “He got to be the star of a production that we had assembled and it ate him up. He didn’t want to be that guy,” Dright said.\n\nMalonga said Jacobs had lived with him in the Los Angeles area for several years to get sober in the early 2000s, but had relapsed and been recently living with family in Florida. He gave away much of his wealth and worked on many unfinished side projects, struggling to find validation from those around him.\n\n“He had hundreds of things he could create. He could draw, he could write music, play piano, he could score things, he could write stories and scripts,” Malonga said. “But unless someone was telling him he was OK, he would never present that.”\n\n“I was very disappointed that he didn’t really see his own talent,” he added. “He was far more humble and insecure than people thought.”"

            "President Joe Biden is reportedly preparing to formally recognize the early 20th century massacres of Armenians as genocide, a designation he pledged to make during his campaign but one that could further strain the U.S. alliance with Turkey.",
            "Biden is expected to make the announcement on Saturday, which is Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day, according to The Wall Street Journal and New York Times, citing U.S. officials. Both newspapers noted that the president could still reverse course.",
            "The Armenian Genocide of 1915-1923, as it’s recognized by 29 countries, saw the systematic mass murder and deportation of an estimated 1.5 million Armenians by the Ottoman Empire from modern-day Turkey. Those atrocities are widely viewed as a genocide among most scholars and historians. Turkey denies it constituted genocide, claiming it was a response to an Armenian uprising.",
            "In his remembrance day statement last year, Biden said that “silence is complicity” and vowed to “recognize the Armenian Genocide and make universal human rights a top priority for his administration so that such a tragedy can never again occur.”",
            "Biden has faced widespread calls to adopt the terminology that past presidents have sidestepped. Should he move forward with the announcement, it would make him the first U.S. president to formally do so. Previously, presidents have avoided that language, though Ronald Reagan had made a passing reference to it during a 1981 statement about the Holocaust.",
            "The House and Senate overwhelmingly passed nonbinding resolutions in 2019 recognizing the genocide, despite resistance from the White House under pressure from Turkey.",
            "A bipartisan group of more than 100 House lawmakers led by Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) signed a letter to Biden on Wednesday pressuring him to clearly and directly recognize the Armenian Genocide in his remembrance day statement.",
            "“The shameful silence of the United States Government on the historic fact of the Armenian Genocide has gone on for too long, and it must end. We urge you to follow through on your commitments and speak the truth,” the letter said.",
            "White House press secretary Jen Psaki did not comment on the issue Wednesday but said the president would have more to say on the subject on Saturday.",
            "Strained ties between Turkey and the U.S., both members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, deteriorated further in December, when the Trump administration imposed sanctions against Ankara over its acquisition of a Russian missile defense system. The move added to tensions already inflamed by human rights issues and regional conflicts overseen by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, with whom then-U.S. President Donald Trump shared a close relationship.",
            "Biden’s decision Saturday will serve as an early indicator of his administration’s approach to Erdogan, whom he has previously described as an “autocrat.”",
            "Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told a Turkish broadcaster this week that a genocide declaration from Biden would further “harm ties.”"

            "Wisconsin Republican Sen. Ron Johnson, who himself declined a COVID-19 vaccine, is now questioning why the American population needs to get vaccinated en masse, putting life-saving public health messaging at risk.",
            "“Why is this big push to make sure everyone gets a vaccine?” Johnson said in an appearance on conservative talk radio host Vicki McKenna’s show this week, adding that he was “highly suspicious” of the effort to mass vaccinate the general public.",
            "Johnson said he sees “no reason to be pushing vaccines on people,” saying their distribution should have been focused only at the most vulnerable populations.",
            "“If you have a vaccine, quite honestly, what do you care if your neighbor has one or not?” Johnson asked. He also questioned the efficacy of the vaccines themselves, saying they were not “fully approved” — while also arguing that not everyone needed to receive one because they are so effective.",
            "Three vaccines have been authorized by the federal government (though distribution of the Johnson & Johnson shot was briefly paused by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration last week), all of which have gone through clinical studies with tens of thousands of participants. They were authorized for distribution through a fast-tracked emergency use process.",
            "Johnson expanded on his comments in a statement to HuffPost.",
            "“Everyone should have the right to gather information, consult with their doctor and decide for themselves whether to get vaccinated,” he said. “I believe government’s role (and therefore my role) is to help ensure transparency so that people have as much information as possible to make an informed decision for themselves.”",
            "Johnson added that he had supported Operation Warp Speed, the vaccine-development program spearheaded by former President Donald Trump, and “celebrated its astonishingly rapid success,” but also cast doubt about the vaccines it helped produce.",
            "“It is a legitimate question as to whether people at very low risk of suffering serious illness from Covid, particularly the young and healthy, should be encouraged to take a vaccine that is being administered under an Emergency Use Authorization,” Johnson said in the statement to HuffPost.",
            "More than 200 million vaccine doses have been administered in the United States so far, and more than half of adult Americans have received at least one dose. Among Americans over 65, more than 80% have had at least one shot.",
            "The Biden administration is aiming to get 80% of adult Americans vaccinated by summer. As new, more-contagious variants of the disease develop, the level of herd immunity needed to return to a pre-pandemic way of life has increased, according to the nation’s top scientists. More than 570,000 Americans have died of COVID-19, and case numbers remain high.",
            "Unlike other countries that are still struggling with getting enough shots, the United States’ biggest obstacle in the months ahead is overcoming vaccine hesitancy, much of which has been concentrated in the South and parts of the Great Plains. Vaccine hesitancy has life or death consequences and also threatens prospects of economic recovery.",
            "Johnson has explicitly rejected the scientific consensus on COVID-19. He said he wouldn’t get the vaccine because he already recovered from the disease in October. However, the CDC has said there is not enough data to know how long immunity lasts after contracting it.",
            "He has previously said that the country had “grossly overreacted” to the pandemic, and repeatedly raised fringe and contrarian theories and conspiracies about the disease and treatments.",
            "The Wisconsin Republican — who is up for reelection in 2022 but has not yet announced whether he’ll be running — is also bucking his party leadership’s messaging on the vaccine. In late March, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell specifically encouraged Republican men, who have some of the highest rates of vaccine hesitancy, to get the shot.",
            "“I can say, as a Republican man, as soon as it was my turn, I took the vaccine. I would encourage all Republican men to do that,” McConnell said.",
            "The Wisconsin Senate race will be one of the country’s most watched next year. In 2018, voters elected Democrats statewide in 2018, and the state flipped blue for Joe Biden. With a Senate seat now also in the balance, Democratic groups have already jumped on Johnson’s comments. American Bridge, the liberal Super PAC that spent more than $84 million during the 2020 presidential election cycle, blasted out Johnson’s comments to its email list.",
            "“More people will get COVID and die due to Ron Johnson’s comments yesterday,” said American Bridge 21st Century spokesperson Zach Hudson. “He’s a disgrace and Wisconsin can’t get rid of him soon enough.”"

            "Jameela Jamil is defending Demi Lovato in the wake of a controversy stemming from the singer taking issue with how a Los Angeles frozen yogurt shop offers diet items to customers.",
            "Over the weekend, Lovato took aim at The Bigg Chill for its marketing of sugar-free options. She called the products “triggering and awful,” as she is in recovery from an eating disorder.",
            "“Finding it extremely hard to order froyo from @thebiggchillofficial when you have to walk past tons of sugar free cookies/other diet foods before you get to the counter,” she wrote in an Instagram Story. “Do better please.”\n\nLovato also posted her direct messages with the shop, an exchange that ultimately went viral.\n\nOn Monday, Jamil weighed in on the ongoing drama, sharing her thoughts on her own Instagram Story.",
            "“Ok, I want to try to avoid making the story bigger than it already is,” she wrote. “But if an eating disorder advocate says she sees products that are positioned as guilt free, and it is potentially triggering, that doesn’t mean she’s too stupid to remember that diabetics exist. It just means that we need to change the marketing of products that are for people’s medical needs.”",
            "The “Good Place” star insisted that Lovato wasn’t attempting to disregard “people’s illnesses,” calling her “one of few celebrities reminding us to look out for mental illness.”",
            "“Guilt free is diet culture terminology. We need to stop using that fucking term. We are so lucky to even have food. What in the name of shit and hell is there to feel guilty about. That’s a term of shame,” Jamil wrote, emphasizing that it’s “good to keep raising awareness on this matter until eating disorder rhetoric is OUT of our normalized mainstream culture.”",
            "Jamil went on to explain that using words like “cheat, guilty, naughty, bad, [and] unhealthy” creates the impression that food is either virtuous or sinful. It’s “problematic terminology,” she wrote.",
            "In a second post on her Story, Jamil accused critics of rushing to “deliberately misunderstand [Lovato’s] intention and stance, and frame her as ignorant and careless, and inherently bad.”",
            "The 35-year-old stressed that “pile ons of mockery” aren’t helpful and only discourage people from making themselves vulnerable. She added that “unless you are also constantly trying to help and advocate for other people, I don’t think it’s a great move of character to pile onto those who do.”",
            "The actor also pointed out that Lovato’s comments on the froyo shop were trending on Twitter all day, rather than tweets about “lawmakers taking away trans rights, healthcare...rather than talking about gun laws.”",

            "“I’m calling on every employer, large and small, in every state, to give employees the time off they need, with pay, to get vaccinated. And any time they need, with pay, to recover, if they’re feeling under the weather after the shot,” Biden said in brief remarks from the Eisenhower Executive Office Building next door to the White House. “No working American should lose a single dollar from their paycheck because they chose to fulfill their patriotic duty of getting vaccinated.”",
            "He said conversations with people across the country made him realize that some people cannot afford to take time from work to get a vaccine. “Every employee should get paid leave to get a shot. And businesses should know they can provide it without a hit to their bottom line,” he said.",
            "Under the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, which Congress passed and Biden signed into law last month, businesses with 500 employees or fewer can claim a tax credit for as much as $511 a day for paid time off they provide to their employees, up to 10 days for vaccinations and recovery time per employee.",
            "A senior administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity said a quarter of Americans who say they will not get vaccinated may consider doing so if they know they would not lose money.",

            "Biden on Wednesday also took credit for having ramped up the vaccination rate since taking office, and thanked his COVID-19 team, federal agencies, state and local governments, retired health care workers who volunteered to administer shots and everyday Americans for lining up to get vaccinated.",

            "Forty world leaders will attend a virtual climate summit hosted by the United States on Thursday and Friday, but the majority of the focus may fall on just one: Jair Bolsonaro, the climate-change-denying president of Brazil.",
            "Bolsonaro has become an international pariah as he has presided over record levels of deforestation in the Amazon rainforest since taking office in 2019, and his reputation has only worsened due to his disastrous response to the COVID-19 pandemic.",
            "It may seem odd to focus on the one outlier at a conference intended to boost climate ambitions ahead of a larger United Nations climate summit in November. But instead of snubbing Bolsonaro, President Joe Biden has used his first few months in the White House to urge Bolsonaro to reclaim Brazil’s former mantle as a global leader in the fight against climate change.",
            "Since February, the U.S. and Brazil have engaged in a series of diplomatic discussions about a potential agreement that could eventually resemble a plan Biden proposed during his campaign to create an international $20 billion fund to incentivize protecting the Amazon. (A similar program, the Amazon Fund, was established in 2008 to allow other countries to support projects that limit deforestation in Brazil, though its major European supporters halted donations in 2019 over Bolsonaro’s environmental policies.) And while that deal almost assuredly won’t materialize this week, Bolsonaro’s approach to the summit could determine whether or not the two leaders reach an agreement both say they want.",
            "Biden and former Secretary of State John Kerry, the U.S. special envoy for climate, “really want to find a way to keep Brazil actively engaged in these climate talks,” said Thomas Shannon, who served as the U.S. ambassador to Brazil from 2010 to 2013. “So they’re making great efforts to make sure that the Brazilians come along with them. But at the same time they’re trying to make it very clear that this is not a moment for half-measures, and that what Brazil has been proposing is insufficient.”",
            "There’s a clear logic behind Biden’s climate entreaties to Brazil. Few countries are more important in the battle to curb carbon emissions, and any attempt to stem the effects of climate change is harder ― perhaps even impossible ― without South America’s largest nation at the table.",
            "Biden has already made some progress with China. If the U.S, a country that abandoned its own environmental role under President Donald Trump, can succeed in bringing Brazil back into the fold, it won’t just kickstart a more aggressive global climate movement, it will increase Biden’s — and the United States’ — reputation as a climate leader.",
            "That goal, however, still faces one major roadblock: Bolsonaro.",
            "‘An Uphill Battle’",
            "Bolsonaro ran for president in 2018 on a plan to industrialize the Amazon, roll back environmental restrictions and eliminate many of Brazil’s protections on rainforest lands. He has vigorously pursued that agenda as president, bulldozing past objections from environmental organizations (which he asserts are part of an internationalist plot to undermine him) and Indigenous tribes, who have accused him of promoting genocide against them.",
            "Bolsonaro has cut the budgets of Brazil’s environmental agencies, fired public officials for publishing official deforestation data he doesn’t like, and scaled back government protection of Indigenous lands, a policy that has led to spikes in illegal land invasions and killings of Indigenous peoples.",
            "Deforestation of the Amazon hit a 12-year peak in 2020, and the forest that has long been a vital carbon sink may now emit as much as it absorbs, according to a recent study. The Amazon is also nearing the point, scientists have warned, past which large swaths of it are no longer recoverable.",
            "Amid international scorn, Bolsonaro found refuge in the U.S. during the Trump years. Biden’s victory forced a slight change in tune in Brazil: Bolsonaro fired his foreign minister, who had described climate change as a Marxist plot. But in discussions with the U.S., the Brazilians have continued to draw a hard line on funding to help limit deforestation, and when Brazil should receive it.",
            "The Bolsonaro government, through Environmental Minister Ricardo Salles, has insisted that the country needs money upfront to change its approach, and it has told the U.S. and other countries that a $1 billion aid commitment this year will help it cut deforestation by 40%. The U.S., however, has repeatedly told the Brazilians that any funding it may provide is contingent on significant and immediate progress in curbing deforestation, a goal State Department officials have said they believe is possible to achieve by the end of this year. Given Bolsonaro’s lack of credibility, the U.S. seems unlikely to budge.",
            "“The Bolsonaro government is facing an uphill battle trying to convince the United States and Europe that it is ready to sit down and take this seriously,” said Anya Prusa, a senior associate in the Brazil Institute at The Wilson Center, a Washington-based think tank. “There’s great skepticism that if international funders give the money first, it will be actually followed with real action.”",
            "The other signals Bolsonaro has sent so far are less than promising, even if he has for now abandoned the sort of fiery rhetoric he used to deny the severity of the fires that engulfed the Amazon two years ago.",
            "Last week, Bolsonaro promised that Brazil would commit to ending illegal deforestation by 2030 and suggested to ministers within his government that he could consider increasing the Environmental Ministry’s budget, the newspaper Folha de S.Paulo reported.",
            "But the 2030 pledge is not as ambitious as it may sound; it merely matches a commitment Brazil already made as part of the Paris Agreement in 2015. And devoting more money to environmental enforcement won’t do much if the government refuses to spend it: Over the first 10 months of 2020, a year in which record fires again hit the Amazon and the Pantanal wetland region, Brazil’s main environmental agency spent just 40% of the funds it earmarked for fire prevention and control.",
            "“Brazil knows how to curb deforestation ― they’ve done it before,” Prusa said. “It’s less a question of resources than it is of political will.”",
            "‘He Will Not Change’",
            "American officials have continued to strike a positive tone about the negotiations with Brazil, but they have also stressed that Biden is not willing to ease demands solely to get a deal. A senior administration official told reporters on Wednesday that the U.S. is not singling out countries like Brazil or telling them to outline more ambitious climate change and emissions reductions policies “on their own;” it is looking for ambitious partners.",
            "“It’s a question of saying, ‘How do we collaborate and cooperate to move more quickly?’” the official said. “But ultimately, for many countries, if they’re not acting on their own and moving forward on their own, it’s very hard for the global community to engage.”",
            "It’s unlikely that anything that happens this week or in the immediate future could cause talks between the U.S. and Brazil to fall apart completely. But officials close to Biden have previously indicated that he won’t wait around for Bolsonaro forever: Juan Gonzalez, who now serves as the White House’s chief Latin America adviser on the National Security Council, told HuffPost last fall that any leader “who thinks they can advance an ambitious relationship with the United States while ignoring important issues like climate change, democracy and human rights clearly hasn’t been listening.”",
            "Biden is also under growing pressure to avoid making a deal with Brazil just to keep up appearances. Last week, 15 Democratic senators called on Biden to avoid any agreement with Bolsonaro that doesn’t include solid commitments. And Brazil’s Indigenous tribes, lawmakers and environmental organizations have all similarly warned against a deal that is too lenient, cautioning that Bolsonaro is solely interested in a symbolic political win.",
            "“He will not change,” Marcio Astrini, a researcher at the São Paulo-based Climate Observatory, told HuffPost. The U.S. and Europe, he suggested, should instead seek to work with Brazilian governors and organizations that are already committed to limiting deforestation.",
            "Brazilian companies and financial institutions are also increasing their demands that the government take aggressive steps to limit deforestation, fearing that a continued refusal to do so will hurt their international reputations and limit the country’s ability to attract foreign investment.",
            "European nations that had previously financed the Amazon Fund have become increasingly hesitant to continue contributing. Norway, which gave $1.2 billion to the fund between 2008 and 2018, said last week that it would not end its freeze on future contributions until Brazil began reducing deforestation again.",
            "If he manages to alienate the U.S., too, Bolsonaro would likely find himself completely isolated.",
            "“It would be a shame, but also the Brazilians would be putting at risk probably their most important partner on these issues,” Shannon said. “If they can’t get along with us, they can’t get along with anybody.”"

            "LED masks look vaguely like something Iron Man would wear from the outside, and shine multicolored lights onto the skin that claim to clear acne, prevent wrinkles and repair sun damage. Kourtney Kardashian uses one (or at least sells a device on her website), so if it’s good enough for a Kardashian, why not for the rest of us?",
            "But it’s not quite that simple. At-home LED devices can range in price dramatically. There’s an under-$40 Neutrogena LED mask for acne (which only lasts for a month before the activator light needs to be replaced). Or you can step it up a bit and try the Kardashian-approved DMH Aesthetics device for $190. If you’re up for a bigger investment, there’s a $435 Dennis Gross mask or other devices that go for thousands of dollars.",
            "Overall, these devices aren’t cheap, so are they worth the money and time investment? Do they do anything at all?",
            "There’s science to prove that most professional treatments used by dermatologists and estheticians, which are higher-powered than at-home devices, work. LED, or light emitting diode, can help with wound healing and skin regeneration, and even muscle repair and pain relief (but here we’ll focus on the beauty benefits of LED). “Different wavelengths of light in LED lights, including blue and red, penetrate the skin at different depths. This penetration may trigger biological processes that help the skin rejuvenate and heal,” said Corey L. Hartman, board-certified dermatologist and founder of Skin Wellness Dermatology in Birmingham, Alabama.",
            "Red LEDs repair cells, increase collagen and elastin production, and can reduce inflammation by increasing the metabolic activity of fibroblasts, a type of cell in the skin. “I recommend red LED for mature skin to slow the aging process, reverse sagging skin, dissolve wrinkles and aid in optimal cellular function so that skin is fed, hydrated and releases waste completely and easily,” said Julie Civiello-Polier, a holistic esthetician and founder of Linea, her specialized skin protocol.",
            "For those with breakouts, cystic acne and cuts and wounds, blue LEDs can be helpful. Blue LED is absorbed by the oil glands and affects porphyrin, a molecule in the skin. “When excited, these compounds kill the bacteria that contribute to acne,” Hartman said.",
            "And while the evidence is less conclusive, yellow LEDs have the potential to be beneficial for sun damage, hyperpigmentation and redness.",
            "But in order to have real benefits — both at home and in professional settings — LED devices must be powerful enough to make these processes happen. In office, devices are created specifically for medical use, and therefore have higher power levels and longer wavelengths that penetrate more effectively than most at-home devices.",
            "Size matters, too, both for convenience and efficacy. “Sometimes the panels or devices are so large in-office, the entire front or back of the body can receive the LED at one time and a treatment length is usually 30 minutes,” Civiello-Polier said. “Some of the really small at-home devices only cover a portion of the face, like a cheek or only the crow’s feet around one eye. When the at-home device is this small, the treatment can take a really long time if one wants to allow the whole face to receive the healing LED,” she shared.",
            "Despite some drawbacks, such as requiring a longer treatment time and being less powerful than in-office treatments, the experts who spoke with HuffPost agree that at-home LED devices can be worth it. “In-office treatments can be slightly more beneficial as they are, well, professional. And they are often combined with a facial. But many can’t make time for multiple weekly sessions, this is where an at-home device would give greater results,” said Natalie Aguilar, celebrity aesthetician and dermatological nurse at N4 skin care.",
            "What To Look For",
            "Do your research first. “I’ve seen some weird brands online that really make me question if it’s a legitimate LED device or if it uses bulbs from a child’s light-up toy,” Aguilar said.",
            "The most important feature to look for is the wavelengths, which should be between 633 and 830 nanometers. “If the wavelengths are a little less, like 490 nm, that is still within healing range, it’s just not as effective for rejuvenation and regeneration,” Civiello-Polier said. “If there are no measurements listed anywhere, skip it and keep shopping,” she advised.",
            "At-home devices might require more frequent use to make up for the lower power, so make them a consistent part of your routine should you start using one. “The lesser strength of the at-home devices may require a more robust regimen of daily use to receive the same amount of healing and rejuvenation power that one might receive in-office,” Civiello-Polier said. Risks are low, so LED devices can even be used multiple times per day if your schedule allows it, but start slow and pay attention to the device’s instructions to see how your skin will react first.",
            "If you haven’t had good luck treating your skin with other products, LED devices might be beneficial but aren’t crucial to a good routine. “At-home LED light therapy can be helpful to treat aging, sun damage and acne — but not necessarily more helpful than other products,” Hartman said.",
            "If you do want to add an LED device to your routine, the experts have some suggestions.",

It is the first major climate gathering since the U.S. rejoined the Paris climate accords, the global carbon-slashing pact former President Donald Trump exited.",

But frankly, the U.S. is looking at this as a tremendous opportunity to shift to clean energy. And we would hope that China and our other countries would look at it similarly.”",

The event, delayed since last year because of the COVID-19 pandemic, is where nations will try to reach a deal to increase the ambition of the Paris Agreement.",
            "Yet this week’s summit will offer more than diplomatic pageantry. Here are a few things to watch for:",
            "1. New U.S. Emissions Target",
            "The Obama administration vowed to cut U.S. carbon pollution between 26% and 28% below 2005 levels by 2025, promising “to make best efforts to reduce by 28%.”",

In February 2016, the conservative majority on the Supreme Court paused the implementation of the Obama-era Environmental Protection Agency’s key regulation to meet that target. Republican state attorneys general sued to block the Clean Power Plan, which aimed to significantly reduce carbon pollution from electricity generators while giving incentives to deploy more solar and wind, arguing its mandates amounted to a “war on coal” that unfairly affected their states. The Supreme Court issued a stay, ordering the EPA to reexamine the regulation’s legal underpinnings.",
            "Once Trump took office, he made Scott Pruitt, the Oklahoma attorney general who led the lawsuits against the Clean Power Plan, the new EPA administrator and set about shredding the rule.",
            "Shortly thereafter, Trump announced the U.S. plan to pull out of the Paris Agreement altogether, making the country’s nationally determined contribution moot.",
            "Ambitious, scientifically sound benchmarks will only go part of the way toward rebuilding trust that the U.S. is seriously committed to weaning its economy off carbon. In a series of conference sessions, top administration officials, including McCarthy, Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland, and Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, will outline the White House’s lofty plans to restrict carbon from power plants and automobiles, research new technologies, and conserve broad swaths of ocean and forests.",
            "To reach the new emissions target, Biden will likely need to enact a clean energy standard that eliminates emissions from 80% of the U.S. power supply by 2030 and 100% by 2035, said Robbie Orvis, the director of energy policy design at Energy Innovation, a climate and energy policy think tank based in San Francisco. Biden has indicated he wants to pursue that route. But Orvis said it won’t be enough.",
            "“A clean energy standard on its own will not squeeze out all the coal by 2030,” he said. “We need some other set of policies, whether it’s regulations on coal, assistance on transitioning from coal, or something to eliminate the remaining coal emissions altogether. If we don’t eliminate coal by 2030, it’s very hard to achieve a 50% reduction. It might be impossible.”",
            "2. Will China And The U.S. Make Nice?",
            "Biden has maintained a hawkish stance toward the world’s second-largest economy. A bilateral summit in Alaska last month boiled over into publicly undiplomatic statements.",
            "The White House has repeatedly framed its domestic climate efforts as a bid to “out compete” China and blunt the political rise of the world’s most populous nation, worrying progressives who note that fear-mongering contributes to the country’s alarming spike in anti-Asian violence and that the U.S. could get locked into an endless cycle of increasingly aggressive competition. The administration’s fact sheet on its $2.3 trillion package to rebuild infrastructure at home last month mentioned China by name five times. Just last week, Secretary of State Antony Blinken reaffirmed the U.S.’s “serious commitment” to Taiwan, which China sees as a breakaway province, and rallied Japan to make aggressive statements about defending the self-governing island territory from Beijing.",
            "Yet, on climate, there has been some progress. Despite the blows in Alaska, the U.S. described the meeting as “substantive” while China called them “candid, constructive and beneficial.” A day after the meeting, China said the two nations would set up a joint working group on climate change.",
            "Last week, White House climate envoy John Kerry went to Shanghai and ended his trip with a formal agreement between the two countries to work together on climate.",
            "Xi’s attendance this week marks another positive sign, though a senior White House official said Wednesday that Biden would not meet privately with his Chinese counterpart.",
            "“We are not having any bilateral or side Zoom room discussions over the course of the next few days,” the official said.",
            "Likewise China Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng said in an Associated Press interview that his country would not buck to pressure to up the ante on its pledge to peak its emissions in 2030 and reach carbon neutrality by 2060.",
            "“For a big country with 1.4 billion people, these goals are not easily delivered,” Le said. “Some countries are asking China to achieve the goals earlier. I am afraid this is not very realistic.”",
            "3. What To Make Of Brazil",
            "Brazil’s far-right President Jair Bolsonaro came to power in 2019 promising to industrialize the Amazon, drawing condemnation from across the world. Global concerns went beyond the displacement of hundreds of Indigenous peoples who live in the largest rainforest (though the Bolsonaro administration has drawn accusations of genocide at home). Rather, they came from concern that the lush jungle would lose its status as a net absorber of carbon dioxide emissions, jeopardizing global climate goals.",
            "Bolsonaro vehemently pushed back against such charges. While he found a kindred spirit in Trump, he accused Biden and leaders across Europe of infringing on Brazilian sovereignty. He called them hypocrites, noting that their countries grew wealthy by destroying the old-growth forests that once covered broad swaths of their territory. By last year, Amazon deforestation hit a 12-year high of nearly 4,300 square miles cleared in just 11 months. As a result, a study published in the journal Frontiers in Forests and Global Change last month found that the Amazon may now emit as much carbon as it sequesters.",
            "All that has made Biden itch for some kind of a deal to dissuade Bolsonaro from clearing more forest. The White House is under pressure from Senate Democrats to condition billions in U.S. aid to Brazil on environmental pledges ― and administration officials have made it clear, in the weeks leading up to the summit, that any potential agreement with Brazil is contingent on Bolsonaro making concrete commitments to curb deforestation immediately.",
            "But state governors, Indigenous leaders and environmentalists in Brazil warned Biden against making any kind of deal with Bolsonaro. Talks between the two countries have been ongoing since February.",
            "It’s unlikely that either side would make any big announcements this week. But the leaders’ speeches could offer clues as to how it’s going.",
            "4. Big Money Pledges",
            "Countries aren’t just expected to pledge domestic emissions cuts. They’re likely to put up some money, too.",
            "The Paris Agreement included a $100 billion U.N.-administered Green Climate Fund to help poorer countries pull their people out of poverty with clean energy investments. Nearly six years later, the fund is barely one-tenth of the way to being fully financed.",
            "The U.S. initially pledged $3 billion, but only handed over $1 billion by the time Obama left office. Trump canceled all future payments. This month, Biden asked Congress for $1.2 billion to pay into the fund. That’s still far below the remaining $2 billion Obama promised and would put the U.S. behind, France, Japan and Germany.",
            "Instead of increasing funding to developing countries, rich nations have recently announced more restrictions on what types of projects their public financing arms can support. In December, the United Kingdom vowed to end all public support for overseas fossil fuel projects. Seven European countries followed suit last year.",
            "Such policies threaten to stunt development in poor countries and encourage China to finance more coal plants, said Arvind Ravikumar, an assistant professor of sustainable energy development at the Harrisburg University of Science and Technology.",
            "“The U.S. cannot be the country that only keeps saying no,” he said. “It has to say yes to something. If you’re not going to do it, China is going to come in and do it. So there is a very big role for the Biden administration to be proactive here and support the things they do like.”",
            "A fairer system for dictating fossil fuels’ future in the developing world might look like a “tiered system in which countries with lower per-capita incomes, low emissions or high use of green energy are deemed more eligible for development projects that depend on fossil fuels,” Vijaya Ramachandran, a fellow at the Center for Global Development, wrote in the journal Nature this week.",
            "5. Intellectual Property Fights",
            "We are seeing a version of this play out already with vaccines. Poorer countries struggling to obtain enough vaccines to inoculate their populations against COVID-19 are pleading with rich nations to lift patent restrictions and allow companies to produce generic jabs en masse.",
            "India and South Africa, predicting this would become an issue, started demanding bans on COVID-19 vaccine patents last year. The director-general of the World Health Organization last month urged rich countries like the U.S. and Canada to grant patent waivers.",
            "Yet the biotech industry has insisted that waiving patents would “undermine our response to this pandemic and future health emergencies” by disincentivizing companies’ participation. The influential and conservative U.S. Chamber of Commerce called demands for waivers “misguided.”",
            "A similar dynamic could well play out with green energy. At a moment when the world needs to take unprecedented steps toward transitioning away from fossil fuels, allowing countries like Bangladesh, Colombia and Gabon to freely replicate solar panels and battery breakthroughs researched in the U.S. could be the difference between keeping warming within 1.5 degrees Celsius and facing the catastrophic consequences of failing to do so.",
            "As the U.S. touts fresh efforts to beef up research and development, those demands could well surface from some of the African, Asian and Latin American countries represented at the conference."

            "CHURCH CREEK, MD. — Last fall a team of archeologists dug hundreds of small holes in a marshy, forested and buggy area of Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge. But there were no obvious signs of the historical site they’d set out to unearth. Frustrated, Julie Schablitsky, the chief archeologist at the Maryland Department of Transportation, grabbed a metal detector and began scanning an area along an old road.",
            "“I got this beep, beep, beep,” she recalled, expecting it to be just another buried shotgun shell. “I dug, and what came up was this coin.”",
            "Not just any coin. It was a 50-cent Liberty coin, dated 1808 ― the year that American abolitionist Harriet Tubman’s parents, Benjamin and Harriet Greene Ross, were married and started a family in this remote area along Maryland’s shore. It’s also the year that the U.S. officially banned the importing of humans who would be forced into chattel slavery.",
            "The coin ultimately led Schablitsky’s team to what they’ve concluded are the remnants of a cabin and homesite that Tubman’s father owned. It is where Tubman spent part of her childhood before she escaped and became a conductor on the Underground Railroad.",
            "State and federal officials announced the discovery Tuesday at a small event at the visitor center of the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Historical Park.",
            "Along with the coin, the initial seach last year turned up other small artifacts, but Schablitsky’s team ran out of time and money for the year, she said. They returned this March and began a more thorough excavation. They unearthed nails, bricks, chunks of glass and painted pottery, a drawer handle, a piece of a chamber pot, a pipe stem and even a porcelain button. Experts have since dated many of the items to the first half of the 19th century.",
            "“With the artifacts, the archaeology, the evidence of a building and just the location — knowing [Ross] worked in the timbered wetlands — those multiple lines of evidence tell us unequivocally that this is the home of Ben Ross,” Schablitsky said.",
            "The discovery helps Tina Wyatt, a descendant of Harriet Tubman and Ben Ross, imagine what her ancestors were like. She wondered if the 1808 coin could have been a wedding gift that her great-great-great-great-grandfather dropped accidentally. She pictures Ross smoking a pipe at the end of a long day of work.",
            "The decorative, painted pottery dispelled a myth in her mind about what her ancestors and other enslaved people would have had in their kitchens, she said.",
            "“It means so much to the family to be able to see all of this,” Wyatt said at Tuesday’s event. “It’s so important, not just for family, but for the world to understand about our history, to know what happened.”",
            "The homesite is in an area of the refuge known as Peter’s Neck, not far from where the Blackwater River snakes its way past what was once the plantation of Anthony Thompson, where Tubman was born into slavery around 1820. Though she and her mother were enslaved by a different family, Tubman — then Araminta “Minty” Ross — would have spent time as a young child and a teenager at the homesite, experts said Tuesday. Her enslaved father, Ben Ross, logged and sold timber to be used for shipbuilding in Baltimore. He was freed five years after Thompson’s death and given a 10-acre piece of land in the 1840s.",
            "“Harriet Tubman worked alongside her father as a teenager, and historians believe that Tubman learned to navigate the land and waterways she would later traverse to lead enslaved people to freedom,” Maryland Lt. Gov. Boyd Rutherford said at Tuesday’s event.",
            "Tubman escaped slavery in 1849 at age 27. Over the next decade or so, she returned to the region about 13 times to help at least 70 others flee to freedom in the North, according to historians.",
            "“This discovery adds another puzzle piece in the story of Harriet Tubman, the state of Maryland and our nation,” Rutherford added. “It is important that we continue to uncover parts of our history that we can learn from, especially when we can do this before time and other forces wash it away.”",
            "Archeologists pinpointed the Ross cabin site just in time. It sits on the edge of marshlands that are migrating further inland each year due to the sea-level rise caused by climate change.",
            "“It’s a lot closer to being lost than we realized,” Marcia Pradines, project manager of the Chesapeake Marshlands National Wildlife Refuge Complex, which includes Blackwater, told HuffPost. “When they dig their [excavation] pits, the water is just a foot or so from the surface of the soil. We were about ready to lose it if we didn’t find it.”",
            "The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service acquired the 2,600-acre Peter’s Neck property for $6 million in 2020, a strategic purchase to replace some of the roughly 5,000 acres that have disappeared to rising sea levels since Blackwater refuge was established in 1938. The Peter’s Neck area is less susceptible to rising seas than other areas and is expected to remain above water but convert to marshland by 2100.",
            "“This is where the future of the refuge will be,” Pradines told HuffPost.",
            "Officials are still excavating the site and are not disclosing its exact location in order to prevent it from being damaged; however, the long-term plan is to open a trail system to provide public access to the area. Many of the discovered artifacts are expected to eventually be on display at the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad Visitor Center in Church Creek.",
            "Pradines said the discovery represents a rare opportunity to connect people with both nature and American history.",
            "“They’ll get to learn how the landscape and how nature really helped shape who we are. That’s certainly the case of this particular landscape. It shaped who Harriet Tubman was. The landscape actually tells the story.”"

            "But conservative lawmakers bent on preserving fossil fuels’ grip on the economy have been busy erecting new barriers at the state level. Texas is considering bills to curb renewables. West Virginia is advancing legislation to force power plants to keep burning coal. A dozen states are considering legislation that would bar cities from enacting building codes that ban natural gas hookups in new buildings.",

            "On Monday, Reps. Cori Bush (D-Mo.) and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) plan to introduce legislation that would provide $1 trillion in federal spending directly to cities, towns and tribes seeking to slash carbon emissions and clean up pollution, circumventing state governments. Nearly two dozen other progressives are co-sponsoring the bill.",
            "The proposal to target local governments, shared first with HuffPost, is modeled on funding provisions in the two COVID-19 relief bills Congress passed over the past year. But the bill allows for money to be spent on a long list of climate-related issues, ranging from projects to cut emissions with electric vehicles and energy efficiency retrofits to those that would remediate toxic water and soil pollutants and help communities adapt to more extreme weather.",
            "While eligible projects listed in the legislation include standard green infrastructure, such as bike lanes and geothermal heating systems, it also allows for funding “to support reparations programs for Black and Indigenous people and communities.”",
            "“We’re making sure that every city, every town, every county and every tribe can have a fully funded Green New Deal,” Bush said by phone last week. “This is going to bring climate justice right to your neighborhood, and to do that, we’re going to have to use this funding structure.”",
            "Anti-Climate Bills Proliferating",
            "The proposal will likely face a steep uphill climb to become law, as the Democrats’ narrow majorities grant more power to conservative members who are less enthusiastic about left-wing priorities.",

            "Last year, Arizona, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Tennessee all passed state laws barring their cities from banning renovations or new constructions from using natural gas for cooking and heating. The legislation, which came in response to a growing number of cities enacting such bans as a way to eliminate a top source of climate pollution and reach decarbonization goals, now looks set to spread.",
            "Another 12 states ― Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Texas and Utah ― are now considering preemption bills of their own, prodded by industry lobbying and advertising campaigns from gas utilities that see the hookup bans as an existential threat.",
            "After Texas suffered deadly rolling blackouts amid a freak February cold snap, Republicans in the state introduced a set of bills to impose new costs on solar and wind generators. Renewables actually overperformed during the Arctic temperatures, and the outages were largely fueled by freezing natural gas pipes and halted nuclear reactors. Still, state Republicans advanced the bill known as HB 4466, which would require renewable firms to pay for backup resources to account for fluctuations in the grid, a mandate from which fossil fuel generators would be free. The state Senate already passed a similar measure.",
            "The push has drawn national outcry, but other states aren’t far behind.",
            "Arizona’s GOP-controlled legislature advanced four bills aimed at undercutting the state utility commission’s legal authority to require private power companies to stop emitting carbon dioxide.",
            "In February, Missouri lawmakers overwhelmingly voted for a bill that would ban a transmission line needed to carry wind energy into the state from using eminent domain to complete its construction.",
            "Last month, West Virginia’s Republican-leaning Senate unanimously passed a bill that would require coal-fired power generators owned by public electric utilities in the state to maintain a supply of least 30 days’ worth of coal for the lifespan of the plants.",
            "In Indiana, the Republican chairman of the House Environmental Affairs Committee, state Rep. Doug Gutwein, said he would not hold hearings on any of the 13 environmental bills assigned to his panel this session, including legislation prohibiting utilities from dumping toxic coal ash and requiring preschools and daycares to test for lead.",
            "“All of this is a sign of the extreme polarization in the American political system,” said Michael Gerrard, director of Columbia Law School’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law. “You have these extreme right-wing state legislators adopting packages of bills that just a few years ago would have seemed utterly over-the-top and outlandish, yet they’ve become mainstream for that wing of the Republican Party.”",
            "Progressive Activists’ Wish List",
            "The vaguely defined reparations provision is hardly the only proposal likely to raise eyebrows among less progressive lawmakers. The measure doesn’t give specifics about how reparations might work or who within those communities might qualify. The bill does, however, offer explicit language about the kind of projects the money is barred from supporting. The legislation clearly bans spending on new fossil fuel infrastructure. But it also bars funding for the procurement of nuclear power, any kind of research, or technology to capture carbon emissions at existing plants or remove carbon molecules from the atmosphere.",
            "Such measures are a clear nod to the left-wing activist groups whom Bush said helped shape the bill, and who take an ideological stance against such technologies and energy sources they consider “false solutions” that threaten to create more pollution or jeopardize the deployment of favored policy measures like more renewables. The bill also bars money from going to “investments or projects supporting law enforcement, immigration detention centers, and prisons, including buildings and vehicles under the control of law enforcement or a prison.” So the legislation can’t fund electric police vehicles or energy-efficient upgrades for the local jail.",
            "“The list of eligible projects is far longer than the list of exclusions,” Bush said. “That says something.”",
            "Kaniela Ing, the climate justice campaign director for the nonprofit People’s Action, said compromising on activists’ priorities posed significant risks to the constituents who helped elect lawmakers like Bush, many of whom have struggled from poverty made worse by high electricity bills and health problems stemming from dirty air and unsafe water.",
            "“Often compromise means death,” Ing said. “If you want to cut this bill for things that are less than what the community needs, you better make the case for it, and know that you might have blood on your hands.”"

            "In his 50-odd years as an appraiser of gems and fine jewelry, Warren Morss has laid eyes on some dazzling pieces.",
            "There was the eye-popping, 17-carat diamond, and the pair of diamond earrings weighing 4 carats apiece, roughly the same as Hailey Bieber’s engagement ring. There was the emerald necklace boasting not one big pendant, but large-cut stones all the way around the collar and more emeralds dripping down the front. (“Really too much in my opinion,” he said decorously.)",
            "These days, though, nothing stands out to Morss quite as much as the sheer volume of work he’s getting.",
            "And that’s largely thanks to the election of President Joe Biden.",
            "Biden campaigned on slashing the total amount of wealth that rich families can pass on tax-free to their heirs. As part of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act — an unprecedented giveaway to the rich — Republicans and President Donald Trump raised the exemption to an all-time high of $11.58 million for individuals or $23.16 million for couples. Undoing Trump’s tax cuts would bring the individual exemption down to $5.49 million; if Biden succeeds in his desire to restore taxation to 2009 levels, wealthy families would be subject to estate taxes after the first $3.5 million.",
            "The result is a mad dash among wealthy families to pass on their millions before they can no longer do so tax-free. Tax attorneys and wealth advisers to the 1% say they’re busier than they’ve ever been, while appointments for appraisers like Morss are filling up months in advance.",
            "“What I’m seeing now is a panic,” said Joseph Marion, a Rhode Island tax attorney and expert in wealth transfer, “relative to people using up their lifetime exemption credits before those credits likely erode under the new Democratic regime.”",
            "It’s not just estate tax levels that are under fire. As a means to pay for Biden’s ambitious social and infrastructure agenda, Senate Democrats favor jacking up the capital gains taxes that wealthy people owe on some of the stuff they inherit. (Right now, they only pay taxes when they sell the assets, and only on the increase in value since the last owner died.)",
            "Biden’s Treasury Department could also revive several efforts, which the Trump administration mothballed, to prevent the ultrawealthy from playing fast and loose with the rules for assigning values to their assets. Eventually, the Biden administration wants to raise all sorts of taxes on the affluent — income, long-term capital gains — to finance paid family and medical leave.",
            "“All the attorneys in my field are sending the message: This is going to be the busiest time ever,” said one wealth planner, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of his clients’ aversion to publicity. “Get in line now.”",
            "The global COVID-19 pandemic has only driven demand for estate planning higher. Suddenly, lots of jet-setting couples found themselves sharing the same shore house 24/7 and driving each other crazy. “Divorces happened a little sooner than people thought they would,” said one attorney. “Or they didn’t happen after all.” There were elderly clients who died in the middle of estate planning, which can cause their plans to come undone. And the particulars of the COVID-19 recession actually helped many clients’ wealth grow faster.",
            "Mostly, though, wealth advisers to the 1% have been slammed with clients racing to beat the Biden administration.",
            "“Since November, especially, we’ve been panickingly busy,” said Michael Salvadore, who specializes in assigning value to privately owned businesses. “Sometimes people don’t realize how much money they’ve accumulated until they’re about to lose it.”",
            "Supercharged",
            "You may have heard the same pandemic that cost millions of ordinary people their lives, health, savings, stability, or jobs caused the fortunes of the country’s wealthiest families and its largest corporations to grow like gangbusters.",
            "The year 2020 was likewise a pretty good year to make an estate plan. The technical reasons for this are baroque and tedious, as with most things tax-related. The main thing to know is that the economic rescue efforts that were necessary to protect the economy from total collapse — stimulus of atlas proportions, interest rates near zero — made for pretty excellent growing conditions of generational wealth.",
            "Children with gigantic intrafamily loans — a way to avoid gift taxes — could refinance at favorable rates with the Bank of Mom and Dad. There was an explosion, several estate planners said, in high net worth individuals laundering their brokerage accounts through a kind of trust that captures all the appreciation minus interest and then passes it on to their heirs, gift-tax-free — again, a terrific gambit in a year when interest rates were low and the stock market walked off the coronavirus like nothing had happened.",
            "Another boom occurred in trusts that allow ultrawealthy individuals to “freeze” the worth of a very valuable asset at a lower valuation by transferring the asset to the trust when it has a low value on paper — say, due to a once-in-a-generation pandemic. When the asset rebounds, the trust keeps all the growth, minus interest, for the heirs. For estate tax purposes, the price tag stays frozen at bargain-basement levels.",
            "Jennifer Davis, a tax attorney with many high-net worth clients, marveled that the pandemic economy had “supercharged” all her favorite estate-planning vehicles.",
            "“The year was intense,” she said. “We just keep thinking interest rates can’t go any lower, and they continue to decline.”",
            "Trusts like these can be a shelter for just about anything of significant worth: a business stake, rental real estate, an LLC that holds the vacation home, a shell company that manages the family’s investments.",
            "The patriarch of the Schreiber family, who founded J&J Snack Foods — you have doubtless bought one of their products, like a Slush Puppie or a SuperPretzel soft pretzel, at a theme park or a college basketball game — has a trust of this type for his children containing 200,000-plus shares of the company’s stock. Last summer, CEO Gerald Schreiber and the trust made a flurry of transactions. Only parts of the transactions are public — executives who trade their company stock must report it to the Securities and Exchange Commission — but the family likely took advantage of the economic downturn to change the terms of their trust and book a big tax benefit. The J&J Snack Foods workforce, meanwhile, suffered furloughs and salary reductions, and 221 of its workers lost their jobs. Spokespeople for J&J Snack Foods did not respond to a request for comment.",
            "The trust belonging to the snack magnates is the rare one that has flared into public view. Of the glut of trusts that the 1% are forming to outrun the Biden administration — spousal trusts, charitable trusts, dynasty trusts — most will be given cryptic names that obscure their purpose.",
            "“My clients, particularly the ones with notoriety, they’ll call it something like the ‘Mulberry Trust’ even though they’re the Smith family,” Davis said.",
            "This secrecy makes it hard to pin down the scale of the current frenzy. But one outward sign of how many people are scrambling to plan their estates is how challenging it has become to book the appraisers who determine the estates’ size.",
            "Salvadore, the business appraisal specialist, has seen an increase in demand ever since June, which happens to be when Biden definitively pulled ahead of Trump in the polls.",
            "A recent assignment sent him hopscotching between oil rigs in a helicopter, somewhere out West. He’s also worked for several newly minted millionaires from the cannabis boom — tromping around their grow houses to tally up the value of their lab equipment, grow racks, and temperature and humidification systems. The amount of high-tech equipment many of them own is astounding, he said, in sharp contrast to their junior-varsity approach to estate planning.",
            "“Because they get rich quick, they haven’t really thought about their estate,” Salvadore said. His appraisals help prepare them for the high-octane wealth protection schemes, like spinning off the land into special trusts and the heavy machinery into separate leasing companies.",
            "Dollars-and-cents appraisers are not the only ones doing a brisk business. Multiple appraisers who specialize in hard assets — real estate, art, and gems and jewelry — tell me this is the busiest they’ve been in their entire careers.",
            "When I called Sandra Tropper, a Washington, D.C.-area appraiser of fine art, she had just taken on an estate planning assignment involving a collection of 19th-century French Impressionist prints and drawings.",
            "“Usually, I don’t get calls until somebody dies, and not for a while,” she said. “It’s not the first thing one does after getting back from the funeral parlor.” These days, without anyone having died, she’s getting a lot of inquiries from small-time collectors who want to know whether a couple of paintings could push them over the lifetime gift tax exemption.",
            "Morss, the jewelry appraiser, has been toting his portable gem lab up and down the New England coast, from colonial-style homes where the family lays out dozens of pieces of jewelry on their dining room table to the less-glamorous bowels of safety deposit box rooms. A single, high-value item can take him days to research and his final report can run as long as 12 pages. Lately, his schedule is further complicated by clients’ living in Florida for six months plus a day, in order to establish residency on its low-tax shores. So book him early.",
            "And if you need to engage an aircraft appraiser, best of luck.",
            "“I can tell you that the jet guys are very, very busy,” Salvadore said. (Kevin O’Leary, a jet guy, confirmed he is very busy, but not exactly because of the estate planning boom. The pandemic has created a surfeit of new customers for private air travel.)",
            "Mostly, though, the fortunes are being passed on as financial assets, with the help of lawyers who are not having as much fun as Salvadore on his helicopter rides.",
            "“When you’re dealing with high net worth individuals there aren’t really ‘fun’ stories,” said Marion, the tax attorney. Instead, he stays up at night wondering if he missed a trick. “It’s pretty nerve-wracking.”",
            "None of this is guarantees Biden will actually succeed in raising taxes on the richest of the rich. It’s not clear whether Senate Democrats, with their minuscule 50-50 majority, have the appetite to do so.",
            "Lots of tax attorneys compared the current frenzy to 2012, when the affluent feared that President Barack Obama would slash the estate tax exemption if he won reelection. “The sky is always falling” in this profession, one estate planner said. Instead, since 2012, the exemption has only gone up.",
            "But if it does come down, there are low-tech ways to avoid estate tax bills, too. When a wealthy parent dies, Roger Durkin, a New England real estate appraiser, often works as part of a team of appraisers to value the entire home and its contents.",
            "“It’s not uncommon to have us go to the house to do the inventory and valuation and find an empty hook on the wall,” Durkin said. “And where is that painting? Kid goes, ‘Oh, that was sold a long time ago.’”"

            "Officers fatally shot Anthony Thompson Jr., a junior at Austin-East Magnet High School in Knoxville, Tennessee, on April 12 after the Knoxville Police Department responded to a report of someone “possibly” armed with a handgun inside the school.",
            "In an interview with the Knoxville News Sentinel, local parent Regina Perkins said she called the police after her teen daughter, who had been dating Thompson, came home early from school with signs of physical abuse. But Perkins said she never described Thompson as armed with a gun and isn’t sure how police got that information.",

            "Authorities said that when police arrived at the school and confronted the teen, he refused to come out of a bathroom. Police initially said a confrontation ensued and that Thompson shot a school resource officer, prompting officers to return fire, killing him.",

            "Perkins said Thompson had had a tumultuous nine-month relationship with her daughter and that she had asked the school to help separate both students due to their physical altercations, which led to two school suspensions. When her daughter came home from school early on April 12 with marks on her face and missing hair, Perkins said she first tried calling Thompson’s mother but was unable to reach her. She then called the police to file a domestic assault report.",

But when a suspect is a person of color, there is no attempt to de-escalate the situation,” he said. “Police shoot first and ask questions later, time after time, because Black lives are afforded less value. We will seek answers and justice for Anthony’s family.”",

            "Kris Mauna, a small business owner of a digital art and calligraphy shop, has three kids, ages 10 through 12. They’re preteens who are constantly scrolling through YouTube and TikTok. Teen influencers on those platforms don’t shy away from talking about politics or trending stories, so it’s nearly impossible for Mauna to shield her kids from news of violence committed against Asian Americans.",
            "Not that Mauna, who’s Filipino American, would want to do that. Her children are not only Asian American; they’re Black, too. She and her husband have become well-versed in these types of difficult conversations since last summer’s Black Lives Matter protests.",
            "Still, the initial decision to talk about race (and police brutality) in America last summer didn’t come easy. Mauna said she and her husband spent many sleepless nights mulling just how much the kids needed to know about what was happening.",
            "Then and now, they’ve decided to be direct and honest with their children.",
            "“I’m the type of parent that wants my children to understand that the world may hate them simply based on the color of their skin,” Mauna told HuffPost. “I want them to know that being both Asian American and Black in this country right now is unsafe.”",
            "As Mauna sees it, talking to her kids about a rise in racist incidents during the coronavirus pandemic is the best way to prepare them “for harsh realities,” even on the playground.",
            "One poll last September found that 1 in 4 Asian American youths have experienced racist bullying online and in person since the pandemic began. One 14-year-old student in Dallas reported that a group of high school boys followed him home, feigned coughing on him and shouted, “Ching chong! You have Chinese virus!” Others reported cyberbullying.",
            "Attacks targeting Asian Americans in general, many of them women or older people, have increased nearly 150% in the past year, according to a study released by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino.",
            "Virginia Duan, a Taiwanese Chinese American freelance writer and editor, has also been having constant conversations on this topic with her four kids, especially the older two, who are 11 and 9. After last month’s Atlanta spa shootings, which took the lives of eight people ― six of them women of Asian descent ― Duan decided to have a more specific conversation with her 9-year-old daughter.",
            "“These talks are never one and done,” Duan said. “With the Atlanta shootings, I honestly can’t remember if my daughter brought it up or she just happened to be in the room when I spoke to my husband about it.” (Duan said she and her husband have generally been “uncensored” when talking about these recent attacks.)",
            "“With the kids, we are always talking about racism, white supremacy, and patriarchy ― but usually in simpler terms,” she said.",
            "Gabrielle Zhuang-Estrin, a clinical social worker who works with the Asian American community in Los Angeles, said parents like Duan and Mauna are doing the right thing.",
            "“In order to talk to our children about race and racism, we need to get comfortable talking about race, period,” she said.",
            "“That doesn’t mean we need to obtain our master’s degree in critical race theory, or to be the perfect ally or anti-racist person,” she explained. “It just means we need to gain some competence in sitting with discomfort knowing we have privilege and grappling with our own racial identities.”",
            "Right now, many Asian Americans are reckoning with past racial harassment they’ve experienced in spite of their “model minority” status. It’s imperative that adults explore their own experiences and unconscious biases so that they’re able to guide their children through their feelings.",
            "“You want your kids to be anti-racist but also to be settled and proud of the skin they’re in,” she said.",
            "If you’re not sure where to start, below is advice from therapists like Zhuang-Estrin and Asian American parents about how they’ve learned to broach this difficult topic. Much of the advice is tailored and told from the perspective of Asian American parents, but there are relevant lessons here for all parents.",
            "Simplify concepts for younger kids.",
            "For elementary-aged kids, 10-20 minutes may be more than enough time to give them a little context and understanding about racism, as well as answer any questions they may have, said Therese Mascardo, psychologist of Filipino descent who works within the Asian American community.",
            "“Use simple sentences to describe what is happening, like: ‘Someone hurt an elder because they looked like us,’” she said. “Keep the conversation brief and to the point.”",
            "Two recent viral videos provide great examples. Jane Park, a Seattle mother of Korean descent, recorded a video on TikTok showing how she talked to her kids about the March 16 shooting in the Atlanta area.",
            "In the viral video, Park shows her children, ages 7 and 5, the words “Stop,” “Asian” and “Hate.” She then asks the kids about their feelings and walks them through some ways they can raise awareness and address racism in their own community.",
            "In another video posted on Instagram, mom and former elementary school teacher Naomi O’Brien sits down with her 5-year-old and explains the recent hate incidents and how they’re tied to anti-Asian rhetoric related to the coronavirus pandemic.",
            "There’s really no age too young to talk about the implications of race in the United States. Zhuang-Estrin has a biracial toddler, and she and her partner are already talking about skin color.",
            "“We use picture books as a tool to wake her up to the fact that the skin color we have embeds us in a racial narrative that can be both difficult and painful as well as wonderful and beautiful,” she said.",

            "When Duan talks to her kids, she resists the urge to soften the information. She tells it to them straight: Asian American people are being targeted simply for being Asian.",
            "That being said, you don’t need to go into traumatizing detail, and you certainly don’t need to show them any videos.",
            "“I think we need to normalize not needing to watch videos of brutality and violence to acknowledge the horror and wrongness of an action,” Duan said. “If your children are Asian, watching the videos can make them more afraid. It can also inure and desensitize kids to violence against people ― Asian or otherwise.”",

            "She also reminds them of the importance of being a good bystander in situations like this.",
            "“I tell them ways they can help a friend if they witness them being attacked,” she said. “Don’t just stand by or walk away, you have to help people who can’t help themselves or nothing will change.”",
            "Depending on your kids’ ages, don’t shy away from providing context and history.",
            "Help kids understand the context of this moment. Because some of the suspects in these attacks have also been people of color, Duan worries that the coverage her kids see in the news or on social media might reframe what’s going on as a Black versus Asian issue.",
            "“Research shows that the majority of anti-Asian violence has been committed by white people, but the overwhelming press has been highlighting incidents where Black or Brown folks have committed the violence,” she said.",
            "Duan asks her children why they think that is.",
            "“As a family, interrogate yourselves on why and how these narratives play together to aid white supremacy and further divide people of color,” she said. “You have to teach your kids how to examine what stories are not being told and why.”",
            "Discuss, too, the history of racism against Asian Americans ― the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882 and the incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II, for instance.",
            "In school, Asian American history, especially the darker chapters, tends to get short shrift. Your kids may not have heard the names Grace Lee Boggs or Vincent Chin but they’ve undoubtedly heard names like Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr. Give them context for understanding Anti-Asian racism by talking about what they already know about racism in America because of figures like Parks and King, Mascardo said.",
            "Remember to pause, ask questions and talk about feelings.",
            "Hearing about senseless acts of violence is a lot to take in at any age. Pause frequently and make sure that your child is comprehending what you’re saying, Mascardo said.",
            "“Ask them how they’re feeling and give them permission to express difficult emotions. Other questions to ask: ‘Have you ever seen something like this happen before?’ ‘How would you feel if someone treated you this way?’",
            "Validate any pain, fear, confusion, anger or sadness that they feel.",
            "“They may have some big feelings, so it’s helpful to talk about some helpful ways to cope,” she said.",
            "Maybe that means punching a pillow if they are feeling angry or letting them know it’s OK to cry if they’re sad. If this year has been weighing on your child more than you realized ― or they share with you racism they’ve experienced ― you might consider exploring therapy as an option.",
            "It’s OK for you to share with your kids how you’re feeling, too; just try to centralize their feelings, Mascardo said.",
            "“Honor your children’s unique feelings and remember that they may not have the same emotions come up as you might expect,” she said.",
            "Then, check back regularly; a one-time talk with your kids isn’t enough.",
            "“It’s important to check in with them regularly, as you never know what may be outside of home, or what they are hearing from the news,” Mascardo said. “Make racism a part of the conversation just as you would talk of grades, friendships, and extracurricular activities.”"

            "Asher McKinney-Ring stepped up to the podium on the floor of the North Carolina General Assembly on Wednesday and took a deep breath. McKinney-Ring is only 15 years old, but the transgender high schooler appeared calm as he argued against North Carolina’s HB358, a bill that would restrict trans kids like him from participating in school sports.",
            "“Words cannot explain how painful and exhausting it is to wake up every morning knowing that my rights to normal childhood experiences like school sports are being debated by elected officials that I’ve never met and that my existence and identity are not protected by law,” he said.",
            "“We are not a threat. We are children,” he said. “And we just want to experience life normally like the rest of our classmates.”",
            "At least 33 state legislatures, including North Carolina, have introduced anti-transgender laws so far this year. And it’s only April. The bills range from banning transgender children from competing on sports teams consistent with their gender identities to criminalizing parents or doctors for providing gender-affirming medical care.",
            "“The goal is to eradicate trans-ness,” said Chase Strangio, an attorney and deputy director for transgender justice at the American Civil Liberties Union. “These bills are being pushed through on theories that claim that it’s harmful to be trans, that trans people aren’t real and the state should come in to stop people from living their authentic trans selves.”",
            "These bills will be deeply harmful to trans children if passed. Some are threatening to define gender-affirming treatment and medical care as child abuse: Texas’s SB1646 would make it a crime for parents to allow their transgender children to get gender-affirming medical procedures. The Texas bill would make it legal to remove trans or gender-queer kids from their homes if their parents affirmed their gender identity.",
            "In recent weeks, other anti-trans bills have become law. In March, Arkansas became the first state in the U.S. to enact a law that makes it a criminal offense for a doctor to provide gender-affirming medical care for a trans youth. Arkansas’s HB1570, or the “Save Adolescents From Experimentation (SAFE) Act,” will go into effect this summer. Nine other states are pursuing bills similar to the one in Arkansas; some will penalize doctors for providing gender affirming medical care, while others will punish parents.",
            "If that weren’t enough, Arkansas has other bills pending in its legislature, including a health care ban for trans kids, a ban on sports for trans children, an anti-trans restroom policy and a bill that allows school employees to misgender trans children.",
            "Other troubling bills include Alabama’s SB10, which makes it a felony for doctors to offer gender-affirming medical care to trans kids younger than 19. The bill goes further than others by including language that would force teachers and other school employees to out trans kids to their parents if the child shows any gender nonconforming signs.",
            "In Tennessee, Republican lawmakers proposed a bill to increase training for those who administer medication to children but then gutted it to instead swap in an amendment that prohibits health professionals from offering gender-affirming medical care.",
            "Missouri introduced an amendment to its constitution in February that would ban trans kids from participating in sports. Adding a constitutional amendment would trigger a public debate and discussion that could be even more traumatic for trans kids and the parents of trans children.",
            "These laws go against recommendations from some of the most respected medical organizations in the country, including the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Psychiatric Association.",
            "Transgender children, parents of trans kids, advocates, health professionals and others are testifying in front of state legislative committees across the country, pleading with their lawmakers to not pass these harmful bills. The most poignant and heartbreaking testimony is coming from children.",
            "“I do not like spending my free time asking adults to make good choices,” Kai Shappley, a fourth-grade transgender girl in Austin, testified in front of Texas lawmakers earlier this week. “It makes me sad that some politicians use trans kids like me to get votes from people who hate me just because I exist.”",
            "“God made me. God loves me for who I am, and God does not make mistakes,” she added. When Shappley asked the group of Republican lawmakers if anyone had questions for her, she was met with silence.",
            "There are several deeply troubling issues with all of these proposed bills, aside from denying trans kids their humanity. These bills will have a lasting effect on trans and gender-queer kids who are seeking vital medical treatment. If these bills pass, at least 45,000 trans youth are at risk of losing care, according to a new study from the Williams Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles, School of Law.",
            "Transgender kids already face higher rates of depression, anxiety and suicidal tendencies than their cisgender peers because of social isolation and bullying. In 2019, 1 in 3 transgender kids reported they had attempted suicide, and nearly one-third reported being a victim of sexual violence, according to a study from The Trevor Project, an organization that offers crisis intervention and suicide prevention for LGBTQ youth.",
            "Many proponents of these anti-trans bills paint a scary dystopian future where, as they say, “biological men” will take over women’s sports. Not only is this baseless and fundamentally wrong, it also just isn’t feasible when you look at the numbers.",
            "Transgender people make up less than 1% of the U.S. population, and that number is even smaller for transgender kids and young adults. Beyond that, there aren’t that many trans kids who play sports, much less trans kids playing sports at competitive or elite levels. For example, in the last two years, only 10 transgender high school athletes in the entire state of North Carolina have requested to participate with the team that best aligns with their gender identity. In other states pursuing similar anti-trans sports bills, lawmakers are having trouble finding examples in which they felt transgender girls unfairly won due to their gender identity.",
            "Although many supporters of these anti-trans bills are cisgender women, these policies will likely hurt cis girls just as much as they hurts trans girls. There’s a long history of attempting to control women’s and girls’ bodies, specifically Black women’s bodies, and this type of legislation will be an extension of that, Strangio said.",
            "“We can expect this to be highly intrusive, highly discriminatory systems of policing,” Strangio, of the ACLU, said, “that authorize private individuals to accuse people of being too masculine and authorize the state to surveil, control and scrutinize the body of women and girl athletes.”",
            "For example, Louisiana’s HB542 explicitly allows students, coaches, teachers and other administrators to file a complaint that a specific athlete is too good, which opens her up to a level of scrutiny over her gender. However, there is no direction on how the state will determine and adjudicate such a claim. It’s not hard to see how this will quickly make more masculine-presenting cisgender girls vulnerable to such complaints.",
            "Strangio added that the country is at a critical point — and people need to realize just how slippery this slope is. “People need to educate themselves to understand the nature of the threat that’s at play. If anyone is being lulled by the idea that this is limited to sports or even limited to health care for trans kids, they have another thing coming to them. These efforts will quickly expand well beyond that.”",
            "One father of an 11-year-old transgender girl put the entire debate into perspective on Wednesday when speaking on the floor of the North Carolina General Assembly.",
            "“We keep talking about what would be fair in sports and what would be fair for girls competing against other girls. I think my right and my daughter’s right and the right of transgender people everywhere to be recognized as ourselves in our lives — it’s not fair for me not to have that, and it’s not fair for [my daughter] not to have that,” said the father, who is also trans. “And I feel like that might be a bigger issue of fairness than somebody else’s right to fairness in middle school soccer.”"

            "It happens every time: I stare at before-and-after photos of women who’ve gotten lip fillers, considering making an appointment. Then, as the social media algorithms are designed to do, I’m delivered videos full of warnings: “Filler migrates! It never dissolves! Look how disfigured these people’s faces are now!” The voices shout at me while I’m shown MRIs of blobs of filler that have migrated from someone’s cheekbones to behind their eyeballs.",
            "It’s enough to scare anyone away from the seemingly simple procedure, but with dermal fillers becoming so ubiquitous, it can’t actually be as bad as these videos try to make us believe. Right?",
            "What is filler, anyway?",
            "Fillers are injected into the face to create a variety of looks, to add volume where it’s been lost to age or where it never existed. They plump lips, heighten cheeks, smooth smile lines and build jaw lines.",
            "Understand that “dermal filler” comes in many forms. There are different brands, and within those brands are unique formulas, but the most commonly used are short-term fillers like Juvederm and Restylane. These are mostly made of hyaluronic acid (HA), an ingredient that naturally occurs in our skin and has been modified to create a more stable, long-lasting substance.",
            "“Overall, HA fillers have become the material of choice due to their favorable properties: safe, long-lasting, non-immunogenic and cost-effective,” said Samuel Lin, associate professor of surgery at Harvard Medical School and a board-certified plastic surgeon. In the case that something goes wrong or the patient doesn’t like the final results, a solution called hyaluronidase can be used to dissolve the filler.",
            "Though fillers can cause temporary swelling, they are approved by the Food and Drug Administration and are considered safe, coming with few side effects or known long-term consequences. The key phrase here is “known long-term consequences.” If you want to learn exactly how much testing a particular filler underwent in order to receive approval, the FDA publicly shares data for dermal fillers. (For example, you can read the entire methodology behind testing Juvederm Voluma.) Ultimately, if you’re not comfortable with the testing that’s been done on a product, the decision is up to you. And always make sure that you’re seeing a board-certified dermatologist or plastic surgeon.",
            "How long do fillers last?",
            "For those who want the convenience of a temporary filler, the marketed lifespan of these short-term fillers is six to 12 months (depending on the filler used and an individual’s lifestyle). But though the filler itself is deemed safe for use, what about all those claims of filler sticking around years later?",
            "It’s not a surprise to Dr. Anil Rajani, who specializes in minimally invasive aesthetics (and often discusses filler on his YouTube channel). “In terms of longevity, there’s no question that these fillers last longer than what the approval studies follow for duration of effect,” Rajani said, referring to fillers he’s dissolved years after injection.",
            "So why are we told differently? Rajani says it comes down to the FDA approval process, which looks at safety and duration, the studies of which last around six months to two years. In these studies, the amount of product remaining in the face is based on external appearance, not actual tissue sampling of what’s left in the body.",
            "“People think that the product is totally gone at one year, which is erroneous,” Rajani said. “In fact, filler can be in the body for several years, and this is evidenced by the recent flare-ups within people’s face after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine,” he said, referring to the few patients who have experienced swelling in areas with filler. In one case, the patient had gotten the filler years earlier. “I personally have dissolved filler in my eye region from product six years prior,” Rajani said.",
            "The body begins to absorb the filler in about four to six months, Lin added. “However, it is not uncommon for fillers to last much longer (one to two years), depending on the location, brand of filler used and injection technique.” How much filler is injected and the body’s metabolism make a difference, too, and because hyaluronic acid fillers can absorb water, it can make the fillers more visible.",
            "How and why does filler migrate to other parts of the face?",
            "As far as those scary-looking MRIs go (which are the exception, not the norm), there are quite a few factors behind why filler can end up beyond where it had been injected.",
            "“A high volume of filler injected, and filler injected into high-pressure areas, can lead to filler overflowing into adjacent areas with lower pressure,” Lin explained. In the case of lip fillers, it can lead to a “filler mustache,” where filler injected into the lips spreads above the mouth.",
            "But just because filler has migrated doesn’t necessarily mean it’s going to cause any harm. And if it does ― likely by becoming infected or forming nodules ― the filler can be dissolved with hyaluronidase. “The low-level amounts remaining in the body have not been shown to be a problem,” Rajani said. “Because it is in such small amounts, it isn’t visible to the human eye. So at this point, there are no known long-term side effects to this, but we are always monitoring.”",
            "Lin agrees. “Filler migration and fillers that last a long time do not necessarily indicate anything unsafe.”",
            "Though fillers are generally safe, they are not without risks. But those risks — like being injected by an untrained provider or by someone using unapproved or “black market” fillers — can be mitigated by going to a licensed professional with extensive training. “Finding the right plastic surgeon or dermatologist to perform your dermal filler procedure and optimize your safety is key,” Lin said. During your consultation, ask questions about the procedure and the filler used, and be sure you feel comfortable before proceeding.",
            "The problems that fear-mongering content creators warn of aren’t completely without merit, but perhaps their message is overblown. Filler migration is real, and the length of time these fillers exist can surpass their marketed lifespan. But a provider who knows what they are doing can turn these into non-issues, and, most important, do so safely."

            "Conway touted Moreno in a statement as “not a politician. He’s a conservative, a political outsider, and a successful businessman just like President Donald J. Trump. He has lived the American Dream and wishes to protect it for future generations.”",
            "Moreno wants to be seen as the Trump-like candidate, even though he blasted Trump as a “lunatic” and a “maniac” in emails with a Republican fundraising consultant in 2016, NBC News reported Monday.",
            "Moreno has joined what’s shaping up to be a crowded Republican primary to succeed retiring Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio).",
            "The leading contenders are former state Treasurer Josh Mandel and former state party chairwoman Jane Timken. So far all, including Moreno, appear to be competing to convince voters that they’re the most like Trump.",
            "The former president hasn’t yet endorsed anyone. But four candidates — Mandel, Timken, Moreno and Ohio investment banker Mike Gibbons — vied for his support at an agitated meeting last month at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida in what one observer compared to a scene from the “Hunger Games,” Politico reported.",
            "Conway’s involvement in Moreno’s campaign could be an indication of which way Trump is leaning, but Conway wasn’t giving out any hints.",
            "“My conversations with President Trump are private. I would never dangle or promise President Trump’s endorsement to any candidate. That is his alone to grant or withhold,” she told Politico.",
            "Conway and Moreno both attended GOP functions last week at Mar-a-Lago. Conway addressed contributors and met privately with Trump several times during her visit, sources told Politico.",
            "Conway most recently made news by appearing backstage at “American Idol” to support 16-year-old daughter Claudia Conway in the singing competition. The smiling mother-daughter scenes were a marked contrast to ugly confrontations at home captured on tape and posted online by Claudia. The teen was booted in an “American Idol” elimination round last month."

            "It’s December 2025, the end of a difficult year. Just a few months earlier, a massive hurricane destroyed dozens of homes in your town, even killed a few of your neighbors. Your house was fine, but you lost power for weeks. The waterfront park where you liked to eat lunch between shifts as a cashier is underwater. Trees are still down, and mudslides cover several roads, making it basically impossible to pick up the extra money you made driving an Uber. Despair starts to eclipse the guilt you feel for surviving the storm.",
            "Then one day you’re scrolling your social media feed and see an update from one of your friends. She’s replanting native trees in the park and helping restore the wetland that once absorbed storm surge before developers drained it to build some beachfront McMansions. She’s earning a better wage than you are and receiving on-the-job training from a local union. You text her, asking how she got the gig. She sends you a link to the Civilian Climate Corps homepage.",
            "That federal program does not yet exist. But that’s how Becca Ellison, the policy manager at the climate group Evergreen Action, envisions the concept that’s quickly gaining traction in Washington, D.C.",
            "Last month, the Biden administration asked Congress to provide $10 billion as part of its $2 trillion infrastructure package to get a Civilian Climate Corps off the ground. On Wednesday, Evergreen released a 20-page report outlining for the first time how the federal government could feasibly create such a program.",
            "As its name implies, the new CCC would hark back to a similar program, the New Deal-era Civilian Conservation Corps. Starting at the peak of the Great Depression in 1933, the original CCC put up to 300,000 Americans (mostly young white men) to work planting billions of trees, digging flood-control channels and cutting hiking trails in public parks for the equivalent of more than $600 per month in today’s dollars.",
            "The new corps described in Evergreen’s memo, shared first with HuffPost, takes a far more ambitious approach. The program would be five times bigger, employing about 1.5 million Americans without the age cap or racial and gender restrictions that limited the original CCC.",
            "It would take on a much more expansive portfolio, including installing solar panels and wind turbines, maintaining public transit systems, and retrofitting homes and buildings to be more energy efficient. It would offer Medicare health coverage, child care stipends and partnerships with labor unions to provide pre-apprenticeship education to enlistees.",
            "“We’re trying to capture the ethos of the American spirit that’s been lost since the New Deal,” Ellison said.",
            "It’d be a far cry from the rustic work camps set up on federal land in rural swaths of the country during the 1930s. Instead, the new plan aims to build modern federal campuses or offer rental vouchers near work sites. Unlike the original CCC, which Congress shuttered in 1942 as World War II shrank the pool of men in need of work, the new program would embed itself into the community fabric, providing grants to existing local programs and partnering with civic organizations to serve long-unmet neighborhood needs.",
            "“The size, the efficiency, and the confluence of a strong role for government in alleviating unemployment with a commitment to important goals ― that’s where the original CCC is a model, the general idea of it,” said Benjamin Alexander, a historian at the New York City College of Technology who wrote a book on the original program. “I stress ‘general idea’ because I think, for the most part, the potential similarities stop there.”",
            "How It Would Work",
            "The program would build off the model of AmeriCorps, the civic jobs program funded in part by the federal government. But it would pay better, take on a more centrally directed mission and help corps members plan for long-term careers.",
            "Despite being the largest existing federal corps program, AmeriCorps employs only 75,000 volunteers per year, many earning a stipend of no more than $4,000 for up to 12 months of service. The CCC would pay 20 times more workers at least $15 per hour, plus benefits, and provide a Green Careers Network that would seek to train enrollees for permanent jobs and direct them to high-paying private employers. That provision actually echoes the New Deal corps, which provided enlistees with classes on agronomy, typing and forestry in the camps at night after the work was done.",
            "The new career network would likely fall under the Department of Labor, which already administers apprenticeships and grant programs, such as the Workforce Opportunity for Rural Communities Initiative and the Job Corps.",
            "Yet even those existing programs require climate-minded overhauls. For example, the Evergreen report found that only three Job Corps career centers ― in New York, New Mexico and Puerto Rico ― offer training to install solar panels and thermal heating systems.",
            "The federal government is legally barred today from making the same mistakes of segregating its workers by race and gender that it did in the 1930s. But one of the other big problems the new proposal aims to avoid this time is clashes with local communities. Then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt put 11 CCC camps in New York’s Bear Mountain State Park, prompting a petition in 1935 from men in the area who complained that the projects threatened their land and excluded them from the work. Fearing bad publicity, Roosevelt shuttered the camps.",
            "To avoid that problem, Evergreen called for the new program to establish an interagency Climate Workforce Council under the White House Council on Environmental Quality that would, among other things, solicit input on projects from local governments, labor unions and community organizations. Neil Maher, author of the 2008 book “Nature’s New Deal,” said the plan’s “emphasis on local communities’ input” was “the most impressive aspect.”",
            "“In the 1930s, the local communities were very involved in local CCC camps: They visited, camps encouraged locals to visit and the young men went into town every week,” said Maher, a historian at Rutgers University. “But local people did not have control or say over what projects the corps was doing. That came from the federal government, and the projects were really top-down.",
            "Jerry Apps, the Wisconsin historian and author of the book ”The Civilian Conservation Corps in Wisconsin: Nature’s Army at Work,” said Evergreen’s proposal blended the original CCC with the New Deal’s Works Progress Administration and called the paper “an excellent beginning.” But he criticized the proposal for failing to include agriculture projects as part of its vision.",
            "“Climate change will affect agriculture and the world’s food supply more than any of us can now realize,” he said in an email. “CCC enrollees could, in a variety of ways, work to establish alternative farming strategies, vertical farming, and small acreage farming, food, clean air, clean water and well-tended soil are essential for survival.”",
            "As a starting point, the Biden administration could expand those efforts at the Job Corps, beef up the Department of the Interior’s Public Lands Corps, and set new funding priorities for AmeriCorps to focus its efforts on energy efficiency, tree planting and ecological restoration.",
            "Congress could then cobble together some Democrats’ existing bills to lay the groundwork for the CCC. Delaware Sen. Chris Coons’ COVID-focused CORPS Act provides a model for how legislation could focus existing corps efforts on a major problem. Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin’s RENEW Conservation Corps Act offers language on how the Climate Workforce Council could be established through a memorandum of understanding among its member agencies. Florida Rep. Frederica Wilson’s Youth Corps Act and Colorado Rep. Joe Neguse’s 21st Century Conservation Corps for Our Health and Our Jobs Act highlight pathways for increasing and cementing federal funding for the program.",
            "“To combat the interlocking crises of the moment — climate change, racial injustice, a global pandemic, and income inequality — our government has an opportunity to modernize a great idea from the past and tailor it to meet the present and the future,” Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) said in a statement. “The Civilian Climate Corps will provide an opportunity for millions of Americans from every walk of life to earn a good wage while serving his or her community and training to transform our economy.”",
            "The report will likely receive attention from the new administration. President Joe Biden’s proposal to rebuild the nation’s infrastructure ― recently dubbed by one columnist “a New Deal with green characteristics” ― borrows heavily from the plans Washington Gov. Jay Inslee authored as part of his ill-fated but influential climate-centered bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. Evergreen was founded by former members of Inslee’s campaign. Maggie Thomas, a co-founder of Evergreen, recently left to serve as chief of staff to Biden’s domestic climate czar, Gina McCarthy.",
            "The White House declined to comment on the specific proposal but confirmed the program was a priority for the administration.",
            "“President Biden knows that a Civilian Climate Corp is going to be instrumental in tackling climate change and creating good jobs putting people to work restoring public lands and waters, planting trees, improving access to parks,” a spokesperson said.",
            "Bipartisan Voter Support, But ‘No Such Luxury’ From Lawmakers",
            "The program is expected to be popular. Among likely voters in October, 79% supported creating a Civilian Climate Corps, including 78% of Democrats and 84% of Republicans, according to polling by the left-leaning think tank Data for Progress.",
            "Despite that widespread support, Alexander warned that Democrats’ slim majority in Congress and Republicans’ hyper-partisan opposition to Biden’s agenda present a much more challenging legislative process than the Roosevelt administration faced when passing the original CCC in 1933.",
            "“Despite all the heated political rhetoric of the time, FDR was actually able to get quite a bit of bipartisan cooperation in Congress for New Deal experiments like the CCC,” Alexander said. “Biden today has no such luxury.”",
            "The program could even face some blowback from progressives, who have already criticized the $10 billion Biden requested in March for a climate corps as far too little to make a difference. Ellison said the proposal “is a good down payment on what an ambitious Climate Corps could look like.”",
            "“Congress could go further,” she said. “We think this program presents a huge opportunity to put Americans to work building a just, sustainable future.”"

            "Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) has claimed that enough Republicans will support expanding voting rights that Democrats shouldn’t change Senate rules in order to pass the voting rights bill that has been their priority since winning full control of Congress.",
            "There’s a catch though: Senate Republicans don’t seem particularly interested.",
            "The “Gang of 10” Republicans that have negotiated with Manchin and other Democrats on various pieces of legislation say they oppose the For the People Act. In interviews this week, most sounded hostile to core parts of the bill, undermining Manchin’s central argument. Without 10 Republicans voting for the measure, it’s doomed.",
            "The bill would reform campaign finance and ethics rules, and its voting rights expansions would mandate automatic, same-day and online voter registration; 15 days of early voting; no excuse absentee voting; limits on lines at polling locations; and a host of provisions providing voters with options of where to cast their ballots, including mobile voting locations and drop boxes.",
            "The bill’s ballot access provisions would set a national floor for voting access that would avoid a lot of the supposed confusion around electoral processes that occurred during the coronavirus pandemic in 2020.",
            "Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) said he has spoken to Manchin about the For The People Act, but he remains opposed to the main elements of it, characterizing them as “Washington ... saying, you know, there’s a one-size-fits-all plan for every state.”",
            "“My principle would be, make it easy to vote, like it’s hard to cheat, but don’t federalize the system,” Portman said. “A lot of the states have come with practices that work best for them.”",
            "When asked if there were individual voting provisions they could support, such as automatic registration, his fellow Gang of 10 members demurred. Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) said simply that he’d be willing to look at Manchin’s ideas.",
            "“I would like to see us make it easier for people to vote, and make it harder to cheat,” Romney said.",
            "“Make it easier to vote but harder to cheat” is a slogan Republicans in Georgia and elsewhere have used to champion new restrictions on voting in the wake of Donald Trump’s election loss, which the ex-president has falsely blamed on fraud. There is no evidence of mass voter or election fraud that would necessitate concerns about “cheating” in any recent midterm or presidential election cycle.",
            "In a very brief hallway interview on Wednesday, Manchin said he did think he was making progress with Republicans on the issue. “We’re talking,” he told HuffPost.\n\nSens. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Jerry Moran (R-Kansas.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) said they hadn’t spoken to him about the voting bill, nor did they cite any provisions in the bill that they support.",
            "“I know that I am strongly opposed to H.R. 1 as written,” Moran said, referring to the For the People Act by the legislation number of the House version of the bill, which passed in March.",
            "Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), another of the Republicans open to negotiating on legislation with Democrats, said she didn’t know what Manchin had in mind. HuffPost asked if she supported automatic or same-day registration; she said West Virginia has a good motor voter law. (West Virginia has a form of automatic voter registration through its DMV services, although Republicans in the state legislature are currently working to gut it.)",
            "“Same-day registration, I think, should be at the discretion of the state and I personally don’t agree with that,” Capito said.",
            "Sen. Todd Young (R-Ind.), another Gang of 10 member, said all he needs to know about the bill is that it changes the Federal Election Commission from a six-member body consisting of three Democrats and three Republicans to a five-member body with a partisan majority.",
            "“Turning the Federal Election Commission into a partisan body is all I need to know,” Young said. “I’m done with it. I don’t spend a lot of time discussing it with my colleagues.”",
            "These Republicans are the few who are even open to negotiating compromises with the Democratic majority. The other 40 are uninterested in negotiation and firmly opposed to legislation like the For The People Act. Democrats would need at least 10 Republicans to pass some version of the For The People Act while maintaining the Senate’s current filibuster rules.",
            "Most Senate Democrats want to change Senate rules so that the body can approve legislation without needing to overcome a filibuster, which requires 60 votes. A key reason many Democrats support changing the rule is so that they can pass the key voting reforms in the For The People Act, preempting some new voting restrictions imposed by the Republican-held state legislature in Georgi, versions of which are advancing in other states like Arizona, Florida, Michigan and New Hampshire.",
            "Since Democrats control only 50 Senate seats, Manchin — who is both more conservative than most of his colleagues and hails from a state that voted for Trump by a nearly 40 point margin — can single-handedly block a change to the filibuster rule, which he’s argued shouldn’t be necessary for the For the People Act.",
            "“There is also bipartisan support for voting reform and many of the initiatives outlined in the For the People Act,” Manchin wrote in a Washington Post op-ed explaining his opposition to changing the filibuster rule. He said he believes Republicans would support “efforts to expand voting hours and access, improve our election security and increase transparency in campaign finance and advertisement rules.”",
            "Manchin has also said that Democrats shouldn’t pass the bill without Republican support because doing so would alienate Trump supporters — hundreds of whom attacked the Capitol in January as Congress tried to certify the 2020 election result.",
            "Freshman Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.) told HuffPost that he’s talked to Manchin about the For the People Act and the West Virginia Democrat “understands we gotta pass voting rights.”",
            "“The ball is in the court of the Republicans. So let’s see what they do,” Warnock said. “There ought to be 10 Republican senators who believe in voting rights. If there are not, we’re going to pass it no matter what.”"

        },
        "articleContent": [
            "It takes a lot of courage for a loved one to open up to you about a traumatic experience they’ve been through. Trauma can span a range of events like physical or emotional abuse, sexual assault, a car accident, a health crisis, a shooting, a natural disaster or the death of a loved one (just to name a few).",
            "So when a person you care about decides to share their personal story, you want to respond to their pain in the “right” way — but it can be hard to know what that is. Often, in trying to be supportive, friends or family inadvertently say something insensitive that backfires and causes hurt instead.",
            "Tovah Means, a trauma therapist at Watch Hill Therapy in Chicago, said many survivors never tell anyone what happened to them because they’re afraid they’ll be judged or blamed for it. Others choose not to speak up because they think what they’ve been through isn’t “that bad.” So if a loved one does confide in you, then you want to honor that.",
            "“Your response has the power to show them that it’s safe to open up to people or that it’s better to stay quiet,” Means told HuffPost. “People don’t need advice, solutions, comparisons or trite comments about suffering. They need listening, empathy and support on their terms.”",
            "Below, we asked trauma therapists to share the phrases to avoid when someone tells you their trauma story and what to say instead.",
            "What Not To Say",
            "“It could have been worse.”",
            "In saying this, your intention may be to give your loved one some perspective or to help them find the “silver lining” in their situation. But know that these words can be harmful, as they minimize the very real suffering this person has endured. They may already feel like what they’ve been through isn’t serious enough to qualify as trauma — and by saying this, you’re only reinforcing that.",
            "“People who share their trauma or concerns often hope to have their pain acknowledged,” said Abigail Makepeace, a Los Angeles marriage and family therapist who specializes in trauma. “Telling someone that ‘it could have been worse’ not only denies their need for this recognition, but if they’re experiencing sadness or resulting trauma, can compound feelings of shame.”",
            "With these words, you’re unintentionally implying that they should actually be grateful for how things turned out rather than recognizing their suffering.",
            "“Well, that happened to you because you did or didn’t...”",
            "This type of comment falls under “victim-blaming,” which is when someone suggests that if a person had done something differently (had less to drink, didn’t stay out so late or left the toxic relationship sooner, for example) that the traumatic event wouldn’t have occurred. This is not only inaccurate — we can’t always prevent bad things from happening to us, no matter how hard we try — but it’s also insensitive.",
            "“We live in an anxious society that teaches us that everything should be in our control, but that’s not reality,” said Tracy Vadakumchery, a licensed mental health counselor in New York who specializes in anxiety and trauma. “When we rationalize a survivor’s experience or look to assign blame to them, we’re beating a dead horse. Their experience likely created this distorted belief system already — that bad things that can happen should always be in their control.”",
            "“The same thing happened to me or someone I know.”",
            "It’s understandable that you’d want to show you can relate to what they’re going through on some level. But the first conversation about their trauma may not be the right time to disclose yours. You want to give the other person ample space to share as much of their story as they feel comfortable sharing without you interjecting.",
            "“Although wanting to compare similar stories might sometimes come from a place of not wanting the survivor to feel alone, it can often make the survivor feel like you aren’t listening or that they have to switch from receiving care to giving it,” Means said. “When someone is telling you their story, resist the urge to bring yourself into it immediately.”",
            "A future conversation may be a more appropriate time to share what happened to you. That said, if you think sharing a similar story might be beneficial in the moment, ask the other person’s permission first. “Keep it brief, refocusing on the trauma survivor,” Means added.",
            "“Everything happens for a reason.”",
            "People like to tell trauma survivors that their pain has meaning — that there’s some deeper reason this awful thing happened to them. It’s easy to fall back on well-worn platitudes when you’re at a loss for words. But know that these kinds of responses can be invalidating to a survivor. Plus, it’s not really your place to try to make sense of their suffering.",
            "“Saying that things happen for a reason or some other hopeful but not helpful comment is often a response that is more about comforting the listener than the survivor,” Means said. “Bad things happen all the time, but that doesn’t mean there is some ultimate reason for it or some meaning to make out of it. It’s up to the survivor how they ultimately make meaning out of their trauma.”",
            "“Wow, that seems like a lot. Are you getting help for that?”",
            "Again, the intent here is positive: You want to ensure your loved one has the proper support they need to process what they’ve been through. And while it might make sense to encourage them to speak to a professional eventually, you also don’t want to give off the impression that you’re incapable of handling what they’ve just shared with you.",
            "Consider, too, that you might be the first person they’ve opened up to so far. So such a question may be premature.",
            "“Survivors mostly don’t share their trauma with others because they feel ashamed or scared that something bad happened to them and they feel worried about how others will see them because of it,” Means said. “This comment shuts down the conversation and can cause the survivor to not want to talk to you anymore about what happened. It also signals that you can’t handle what they are telling you.”",
            "What To Say Instead",
            "When someone you care about shares their trauma story with you, your instinct may be to go into fixing mode. Keep in mind that the person might not need solutions; they might just need support.",
            "“It’s important to accept that there usually isn’t a quick or obvious solution to helping others heal,” Makepeace said. “Letting someone know that you’re sorry, care, and are willing to help can be powerful and provide much-needed acknowledgment and support.”",
            "Here are some simple but powerful phrases to try:",
            "“I’m not even sure what to say but I’m glad you told me.”",
            "It’s OK — normal even — if you can’t find the right words and aren’t exactly sure how to respond. You can even say as much. By adding that you’re grateful they opened to you, you’ll help this person feel less alone and show them that their story is safe with you.",
            "“Just letting them know that you are there for them and that you are glad they shared is enough,” Means said. “For example, ‘I know that must not have been easy to tell me, I am glad you did and I’m here for you if you want to share more.’ Support doesn’t mean solving their problems, it just means that you are solid enough to trust and bring hard stories to.”",
            "“I’m so sorry that happened to you.”",
            "Again, your response doesn’t need to be complicated — just compassionate.",
            "“This is simple, but one of the greatest things to say to show up for someone telling their trauma story,” Vadakumchery said. “It shows that you acknowledge their pain and see the harm that their experience caused them.”",
            "“I don’t know exactly how you felt, but if it were me, I would be so scared/sad/angry.”",
            "Practice empathy for a moment by imagining what it might be like if you went through the same thing. Consider how you might feel in those circumstances.",
            "“Maybe you would feel scared or sad. Maybe you would be confused and not know what to do. Maybe you would be angry,” Means said.",
            "Then use this information to formulate your response.",
            "“Just letting them know you are willing to put yourself in their shoes, even for a moment, can feel caring,” Means said. “Empathy can also look like a sad, caring or compassionate look on your face. It could be putting your phone down when you realize they need your attention. It doesn’t have to be wordy or sophisticated.”",
            "“Is there anything I can do to support you?”",
            "“Asking what they need shows that you respect how they decide to move forward with their story, and also that you’re showing up for them,” Vadakumchery said.",
            "If you think your friend could benefit from talking to a mental health professional, you can gently suggest the idea of therapy. Try something like, “As your friend, I’m always here to listen and support you. But I can see you’re really struggling and I’m not an expert. I can help you find a therapist who specializes in this area if you’re interested.”",
            "And even if your loved one isn’t sure what they need right now, checking in this way demonstrates that you care and are willing to help however you can, Makepeace said."

            "While a fragrance can say a lot about your personality, we’d be lying if we said selecting the right scent isn’t complicated.",
            "With that being said, perfume pricing can vary widely — and it’s not immediately clear if there’s really a difference between budget fragrances and luxury perfumes. So we tapped three master perfumers to answer this burning beauty question.",
            "Ahead is an in-depth look into the advantages and considerations attached to both types of perfumes, as well how they differ in terms of sourced ingredients, manufacturing process and more.",
            "The process used to make luxury and budget scents is essentially the same.",
            "While luxury and budget perfumes can differ greatly in the quality of ingredients (more on that later!) used in the formula, the process for making both scents is still essentially the same, according to expert perfumer and founder of Eat. Sweat. Undress Alexia P. Hammonds.",
            "“While process and equipment may differ with smaller indie brands, essentially the perfume-making process is still the same,” Hammonds said. She explained that to make perfume, sourced synthetic and natural ingredients are decanted into large steel tanks before being weighed out. Next comes the maturation phase, which can take up to three weeks. Then, the process entails dilution in alcohol, maceration (if residual waxes from plants clump together), chilling and filtering.",
            "But some luxury and budget perfumes can differ in quality of ingredients.",
            "Just like award-winning chefs tend to use high-quality ingredients in their kitchens, Paolo Terenzi, president and perfumer of Tiziana Terenzi fine fragrances, said that some luxury fragrances have the advantage of incorporating high-quality sourced ingredients into their formulas.",
            "“Luxury perfumes are more likely to use natural notes (derived from florals, spices, etc.) instead of those that are synthetic,” he explained. “These notes are then incorporated into the base, middle and top notes of a scent, which allows the fragrance to be more aromatic and complex.”",
            "In addition to higher-quality ingredients, Hammonds added that luxury fragrances often contain a higher percentage of perfume oil than their cheaper counterparts. This allows the fragrance to last longer, as a result. (Wondering how strong a fragrance is? The terms used to describe it ― parfum, eau de parfum, eau de toilette, etc. ― indicate its concentration of oil.)",
            "But while budget perfumes are cheaper to produce because of their utilization of synthetic ingredients, they still can be suitable for those who prefer a single-note fragrance, as the scent is more straightforward, said Terry Carter, in-house perfumer and chief formulator at Travertine Spa, Inc.",
            "However, he added that inexpensive perfumes do not contain layers of notes, which can be a turnoff to those looking for an in-depth olfactory experience.",
            "“In a sense, budget perfumes can be very straightforward due to a lack of complexity in scent notes,” Carter told HuffPost. “However, akin to wine, an aged Beaujolais will have [more] depth and complexity [than] a budget table wine.”",
            "Don’t assume that luxury scents always contain natural ingredients.",
            "While some finer scents do have the advantage of using higher-quality ingredients, it’s important to acknowledge that both luxury and budget brands both can contain synthetic ingredients, Hammonds said.",
            "“People often think that luxury brands only contain natural ingredients and it’s not true,” Hammonds explained. “Musk is now a synthetic ingredient, since it was banned from sourcing it from the animal.”",
            "Yes, luxury perfumes can be overpriced.",
            "Terenzi said that fragrance price is usually based on the rarity and cost of the raw materials composing the perfume, whereas only a small component of the price is based on the materials used to make the bottle or the box.",
            "However, he affirmed that there are instances when perfumes cost more than they should be valued.",
            "“Unfortunately, it happens sometimes due to marketing forcing, along with campaigns entrusted to very expensive testimonials,” he explained. “These extra costs are unjustifiably charged to consumers, and is a sad law of the market.”",
            "Budget brands may opt for to use inexpensive ingredients to keep costs down. However, Hammonds said many indie brands have developed cheaper scents that are just as potent as expensive ones.",
            "“Budget brands have created some of the most popular and cult-worthy followings due to the quality of their product,” she added. “Fragrance is so subjective.”",
            "Which is the better perfume choice?",
            "Because this is such a subjective topic, it depends who you ask. Beauty is in the eye (or rather, nose) of the beholder.",
            "On one hand, Terenzi said it’s best to choose quality over quality when selecting a fragrance. “I have always preferred quality to quantity, and perfumes are no exception to this rule of quality,” he added. “It is much better to have a fragrance of excellent quality, great power and long lasting rather than a hundred mediocre creations. Let’s not forget that a quality perfume persists on our body for at least ten hours, whereas most commercial products have already vanished and must be sprayed again after less than two hours.”",
            "However, while luxury perfumes can boast fancy packaging and a brand name, Hammonds believes pricing does not make one fragrance reign supreme over the next. Instead, she advised looking for a fragrance that speaks to your own individual wants and needs.",
            "“It is always a matter of preference and what suits your individual needs,” she said. “What factors into why a fragrance can be extremely expensive is its lasting power, the percentage of oils versus alcohol, packaging and brand power.”"

            "It’s been a year since the coronavirus pandemic upended the U.S. restaurant industry, necessitating innovations in takeout, carry-out cocktails, expanding outdoor dining and contactless technology. Trends that weren’t supposed to take hold for years have occurred at an accelerated rate.",
            "“Looking at 2020, obviously it was the worst year in history for the United States restaurant industry,” said Hudson Riehle, senior vice president of the research and knowledge group for the National Restaurant Association. “In all the industries in America, the restaurant industry was the most impacted in terms of employment and sales decline.”",
            "Riehle said 2020 ended with an estimated $240 billion less sales than 2019 — a 19.2% decrease — and that 2 million restaurant workers remain out of work, even though the country is staring to reopen.",
            "HuffPost spoke with industry experts on what restaurants will look like after the pandemic. One thing everyone agreed upon: Recovery will take time.",
            "“It’s going to be very hard to have a thriving independent restaurant business when you’re basically trying to climb out of debt,” said Edward Lee, chef, restaurateur and co-founder of the philanthropic The Lee Initiative. “I think it’s going to be very challenging and no one ultimately knows what’s going to happen. Will restaurants have the money to support the small, independent farms? Will small, independent restaurants be able to do all the cool things they used to do before, with the decorations and the meaningful menus? All that stuff costs money.”",
            "“The restaurant crisis is still going to be with us for a while,” Lee added, noting that it’s currently challenging for restaurant owners to get money from both banks and private investors.",
            "Riehle said business should pick up as the vaccine rollout continues and it gets warmer around the country.",
            "“But it’s still a huge abyss to overcome,” he said.",
            "Sluggish Indoor Dining",
            "With vaccines in high gear — including inoculations of restaurant workers — and dining rooms reopening across the country, it should be safe to eat indoors again if you’ve been fully vaccinated. However, Lee said consumers are reluctant to do so.",
            "“There’s been a lot of damage done to restaurants. Not just financially, but also from a public standpoint,” he said. “There was a lot of restaurant-bashing that was being done during the pandemic, and a lot of people created this unfair narrative where restaurants were reopening simply out of profit, and that just wasn’t the case.”",
            "Lee kept most of his restaurants operating — and even opened the brand-new Cincinnati restaurant Khora in October — so his employees could keep their health insurance during the pandemic.",
            "It may take some time, but industry experts say people will probably become increasingly comfortable returning to pre-pandemic dining situations.",
            "“There’s a romance to restaurants, and I am fighting so hard not to lose that,” Lee said.",
            "Caroline Styne, a co-owner of the Los Angeles-based Lucques Group who managed to keep A.O.C Wine Bar open with partner Suzanne Goin, agreed.",
            "“As people get vaccinated, they’re feeling more and more comfortable about being out,” said Styne, who is also on the advisory board of the Independent Restaurant Coalition, which worked with Congress to pass the Restaurant Revitalization Fund. “I know I am. Actually, I ate indoors at a restaurant last night, a very small restaurant. My family and I all looked at each other going, ‘We’re all vaccinated, so I guess it’s OK.’”",
            "Styne is a fan of communal tables and hopes the seating option, along with general conviviality, returns to restaurants.",
            "“I think people will be inching closer and closer together,” she said. “People want to sit at a bar and have a drink. I think that in general, human beings want to be near other human beings, really closely. I think the year is going to see a very slow moment of tables getting closer and closer. But I’m not sure if by the end of the year that we will be back to our original seating arrangements.”",
            "Justin Hill, principal at Seattle-based architecture firm MG2, said his organization’s research showed that 75% of people plan to continue using curbside pickup after the pandemic and that 31% were less willing to use communal seating.",
            "Off-Premises Options Are Here To Stay",
            "Riehle said off-premises sales — meaning takeout, curbside pickup and delivery — accounted for 60% of all restaurant traffic before the pandemic, but increased to 90% during the second quarter of last year. And he doesn’t see takeout sales returning to pre-pandemic levels.",
            "For Elaine Townsend, co-owner of the newly opened Cincinnati-based Asian-inspired pastry and ramen shop Mochiko, said she lucked out and found a brick-and-mortar with a takeout window.",
            "“It was a very big selling point for us when we chose this spot,” she said. “With how unpredictable things have been during the pandemic, the ability to provide both quick service and dine-in service, when it became an option again, was something we knew we needed to have.”",
            "Another sector that has seen pandemic-era ubiquity is ghost kitchens, or delivery-only kitchens — which Riehle called “a long-term trend and not a fad,” even though less than 5% of operators have added delivery from a virtual or ghost kitchen since the beginning of the pandemic",
            "Townsend explained the appeal of ghost kitchens: “It allows a chef or owner of a small business to be able to sell their food without the same costs involved in a full restaurant like designing and building out a space, as well as hiring a large front-of-house staff.”",
            "The Return Of Automats",
            "Automats, which allow people to put a coin into a vending machine and purchased a pre-packaged meal, arrived in the U.S. in 1902. They practically went extinct 30 years ago, then experienced a brief revival in the aughts.",
            "“Automats originally disappeared because of shifts in culture and eating habits that [automats] didn’t adapt to,” said Joe Scutellaro, the principal owner of Automat Kitchen in Jersey City. “People were moving away from cities to suburbs. Fast food chains were popping up on every corner, and taste preferences were changing quickly. People were looking for healthier, fresh options.”",
            "But between his establishment, New York’s Brooklyn Dumpling Shop and Portland’s Pix Pâtisserie, the pandemic-ready option is back.",
            "They work a little differently now, though. At Automat Kitchen, for example, customers can order global-inspired food online (it’s all made fresh) and pick it up from a food locker inside the restaurant. Customers unlock the locker with their phone and only touch the food bag. (The restaurant also has indoor and outdoor dining options.)",
            "Will automats replace human employees? Probably not.",
            "“The future of food service and technology needs to be human-centric and focused on customer benefits,” Scutellaro said. “It all falls apart without the passion, perspective and empathy that technology just can’t deliver. And it also means that the digital, mobile and physical footprint of restaurants will need to become more blended and customized too.”",
            "Smaller Staffs",
            "Styne said restaurant staffs will probably shrink, especially initially.",
            "“We’ve all gotten by with less,” she said. “Everyone has had to dig in and change the way they work and maybe change the way they operate to accommodate lower staffing levels, and I’m sure some people will keep it that way. It’s a shame because you don’t want the jobs to be lost.”",
            "She mentioned some people have also been reluctant to return to work out of fear, which affects staffing.",
            "“I think people have been stuck at home for a year and haven’t been out and haven’t changed their habits and are afraid,” she said. “It’s just going to take time for people to get used to the idea that, ‘Oh, I can be around people again. That’s right. I’m not going to die the minute I walk out the front door.’”",
            "A Focus On Fixing Inequalities",
            "“Although I’m tired of the phrase ‘the new normal,’ it is an accurate description of our next future-state,” Hill said. “We can’t unlearn or erase the emotional memory of what we’ve all just experienced.”",
            "Both Lee and Styne would like to use the lessons of past year to correct the wrongs of the industry.",
            "“My fear is that humans have very short memories,” Styne said, noting that the past year has made people pay attention to important issues such as Black Lives Matter, anti-Asian violence, mistreatment of women and other forms of inequality.",
            "“If we can keep shining a light on these things that have come out in the pandemic, then that would be a godsend, because we need to be a more tolerant, understanding and a tighter community than we are,” she said.",
            "“What the pandemic did was give everyone time to reflect,” Lee said. “You don’t fix the system overnight. It’s not going to happen with a snap of a finger. I do hope that the other side of this is a restaurant industry that’s kinder, more activist, more worker-friendly, more sympathetic, and more about truly a community. At the end of the day, it’s made up of good people. We hear change. We want change. We see it. It’s just how to get to that finish line. It’s going to be challenging, but the restaurant industry is always met with challenges. We’ll meet this one, too.”"

            "The new budget has its share of standard Democratic priorities, but the suite of laws that collectively authorize spending priorities and regulations for the coming fiscal year also introduces a host of groundbreaking initiatives. In a key win for Weaver’s group, the state has extended its eviction moratorium for another year and created a $2.4 billion fund for low- and middle-income tenants to pay off as much as 12 months’ rent payments for which they are in arrears because of the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
            "For the first time in a decade, the state is due to fully fund public schools in accordance with a 2006 court ruling requiring New York to spend billions of dollars more to fulfill its constitutional obligation to provide residents an adequate education. The new state budget increases the court-mandated funding, known as Foundation Aid, by $1.4 billion, enabling New York to make up for years of underpayment.",
            "In addition, New York has created a $2.1 billion “excluded workers” fund that makes undocumented immigrant workers who lost work eligible for up to $15,600 in unemployment benefits. Because of these workers’ immigration status, they have been ineligible for federal benefits.",
            "Big Business Loses Its Guardian Angel",
            "The most radical element of New York’s budget, though, is the way it funds these priorities by asking the state’s wealthiest residents to pay more in taxes.",
            "New York’s millionaires are now due to pay the highest state income taxes in the country.",
            "New Yorkers earning $1 million to $5 million a year would see their top tax rate go from 8.82% to 9.65%. The budget creates income tax brackets subjecting earnings from $5 million to $25 million to a 10.3% tax rate and income above $25 million to a 10.9% tax.",
            "The state’s corporate income tax rate is also going from 6.5% to 7.25% for companies with incomes of $5 million a year or more.",
            "Providing New Yorkers with economic opportunity “means balancing tax structures, balancing wealth inequality,” said state Assemblywoman Amanda Septimo (D), a South Bronx progressive. “This is a budget that takes a serious attempt at doing that.”",
            "New York’s corporate community has been less enthusiastic.",
            "Kathryn Wylde, president and CEO of the Partnership for New York City, a big business lobby, told Daily News columnist Errol Louis that raising taxes in spite of the federal aid the state is due to receive is “pure venom.”",
            "Wylde’s criticism reflects the frustration of the larger business community with its diminished clout in Albany.",
            "The most obvious short-term reason for corporate New York’s losing hand is the declining influence of Cuomo. The business-friendly governor has spent the past month fending off calls for his resignation over allegations of sexual misconduct and for covering up the number of COVID-19 deaths in the state’s nursing homes.",
            "Since he has been focused on shoring up his public image, Cuomo was less directly involved in negotiating the budget than he ordinarily would be.",
            "What’s more, Democrats in the state legislature have the votes to override a veto by Cuomo.",
            "Given Cuomo’s desire to retain support in the state Assembly, which has the authority to impeach him, it is unlikely that he would risk alienating Democrats with a contentious budget fight, according to Bradley Tusk, a venture capitalist and centrist political consultant.",
            "“Cuomo didn’t have the power to stop them,” Tusk said.",
            "Changing The Players",
            "Cuomo’s new weakness, however, is only one of several reasons for the progressive nature of the budget. A decade of progressive organizing had shifted the ground underneath Cuomo long before scandals reduced his leverage.",
            "For his first eight years in office, Cuomo maintained a business-friendly consensus in Albany by doing what he could to keep Republicans in charge of the state Senate. For example, he quietly blessed the formation of the Independent Democratic Conference, a group of rogue Senate Democrats that effectively guaranteed GOP control of the chamber.",
            "But the 2016 election of Donald Trump as president radicalized New York Democrats. These Democrats, eager to fight back against Republicans, were furious to learn about the IDC’s existence, providing an organic constituency for a Democratic takeover of the state Senate led by seasoned outfits like the New York Working Families Party.",
            "“There is a bigger organized left than has existed recently and is working together with organized labor and some nonprofits to bring more people into politics,” said Weaver, a member of the New York City chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America, which also experienced explosive growth during this period.",
            "Although Cuomo brokered a deal to dissolve the IDC in April 2018, progressives refused to give up their campaign against the ex-IDC members. They succeeded in ousting six out of eight, signaling that New York Democrats were prepared to punish lawmakers who betrayed the party’s core principles.",
            "For its part, DSA helped elect Julia Salazar to the state Senate in a separate 2018 primary challenge. The Brooklyn Democrat has since been joined by five more DSA-aligned Democrats.",
            "Facing a Democratic-controlled legislature for the first time in 2019, Cuomo proved more pliant. He reluctantly agreed to sign a bill strengthening rent regulations for the state’s population of struggling tenants, defying the real estate industry with which he was usually aligned.",
            "Weaver sees the bill’s passage as a key turning point.",
            "“Ever since 2019 … organized people are able to outmaneuver the governor and win truly transformative, redistributive legislation in Albany,” she said.",
            "A slew of Republican retirements paved the way for another watershed election for Democrats in 2020. In November, New York Democrats won a veto-proof supermajority in the state Senate, complementing its existing supermajority in the Assembly.",
            "The progressive changes in this year’s budget would likely not have been possible without the larger Democratic majorities in the legislature.",
            "“There were a lot more receptive ears on the inside than there normally would be,” state Senate Deputy Majority Leader Michael Gianaris, a Queens Democrat, said.",
            "Winning The Game",
            "Even before the 2020 election results were known, a coalition of groups that included the New York WFP, the union-backed Stronger Economy for All coalition and Weaver’s Housing Justice for All were plotting a strategy to force Cuomo to raise taxes.",
            "The initiative that emerged from those discussions was the Invest in Our New York (IONY) campaign, which formally launched in January.",
            "The campaign’s stakeholders tapped Rebecca Bailin, who led a successful Riders Alliance effort to increase public transportation funding, as campaign manager. Monica Klein, a consultant for the New York WFP who ran the anti-IDC primary challengers’ press operations, would engineer the campaign’s strategic communications.",
            "Together, Bailin and Klein crafted a simple message ― “Tax the rich” ― with a clear target: Cuomo.",
            "“You have to have a united message and keep hammering it over and over again,” Bailin said.",
            "Every Friday morning, IONY leaders met with a group of core progressive lawmakers, or “champions,” to talk strategy.",
            "To help lawmakers win over wayward colleagues, IONY combined traditional activism events with resources aimed at winning the intellectual war.",
            "The coalition released a report on March 19 showing how the wealth of New York’s super-rich exploded during the pandemic and assembled an open letter from wealthy New Yorkers asking Cuomo to raise their own taxes.",
            "When it came to rebutting claims that tax hikes would prompt a mass exodus from New York, the research of Cornell University sociologist Cristobal Young, author of “The Myth of Millionaire Tax Flight,” proved critical.",
            "Based on an analysis of a dozen years of tax returns for 3.7 million Americans with annual incomes of $1 million or more, Young found that 0.3% of the total moved to lower-tax states.",
            "Tusk conceded that the tax hikes were not likely to trigger a flood of wealthy departures from New York but warned that “since so few people pay such a high percentage of the taxes, even a modest flight can cause a lot of problems.”",
            "“I hope the new spending does more than just make the left feel good because otherwise it would have accomplished more either by remaining in the economy or going to people directly through [universal basic income],” Tusk added.",
            "In the end, IONY and its allies employed a mixture of policy horse-trading and grassroots pressure to cajole just enough moderate Democratic holdouts.",
            "Volunteers from New York City DSA canvassed the neighborhoods of fence-sitting lawmakers, placing custom-made door hangers at voters’ doors with the office phone number of the lawmaker and a model script to use during a call.",
            "“Call your legislator and tell them no cuts to our subways, schools and hospitals ― Senator Brian Kavanagh, tax the rich,” a door hanger targeting a Lower Manhattan Democrat stated. (He ended up voting yes.)",
            "In the course of negotiations, plenty of progressive revenue raisers got left on the cutting-room floor, including a tax on large inheritances, a financial transactions tax and a long-term capital gains surtax.",
            "The left wants that additional revenue so New York can, among other things, enact universal pre-kindergarten education, adopt single-payer health care and provide housing vouchers to the state’s homeless population.",

            "Rivera has found himself commending his younger progressive colleagues for their passion and sharing in their frustration that the bill wasn’t even more ambitious. He then reminds them of just how far the legislature has come in such a short period.",

            "LONDON (AP) — Prince Philip royal ceremonial funeral will take place April 17 at Windsor Castle — a slimmed-down service amid the COVID-19 pandemic that will be entirely closed to the public.",
            "Philip, also known as the Duke of Edinburgh, took part in planning his funeral and its focus on family was in accordance with his wishes. The 99-year-old duke, who died Friday, also took part in designing the modified Land Rover that will carry his coffin.",
            "“Although the ceremonial arrangements are reduced, the occasion will still celebrate and recognize the duke’s life and his more than 70 years of service to the Queen, the UK and the Commonwealth,” a palace spokesman said Saturday while speaking on condition of anonymity in line with policy.",
            "Prince Harry, Philip’s grandson who stepped away from royal duties last year and now lives in California, will attend the service along with other members of the royal family. His wife, the Duchess of Sussex, who is pregnant, has been advised by her doctor not to attend.",
            "Palace officials said the ceremony would be conducted strictly in line with the British government’s COVID-19 guidelines, which restrict the number of people attending funerals to 30. They declined to say whether the royal family would be required to wear masks.",
            "The palace appealed to the public not to gather in Windsor, and for those who wished to pay their respects to Philips to stay at home instead.",
            "“While there is sadness that the public will not be able to physically be part of events to commemorate the life of the duke, the royal family asks that anyone wishing to express their condolences do so in the safest way possible and not by visiting Windsor or any other royal palaces to pay their respects,″ the palace spokesman said. “The family’s wish is very much that people continue to follow the guidelines to keep themselves and others safe.”",
            "The announcement comes after military teams across the U.K. and on ships at sea fired 41-gun salutes Saturday to mark the death of Philip, honoring the former naval officer and husband of Queen Elizabeth II whom they considered one of their own.",
            "Batteries in London, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast — the capitals of the four nations that make up the United Kingdom — as well as other cities around the U.K. and the Mediterranean outpost of Gibraltar fired the volleys at one-minute intervals beginning at midday. Ships including the HMS Montrose, a frigate patrolling the Persian Gulf, offered their own salutes.",
            "“The Duke of Edinburgh served among us during the Second World War, and he remained devoted to the Royal Navy and the Armed Forces as a whole,” Gen. Nick Carter, chief of the defense staff, said in a statement. “A life well-lived. His Royal Highness leaves us with a legacy of indomitable spirit, steadfastness and an unshakeable sense of duty.”",
            "Members of the Commonwealth, a group of 54 countries headed by the monarch, were also invited to honor Philip. The Australian Defense Force began its salute at 5 p.m. local time outside Parliament House in Canberra, and New Zealand planned to offer its own tribute on Sunday.",
            "Philip joined the Royal Navy as a cadet in 1939 and once had a promising military career. In 1941, he was honored for his service during the battle of Cape Matapan off the coast of Greece, when his control of searchlights aboard the HMS Valiant allowed the battleship to pinpoint enemy vessels in the dark. Philip rose to the rank of commander before he retired from active duty.",
            "Two years after the war ended, Philip married Elizabeth at Westminster Abbey when she was 21 and he was 26. Philip’s naval career came to an abrupt end when King George VI died in 1952 and his wife became queen.",
            "At the queen’s coronation in 1953, Philip swore to be his wife’s “liege man of life and limb” and settled into a life supporting the monarch. The couple had four children — Charles, the heir to the throne, Anne, Andrew and Edward.",
            "Before he retired from official duties in 2017, the prince carried out more than 22,000 solo public engagements and supported over 780 organizations, including the Duke of Edinburgh’s Award for young people.",
            "Members of the public continued to honor Philip’s life of service on Saturday, leaving flowers outside Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle despite appeals from authorities and the royal family to refrain from gathering.",
            "“I think everyone would like to pay their respects,” Maureen Field, 67, said outside Windsor Castle. “Because of the virus, a lot of people have to stay away. He didn’t want a big funeral. He wanted a very private time with his family to say their goodbyes. So, we’ve all got to respect that.”",
            "Mike Williams, 50, traveled from his home in Surrey, southwest of London, to Buckingham Palace to honor the prince.",

            "Then-27-year-old Chantel Giacalone went into anaphylactic shock after biting into a pretzel infused with peanut butter while in Las Vegas for a convention, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported Friday. Giacalone, an aspiring actor, had roles in “The Butterfly Effect 3: Revelations” and the web series “Hollow Walls.”",

            "He argued that neither of the two medics on-site that day had IV epinephrine, an adrenaline treatment for severe allergic reactions that is required by the Southern Nevada Health District. According to testimony during a three-week trial, the requirement was established by a task force the company sits on.",
            "Morris said the medics instead deployed intramuscular epinephrine, but IVs are required for full anaphylaxis.",

            "WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) — A second lieutenant in the U.S. Army is suing two Virginia police officers over a traffic stop last December during which the officers drew their guns, pointed them at him and used a slang term to suggest he was facing execution before pepper-spraying him and knocking him to the ground.",
            "Body camera footage shows Caron Nazario, who is Black and Latino, was dressed in uniform with his hands held in the air outside the driver’s side window as he told the armed officers, “I’m honestly afraid to get out.”",
            "“Yeah, you should be!” one of the officers responded during the stop at a gas station.",
            "In a lawsuit filed earlier this month, Nazario says his constitutional rights were violated during the traffic stop in the town of Windsor. The two sides in the case dispute what happened after a second police officer joined the first one in the stop. At the time, Nazario was coming from his duty station and going home, attorney Jonathan Arthur told The Associated Press on Friday.",
            "“Graduated from Virginia State University. He was commissioned out of their ROTC program. He’s an officer in the United States armed forces,” Arthur said. “These guys decide to do this to him.”",
            "Asked about Nazario’s condition after the incident, Arthur said, “He’s definitely not doing too well.”",
            "Windsor Police Officer Daniel Crocker radioed he was attempting to stop a vehicle with no rear license plate and tinted windows. He said the driver was “eluding police” and he considered it a “high-risk traffic stop,” according to a report he submitted afterward and which was included in the court filing.",
            "Arthur said Nazario explained at the time that he wasn’t trying to elude the officer, but was trying to stop in a well-lit area “for officer safety and out of respect for the officers.”",
            "Another officer, Joe Gutierrez, was driving by when he heard Crocker’s call, saw him attempting to stop the SUV and decided to join the traffic stop. Gutierrez acknowledged that Nazario’s decision to drive to a lighted area happens to him “a lot, and 80% of the time, it’s a minority,” Arthur said, quoting the officer.",
            "The lawsuit says by the time the two officers reached Nazario’s SUV, the license plate was visible in the rear.",
            "Nazario drove his SUV to a well-lit gas station where, according to the lawsuit, the two officers got out and immediately drew their guns and pointed them at Nazario after they got out of their cars. The officers then attempted to pull Nazario out of the vehicle while he continued to keep his hands in the air. Gutierrez then stepped back and pepper-sprayed Nazario multiple times as officers yelled for him to get out of the car.",
            "“I don’t even want to reach for my seatbelt, can you please? ... My hands are out, can you please — look, this is really messed up,” Nazario stammered upon being pepper-sprayed, his eyes clenched shut.",
            "The officers shouted conflicting orders at Nazario, telling him to put his hands out the window while also telling him to open the door and get out, the lawsuit says. At one point, Gutierrez told Nazario he was “fixin’ to ride the lightning,” a reference to the electric chair which was also a line from the movie “The Green Mile,” a film about a Black man facing execution.",
            "Nazario got out of the vehicle and again asked for a supervisor. Gutierrez responded with “knee-strikes” to his legs, knocking him to the ground, the lawsuit says. The two officers struck him multiple times, then handcuffed and interrogated him.",
            "The traffic stop was captured on Nazario’s cellphone video, and the body-worn cameras worn by Crocker and Gutierrez, according to the lawsuit.",
            "“These cameras captured footage of behavior consistent with a disgusting nationwide trend of law enforcement officers, who, believing they can operate with complete impunity, engage in unprofessional, discourteous, racially biased, dangerous and sometimes deadly abuses of authority ...” the lawsuit says.\n\nThe AP reached out to Windsor police for comment, but an email was not returned and their voice mailbox was full. No one answered the phone at a number listed for Crocker on Friday.\n\nCrocker and Gutierrez still work for the department, the town manager told The Virginian-Pilot of Norfolk. Windsor is about 70 miles (112 kilometers) southeast of Richmond."

            "RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Democratic Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam announced Thursday that he is backing Terry McAuliffe in the race to succeed him, handing his predecessor one of the contest’s most coveted endorsements.",
            "Northam, who under Virginia law cannot seek a consecutive term in office, said McAuliffe’s accomplishments during his previous term in the governor’s mansion show he is the right person for the job.",
            "“Terry’s strong record of delivering for Virginians is exactly why we need him as our next governor,” Northam said in a statement shared with The Associated Press ahead of the formal announcement. “We will need bold leadership ready to build a more equitable post-COVID economy that creates jobs, invests in workers, ensures equitable access to quality affordable health care, and rebuilds Virginia’s thriving network of small businesses.”",
            "McAuliffe, the presumptive front-runner in the June 8 Democratic primary, has been methodically locking up and rolling out an unmatched number of endorsements and said he was honored to have Northam’s.",
            "Northam’s senior political adviser, Mark Bergman, said that in making his decision, the governor met with all the Democratic candidates except Lee Carter, the only socialist in the House of Delegates, who did not seek his endorsement.",
            "Bergman said that for Northam, it was a decision between McAuliffe and the two women in the race, former Del. Jennifer Carroll Foy and state Sen. Jennifer McClellan.",
            "Bergman said Northam sees this year’s election as an opportunity to make permanent the sweeping changes Democrats have implemented during his term.",
            "Virginia has undergone a swift transformation during Northam’s tenure, which coincided with a Democratic takeover of the state legislature. Northam has signed into law various pieces of legislation that have made Virginia an outlier in the South, including Medicaid expansion, sweeping criminal justice reforms, LGBTQ protections, a minimum wage increase and stricter gun laws.",
            "“He feels like Gov. McAuliffe provides the party the best opportunity to cement the change in Virginia and win in November,” Bergman said.",
            "McAuliffe, a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee and top party fundraiser with national name recognition, has promised that increased education spending would be his top priority if elected. He’s also pledged to work to significantly accelerate Virginia’s minimum wage increase to $15 by 2024 and said during a debate Tuesday night that he would push to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.",
            "Among McAuliffe’s other endorsements: Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, U.S. Rep. Elaine Luria, 34 members of the General Assembly and 11 members of the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus.",
            "Northam’s decision will likely be a disappointment for supporters of Carroll Foy and McClellan, who are running what could be history-making bids. Either would be Virginia’s first female governor and the nation’s first Black female governor.",
            "Also in the race is Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax, who is facing two unresolved allegations of sexual assault that are widely seen as an impossibility to overcome. Fairfax strenuously denies the allegations and has said he thinks voters will see through what he considers a smear campaign against him.",
            "Republicans have opted to whittle down their seven-candidate field at a convention on May 8 that is going to be held at sites across the state."

        "articleContent": [
            "The Biden administration avoided one of the more challenging early tests of its climate agenda Saturday, when two South Korean battery giants feuding over trade secrets reached a settlement to keep a massive Georgia factory complex open, according to sources familiar with the negotiations.",
            "The White House faced a Sunday deadline to decide whether to veto a U.S. International Trade Commission decision from February that barred SK Innovation from importing the materials needed to build electric vehicle batteries at a $2.6 billion pair of plants in Commerce, Georgia.",
            "The case illustrates the new administration’s dueling priorities as it seeks to jumpstart efforts to eliminate the U.S. economy’s planet-heating pollution while going head-to-head with China over intellectual property protections.",
            "As late as Friday night, the company looked far from a deal with Seoul-based rival LG Energy Solutions, which convinced the federal trade court that SK Innovation destroyed evidence of stolen trade secrets. In February, the ITC imposed a 10-year import ban on SK Innovation, jeopardizing the supply of batteries for Ford’s electric F-150 pickup and Volkswagen’s Crossover series and threatening the 2,600 jobs the company planned to fill in Georgia over the next few years.",
            "The ruling also risked delaying President Joe Biden’s plans to electrify the nation’s 276 million some-odd automobiles, the top U.S. source of climate pollution.",
            "The $1.8 billion cash deal will also end other ongoing lawsuits between the two companies in the U.S. and South Korea, including one in a federal court in Delaware that had been on pause until the ITC saga reached its completion.",
            "“We have decided to settle and to compete in an amicable way, all for the future of the U.S. and South Korean electric vehicle battery industries,” SK Innovation CEO Jun Kim and LG Energy Solution CEO Jong Hyun Kim said in a joint statement Sunday morning. “In particular, we will work together to strengthen an EV battery domestic supply chain and support the U.S. Biden Administration’s effort to advance green energy policies and environmental responsibility.”",
            "SK Innovation’s plant will comprise upward of 35% of the U.S. production capacity of electric vehicle batteries by the end of Biden’s first term, when the country is expected to have roughly 11 big powerpack-making factories online.",
            "That would likely force automakers to rely more on batteries made in China, which, by contrast, is building some 100 battery plants.",
            "The settlement, the details of which were starting to be disclosed Sunday morning, will likely help reverse the ruling and allow SK Innovation to keep its plant open.",
            "The agreement is a political win. Leaders across the partisan spectrum pressed for an outcome that would allow the plant to remain open. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) pleaded with Biden to veto the decision if a settlement wasn’t reached. In recent weeks, Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.) held at least one meeting seeking to broker a deal.",
            "But ultimately the looming deadline and high stakes of a decision that should define the future of a U.S. set for near exponential growth in the next decade led to an eleventh-hour agreement.",
            "Losing the factory without a deal or veto would have sent a chill through the U.S. battery market as it looks to start attracting more players, said Caspar Rawles, an analyst at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, a London-based research firm that specializes in lithium-ion batteries and electric vehicle supply chains.",
            "“The message that you’re sending to those companies by essentially shutting down a plant in the U.S. due to legal reasons does not send a good message,” he said before the deal was announced. “It’s not the most inviting investment environment for someone looking to spend several billion dollars, and then there’s a risk something happens and there’s a legal intervention and they lose it all.”",
            "A presidential veto would have been a rare move. The last time the power was used was in 2013, when President Barack Obama blocked an ITC ruling that would have prevented Apple from importing some iPads. Ronald Reagan set the record, vetoing four ITC decisions, including one that coincidentally dealt with batteries."

        "articleContent": [
            "There’s no shortage of information about the mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic ― from the increasing rates and intensity of depression and anxiety to the effects on child development.",
            "Many experts have referred to the pandemic as an example of “collective trauma.” But what exactly does that categorization mean for us as individuals and our global society as a whole?",
            "Below, mental health professionals break down the meaning and impact of collective trauma, as well as how it compares to individual trauma and how we can cope with the experience.",
            "What is collective trauma?",
            "“Individual trauma is a traumatic event that happens to a person, whereas collective trauma happens to not just a small group of people but society,” said Dan Reidenberg, a mental health expert and executive director of Suicide Awareness Voices of Education. “Collective trauma changes history and memory for many. It changes the way we process and see not only the trauma that was experienced, but what we do with our memory of it as we move forward.”",
            "Rachel Thomasian, a licensed therapist and owner of Playa Vista Counseling in Los Angeles, described the latter as a “distressing, fear-inducing experience that is felt collectively.” She listed war, genocide, natural disasters and other large-scale catastrophes as examples of collective trauma.",
            "The coronavirus pandemic is a clear example of collective trauma on a global scale, a shared experience of loss and serious emotional disturbance that has touched every citizen of the world in some way. The historic event has changed the way people think and approach everyday life, and it carries other consequences that will continue well into the future.",
            "What is the impact of collective trauma?",
            "“Collective traumas are significant because they become transformative for a society,” Thomasian told HuffPost. “Some cultures define themselves heavily by a collective trauma and how they healed. Additionally, people change the way they live or create systems as a result of these events.”",
            "She pointed to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks as an example of collective trauma for many Americans, leading to intense fear and grief over a long period of time and changes to the way we travel that remain in place to this day. The attacks created wide-reaching cultural and political shifts, in addition to mental health struggles such as post-traumatic stress disorder.",
            "With the pandemic, people have lost the experience of physical touch, a valuable form of comfort and a coping mechanism in difficult times. It may lead to a long-term impact on our attitudes toward touching. Many people have also developed a heightened awareness around their physical bodies and health anxiety. The chronic uncertainty and exposure to death on such a massive scale are also hugely consequential.",
            "Although collective trauma can affect large communities of people, the extent and circumstances may vary. The pandemic has made this very clear by highlighting the many inequities in the United States.",
            "“While a whole group may be exposed to a collective trauma, not everyone is impacted the same,” said Marianela Dornhecker, a licensed psychologist practicing in Missouri and Texas. “Those that are on the frontlines, have directly experienced loss, have had significant financial impacts, already have histories of trauma, or come from backgrounds with significant stress and hardship (i.e. folks from marginalized or financially disadvantaged backgrounds) are more likely to be impacted by the collective trauma.”",
            "Dornhecker added that the past year has been an especially difficult time given many other experiences of trauma beyond the pandemic, such as highly publicized incidents of police brutality, racial violence and the U.S. Capitol insurrection in January.",
            "“Again, marginalized folks are more likely to experience hardship from the consequences of these events,” she said. “I think it is especially important to take the time to validate and recognize these experiences of pain, both as individuals and as a culture, to allow for healing.”",
            "How does it compare to individual trauma?",
            "“When we talk about trauma, typically we are describing an acutely distressing event that happens to one person or a few people,” Thomasian said. “Examples of this can be a severe car accident that one or two people are in or a bank robbery that is experienced by a few people.”",
            "On the other hand, collective trauma is an incident that an entire group of people experiences together. Moving forward after collective trauma can bring additional challenges.",
            "“This kind of trauma is often worsened by a lot of exposure to media coverage around said event,” said Meg Gitlin, a psychotherapist in New York who manages the therapy insight Instagram account City Therapist.",
            "When you’re facing a personal loss or hardship, it may be helpful to seek distractions such as a social event or time with loved ones unrelated to the situation. Such distractions are harder to come by during the pandemic with the 24/7 news coverage, restrictions on gatherings and the fact that it tends to come up in almost every conversation. The latter may sometimes be helpful, however.",
            "“There is a benefit of feeling understood and validated when we experience an event with others, compared to the isolation that can come from experiencing an individual trauma,” Thomasian said. “It really does help us cope to compare ‘war stories.’ It creates a sense of unity and makes us not only feel less isolated and alone, but it also helps us understand how universal our experience and our psychological reaction is.”",
            "Still, the shared experience can also have a negative impact on people’s mental health.",
            "“One way collective trauma differs from individual trauma is that while people tend to feel less ‘alone’ in the experience of collective trauma, they also tend to minimize the impact it has had on them by way of comparing themselves to those who have it ‘worse off,’” Gitlin told HuffPost. “I’ve seen, for example, people in my practice who struggle to fully process and acknowledge the trauma of the past year because they haven’t lost anyone personally to COVID or still have a job. There’s a lot of qualifying going on that sounds like, ‘This has been a hard year, but at least I haven’t had XYZ happen.’”",
            "Gitlin added that this approach is often protective because it allows people to distance themselves from the trauma and maintain the sense that they’re doing OK.",
            "“For others, it may be a cultural push to remain strong and ‘look on the bright side’ by practicing gratitude,” she said. “This can ultimately be detrimental because it prevents them from actually dealing with the impact of the trauma by accessing support or acknowledging their losses.”",
            "How can we cope with collective trauma?",
            "Many mental health resources are available that can help you get through trauma, collective or otherwise. These include professional therapy and support groups.",
            "“Don’t forget that just because everyone else is also experiencing loss doesn’t mean you don’t get to ask for the help you need,” said Sue Varma, a New York-based psychiatrist. She emphasized acknowledging that you are entitled to your own trauma and personal need to grieve. Pay attention to your feelings and explore them with a professional, if needed.",
            "Varma also recommended venting to loved ones or planning group tributes to memorialize the experience. People can come together to share their stories, bring flowers or engage in other rituals to process what has happened. Finding community and coping collectively is often helpful.",
            "“Talk, have memorials and gatherings when it becomes safe to do so, put something outdoors on the calendar,” she said. “Plan those hugs, those celebrations, commemorations, even if they are modified pandemic versions or have to get rescheduled. Give yourself something to look forward to.”",
            "Reidenberg, the executive director of Suicide Awareness Voices of Education, suggested helping others as part of your coping process.",
            "“For example, someone might go shopping for people less fortunate or the elderly who are less able to get out of their homes. Others might offer to take a group of kids to a park for other parents so they can have some time to relax,” he said.",
            "“Meaning-making after a traumatic event is another way to heal from the experience,” Dornhecker added. “This can be done at the individual or societal level by creating purpose after an event or enacting policies that lead to positive changes and greater equity for the society.”",
            "Limiting your media consumption is also helpful, experts said. Unplug and turn to your preferred coping mechanisms, whether it’s cooking, listening to music or going on long walks. The trauma may be collective in nature, but there’s no one-size-fits-all approach for healing."

            "VanLuven, hired by homebuyers to inspect a home in Oxford Township on March 12, was allowed into the house with the buyers’ real estate agent by the owners, who left while the inspection was underway.",
            "While she was out, one of the owners received a webcam alert on her phone that movement had been detected in the nursery. That’s when she saw VanLuven masturbating, according to The Smoking Gun.",

            "The homeowners then called 911, and officers showed up while VanLuven was still doing the inspection.",
            "At first, VanLuven told officers he touched the doll only to inspect an electrical outlet, authorities said. When he was confronted about the camera, he apologized and made incriminating statements, the sheriff told reporters.",

The actions of these homeowners will likely prevent this defendant from going into anyone else’s home.”",
            "If convicted, VanLuven faces up to two years in prison and $2,500 in fines. He was ordered to undergo a mental health evaluation and was prohibited from being alone in any residential property that he does not own as he awaits trial. He also was ordered to have no contact with the Oxford Township homeowners."

            "Millions of American parents are now either partially or fully vaccinated against COVID-19. But for millions of kids, that prospect is still a long way off.",
            "While many teenagers ages 16 and older are now able to get vaccinated — and new data from Pfizer suggests its vaccine is safe and highly effective in children as young as 12 — we’re likely months away from large swaths of kiddos rolling up their sleeves.",
            "“It’s more likely that the majority of children won’t be vaccinated until the end of this year, or the beginning of next year,” said Steven Abelowitz, a pediatrician with Coastal Kids Pediatrics in Orange County, California. He emphasized, though, that even best guesses are “all speculation” at this point.",
            "That means parents are in for a strange stretch of months when they suddenly have a whole lot more protection, but their kids don’t. Here are some basics to keep in mind as you navigate that new (new new?) normal.",
            "First, know that for kids, nothing has really changed.",
            "It might feel pretty different to be vaccinated yourself, but remember that COVID-19 precautions for kids and other unvaccinated people have not changed over the past few months, Abelowitz said.",
            "Kids should still be protecting themselves by wearing face masks, avoiding crowds and poorly ventilated indoor spaces, and washing their hands — basically everything we’ve been hearing, and hopefully doing, for the past year. One slight change: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now says 3 feet of physical distance is sufficient to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus in schools.",
            "But spending time indoors with vaccinated family members is now safe.",
            "One area where there has been some change is federal recommendations around how children are able to interact with fully vaccinated people outside their households.",
            "People who’ve been fully vaccinated can now spend time indoors — and unmasked — with those who haven’t, so long as the unvaccinated individuals (in this case, kids) aren’t at high risk for serious COVID-19 complications, according to the CDC.",
            "That means if your child has a beloved adult in their life who is fully vaccinated, they can go ahead and hang out together indoors without you needing to worry that they’ll contract the virus. (Of course, no one can say there’s no risk, but the risk is low, especially now that the CDC says there’s ample evidence that fully vaccinated people aren’t likely to transmit the virus.)",
            "All of this is probably very welcome news to a lot of grandparents, aunts and uncles and babysitters — and the kids who love them.",
            "Their *mathematical* risk of catching COVID-19 is lower.",
            "To be clear: You being vaccinated does not directly affect your child’s own risk of getting COVID-19 — unless you happen to be breastfeeding, in which case there is mounting evidence that parents who are breastfeeding do, in fact, pass along antibodies.",
            "So if, say, your kids are exposed to COVID-19 at school or someone who is infected coughs on your children during a flight to a family vacation, your vaccination status does nothing to keep them healthy.",
            "That said, when parents or caregivers are vaccinated, it does — in a more roundabout way — influence children’s level of risk.",
            "“What we’ve learned through the vast majority of epidemiological studies is that children were getting infected by their household contacts,” said David Cennimo, a pediatric infectious disease expert at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School. “So if parents are vaccinated, it’s highly unlikely that they’re going to bring COVID home.”",
            "“On a total math equation of ‘how protected are they?’” he continued, “they are much more protected now that you have the vaccine.”",
            "We’re not, however, anywhere near the point where herd immunity would offer them more direct protection.",
            "Want to cut your kid’s risk? Ask about vaccination status.",
            "Planning play dates? Thinking about family trips? Considering camp or extracurriculars? The same basics that have guided risk-benefit analyses so far during the pandemic still apply. Outdoor settings are less risky than indoor settings. Bigger spaces are better than smaller spaces. Being in a small group (or no group at all) is safer than being in a large one.",
            "But one thing has changed: Now you should definitely be asking people about their vaccination status, which can be a tricky conversation to have.",
            "“If I had a child and they were going over for a play date, I’d want to know: Are the adults in that household vaccinated?” Cennimo said. “Because if they are, the likelihood that there is COVID in that household is so much lower.”",
            "Know that if this — any of this — feels difficult to sort through, you’re not alone. There are no easy answers, and parents will continue to have to make decisions that feel right to them.",
            "Parents should also feel empowered to weigh the potential benefits of letting their kids reconnect with friends or simply have fun, Cennimo said. All of these are considerations to keep in mind.",
            "“People need to think about their comfort levels and, within the guidance provided, really titrate their activity to their comfort levels,” he said."

            "Mistake #1: reboiling the water",
            "We’ve all been there: in desperate need of a quick tea fix you’ve picked up the kettle, realised there’s water in it and flicked the switch on. But this is incredibly bad news for the taste of your tea.",
            "Always use freshly drawn (filtered if possible) cold water in the kettle, suggest the experts at Twinings. The reason being: oxygen helps the flavour develop. And if you reboil the water, it loses all of its oxygen and you’ll be left with “a really flat cup of tea”.",
            "Mistake #2: putting the milk in last",
            "As controversial as it sounds, putting the milk in first is key to getting a banging brew if you live in a hard water area, according to an academic no less.",
            "As Professor Alan Mackie, from Leeds University, told The Sun, the flavour of your brew is produced by the different compounds in tea, which include tannins.",
            "“Making tea the traditional way – steeping a bag in hot water before removing it and adding milk – results in the tannins turning into solids before they can develop the flavour properly,” said Prof Mackie, according to Heart.",
            "Add the milk at the start of the process however and the proteins can bind to the tannins and other minerals in the water. This prevents them from turning solid, which in turn gives you tastier tea. Hoorah!",
            "Mistake #3: pouring boiling water over your teabag",
            "Another no-go. The Twinings tea types recommend giving your kettle a couple of minutes to cool down after it’s boiled rather than rushing to fill your cup like the eager beaver you are.",
            "They suggest you should never pour boiling water over a tea bag or loose tea because the boiling water will “burn” the tea, meaning it doesn’t release its flavour potential.",
            "Mistake #4: using the wrong type of teaspoon",
            "Yep, the very material your teaspoon is made from could well be influencing the taste of your cuppa. Materials expert Zoe Laughlin tells HuffPost UK: “The less reactive the metal, the better. This means your common stainless steel does a great job and is far better than a silver spoon, which can impart a metallic taste to food, but gold is the ultimate taste sensation as it is truly inert and won’t alter the taste of the tea in any way.”",

            "His second accuser, Meredith Watson, said he assaulted her when they were college classmates at Duke University in 2000.",
            "Fairfax is correct that all four of his Democratic opponents ― McAuliffe, state Sen. Jennifer McClellan, Del. Lee Carter and then-Del. Jennifer Carroll Foy ― called for Fairfax’s resignation shortly after Watson came forward with her accusation.",
            "McAuliffe indeed appears to have been the first to do so, though the others followed soon thereafter. Notably, McClellan and Carroll Foy were both members of the Virginia Black Legislative Caucus, which joined calls for Fairfax’s resignation mere hours after McAuliffe.",
            "But Fairfax chose to direct his strongest words at McAuliffe, who is white. McAuliffe has faced criticism from some Black Virginians for his handling of policing issues during his tenure, as well as his decision to seek a second term as governor well after Fairfax, McClellan and Carroll Foy, all of whom are Black, had entered the race. (Carter, a white democratic socialist, is widely viewed as a long-shot candidate.)",
            "Many critics immediately blasted Fairfax for the comparison, noting that, among other things, Floyd and Till were both killed ― a far cry from the damage to his reputation.",
            "But Fairfax sought to paint them as part of the same pattern of anti-Black discrimination.",
            "“The murder of George Floyd was horrific,” he said. “But it recalls a history in Virginia and in our nation where African Americans ― and particularly African American men ― are presumed to be guilty, are treated inhumanely, are given no due process and have their lives impacted ― in some cases, taken away in an instant.”",
            "Fairfax, who maintains that he had consensual sex with the two women, has been aggressive in his denials of wrongdoing from the start. He immediately called for the FBI to investigate the claims, implying that he had nothing to hide and wanted “due process” before the law. A few months later, he took a polygraph test that his office said he passed.",
            "Fairfax went on to sue CBS for $400 million for televising interviews with his accusers that he argued were libelous. A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit in February, and nothing appears to have come of Fairfax’s calls for an FBI probe.",
            "Fairfax alleged on Tuesday night that The Washington Post had dismissed the charges as “false” and questioned “whether there was a rush to judgment.”",
            "Fairfax’s campaign said he was referring to a July 2020 editorial in which the Post expressed some sympathy for Fairfax’s calls for a fairer hearing, even as it criticized his “intemperate” response to the allegations. Fairfax claimed that there was a witness to the alleged sexual encounter with Watson at Duke, but the Post noted that Watson’s attorney refused to answer the newspaper’s questions about the witness.",
            "“Shouldn’t authorities in North Carolina, where there is no statute of limitations on rape, look into this matter, particularly because Ms. Watson claims to have been victim of a separate rape one year earlier at Duke by a prominent basketball player?” the Post asked.",
            "Fairfax had, to this point, largely been written off by Virginia politics watchers as a serious contender.",
            "But if name recognition is half the battle, Fairfax did his part with a debate-stealing moment that outshined any other exchange in the otherwise genteel forum.",
            "Fairfax’s persistence has won him the support of a core contingent of Black Virginians resentful of what they see as the railroading of the highest-ranking Black elected official in the state.",
            "“I believe in due process before the law,” said Tilly Blanding, a Fairfax County Democratic activist and former candidate for the House of Delegates, who is supporting Fairfax. “I really don’t feel that, especially as a Black man, he has been treated fairly.”",
            "Fairfax’s allies have been especially piqued by what they regard as the greater fairness with which allegations against other, mostly white elected officials have been met.",
            "For example, New York’s top-ranking Democrats called for New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) to resign in March, only after the governor had been accused of unwanted flirtations or touching by six women.",
            "And unlike Fairfax, who has never had an official inquiry into his claims, the charges against Cuomo are being investigated by attorneys hired by the New York attorney general.",
            "“Everyone else seems to get an investigation other than Justin Fairfax,” said Lauren Burke, a spokesperson for Fairfax’s campaign.",
            "But Cuomo’s predicament also suggests that Fairfax’s comparisons of himself to a figure like Emmett Till, a Black 14-year-old who was lynched and mutilated in 1954 for allegedly whistling at a white woman, might draw attention away from the underlying merits of Fairfax’s case.",
            "At least one white Cuomo ally likened the governor’s predicament to Till as well, though Cuomo himself has not. Some Democrats in the state Assembly reportedly made the comparison as well.",
            "The pushback has been swift and strong. New York Senate Democratic Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, the first woman and first Black woman to lead the legislative chamber, dismissed the analogy.",
            "Till “was lynched. He was an African American teenager visiting relatives in Mississippi. I see no comparison,” Stewart-Cousins said."

            "I’m never happier than when I’m at home on a leisurely weekend, keeping an eye on the stove while a big pot of homemade stock, soup or pasta sauce bubbles away for hours. And since a lot of those long-simmering recipes call for bay leaves, I’ve dutifully dropped one or two of the leaves into pots for years with the faith that I was infusing the liquid with some elusive-yet-magical essence.",
            "But when I sat down to eat, I often wondered: Do I actually taste the bay leaf, or am I just imagining that I do? Come to think of it, what do bay leaves even taste like? Are they worth the money? And when a recipe calls for a bay leaf, does that mean dried or fresh? Can they be used interchangeably?",
            "I realized that while I liked the ritual of dropping those leaves into simmering pots of comfort food and watching them dance on the surface, I wasn’t sure they were actually doing anything.",
            "On one hand, there are so many recipes and types of cuisines that call for this herb: Everyone from old-school Italian grandmas to fancy Michelin-starred chefs consider them essential to their broths, stews and sauces. On the other, not since cilantro have I ever heard an herb spark more controversy: It seemed like I was always hearing other home cooks complain that the brittle, dry leaves were totally worthless and devoid of flavor. Some wonder whether, at $4 or $5 for a small handful of leaves, they’re a total scam. But they also keep using them — either out of habit, or just to hedge their bets.",
            "Since I had a lot of questions and zero answers, I did a little research. Then I turned to the pros to see if they could convince me that bay leaves really do add flavor to food.",
            "What are bay leaves, anyway?",
            "There are a few reasons cooking with bay leaves can be legitimately confusing for home cooks. The first thing to know is that there are two types of bay leaves commonly available in the U.S.: Turkish (also known as Mediterranean) and California. They come from two different plants, and are each named for the parts of the world where they originated.",
            "While it’s possible to find both types for sale in dried and fresh forms, the vast majority of what you’ll come across is the Turkish variety. That’s what you’re likely to find dried in the spice aisles of supermarkets across America. You may spot them fresh in the produce sections of high-end grocers too. The leaves come from the bay laurel tree or shrub (Laurus nobilis), which predates the ancient Greeks and Romans.",
            "Gourmet markets and spice shops may also sell the dried California variety (Umbellularia californica, which was used medicinally by Native Americans) as a second option, but they should be clearly labeled as such. In many parts of California, the plant is ubiquitous: Fresh leaves pop up at farmers markets (both for culinary use and woven into fresh herb wreaths), and hardcore home cooks who don’t have them in their own backyards forage them in the wild. (If you’ve hiked around San Francisco, you’ve probably noticed their distinctive, pleasantly medicinal aroma perfuming the trails.)",
            "So what’s the difference? Turkish bay leaves are shorter and more rounded, and often have wavy edges. Their aroma and flavor is subtle, with a pleasantly minty taste and notes of warm baking spice. The California variety is typically long and thin, is pungently aromatic, and has an assertive, almost eucalyptus-y flavor. Because their flavor and aroma is so assertive, they can easily overpower food. California bay leaves may be better-suited to chefs, serious home cooks and herb nerds, rather than the home cook who’s just looking to build out a versatile spice cabinet.",
            "How are bay leaves used?",
            "Herb expert Cal Orey, who dedicated an entire chapter to the culinary herb in her book, “The Healing Powers of Herbs and Spices,” explains: “When a recipe calls for a bay leaf, I think it’s safe to assume that they mean the dried Turkish type. They’re what’s available in grocery stores and are the most commonly used, so unless a recipe specifically calls for something else, go with those.”",
            "As for whether the different types of leaves can be used interchangeably, Orey pointed out another potentially confusing aspect of cooking with this herb. While the general rule with most herbs is that the dried versions are roughly double the potency of fresh, the opposite is actually true with bay leaves. The fresh ones are much stronger than dried, so they should be used more sparingly — especially the more assertive California variety. The general guideline is that if you want to swap in fresh leaves for dried, reduce the amount by half.",
            "But no matter which type you’re using, cook with the whole leaves, and then discard them before serving. Yes, you can also buy ground bay leaves, but they’re rarely called for in recipes. Slowly coaxing the flavor out of whole leaves and then tossing them is definitely the way to go.",
            "An argument for dried bay leaves",
            "Orey, who is from California, has always been an advocate of cooking with bay leaves. She’s loved them ever since she was a child, when she remembers the distinctive minty-spicy-savory aroma of the herb scenting the air of her childhood kitchens. Given where she lives, she’s always had year-round access to both varieties of bay leaves, in fresh and dried forms. But because of what she calls the “paradox” of the herb — that the flavor of the fresh leaves is so much stronger than the dried — her go-to is always the dried Turkish variety. While some people may complain that the flavor of the dehydrated leaves is subtle, for her, that’s a good thing. She argues that the flavor of the fresh leaves is too potent for most recipes. But the delicate, nuanced taste of the dried type adds just the right level of herbaceousness to flavor dishes in a balanced way, while still allowing the other ingredients to come through.",
            "Orey uses the dried herbs in soups and stews, in saucy main dishes like chicken cacciatore, and even to add a warm savory note to desserts like rice pudding. She also finds their flavor the perfect match for fish and shellfish.",
            "She also prefers dried bay leaves for their accessibility and convenience. “Most people across the country don’t have access to the fresh leaves, which is one reason why the majority of recipes are written for the dried variety,” she said. “Not only are the dried leaves easier to find in grocery stores, but people who think they’re pricey should know that their shelf life is actually quite long. They last for a couple years. So it’s definitely worth the money to use the dried version — I’m never without a jar of them in my pantry.”",
            "An argument for fresh bay leaves",
            "James Beard Award-winning chef Gabrielle Quiñónez Denton has also long-used the dried herb in her cooking. She and her husband and co-chef, Greg Denton, own two acclaimed restaurants in Portland, Oregon: the classic French Bistro Agnes, and Ox, which takes its inspiration from Argentinian wood-fired cooking. The Dentons use dried bay leaves at both restaurants ― in a Madeira reduction that’s served with chicken liver mousse, and also in coq au vin, boeuf bourguignon, bean ragoûts and salmon gravlax.",
            "But it wasn’t until a few years ago, when the chef planted a 2-foot-tall Mediterranean bay laurel in her backyard, that she really fell in love with using fresh bay leaves, which she says have a much brighter flavor than the dehydrated type. “In their dried form, Greg and I feel that bay leaves serve as more of a back note in most of our recipes, to the point where — if they were omitted — most people wouldn’t notice that something was missing,” she explained. “I’ve never been too excited by their presence. So if we really want the flavor to play a more vibrant role in a dish, then we will use fresh bay.”",
            "At home, she grabs some leaves from her plant to infuse in béchamel and velouté sauces, which serve as the base for mac and cheese or as the filling for pot pies. “But my absolute favorite is in a simple dish that my grandmother used to make for our family in the Andean highlands of Quito, Ecuador: a boiled artichoke with a side of warm, bay-flavored béchamel sauce for dipping — spiked with a swirl of homemade ají,” she said.",
            "During the chef’s off-hours at home, she also makes an herbal tea by simmering fresh bay leaves with a cinnamon stick (finished with a splash of oat milk and a little honey), and a traditional Cape Verdean rice-and-beans dish called jagacida she learned back in college from her roommate’s dad. For those dishes and dozens of others, she said, “It’s absolutely worth seeking out the fresh leaves for the vibrant flavor they add to a dish.”",
            "Shopping for and storing bay leaves",
            "Fresh leaves should be a fragrant, vibrant green, free of blemishes and cracks, and should be flexible enough to bend or fold without breaking. Store them in the fridge to prolong their usability, and toss them when they start to lose their color or become brittle. (Of course if you ever find yourself with an excess of the fresh variety, you can always set the leaves out to dry while they’re still good so you can avoid buying more when you need them.)",
            "Those little jars from the supermarket should last for a couple of years. So why is the biggest complaint about dried bay leaves that they don’t add any flavor to food? Probably because a lot of people don’t realize how many ways they can use them, so they let them languish for years and years in the back of their spice cabinets. Or, they’re storing them in a hot spot in their kitchens, which will rapidly diminish their flavor. Orey says you can check the expiration date to avoid past-their-prime leaves, but the more foolproof way is just to use your nose. If you don’t smell that complex aroma hit you when you open the jar, it’s time to toss it.",
            "The takeaways",
            "After talking to Orey and Denton, I came away from my bay leaf deep dive a true believer that the herb does indeed add nuanced flavor to countless dishes (as long as the dried leaves haven’t lost their essential oils while forgotten in the back of the spice cabinet). As Orey recommends, I’ll assume that when a recipe calls for bay, it means dried (and if all I have is fresh, I’ll use half the amount). On Denton’s advice, I’ll reach for dried leaves when I want more of a subtle background of bay and for fresh leaves in dishes where I want their more assertive flavor to take center stage. I also planted a small bay laurel in my own herb garden, so I’ll always have both the dried type in my pantry and fresh just outside my kitchen door."

            "“I think there is pent up demand for international travel,” Mike Kennedy, co-founder of the travel marketplace Koala, told HuffPost. “Caribbean and Mexico in particular, will likely see a huge uptick in tourism from Americans. It reconciles that sense of wanderlust we’re all feeling without taking too much risk. Flights that aren’t much longer (or in some cases shorter) than domestic flights.”",
            "In January, Koala released a future travel trends report based on Google data, which found that Puerto Rico and Mexico were the top two destinations outside the 50 states generating travel search interest. Others in the top 10 included Jamaica, Aruba, Costa Rica and the Bahamas ― indicating an interest in beach vacations that aren’t too far from home.",
            "The beach craze is consistent with trends we’re already seeing this year among those who opted to travel before the CDC’s announcement.",
            "The hotel price comparison site Trivago reported that the top five destinations on its platform for March 2021 were Las Vegas, Miami Beach, Orlando, Myrtle Beach and Cancun. Trending destinations for U.S. travelers in the “international” category also included Playa del Carmen, Mexico; Playa Bavaro, Dominican Republic; and San Juan, Puerto Rico (though Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory, many platforms consider places outside the 50 states to be international destinations).",
            "A Tripadvisor report from mid-March found that the 10 fastest-growing destinations for Americans are Isla Verde, Puerto Rico; St. Thomas; Playa Maroma, Mexico; Tulum, Mexico; Key West, Florida; Key Largo, Florida; Miami Beach; Christiansted, U.S. Virgin Islands; Cruz Bay, U.S. Virgin Islands; and Fort Myers Beach, Florida.",
            "Additionally, Squaremouth travel insurance revealed in March that most of the most popular international destinations for U.S. travelers using the platform are island countries and territories, with Turks and Caicos, the Dominican Republic, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Costa Rica and Mexico in the top five.",
            "As people start to plan their so-called “revenge travel” to make up for the trips canceled by the COVID-19 pandemic, it’s clear sunshine and relaxation are top of mind.",
            "“We believe travelers will either visit places they’re familiar with, as they’ll find comfort in that familiarity, or seek out new places where they can roam freely and safely,” said Carolyne Doyon, president and CEO of Club Med North America and the Caribbean.",
            "“At Club Med, we’re already seeing increased interest in bookings for our resorts in Florida, the Caribbean and Mexico, with more than 40% of bookings from guests who haven’t stayed with us before or guests who are staying with us for the first time in over three years, and anticipate as travelers continue to feel more comfortable with vaccine distribution more widespread, we’ll eventually see a burst in bookings all throughout the same time period,” she added.",
            "Going Beyond The Western Hemisphere",
            "Still, plenty of would-be travelers are daring to dream of destinations farther afield.",
            "The Maldives, Japan, Greece and Iceland were also on Koala’s top-10 list of trending future travel destinations. Its list of top city and region destinations also included Bora Bora, Paris, Dubai and Bali.",

            "But while these destinations may be on people’s minds, they don’t seem to be on their actual travel itineraries. Squaremouth reported in March that the share of travelers buying insurance for trips to Europe has dropped to 8% in 2021, compared to 25%-45% in pre-pandemic years.",
            "This is likely due to a combination of distance and the fact that most European countries still have travel restrictions for U.S. visitors, vaccine rollout has been slow, and increased COVID-19 cases and lockdowns abound. Still, a number of countries across the Atlantic are reportedly allowing (or planning to allow) vaccinated foreign travelers, including Iceland, Cyprus, Estonia and Poland.",
            "Just because you can go somewhere doesn’t necessarily mean you should, however. As the CDC has advised, domestic travel is the name of the game for now ― and only for those who are fully vaccinated.",
            "Even if you do fall into that group, it remains important to take the proper safety precautions wherever you travel. Wear a mask, wash your hands, keep your distance and stay home if you aren’t feeling well. Times like these call for collective responsibility."

            "Like most formal events this year, the 2021 Screen Actors Guild Awards lacked much of its usual flair. But in spite of the ceremony’s lack of a traditional red carpet, Jamie Chung found a way to make a topical statement with a well-placed, custom-designed accessory.",
            "The “Lovecraft Country” star was photographed outside a Brooklyn, New York, firehouse in a red Oscar de la Renta gown. She held a clutch by Edie Parker, who has also designed handbags for Kate Hudson and Emma Roberts, among other stars.",
            "Chung’s bag was emblazoned with the words “Stop Asian Hate” in gold lettering, alluding to the recent surge in discrimination and violence against Asian Americans in the U.S.",
            "“In some Asian cultures, the color red symbolizes joy, luck and happiness,” Chung wrote on Instagram. “In Korean culture it symbolizes creation, passion and power.”",
            "“I’m so proud of my history and heritage,” she added.",
            "The sentiment recalled Laverne Cox’s 2019 Emmy Awards look. At the time, the “Orange Is the New Black” star carried an Edie Parker bag bearing the date on which the Supreme Court would begin hearing arguments over whether LGBTQ workers should be protected under federal anti-discrimination laws.",
            "Chung, whose credits include ABC’s “Once Upon a Time” and Fox’s “The Gifted,” said witnessing recent incidents of anti-Asian discrimination ― many of which are believed to have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic ― was “terribly frightening.”",
            "“It’s infuriating because discrimination is nothing new for Asian Americans,” she told People in an interview last month. “I think only now people are becoming aware of how bad it’s gotten and it’s disappointing that more media outlets aren’t sharing these stories. ... We can all do our part to help educate and advocate for each other. We can’t let up until we see real systemic change for all communities of color.”",
            "The 37-year-old is among of host of stars, including “Killing Eve” star Sandra Oh and “Saturday Night Live” cast member Bowen Yang, who have condemned the growing trend of discrimination. Last week, K-pop band BTS recalled their own experiences with racism in an emotional statement posted to social media."

            "He said the U.S. quickly corrected the mistake. “I thank the new American government for the efficiency with which it intervened,” he said.",
            "Another company, a Sardinian graphic design firm owned by a different Alessandro Bazzoni, also managed to get off the sanctions list after it was mistakenly added."

            "As Congress debates the passage of a sweeping reform bill targeting voting rights, campaign finance, redistricting and ethics, Democrats in the House and Senate have the name of a colleague who is no longer with them on their lips.",
            "Rep. John Lewis, who died last year, dedicated his life to expanding and protecting the right to vote. He was attacked for it. And he was elected, in part, to help preserve it. He ultimately helped write part of the bill that Democrats are now pushing to enact.",
            "“Let me close with this,” Rep. John Sarbanes (D-Md.), the lead sponsor of the For the People Act, said at the end of his House floor comments March 2 before the bill’s final passage, “John Lewis, who is not with us anymore, fought for voting rights. He knew the vote was sacred. He told us to keep our eyes on the prize. Today we do that.”",
            "Lewis, a civil rights leader and Georgia Democrat, died at the age of 80 from complications related to pancreatic cancer on July 17, 2020. As the head of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, he was the youngest speaker at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in 1963. In 1965, he led the march from Selma to Birmingham, Alabama, that left him with a broken skull after white police officers assaulted the marchers. Congress responded to the “Bloody Sunday” assault by passing the Voting Rights Act. As a congressman representing Atlanta for 34 years, he came to be known as the “conscience of Congress,” hosting members of both parties for annual pilgrimages to the bridge in Selma where, in his words, he “gave a little blood.”",
            "In his eulogy for the late congressman, former President Barack Obama called on politicians to “honor John” by not only passing the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to restore the Voting Rights Act of 1965 but also “to make it even better.” Obama called for Congress to pass legislation to expand voting rights by making voter registration automatic, adding polling locations to eliminate long lines to vote, restoring voting rights to ex-felons and making Election Day a national holiday.",
            "“We should keep marching,” Obama said.",
            "Democrats now have their chance to follow through on that promise.",
            "Title I of the For the People Act, which is under consideration in key Senate committees, is almost entirely from Lewis’s Voter Empowerment Act, a bill he introduced in every Congress beginning in 2012. The bill expands voting opportunities by mandating states provide for automatic voter registration, same-day and online voter registration, at least 15 days of early voting and no-excuse absentee voting. It also provides protections for disabled voters, money for updating election infrastructure, limits voter purges, requires states to open enough polling locations to reduce long lines and restores voting rights to ex-felons.",
            "Heavy Republican opposition and some Democrats’ commitment to preserving the filibuster stand in its way. But Democrats and activists hope that they will remember that a respected colleagues’ words and cause ― not to mention the countless Americans whose voting rights could be impeded without Congress’s intervention ― are at stake.",
            "“It’s absolutely the case that his legacy lives on here,” said Stephen Spaulding, senior counsel for public policy at Common Cause, a nonpartisan nonprofit backing the For the People Act.",
            "Voting Rights Under Attack",
            "Lewis isn’t here to see the latest massive wave of voter restriction bills introduced by Republican legislators sweeping through statehouses across the country, including in his home state of Georgia. But they surely would come as no surprise.",
            "In July 2011, he delivered a searing speech against the slew of voter suppression legislation at the time, spurred by false allegations of voter fraud after Obama won the 2008 presidential election.",
            "“Voting rights are under attack in America,” Lewis said. “There’s a deliberate and systematic attempt to prevent millions of elderly voters, students, minority and low-income voters from exercising their constitutional rights.”",
            "There were key similarities then to what’s happening now. As the 2008 election reached its end, Republican candidate John McCain claimed at the final presidential debate that Obama and the Democratic Party were “now on the verge of maybe perpetrating one of the greatest frauds in voter history in this country, maybe destroying the fabric of democracy.” The claim arose from conservative media, where the community organizing group ACORN was said to be stealing the election after reports revealed that many of its paid voter registration canvassers improperly filled out registration forms in order to meet quotas.",
            "A court acquitted ACORN (the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now) of all criminal charges related to voter fraud in early 2011, but it was too late to stop the spread of the voter fraud lie. Polls showed that over half of Republican voters believed that Obama stole the 2008 election with the help of ACORN. Republicans rode a midterm election wave in 2010 to power in states across the country and immediately went to work making it harder to vote. At least 19 states enacted new voter restriction laws in 2011.",
            "“Representative Lewis received those developments with alarm,” said Wendy Weiser, vice president of the Brennan Center for Justice, a bipartisan nonprofit that advocates for voting rights. “And obviously he had a lot of experience understanding where that was coming from, where that was going and what its dangers were. I think that he fittingly took up that charge again and said we’re not going back.”",
            "Lewis led the effort to write legislation to stop this new wave of voter restrictions at the state level. He did so under a broader reform umbrella initiated by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to direct leading lawmakers in the Democratic Party caucus to craft solutions to so-called democracy issues: voting rights, campaign finance reform and gerrymandering. Sarbanes, the lead sponsor of the For the People Act, was tasked with tackling campaign finance issues while Lewis took on voting rights.",
            "But Lewis wasn’t starting from scratch. The Voter Empowerment Act built off of the 2005 Count Every Vote Act, introduced by then-Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones (D-Ohio) and then-Sen. Hillary Clinton (D-N.Y.) in response to the panoply of problems that emerged in the 2004 election, which gave Republican George W. Bush a second term. Their bill contained many of the changes that Lewis would expand on, including mandating early voting, requiring paper ballot records, making Election Day a holiday, ending felon disenfranchisement and setting federal standards for the number of polling locations and voting machines available in each community.",
            "To begin, Lewis convened regular roundtable discussions involving voting rights and civil rights groups and other congressional offices to collect and debate all potential ideas to make voting easier and to reduce the threat of voter suppression tactics. Groups included the Brennan Center, Common Cause, the NAACP, the Legal Defense Fund, the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Education Fund, NALEO, The Advancement Project, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, Asians Advancing Justice, and organizations representing Native American and disabled communities.",
            "“I just remember it being a very iterative process by which they worked very closely with outside groups to craft the most robust bill,” Spaulding, who was involved in the roundtable discussions, said. “Mr. Lewis was very involved in the details, as was his staff.”",
            "The broad coalition of voting and civil rights groups around the table represented a recognition on Lewis’s part that the work of expanding voting rights in the 21st century went beyond the 20th century civil rights movement’s focus on Black communities in the South.",
            "“There was an understanding that this is a broad-based problem throughout the country,” said Nicole Austin-Hillery, who worked with Lewis’s office on the bill when she was head of the Brennan Center’s office in Washington, D.C. “It’s not a problem that’s just in the South. And it’s also no longer just a problem that impacts African Americans, even though I think data would show that it predominantly impacts African Americans.”",
            "The bill-writing process was not limited to discussions with Washington-based interest groups. Lewis, his staff and those groups spoke to voters in the states to learn about the real problems they had with how their states conducted elections.",
            "“It was a combination of not only identifying what the lawmakers thought the needs were, but, most importantly, it was about identifying what the voters’ stories were, what their experiences were and then trying to find solutions that met the needs of the voters,” Austin-Hillery, who is now executive director of the U.S. program for Human Rights Watch, said.",
            "With Republicans in control of the House, Lewis’s bill never made it out of committee.",
            "The ‘Jim Crow Relic’ That Could Stand In The Way",
            "Austin-Hillery went on her first pilgrimage with Lewis to Selma’s Edmund Pettus Bridge in March 2013, just weeks after the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments in the Shelby County v. Holder case on the constitutionality of the Voting Rights Act’s pre-clearance section. In those arguments, Justice Antonin Scalia called the landmark law passed in response to what transpired on that bridge a “perpetuation of racial entitlement.” The portentous arguments before a court with a majority of conservative justices appointed by Republican presidents for their opposition to voting rights laws hung heavy over the annual celebration of the fight for the franchise.",
            "“I asked [Lewis] to describe for me how he felt when he was on that bridge when he was a young man ― when they were attempting the march for the first time,” Austin-Hillery recalled.",
            "“He explained how there was the unknown,” she said. “That they didn’t know what was waiting for them ahead. But he shared that they knew that no matter what lies ahead they had to move forward. That they had to fight because there was nothing more important for a person in the United States than being able to exercise their right to vote. That was the way that each person had a voice.”",
            "Three months later, Chief Justice John Roberts handed down the unknown. In a 5-4 decision, Roberts struck down the Voting Rights Act’s pre-clearance formula and declared that racism in America was no more: “[T]he conditions that originally justified these measures no longer characterize voting in the covered jurisdictions.”",
            "States previously covered by the Voting Rights Act, those with a history of ballot-box discrimination, would now be able to enact potentially discriminatory laws without the pre-clearance that meant having to run them by the Department of Justice for approval first. This ruling is why, today, Republicans in Georgia can enact a law that reduces voting opportunities and makes it a misdemeanor to hand a voter waiting in line a cup of water without first undergoing a review to determine if the law will unfairly discriminate against protected groups.",
            "The decision also changed the voting rights agenda for Democrats in Congress. They now needed to write legislation to reauthorize the pre-clearance section of the Voting Rights Act in terms that the conservatives on the Supreme Court would abide. Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.) tapped Lewis and Reps. Terri Sewell (D-Ala.) and Bobby Scott (D-Va.) to develop a legislative fix for the court’s decision. That work would ultimately become the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.",
            "But restoring the pre-clearance section would still not go as far as Lewis’s Voter Empowerment Act did in preventing voter suppression measures from being enacted.",
            "“All of this was taken together,” Clyburn said about the combination of the Voting Rights Act reauthorization and the Voter Empowerment Act.",
            "But Lewis’s bill did not move through the Republican-controlled Congress. In each new Congress, he introduced a new version. And each new version contained updates based on the new pathways that Republican legislatures were finding to restrict voting access.",
            "“The approach that Representative Lewis took over the years was to just keep refreshing the bill to address the most important problems and to use the best available solutions based on the experience of what was actually working in the states,” Weiser said.",
            "After Trump won election in 2016, Pelosi designated Sarbanes as the head of a Democracy Reform Task Force to bring together all of the legislation she had asked her caucus to come up with back in 2011 into one bill. This included Lewis’s Voter Empowerment Act. That bill was introduced as the For the People Act in 2019 after Democrats won control of the House.",
            "House Democrats passed the For the People Act in 2019, but it was blocked by in the Senate by Republicans. The House passed it again on March 3. This time it will be considered by the Senate since Democrats won control of the chamber by the slimmest of majorities thanks in part to victories in both Georgia Senate races. Democrats are also introducing a standalone version of Lewis’s Voter Empowerment Act, now called the John R. Lewis Voter Empowerment Act, sponsored by Clyburn and Rep. Nikema Williams (D-Ga.) in the House and Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.).",
            "When Obama called on lawmakers to “honor John” in his eulogy for the late congressman, he asked that they pass the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act, now named for Lewis, and voting rights reforms that are contained in the very bill Lewis authored. And he had sharp words for the Senate in how it should go about enacting these laws.",
            "“[I]f all this takes eliminating the filibuster, another Jim Crow relic, in order to secure the God-given rights of every American, then that’s what we should do,” Obama said.",
            "The Senate is now barreling toward a showdown over the chamber’s filibuster rules as it considers the For the People Act. At the moment, the bill requires 60 votes to overcome a Republican-led filibuster. With Democrats controlling only 50 seats, it is unlikely to become law without changes to the filibuster rules.",
            "Senate Democrats will soon be faced with whether they will let Lewis’s last voting rights push be felled by a filibuster, as so many civil rights bills were before, or if they will heed Obama’s call."

            "Every year the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum gives out a Profile in Courage Award, named for JFK’s 1957 book spotlighting eight senators who took unpopular, politically difficult positions in the interest of the public good.",
            "This year’s winner is Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), the JFK Library announced late last month. The honor is for Romney’s promotion of democracy and the rule of law, at a time when both had been under assault from President Donald Trump and nearly all of his fellow Republicans.",
            "Usually the award ceremony takes place at the library, with a full audience and a member of the Kennedy family on hand to present it. This year’s event will be virtual because of the coronavirus pandemic. And that’s a shame.",
            "Standing on a stage in Boston with a member of the Kennedy family would have reprised one of the most important moments of Romney’s political career: the signing of a 2006 law that brought nearly universal health care to Massachusetts.",
            "Romney, who as governor had been the bill’s most prominent architect and advocate, was the star of the show. But at his side was Ted Kennedy, the longtime Democratic senator, a brother of JFK and an icon of American liberalism.",
            "Romney and Kennedy had worked together on the reforms, and, at the ceremony, Romney was happy to talk about their collaboration. He already harbored presidential ambitions and, back then, an elected official could make a name for himself in the Republican Party by demonstrating his ability to craft landmark legislation.",
            "But that was a very different era.",
            "An Unlikely Partnership, From A Different Era",
            "The alliance between Ted Kennedy and Romney was always improbable, at least to those who didn’t know either man. A decade earlier, Romney had challenged and nearly beaten Kennedy in a brutal Senate campaign. He’d then gone on to wage a successful campaign for Massachusetts governor.",
            "But Kennedy didn’t hold grudges. He also believed that the only way to pass ambitious liberal reforms was through compromise. One of his biggest regrets from public life was not pushing harder to broker a deal with then-President Richard Nixon, who in the early 1970s had proposed a conservative health plan that would have led to most Americans getting insurance.",
            "Although Romney’s scheme for achieving quasi-universal coverage wasn’t the one Kennedy would have chosen, he wasn’t about to pass up another opportunity. He helped Romney get special regulatory approval that the plan needed from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, then lobbied liberal allies in Massachusetts to get behind the initiative.",
            "At the signing ceremony, Kennedy joked about their partnership and predicted that the law would become a template for national reforms. He was right. The Massachusetts reform scheme was a model for the Affordable Care Act, which became law four years later.",
            "Inspiring “Obamacare” had not been Romney’s goal, of course, and there’s no evidence that helping the uninsured was even his motivation. But Romney was a problem solver, going back to his days as a consultant and then head of Bain Capital. And as a newly elected governor, he quickly discovered that the state’s biggest budget challenge was sustaining its high spending on health care.",
            "After devouring spreadsheets and PowerPoint decks, and quizzing policy experts who gave him long briefings, he settled on the quasi-universal coverage scheme because it seemed more efficient than subsidizing charity care at hospitals, as the state had traditionally done.",
            "Then he negotiated with Democrats, including not just Kennedy but also leaders in the state legislature, because it was the only way to pass legislation.",
            "The Republican Fringe, Then And Now",
            "In promoting the health care plan and ignoring political advisers who warned that some of its features might alienate anti-government conservatives, Romney was following in the footsteps of another Republican politician who had, in similar fashion, broken with more ideologically minded members of his party.",
            "That Republican was Romney’s father, George, the former governor of Michigan.",
            "As a rising star in the 1960s, George Romney had fought with members of his party who were lining up against civil rights and declaring war on the “welfare state.” In a famous 1964 GOP convention speech, he warned that these fringe elements were becoming too influential. Mitt, then just 17, watched the speech from the front row.",
            "George Romney lost that fight and, a half-century later, the heirs to that fringe movement have taken over the GOP, although these days it sometimes seems to be as much a cult of personality around Trump as it is a triumph of right-wing governing philosophy. The point is to get and to keep power, and if that requires flouting the rule of law or basic principles of democracy, Republicans generally do not seem troubled by it.",
            "But Mitt Romney does, and he has acted on that impulse repeatedly since becoming a senator from Utah in 2018. He voted to remove Trump twice, the first time for abuse of power during the Russia investigation and the second time for incitement of insurrection in an attempt to overturn the result of the 2020 presidential election. He also voted to certify the Electoral College results on Jan. 6, the pro forma action Congress was taking on the day of the insurrection.",
            "Those votes earned Romney grief from Trump and his supporters ― in one instance, captured on video and then spread virally over social media, while Romney was at the airport waiting for his flight in advance of the Jan. 6 certification.",
            "When a Trump supporter asked him if he was prepared to reject the election results because Democrats had supposedly stolen the election, the unfailingly civil Romney replied, “No, I’m not.”",
            "“We have a Constitution, and the constitutional process is clear, and I will follow the Constitution,” Romney said. “And then I will explain all that when we meet in Congress.”",
            "The Future For Romney And His Party",
            "It’s hard to figure out what place Romney has in the Republican Party going forward.",
            "Trump has left the White House, but his presence still hovers over the party. And although the Republican caucuses in Congress are smaller following the 2020 losses, they are also more extreme, both philosophically and temperamentally. Only a handful joined Romney in voting to remove Trump the second time, even though the trial came just weeks after rioters literally threatened their lives.",
            "Romney’s problem-solving attitude also feels anachronistic. Back in 2006, he imagined the Massachusetts health care law as a signature accomplishment on which he could base a future run for president. But when he became the GOP nominee in 2012, he had to distance himself from the plan because mere association with Obamacare had become such a political liability among Republicans.",
            "More recently, Romney has been among a small group of Republicans reaching out to the Biden administration over policy initiatives, including a “child allowance.” But most Republicans, including caucus leaders, are not engaging seriously on policy and focusing more energy on “cancel culture.”",
            "This is probably a pretty good glimpse into Romney’s political future and, rest assured, he will be just fine. He is a very wealthy man, and his Senate seat is probably safe, although right-wing activists in Utah have been known to punish principled conservatives who deviate from the party line.",
            "But the fact that Romney’s vote even demands recognition for courage says a lot about what the Republican Party has become. Many Republicans will speak privately about their distaste at Trump’s behavior and contempt for democracy, and will worry about what the party has become. They just won’t say so publicly.",
            "They are profiles in cowardice, and there’s no award for that ― just the harsh verdict of history."

            "Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.), the third-highest ranking member of Democratic Party leadership in the House, told HuffPost he’s “insulted” by the position Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) is taking on the party’s top legislative priority: a giant reform package that includes an expansion of voting rights across the country.",
            "Manchin, the only Democratic senator not to co-sponsor the For The People Act this year, very carefully backed parts of the bill in a statement issued on March 25. While he expressed some support for elements of the bill, he also said that he was primarily focused on finding “a bipartisan solution” to the issues the bill addresses, including voting rights.",
            "For Clyburn, Manchin’s statement prioritizes bipartisanship over the voting rights of Black Americans and other minority groups.",
            "“I’m insulted when he tells me that it’s more important to maintain a relationship with the minority in the U.S. Senate than it is for you to maintain a relationship with the minority of voters in America,” Clyburn said in an interview. “That’s insulting to me.”",
            "Clyburn further criticized Manchin for imperiling his fellow party caucus members by not trying to reverse voting restrictions passed by Republican state legislatures. He specifically cited the possibility that new voting restrictions in Georgia could cost freshman Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.) his seat in 2022.",
            "“Since when do their rights take precedence over your fellow Democrat Warnock, who saw his state just pass laws to keep him from getting reelected?” he asked. “And you’re going to say it’s more important for you to protect 50 Republicans in the Senate than for you to protect your fellow Democrat’s seat in Georgia. That’s a bunch of crap.”",
            "The For The People Act passed the House on March 3, with all Democrats but one voting in favor — and all Republicans plus that one Democrat opposed. The bill faces a similarly stark partisan reception in the Senate. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) calls the bill a Democratic “power grab” and “socialism.”",
            "The bill will face a Republican-led filibuster when it comes to the floor. Ten Republicans would need to vote to end debate on the bill to allow it to clear a filibuster and face a simple majority up-or-down vote. That is unlikely to happen.",
            "Clyburn says Senate Democrats need to change the filibuster rules in order to pass this bill. At the very least, he believes that the filibuster rules should be changed to allow voting and civil rights legislation to pass on a simple majority.",
            "“The issue of civil rights and voting rights, these constitutional issues, should never be sacrificed on the altar of the filibuster,” Clyburn said. “I’ve been saying that for a long time.”",
            "“I don’t understand why we can’t see that my constitutional rights should not be subjected to anybody’s filibuster,” he added.",
            "He warned that if Democrats let this voting rights bill, along with the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act reauthorizing the 1965 Voting Rights Act, fall to Republican-led filibusters, the party would “pay the biggest price it has ever paid at the polls” in the 2022 midterm elections.",
            "“That is an actual fact,” Clyburn said. “I think I know Black people. I’ve been Black 80 years.”",
            "Clyburn hopes that President Joe Biden heeds this warning as well. He believes Biden will push to get this bill enacted into law after the president made a promise to have the backs of Black voters after he won election last November.",
            "“And especially those moments when this campaign was at its lowest end, the African American community stood up again for me,” Biden said on Nov. 8 after he was officially declared the winner last year. “You always had my back, and I’ll have yours.”",
            "Clyburn’s endorsement of Biden ahead of the South Carolina primary, after the former vice president had lost the Iowa caucus and the New Hampshire and Nevada primaries, propelled him to the Democratic presidential nomination.",
            "“The best way to have the backs of Black folks is to ensure the constitutional rights to cast an unfettered vote; there ain’t no better way than to do that,” Clyburn said. “Joe Biden is not going to allow the voting rights of Black people to be sacrificed on the altar of the filibuster.”"

            "A mysterious ailment is turning some black bears friendly and unafraid of humans, among other strange symptoms.",
            "Researchers believe the illness, which appears to afflict young bears around a year old, is a kind of encephalitis, meaning an inflammation of the brain, according to a news release from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife late last month. Since 2014, a handful of bears in Nevada and California have shown signs of the condition, and four California bears were confirmed to have it in the last year.",
            "“The first bear I personally rescued was diagnosed with encephalitis in March of 2018,” Ann Bryant of the Bear Education Aversion Response told Live Science. “She walked into a school and entered a classroom where she sat down among the children, behaving very much like a friendly dog.”",
            "The encephalitis has other serious effects on the bears, including tremors, head tilts and seizures. Affected bears also tend to be seriously underweight. One female bear, observed in February picking up an apple and eating it among humans on a patio, weighed only 21 pounds when she should have been around 80 pounds. She was also covered in ticks, walked strangely and was ultimately euthanized.",
            "It’s still unclear exactly what’s causing the brain inflammation. But in the course of studying the phenomenon, scientists have identified five previously unknown viruses in the affected bears.",
            "These viruses are not believed to pose any risk to humans, Jamie Sherman, a veterinarian at the University of California, Davis’ One Health Institute told the Sacramento Bee.",
            "Bears suffering from encephalitis typically have to be euthanized. Their symptoms make them unequipped to survive in the wild, and those placed in zoos or sanctuaries can become “a huge burden” due to the lifelong medical care they’ll need, wildlife veterinarian Brandon Munk said in the CFDW release.",
            "Two bears exhibiting neurological issues in recent years, however, were able to find new homes. One, now named Elinor, was brought to the Orange County Zoo. The other bear, who had gone viral after being caught on camera sniffing a snowboarder and is now named Benji, lives at the San Diego Humane Society’s Ramona Wildlife Center. Last month, Benji celebrated his third birthday there with a cake made out of fruit and mashed potatoes."

            "Republican-controlled legislatures across the country have introduced dozens of bills targeting transgender youth, building on conservative dog whistles and putting some of the country’s most vulnerable at risk, human rights groups say.",
            "The bills fall into two main categories: At least 17 states are considering laws that would limit access to health care for young transgender Americans, and 28 more have bills excluding trans kids from school sports, according to a tally by the American Civil Liberties Union.",
            "So far, the effort is working. Bills prohibiting children from playing on sports teams in line with their gender identity have already been passed in Arkansas, Mississippi and Tennessee — and other measures are moving forward as well.",
            "South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem (R) went so far as to say she was “excited” when such a bill passed in her state. She later declined to sign it, saying she was worried about legal challenges, and instead issued a pair of executive orders she said would “protect” sports teams this week.",
            "“Only girls should play girls’ sports,” Noem said Monday.",
            "The push to roll back freedoms for transgender kids amounts to a dramatic uptick in exclusionary legislation by GOP lawmakers that builds on the far-right push to establish anti-trans bathroom laws, human rights groups say.",
            "“We are truly witnessing an escalation of attacks on trans people, unlike anything I’ve ever seen in government,” Chase Strangio, deputy director for transgender justice at the ACLU, told Democracy Now. “I think what we’re seeing today in state legislatures is a particular effort to pivot from the anti-trans restroom bills into a new form of regulation of trans young people and trans bodies.”",
            "The ACLU has pledged to file suit against such bills, and a judge overturned legislation in Idaho last year that sought to exclude transgender girls from girls sports teams. But studies show that a vast majority of trans youth feel unsafe at home and at school, Strangio said, and ongoing efforts will only contribute to that.",
            "President Joe Biden has moved quickly to undo some of the Trump administration’s efforts to exclude transgender people from everyday life, including lifting a ban on trans service members in the military on Wednesday. But efforts to target young trans people have multiplied this year. Republicans have often worked in conjunction with religious conservative groups to repackage anti-trans legislation and use it toward their larger fight against political correctness, The New York Times notes.",
            "This bevy of legislation relies heavily on misinformation and negative tropes about transgender people, and flies in the face of medical advice.",
            "After the Arkansas legislature overwhelmingly passed a harmful bill that would prohibit doctors from providing medically necessary treatment to trans youth, the president of the American Academy of Pediatrics said it was a “dangerous” attempt to politicize medicine.",
            "“This is discrimination by legislation and transgender children and all children deserve better,” Dr. Lee Beers said. “It puts politicians rather than pediatricians in charge of a child’s medical care.”",
            "The Arkansas bill, titled the Save Adolescents From Experimentation, or SAFE, Act, leans heavily on conservative dog whistles about transgender people. LGBTQ rights groups have called on the state’s Republican governor, Asa Hutchinson, to veto it. Hutchinson has not said whether he supports the bill, but he signed the bill prohibiting transgender girls from competing on sports teams last week.",
            "The National Center for Transgender Equality said the Arkansas legislature’s decision was putting young people at risk.",
            "“They would deny them live-saving, appropriate health care not because it’s good public policy but because politicians believe that it will bring them more power,” said Rodrigo Heng-Lehtinen, deputy executive director for the group. “We need to remember that these are children. All children deserve to have access to the support and health care they need to live happy and healthy lives.”"

In the accompanying interview, he describes the vaccines as “a godsent miracle” and urges fans from both sides of the political spectrum to schedule their jabs as soon as possible.",
            "“It became very clear to me that the only way to really get back to normal is through vaccinations,” the 10-time Grammy nominee said. “You’ve got to get needles in arms.”",
            "The 43-year-old North Carolina native is gearing up for the release of a triple album project, “Heart & Soul,” later this month. He’s also hopeful he’ll be able to safely return to the stage this year ― one of the many reasons, he said, he is determined to encourage widespread vaccinations.",
            "“If you believe you shouldn’t, I don’t have a problem with it,” said Church, who received backlash from some fans in 2018 after he spoke out in favor of “common sense” gun reform. “I’m a liberty guy, too. I get it. But I view this a little differently than most other things. We’ve never encountered this.”",
            "“I just want to play shows,” he continued. “Politics’ job is to divide — that’s how you win elections. Those things that unite us are music and sports. The times when, whether you’re a Democrat or Republican or whatever, you throw your arm around the person next to you.”",
            "Billboard’s cover shot is an homage to Presley, who in 1956 was photographed receiving a polio vaccine while backstage at “The Ed Sullivan Show.”",
            "Elsewhere in the interview, Church also shared his thoughts on fellow musician Morgan Wallen, who used the N-word in an expletive-ridden video in February, prompting radio stations to drop him and his record label to suspend him.",
            "Even prior to that, “Saturday Night Live” had scrapped Wallen’s scheduled performance last fall after videos surfaced on social media showing him partying mask-free in violation of the show’s coronavirus precautions.",
            "Neither controversy has made a lasting impact on Wallen’s album sales. Still, Church told Billboard he was “heartbroken” by “The Voice” alum’s “indefensible” behavior.",
            "“I think Morgan’s trying to work on that and on himself,” he said. “And I hope he does.”"

            "Moving to the White House is rough ― and that goes for first dogs as well.",
            "Within just two months of calling the Oval Office home, President Joe Biden’s dog Major has made headlines over two reported minor biting incidents involving staff.",
            "The 3-year-old canine didn’t break anyone’s skin or cause serious injury in either instance. Even so, some critics have been quick to call for his removal.",
            "But according to the experts, it’s the critics who are barking mad.",
            "“You have to think about the number of people he has to interact with on a daily basis,” dog behaviorist Michael Shikashio told HuffPost. “I think he needs time to meet the different staff; he needs the proper handlers.”",
            "Dog bites and dog aggression are not unusual, according to Shikashio and fellow animal experts who say most cases involve a dog having some kind of fear. In Major’s case, he’s likely still adapting to some pretty unique surroundings, and that takes time.",
            "“When a dog misbehaves, it’s a human problem,” famed dog trainer and so-called “dog whisperer” Cesar Millan told HuffPost. “You cannot blame someone who does not rationalize; there is no knowledge behind instinct, it’s all reaction.”",
            "Biden has also indicated that stress was a reason for at least the first incident, saying in an interview last month that Major was merely “surprised by an unfamiliar person.”",
            "“Every door you turn to, there’s a guy there in a black jacket,” Biden said of this new home life. He stressed that the incident did not lead to any real injury.",
            "“Look, Major was a rescue pup. Major did not bite someone and penetrate the skin,” he said.",
            "Major was adopted from a Delaware animal shelter as a puppy ― making him the first shelter dog to reside in the White House. Lindsay Hamrick, director of shelter outreach and engagement at the Humane Society of the United States, insisted that he deserves a fair shake.",
            "“Dogs from shelters and rescues are no different from other dogs — every dog is an individual,” she said. “There is no data to support that dogs who are adopted from a shelter or rescue organization are more likely to bite.”",
            "Like Millan and Shikashio, Hamrick emphasized that Major likely needs time to transition into the role of first dog, a title he shares with the Bidens’ older German shepherd, Champ.",
            "“Dogs experience a transition period when settling into a new environment. Some dogs adjust to a new environment very quickly, while for others, the transition may take a few days, a few weeks or even a few months,” she said. “Introducing dogs slowly to new rooms, environments and people can help make the adjustment period smoother, but keep in mind that each dog is an individual with different needs.”",
            "Millan and Shikashio also encouraged setting indoor boundaries for Major and Champ as they get adjusted to their new home.",
            "“You can’t just wander around [the White House], so that should go the same for the dog,” Millan said. He stopped short of saying the dog is the one that needs training, however, pointing a finger instead at the humans around him.",
            "“You can’t blame an animal for misbehaving,” said Millan. “I understand at one point, we have to make someone responsible, but we humans have to be responsible, including the people who are going to live with the dog.”",
            "He encouraged those who enter the White House to check their emotions at the door and dismiss any prejudices they may have about different dog breeds.",
            "“I understand the White House is not a place for people to become enlightened ... It’s about power, it’s about politics, it’s about disagreeing with other people,” he said. “If you are afraid of the dog, he’s going to feel it. If you don’t like the dog, he’s going to feel it.”",
            "Shikashio also encouraged White House visitors and staff not to approach the dogs but give them their space. Based on reports that the dog nipped people’s hands in both incidents, he believes someone was reaching out to touch Major or to let Major smell them, “which can be a big mistake,” he said.",
            "“It’s actually usually best to see if the dog wants to engage with the person. Because most of the time, it’s us humans who are getting in their space, but most dogs are afraid,” he said.",
            "Though all this may sound like an unnecessary challenge to some, Millan insists the White House needs animals.",
            "“Politics is chaos. It’s not about harmony, it’s not about balance,” he said. “He’s the only one who wants your happiness. He’s the only one who wants your love. Everyone else is about the deadline.”",
            "Millan and Shikashio agree that Major’s a good boy with a lot of potential.",
            "“Major, I love you; I’ve got your back, my friend. It’s not your fault,” Millan declared."

        "articleContent": [
            "Starting Thursday, millions of recently unemployed Americans can opt to have the federal government cover their health insurance costs for several months, offering much-needed relief to people struggling during the coronavirus pandemic.",
            "As of April 1, the federal government will start paying the full premiums for Americans who are getting their health insurance through COBRA, a federal program that allows the jobless to continue being covered through their former employer’s health insurance plan for at least 18 months at personal cost.",
            "The benefit is one of several health care provisions in the American Rescue Plan, the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package Democrats passed in mid-March. The federal government will foot the bill for six months, through the end of September. There’s no definitive estimate for how many Americans this program will reach, but it’s expected to be in the millions.",
            "As of last August, an estimated 12.7 million Americans had lost their health insurance during the pandemic, according to the last report from the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal-leaning think tank. Half that number was the spouses and children who were getting health insurance through their partners’ and parents’ employers.",
            "For most Americans, COBRA is prohibitively expensive. On average, employer-sponsored private health insurance was $7,470 for single coverage and $21,342 for family coverage in 2020, according to a survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation. It’s a steep cost for someone who has just lost a job.",
            "COBRA was too expensive for Contessa Washington, 41, from Crowley, Texas, who lost her job as a social worker at a nursing home in February. The facility, Wellington Oaks by Daybreak Ventures, laid off staff after struggling to receive enough patients during the pandemic, she said. The single mother of three said the only job offer she’s gotten since then was too far away — more than a 90-minute commute.",
            "Washington has a rare incurable blood disorder, thalassemia, which requires regular doctor visits to get blood transfusions.",
            "Her health insurance plan at Wellington Oaks wasn’t even that good in the first place, she said. It had a $3,000 deductible. She had to go to the hospital for an emergency blood transfusion in January and was stuck with the full $1,500 bill. A single doctors appointment after losing her job and without insurance left her with a $900 bill. She’s been skipping doctor appointments since.",
            "“I’m not saying I don’t need to go [to the doctor], but I’m not going, because I don’t want to get more in debt,” Washington said. “I’m stressed because I do have three children... I have had this illness all my life, but they weren’t able to recognize what it was until I was 17, so it’s getting worse, but right now it’s more me worried about getting to the doctor, not getting so much in debt where I can’t pay my rent.”",
            "Public leaders are optimistic that the country is in the final months of the pandemic, as more and more Americans get vaccinated and the death rate continues to decline. But economic recovery is going to be slow, and for many that means longer periods of joblessness and being uninsured.",
            "There are stories like Washington’s around the country.",
            "“There was a lot of different situations where I really felt like I really wanted to go to urgent care, but I couldn’t,” said a 23-year-old single mother from Decatur, Georgia, who lost her job at a credit union in January. She asked for anonymity to share her personal health experiences.",
            "The woman developed symptoms after having unprotected sex but felt she could only rely on home remedies and self-diagnosis in order to avoid the bill from a doctor’s visit. The symptoms eventually went away, but she never knew the underlying cause.",
            "“On top of me not having any money — but even if I did have money, I had to buy groceries, I just could spend on that,” she said. “It really does affect you.”",
            "To be eligible for this new benefit, Americans must qualify for COBRA, either because they lost their job or saw a reduction in hours, but cannot be eligible for Medicare or another health care plan either through their spouse or a new employer. The plan also allows those who previously declined COBRA but would have otherwise been eligible to benefit.",
            "The American Rescue Plan requires health insurance companies to notify all eligible Americans about these benefits. And the Department of Labor is issuing guidance to employers to ensure that is the case, a spokesperson at the Department of Labor confirmed. Americans are encouraged to reach out to their former employers or the Labor Department if they think they’re eligible but haven’t been notified.",
            "The Congressional Budget Office estimated that a previous version of this benefit proposed by House Democrats earlier this year, which would have covered only 85% of premiums through COBRA, would reach an additional 2.2 million Americans, 600,000 of whom would have been uninsured without the provision. Because this proposal covers 100% of the premiums, its reach is expected to be more than that, Josh Bivens, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, said in an email.",
            "Still, it’s not a perfect fix, and it’s only temporary. Progressives have derided this Band-Aid as being a boon for private insurers that have already reported big profits during the pandemic. After all, the government is essentially paying for Americans to stay on private plans instead of moving them onto cheaper public ones, such as Medicare and Medicaid.",
            "And six states — Alabama, Alaska, Idaho, Indiana, Michigan and Montana — haven’t expanded COBRA to apply to businesses that employ fewer than 20 people.",
            "“I think this COBRA provision is obviously much better than doing nothing,” Bivens said. “I do think providing coverage this way highlights just how expensive private health coverage in the U.S. is.”",
            "For the next six months, it will give many some peace of mind. Caroline Kacmarsky, a 24-year-old campaign field worker whose job in Sen. Jon Ossoff’s Georgia campaign ended last month, qualified for all three rounds of stimulus checks amounting $3,200 over the last 12 months. The vast majority of that, she said, has gone to paying for COBRA or her medications upfront while she was either between jobs or out of a job altogether.",
            "“Since losing my health insurance, it’s been a kind of scary time for me,” Kacmarsky said. She’s on three daily medications, which she’s had to pay for out of pocket. One of those medications is $400 a month.",
            "In December, her COBRA premium was $600, the same amount as the second round of direct payments.",
            "“There’s always a little nagging in your brain when you don’t have health care.”",

            "Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin is set to take a leading position with House Democrats’ campaign arm, becoming the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee’s first-ever organizing chair.",
            "Raskin, a progressive who represents the Maryland suburbs and was the lead prosecutor in President Donald Trump’s second impeachment trial, will help shape the field and digital organizing strategies for the party as Democrats try to buck history and hold on to a slender House majority during the 2022 midterms.",
            "The DCCC is partnering with Raskin to massively expand his Democracy Summer program, part of a reorganization of the committee’s organizing efforts. Its goals include integrating traditional fieldwork with digital campaigning lessons learned from the 2020 cycle when COVID-19 restricted in-person campaigning, as well as focusing on long-term goals rather than just short-term electoral victories.",
            "“I sort of distinguish between organizing and mobilizing,” Raskin told HuffPost in an interview. “I think that the party’s been great at mobilizing people to go vote, but organizing is more of the long-term, sustained community engagement that builds big power over a period of time.”",
            "As part of the plan, the DCCC is moving all of its field staff, mobilization staff and portions of its digital and voter protection teams under the umbrella of a new organizing department, led by committee veteran Pavitra Abraham. The goal is to make the committee ― which has traditionally focused first and foremost on fundraising and airing television ads ― more involved in building up the ranks and skills of Democratic organizers.",
            "“We’re taking much more of a comprehensive approach,” Abraham said. “We’re talking about long-term infrastructure-building, skill-building, pipeline-building. We’re trying to be less siloed and more integrated.”",
            "The Democracy Summer program, which Raskin has run on his own campaign since he was in the state legislature, combines educational sessions on the history of social change in America with two days a week of on-the-ground organizing work in fellows’ home states or districts. (A letter Raskin wrote to his House colleagues inviting them to participate said fellows would receive a “modest stipend.”)",
            "More than 1,000 high school and college students in the mid-Atlantic region have participated in Raskin’s program, and the DCCC said multiple campaigns have already expressed interest in the national version.",
            "“This has blossomed into something huge,” Raskin said. “It speaks to people’s desire to make politics a far more reflective and educational thing.”",
            "Some Democrats have questioned the party’s decision to forgo in-person organizing during the pandemic, arguing that the lack of face-to-face voter contact inhibited the party and contributed to Democratic losses in multiple razor-thin House contests.",
            "“COVID-19 has definitely hurt Democratic Party efforts because we are a party that thrives on face-to-face contact,” Raskin said, while noting he’s not certain if any specific losses can be attributed to the decision to limit canvassing. “It’s been difficult for us.”",
            "Raskin joins vice-chairs Texas Rep. Marc Veasey and California Reps. Ami Bera and Linda Sanchez, and Chair New York Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney on the committee’s leadership team.",
            "Democrats have a slim 219-211 majority in the House, and while the political battlefield won’t be set until states draw district lines later this year, the party out of power in Washington, D.C., historically gains dozens of seats in midterm elections."

            "Five cocktails were the top pick in three states each: piña colada, wine cooler, White Russian, margarita and mojito. The margarita was also the second most popular cocktail overall in both the warm seasons and the cold ones.",
            "Naturally, there were some clear local favorites, like the daiquiri in Louisiana and the mai tai in Hawaii. In other unsurprising revelations, Upgraded Points also found that search interest for “cocktail recipes” almost doubled in March 2020 compared to March 2019.",

            "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden and a top health official warned Monday that too many Americans are declaring virus victory too quickly, appealing for mask requirements and other restrictions to be maintained or restored to stave off a “fourth surge” of COVID-19. The head of the CDC said she had a feeling of “impending doom” if people keep easing off.",
            "The double dose of warnings came even as Biden laid out hopeful new steps to expand coronavirus vaccinations, with all adults to become eligible over the next 5 weeks. Biden announced plans to expand the number of retail pharmacies that are administering vaccines, and investments to help Americans get to vaccination sites. But the optimism was tempered by stark warnings about the potential for another wave of cases.",
            "“This is deadly serious,” Biden said, urging governors to reinstate mask mandates and other restrictions that some states have been easing.",
            "Hours earlier, during a virtual White House health briefing, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, grew emotional as she reflected on her experience treating COVID-19 patients who are alone at the end of their lives.",

            "“I’m going to lose the script, and I’m going to reflect on the recurring feeling I have of impending doom.”",
            "Cases of the virus are up about 10% over the past week from the previous week, to about 60,000 cases per day, with both hospitalizations and deaths ticking up as well, Walensky said. She warned that without immediate action the U.S. could follow European countries into another spike in cases and suffer needless deaths.",
            "“I have to share the truth, and I have to hope and trust you will listen,” she said.",
            "Later Monday, Biden addressed the nation from the White House, declaring, “If we let our guard down now, we can see the virus getting worse, not better. People are letting up on precautions, which is a very bad thing.”",
            "Biden delivered a direct appeal to governors, state and local leaders to reinstate mask-wearing requirements if they have lifted them, and said he encouraged leaders to pause plans to further ease virus-related restrictions.",
            "“Please, this is not politics, reinstate the mandate if you let it down,” he said.",
            "Biden announced that by April 19 at least 90% of the adult U.S. population would be eligible for vaccination — and would have access to a vaccination site within 5 miles of home. Quick vaccination would still depend on supply.",
            "Biden had previously directed that all states make all adults eligible for vaccination by May 1, but many have moved to lift eligibility requirements sooner in anticipation of supply increases.",
            "Meanwhile, the White House is moving to double the number of pharmacies participating in the federal retail pharmacy program — which has emerged as among the most efficient avenues for administering vaccines — and increase the number of doses for them to deliver. Retail pharmacies are located relatively close to most Americans and have experience delivering vaccines like flu shots.",
            "Biden announced that the U.S. is expecting delivery of 33 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine this week — including 11 million of the single-dose Johnson & Johnson shot.",
            "More than one in five adults and nearly 50% of senior American are fully vaccinated, according to data from the CDC. On Thursday, the U.S. set new single-day record for shots in arms: more than 3.2 million.",
            "“Now is not the time to let down,” Biden said. “Now’s not the time to celebrate. It is time to do what we do best as a country: our duty, our jobs, take care of one another.”",

            "DONNA, Texas (AP) — More than 500 migrant children were packed into plastic-walled rooms built for 32 people, sitting inches apart on mats with foil blankets Tuesday at the largest U.S. Customs and Border Protection holding facility for unaccompanied children.",
            "Overall, CBP’s main child processing center, a compound of white tents in Texas’ Rio Grande Valley, held over 4,100 migrants, more than 3,400 of them children who traveled to the U.S.-Mexico border alone and the rest of them families. It is designed for 250 people under guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during the coronavirus pandemic.",
            "The Biden administration allowed journalists to see conditions for the first time since the facility opened Feb. 9 amid a spike in families and unaccompanied children crossing the border.",
            "It was a grim picture.",
            "A 3,200-square-foot (297-square-meter) space had been divided into several rooms for 32 children each under CDC guidelines, each separated by thick plastic walls instead of the chain-link fence used by previous administrations. Despite the health recommendations, one of the “pods” held nearly 700 kids, another had nearly 600 and others had just above 500. Everyone wore masks, but COVID-19 tests aren’t done unless they show symptoms.",
            "Doors to the rooms were open for free movement but there was little room to roam and no one to play games. Most children just sat on the ground close together, chatting quietly. Some were wrapped in foil blankets. Lights are dimmed at night.",
            "Children, most of them between 13 and 17, are separated by age. Families occupied a separate pod that was less crowded than the jam-packed rooms for older children.",
            "A room for “tender age” children from 3 to 9 years old consisted of a walled playpen with mats on the floor and far more space than the eight pods for older children. An 11-year-old boy cared for his 3-year-old sister, and a 17-year-old cared for her newborn.",
            "“I’m a Border Patrol agent. I didn’t sign up for this,” Oscar Escamilla, acting executive officer of the Border Patrol’s Rio Grande Valley sector, said while looking at the younger kids.",
            "The children are processed in the tent-like facility in the Texas border town of Donna before being taken to longer-term care facilities run by U.S. Health and Human Services and then placed with a family member, relative or sponsor.",
            "About two dozen of some 270 children being transferred to HHS midday tested positive for COVID-19 — the only time they are tested unless they exhibit symptoms earlier. Escamilla said the overall positivity rate at the Donna facility was about 14%.",
            "As they prepared to leave, children who tested negative for COVID-19 played soccer in the outdoor recreation area, where they can go three times a day when their pods are being cleaned. Those who tested positive for the virus gathered around metal benches off to the side and will still go to HHS centers.\n\nThe Border Patrol is apprehending far more children daily than HHS is taking, leading to a severe backlog. The Border Patrol is not supposed to detain children for more than three days, but HHS lacks space.\n\nMore than 2,000 kids have been at the Donna facility for more than 72 hours, including 39 for more than 15 days. One child had been there 20 days. The average stay was 133 hours.\n\n“The intent of the Border Patrol is not detention. We’re not in the business of detention,” said Escamilla, the official who supervised the media tour. “We’re forced into the business because we can’t turn them over to anybody.”\n\nHHS is housing children at convention centers in Dallas and San Diego and is opening large-scale sites in San Antonio, El Paso and elsewhere.\n\nA large HHS facility is being built near the holding center in Donna, separated by a chain-link fence. Noise from construction equipment filled the air near seven buses that were to take children to other HHS facilities.\n\nAbout 250 to 300 children enter the Donna facility daily and far fewer leave, a “lopsided” difference that Escamilla said was leading to more crowded conditions. It has held as many as 4,600 migrants.\n\nMore than 17,000 unaccompanied children were in U.S. custody as of Monday, about 12,000 with HHS and the rest with Customs and Border Protection. On Monday, 446 children entered CBP custody but only 229 went to HHS.\n\nHHS, which opened a facility Tuesday for 500 children at Fort Bliss in Texas, is working to build up to a capacity of 13,500 beds, spokesman Mark Weber said.\n\nSeveral hundred kids and teenagers are crossing the border daily, most fleeing violence, poverty or the effects of natural disasters in Central America. President Joe Biden has declined to resume his predecessor’s practice of expelling unaccompanied children.\n\nBut his administration has continued expelling adults under a coronavirus-related public health declaration enacted by former President Donald Trump. Biden also has tried to expel most families traveling together, but changes in Mexican law have forced agents to release many parents and children into the U.S.\n\nIn some cases, parents refused entry into the U.S. have sent their children across the border alone, hoping they will be placed with relatives eventually.\n\nBiden has faced intense pressure to bring more transparency to how large numbers of migrant children are being treated. In his administration’s first tour of the Donna holding facility, two journalists from The Associated Press and a crew from CBS shared text, photos and video with other news outlets as part of a pool arrangement.\n\nAt the facility, children entered a tent with a dirt floor and three rows of bleacher-style seats. About 60 children waited to be admitted Tuesday, all wearing masks and seated close together.\n\nThey then go into a small room for lice and scabies inspection and a general health check, including whether they have a fever. Their hair is hosed down.\n\nThe facility is staffed by physician assistants and nurse practitioners, who perform psychological tests, including asking children if they have had any suicidal thoughts. All shoelaces are removed to avoid harm to anyone.\n\nAmid the loud hum of air conditioning vents, children are led to a room for processing, with anyone 14 and older getting photographed and having their fingerprints taken. Younger kids don’t.\n\nIn another room, agents ask them if they have a contact in the U.S. and allow the child to speak with them by phone. Plastic shields separate the agents and the children, who are seated at tables. They get bracelets with a barcode that shows a history of when they showered, medical conditions and any other personal information.\n\nAll children are given notices to appear in immigration court, clearing the way for them to be released to Health and Human Services. About 1,200 children were ready for release Tuesday but there was nowhere to send them, Escamilla said.\n\n___\n\nMerchant reported from Houston."

            "Chauvin, 45, is charged with second- and third-degree murder as well as second-degree manslaughter in Floyd’s death. He has pleaded not guilty on all counts.",
            "Video recorded on a bystander’s cellphone and viewed millions of times across the world showed Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, crying out for help as Chauvin, who is white, and two other police officers pinned him to the ground.",
            "Floyd’s killing sparked months of nationwide protests against police brutality and racism and led to a worldwide reckoning against racial injustice.",
            "Here’s what else you need to know as Chauvin’s trial unfolds:",
            "How Floyd Died",
            "On May 25, 2020, the Monday of Memorial Day weekend, two Minneapolis police officers ― Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane ― responded to a call shortly after 8 p.m. about a man trying to use a counterfeit $20 bill at a corner market, according to a criminal complaint filed by the state of Minnesota.",
            "The suspect, Floyd, was sitting in a parked car near the store with two other passengers when Kueng and Lane arrived, the complaint stated. After Lane began speaking to Floyd, the officer pointed his gun at Floyd’s open window. He then pulled Floyd out of the car and handcuffed him. Floyd “actively resisted” being handcuffed, according to the complaint.",
            "Read the full criminal complaint against Chauvin here.",
            "Once handcuffed, Floyd was “compliant,” following Lane’s directions and engaging in a short conversation with the officer, the complaint stated. At 8:14 p.m., as Lane and Kueng attempted to walk Floyd to their patrol car, Floyd “stiffened up, fell to the ground and told the officers he was claustrophobic.”",
            "Two more officers ― Chauvin and Tou Thao ― arrived about that time. They joined the other officers in trying to get Floyd into the backseat of the patrol car, but Floyd was not cooperating, according to the complaint. Floyd “began saying and repeating that he could not breathe.”",
            "At 8:19 p.m., Chauvin pulled Floyd to the ground and placed his knee on the back of Floyd’s neck while Kueng held Floyd’s back, Lane held Floyd’s legs and Thao stood watch, the complaint stated.",
            "Floyd, while handcuffed and pinned face-down to the ground, stated multiple times that he couldn’t breathe and repeatedly said “mama” and “please,” according to the complaint. At one point, Floyd can be heard on a bystander’s video stating that he was “about to die.”",
            "Bystanders can be heard in the cellphone video telling officers that they’re killing Floyd and pleading with them to help him.",
            "By 8:25 p.m., Floyd had stopped moving and, moments later, ceased breathing, the complaint stated. Kueng checked Floyd’s wrist for a pulse but “couldn’t find one.” Chauvin continued to kneel on Floyd’s neck until 8:27 p.m.",
            "Floyd was then taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 9:25 p.m. after first responders and doctors tried to revive him for nearly an hour. Chauvin and the other three officers were fired the next day.",
            "Two autopsies ― one conducted by county officials and the other commissioned by Floyd’s family ― separately classified Floyd’s death as a homicide. However, the autopsy reports, which were both released last June, differed on the exact cause of death.",
            "The Hennepin County medical examiner’s office said in its report that Floyd died of “cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint and neck compression.” Michael Baden and Allecia Wilson, the doctors who conducted the independent autopsy, said Floyd died of mechanical asphyxia.",
            "Charges",
            "On May 29, Chauvin was arrested and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison (D) filed a tougher second-degree murder charge against Chauvin on June 3.",
            "Under Minnesota statutes, a person can be charged with second-degree murder if they intentionally killed someone without premeditation or unintentionally killed someone while committing certain other offenses. A person can be charged with third-degree murder if they unintentionally cause “the death of another by perpetrating an act eminently dangerous to others and evincing a depraved mind, without regard for human life.”",
            "Second-degree manslaughter can occur when a person causes the death of another person by creating “an unreasonable risk” and “consciously takes chances of causing death or great bodily harm to another,” according to Minnesota law.",
            "Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill, who is presiding over Chauvin’s trial, dropped the third-degree murder charge against Chauvin in October. He ruled that such a charge under Minnesota law would require proof that Chauvin’s conduct was “eminently dangerous to others,” not just Floyd.",
            "But Cahill reinstated the charge on March 11 after an appellate court ruled that he should have followed the precedent set by the conviction of former officer Mohamed Noor, who fatally shot Justine Damond in 2017.",
            "Lane, Kueng and Thao have been charged with aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter. They have each pleaded not guilty to the charges and are scheduled to be tried together beginning in August. The three officers were released on separate $750,000 bonds weeks after Floyd’s death.",
            "Chauvin was released from jail in October on a $1 million bond, reigniting protests across Minneapolis.",
            "Trial Begins",
            "Jury selection for Chauvin’s trial began March 9 and lasted two weeks. Of the 15 jurors seated, two are alternates and one is an extra alternate. Cahill is expected to dismiss the extra alternate Monday if none of the other jurors drops out before then.",
            "Because of COVID-19 precautions, Cahill is allowing only a limited number of people inside the courtroom, including just two journalists each day. However, in a rare move, the trial will be broadcast live.",
            "The jurors’ faces will not be broadcast and their identities will not be released during the trial. They will be referred to only by their juror numbers.",
            "Cahill, as well as members of the prosecution and defense teams, questioned the prospective jurors about a range of topics, focusing mostly on their backgrounds, their feelings about the trial and their stances on Black Lives Matter, the criminal justice system and police generally.",
            "Three days after jury selection began, the city of Minneapolis announced it agreed to a record-breaking $27 million civil settlement with Floyd’s family. Chauvin’s attorney, Eric Nelson, filed motions to delay the trial and change the venue, arguing news of the city’s settlement prejudiced the jury pool. Cahill ruled against the motions.",
            "The seven jurors who were seated before the settlement was announced were recalled at Nelson’s request to see if the agreement had affected their ability to be impartial. Cahill dismissed two of the jurors after they said it had.",
            "Here’s what we know about the 15 jurors, which include four Black people, two multiracial people and nine white people, according to The Associated Press:",
            "Juror No. 2 is a white man in his 20s who works as a chemist. He is the only juror on the panel who said he had never seen bystander video of Floyd’s arrest.",
            "Juror No. 9 is a multiracial woman in her 20s. She said she has an uncle who is a police officer and suggested Chauvin may have behaved the way he did because Floyd was potentially resisting arrest or that civilian lives may have been in danger.",
            "Juror No. 19 is a white man in his 30s who works as an auditor. He has a friend who works for the Minneapolis police. He said he generally supports Black Lives Matter.",
            "Juror No. 27 is a Black man in his 30s who works in computer security. He said he immigrated to the U.S. more than 14 years ago. He said he had a somewhat negative view of Chauvin.",
            "Juror No. 44 is a white woman in her 50s who serves as an executive of a nonprofit health care advocacy organization. She said she strongly agrees that the criminal justice system is biased against minorities.",
            "Juror No. 52 is a Black man in his 30s who works in banking. He said he has neutral opinions on Chauvin and Floyd.",
            "Juror No. 55 is a white woman in her 50s who works as an executive assistant at a health care clinic. She said “all lives matter” to her no matter “who they are or what they are.”",
            "Juror No. 79 is a Black man in his 40s who works in management. He said he has lived in the Minneapolis area for roughly two decades after he immigrated to the U.S. He said he generally trusts police.",
            "Juror No. 85 is a multiracial woman in her 40s who works as a consultant. She said she has a neutral view of Floyd. She said she has a pretty strong faith in police but recognizes they are human and can make mistakes.",
            "Juror No. 89 is a white woman in her 50s who works as a registered nurse. She said she somewhat disagrees about the statement that it’s not right to second-guess decisions officers make.",
            "Juror No. 91 is a Black woman in her 60s who worked in marketing before retiring. She said she has a very favorable view of Black Lives Matter. She said she has a relative who is a police officer in Minneapolis.",
            "Juror No. 92 is a white woman in her 40s who works in the commercial insurance industry. She said she doesn’t believe police should treat poorly someone who isn’t cooperating or might be under the influence of drugs.",
            "Juror No. 96 is a white woman in her 50s who is unemployed. She said a person should have nothing to fear from police if they cooperate with their commands.",
            "Juror No. 118 is a white woman in her 20s who is a social worker. She said police and their jobs are important but that she also believes there are things about policing practices that should be changed.",
            "Juror No. 131 is a white man in his 20s who works as an accountant. He said he initially had a somewhat negative opinion of Chauvin and that he views Black Lives Matter somewhat favorably.",
            "What’s Next",
            "Opening statements from the prosecution and defense are scheduled for Monday. Witness testimony and cross-examination will follow. This portion of the trial is expected to last two to four weeks before closing arguments are made and the jury begins deliberation.",
            "Chauvin’s attorney is expected to argue that Floyd died of a drug overdose. (The county medical examiner’s report indicated Floyd had fentanyl and methamphetamine in his system when he died.)",
            "The prosecution, led by Ellison, will likely contend that Chauvin’s actions were part of a pattern of excessive force during his tenure as a police officer. Ellison’s office has outlined six incidents prior to Floyd’s death in which Chauvin restrained people by their necks or knelt on top of them. Chauvin was never reprimanded for his actions, though at least two of those arrested said they filed formal complaints against him, The Marshall Project reported.",
            "If convicted of second-degree murder, Chauvin faces up to 40 years in prison. He faces up to 25 years behind bars if convicted of third-degree murder and up to 10 years if convicted of second-degree manslaughter."

            "Tugboats were pulling the Ever Given toward the Great Bitter Lake, a wide stretch of water in the middle of the Suez Canal, for a technical inspection.",
            "The Suez Canal, one of the world’s busiest trade routes, became blocked when the ship’s operators said it was blown off-course by strong winds during a sandstorm. Shipping experts also suggested human error may have caused the behemoth to shift sideways, lodging both the bow and stern in the sandy banks on either side of the canal.",
            "The Ever Given is one of the largest container ships in existence, nearly as long as the Empire State Building is tall. It’s loaded with some 18,000 containers and weighs 220,000 tons, and dislodging it from both banks represented a complex and fraught engineering challenge.",
            "The severing of the shipping artery had near-immediate impacts on global trade. Syria said it would begin rationing the use of fuel until the canal was once again open and analysts estimated the blockage was holding up almost $10 billion in trade every day, The New York Times reported.",
            "Early Monday, the chairman of the Suez Canal Authority announced the 1,300-foot ship had been dislodged from the eastern bank of the canal and tug boats were shepherding it back on course.",

            "Traffic could begin coursing through the Suez Canal soon, although there are currently more than 450 ships stuck in a logjam and it’s unclear how long it will take to clear the backlog."

        "articleContent": [
            "As President Joe Biden gears up to press Congress for a $3 trillion overhaul of the nation’s infrastructure, Republicans have started trying to narrow the package’s ambitions to just roads, bridges and ports.",
            "On Monday, Biden will face some new pressure on the package, but from the left. Much of the Congressional Progressive Caucus is set to unveil the THRIVE Act, which would provide $10 trillion in federal infrastructure spending over the next decade, including massive investments in renewable energy, zero-emissions buildings and economic development in some of the worst-polluted parts of the country.",
            "“The THRIVE Act is the agenda that establishes the pillars for economic renewal in our country,” Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), a lead sponsor of the Senate version of the bill, told HuffPost by phone. “This bill lays out a plan for massive job creation within the United States, so that a younger generation of Americans can think of these jobs as careers.”",
            "It seems likely that Democrats will be able to get some level of infrastructure through both chambers; even Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), the most conservative Democrat in the Senate and a powerful swing vote, has signaled willingness to pass an infrastructure bill without Republican support. And Biden appears to be warming to calls to reform or scrap the filibuster, the Senate procedure requiring a 60-vote majority to pass most legislation. But the THRIVE Act ― a version of which former Rep. Deb Haaland (D-N.M.), who now serves as Biden’s interior secretary, introduced last year ― offers a broad progressive consensus on what an ambitious package should include.",
            "The bill is light on specifics but sets out a general framework for directing at least $1 trillion per year over the next decade to rapidly weaning the United States off fossil fuels and replacing corroded water systems, increasing benefits for home care workers, remediating toxic industrial sites, and propping up new, localized food producers, among other things. The bill lays out an expansive vision of how to slash the nation’s planet-heating emissions in half and balance the racial and regional gaps in wealth and health, issues that have animated the party’s base and inflected once-sleepy debates over roads and rail funding with the energy of a new-wave civil rights movement.",
            "The package would create more than 15.5 million jobs per year and virtually end unemployment, according to an analysis by the University of Massachusetts’ Political Economy Research Institute. The Sierra Club-commissioned report examines what’s called the “Transform, Heal and Renew by Investing in a Vibrant Economy” agenda, which shares the legislation’s acronym. The Green New Deal Network ― a newly formed coalition of green groups, environmental justice advocates and the powerful Service Employees International Union, which represents more than 1 million workers ― helped shape the bill.",
            "“The people that were the glue that held this society together, that held American together for the last year, were the people one year ago we didn’t think were worth paying $15 an hour,” Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.), the bill’s lead sponsor in the House, told HuffPost. “Coming out of COVID, people are seeing how much people are hurting, where the fractures are, and this is an opportunity we need to take advantage of.”",
            "The bill earmarks 50% of spending for the neighborhoods, towns and regions that have borne the brunt of the fossil-fuel economy’s cruelties ― from the Black Americans who live near Louisiana’s petrochemical corridor and suffer rates of cancer 95% higher than the rest of the country to the struggling Appalachian coal communities now preyed on by natural gas goliaths.",
            "On Friday evening, lawmakers were still working out the exact language, but the bill is expected to set up paid committees that would include representatives of those communities to oversee where the money goes. It also mandates that the federal government respect the sovereignty of Indigenous tribes.",
            "The bill would establish a goal of 100% zero-carbon electricity by 2035, zero emissions from new buildings by 2025 and extending clean public transit options to the majority of Americans by 2030, and it would mandate Congress direct much of its spending toward those aims.",
            "The White House’s infrastructure package is potentially less ambitious on the climate front, allotting just $400 billion for measures like green transit and research and development, according to The Washington Post. If that plan is carried out within just the next three to four years, it would essentially amount to about $1 trillion per year. If the administration instead doles it out over a decade, as a source familiar with the White House’s plans told HuffPost is likely, it would amount to roughly one-third of the spending and jobs progressives are demanding.",
            "As Republicans stand a good chance of reclaiming one or both chambers of Congress in the 2022 midterm elections, progressives want a package that enshrines investments beyond Biden’s first term. As shown by the failed GOP efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act while President Donald Trump was in office, it’s challenging to repeal popular legislation even with control of Congress and the White House.",
            "“This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity, and there may not be an opportunity to try again in two years,” said Kaniela Ing, the climate justice campaign director for the nonprofit People’s Action Network. “We have no choice but to plan ahead.”",
            "Various pieces of climate legislation Democrats introduced over the past month offer details of what could make it into a final version of the THRIVE Act, should it gain steam. The bill itself calls for approving the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, or PRO Act, the legislation that would mark the biggest expansion of union organizing rights in the post-war period.",
            "It could also include the $500 billion package that Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) unveiled this month for climate-friendly transit and the 100% clean energy standard that Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) introduced. And it could include Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s $454 billion electric car proposal and the $1.1 trillion plan for greener public schools that Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.) endorsed this month.",
            "Schumer’s office did not return a request for comment on Friday.",
            "At his first general press conference since taking office, Biden touched on various points captured in the THRIVE Act, calling for giving oil and gas workers jobs capping thousands of abandoned wells and for rebuilding public schools where corroding pipes make it so “the kids can’t drink the water out of the fountain.”",
            "“Global warming’s already done significant damage,” Biden said. “It’s going to get worse before it gets better.”",
            "The THRIVE Act includes general language aimed at blocking funding from fossil fuel projects and bars money from going to geoengineering, the as-yet mostly theoretical efforts to artificially cool the planet, which federal scientists are starting to consider studying. Such provisions, while popular with activists who dub technology to capture carbon emissions or to suck CO₂ out of the atmosphere “false solutions,” could prove controversial with scientists and policy experts who say that both are needed.",
            "Markey said the bill was meant to be “deliberately” general to avoid favoring any particular zero-carbon technologies. For example, it skirts the issue of whether money would go to propping up nuclear power plants, a divisive issue among Democrats that Markey similarly left out of the Green New Deal resolution he introduced in January 2019.",
            "“Going forward, I think we should cast an arched eyebrow to easy and false solutions,” he said. “There’s still a lot of technological unknowns in those efforts, and we know renewables are effective and becoming increasingly cheaper.”",
            "The proposal increases pressure on the White House to pack its infrastructure plans into one major piece of legislation rather than splitting priorities among smaller bills.",
            "“The infrastructure package should also be done in one bill, not two,” Alexandra Rojas, executive director of the left-leaning campaign group Justice Democrats, said in a statement. “Republicans have made it clear that they have no intention of working with the President on an infrastructure package. Splitting the bill up in the hopes of getting 60 votes for the first bill will simply waste precious time.”"

            "“I’m going to lose the script and I’m going to reflect on the recurring feeling I have of impending doom,” Dr. Rochelle Walensky said at a White House coronavirus press briefing. “We have so much to look forward to, so much promise and potential of where we are, and so much reason for hope. But right now I’m scared.”",
            "Walensky reported a 10% average increase in COVID-19 cases across the country over the last seven days compared to the same prior period. Deaths have also started to increase by 2.6% and hospitalizations by 4.2%.",
            "“When we see that uptick in cases, what we’ve seen before is that things really have a tendency to surge and surge big,” she said. She also likened the nation’s trajectory to surges being seen in Europe following a similar stagnation of cases.",
            "Walensky partially blamed the case rise on increasing travel and certain regions opening up too quickly. She also suggested that a new variant of the virus, B117, may be contributing to the rise since it is more transmissible.",
            "She urged Americans to “just hold on a little longer” and to get vaccinated as soon as they can.",

            "She covered her racks in foil and popped them in a bath tub filled with hot water and a dishwasher tablet or two, leaving it all to soak for two hours. “A chemical reaction between the foil and dishwashing tablet leaves trays sparkling,” she wrote.",
            "Many have tried the hack, with one saying: “I followed this and it worked so well on my racks. They’re like brand new.”",

            "If your mattress is about 100 years old (and smells like it, too), a hack proving to be increasingly popular is from Tiktok user @lesliezimmerman8 – and it’s one Mrs. Hinch uses, too.

Natalie Armstrong, sleep expert at bed and mattress brand Sealy UK, previously told Ideal Home lots of modern mattresses, such as those that feature Purotex, naturally create a clean and healthy sleeping environment by releasing friendly bacteria into the mattress.",

Next, do another hot wash with baking soda sprinkled across your trays and the bottom part of the dishwasher – and you’re good to go.",

            "The top 1% of the highest-earning American households are hiding 21% of their income from the Internal Revenue Service, costing the nation some $175 billion a year in revenue, according to the latest estimation on the cost of tax evasion.",
            "That 1% accounts for more than a third of all unpaid taxes, concluded the study released this month by the Bureau of Economic Research, which included economists from the IRS and several universities.",
            "That’s significantly more than the IRS had previously estimated. Researchers concluded that the estimate is “conservative.”",
            "The money is hidden through a variety of strategies, including stashing billions of dollars in offshore accounts.",
            "The problem stems from a combination of drastic cuts to the IRS budgets, reducing manpower to sniff out cheats, matched against increasingly sophisticated tax dodging that’s more difficult to trace, according to the study. Total funding for the IRS has been cut by close to 20% and the number of staff has been shaved 30% since 2010.",
            "Beefing up budgets and staff alone, as the Biden administration plans to do, could increase tax revenue by over $1 trillion over a decade, The Wall Street Journal reported. IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig has estimated that each dollar spent on tax enforcement could bring in $5 to $7 in revenue.",
            "The percentage of income tax evasion generally increases with the income category, the study found. Taxpayers in the bottom half of income categories evade taxes on around 7% of their income. Taxpayers in the top fifth evade taxes on 10% of their income, with the richest 5% avoiding taxes on at least 20% of income.",
            "The average annual income of the top 1% of earners is approximately $1.7 million. They collect some 20% of the money earned annually in the nation, according to the Pew Research Center.",
            "Even as high earners are dodging taxes, IRS audits of the wealthy have plunged, another recent study has found. Audits of those reporting incomes over $1 million fell from nearly 50,000 in 2012 to just over 11,000 last year — even as the number of millionaires skyrocketed.",
            "“The IRS needs a lot more resources from Congress,” Daniel Reck, a lead author of the study, told The Washington Post. The agency should “invest in more comprehensive examination strategies, involving audits of individuals, pass-through businesses, and other private entities,” such as charities and trusts, he added.",
            "The IRS “needs to hire and train large numbers of experts to conduct those more comprehensive examinations. They can absolutely do all of this, but budget cuts have severely curtailed their ability to do it,” according to Reck.\n\nPresident Joe Biden is considering a tax hike for corporations and those earning more than $400,000 a year to fund an infrastructure and jobs package."

            "“I literally took 10 steps away and turned around, two ravens came down and instantly grabbed one out of the package, ripped it off and flew off with it,” Lewallen said.",
            "Lewallen said the piece of meat was about 4-by-7 inches (10-by-18 centimeters) large — a sizable meal for a sizable bird.",

            "And once he got back home, he noticed that one of the ravens had taken a poke at another rib but did not rob it.",
            "“I cut that meat out and started marinating it and my wife said, ‘That’s gross, we should take it back,’ ” Lewallen said. “Costco actually took it back even after we had started marinating them and gave us a full refund.”",
            "Additional raven thief sightings have emerged on social media.",
            "“My parents were minding their business after a shop and made it home with one less steak!” Kimberly Waller wrote on Facebook. “The bird snatched it right out of the pack in the parking lot.”",
            "Anchorage resident Tamara Josey replied to Waller’s post and referred to the ravens as “calculating.” She said ravens hovered her in an attempt to steal her groceries.",
            "“I had two ravens, one that was on the car next to me and he kept squawking really loud,” Josey said. “He would sit on the car and stare at me, then hop next to the bed of the truck on the other side, and he kept going back and forth. The other raven was on the ground. He kept trying to pull — I had those little mini-melons you have in the mesh baggies — he kept trying to grab the netting and pull my melons off the cart.”",
            "A raven started to fly in a circle around Josey until she got them to scram.",
            "“He was waiting for another opportunity to grab the melons off the cart, but they never were deterred,” she said. “They just stayed posted, waiting for their next opportunity to steal something out of my cart.”",
            "“They are very dedicated to their mission,” she added.",
            "A manager at an Anchorage Costco declined to comment to the newspaper about the raven thieves.",
            "The Anchorage Audubon Society tallies the raven population every December. The group reported 923 common ravens in 2018, 621 in 2019 and 750 birds in 2020.",
            "Rick Sinnott, a former wildlife biologist with the state Department of Fish and Game, said hundreds of ravens fly to Anchorage in the winter for food. After winter turns to spring, most of the ravens leave, Sinnott said.",
            "But before they do, the ravens stick around to pluck assorted meats, fruits and vegetables.",
            "“For years, decades, they’ve watched people in parking lots of grocery stores with all this food,” Sinnott said. “They know what a piece of fruit looks like in a grocery cart because they’ve seen it on the ground or seen it in a garbage can.”"

            "Rev. Wilhelmus Tulak, a priest at the church, said he had just finished celebrating Palm Sunday Mass when a loud bang shocked his congregation. He said the blast went off at about 10:30 a.m. as a first batch of churchgoers was walking out of the church and another group was coming in.",
            "He said security guards at the church were suspicious of two men on a motorcycle who wanted to enter the building and when they went to confront them, one of the men detonated his explosives.",
            "Police later said both attackers were killed instantly and evidence collected at the scene indicated one of the two was a woman. The wounded included four guards and several churchgoers, police said.",
            "The attack a week before Easter in the world’s most populous Muslim-majority nation came as the country was on high alert following December’s arrest of the leader of the Southeast Asian militant group, Jemaah Islamiyah, which has been designated a terror group by many nations.",
            "Indonesia has been battling militants since bombings on the resort island of Bali in 2002 killed 202 people, mostly foreign tourists. Attacks aimed at foreigners have been largely replaced in recent years by smaller, less deadly strikes targeting the government, police and anti-terrorism forces and people militants consider as infidels.",
            "President Joko Widodo condemned Sunday’s attack and said it has nothing to do with any religion as all religions would not tolerate any kind of terrorism.",
            "“I call on people to remain calm while worshipping because the state guarantees you can worship without fear,” Widodo said in a televised address.",
            "He offered his prayers to those injured and said the government would cover all costs of medical treatment. He said he had ordered the national police chief to investigate the attack and crack down on any militant network that may be involved.",
            "At the end of Palm Sunday Mass in St. Peter’s Basilica, which opened Holy Week ceremonies at the Vatican, Pope Francis invited prayers for the victims of violence. He cited in particular “those of the attack that took place this morning in Indonesia, in front of the Cathedral of Makassar.”",
            "Indonesia’s National Police spokesperson Argo Yuwono told a news conference in the capital, Jakarta, that police were still trying to identify the two attackers on the motorbike and whether they were linked to a local affiliate of the banned Jemaah Islamiyah network or were acting independently.",
            "Indonesian forces in December arrested the group’s leader Aris Sumarsono, also known as Zulkarnaen. Over the past month the country’s counterterrorism squad has arrested about 64 suspects, including 19 in Makassar, following a tipoff about possible attacks against police and places of worship.",
            "While Jemaah Islamiyah has been weakened over the past decade by a sustained crackdown, in recent years a new threat has emerged in militants who fought with the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria and returned to Indonesia or those inspired by the group’s attacks abroad.",
            "Indonesia’s last major attack was in May 2018, when two families carried out a series of suicide bombings on churches in the second-largest city of Surabaya, killing a dozen people including two young girls whose parents had involved them in one of the attacks. Police said the father was the leader of a local affiliate of the Islamic State group known as Jemaah Anshorut Daulah.",

I think we’ve got to move on because we’ve got limited time.”",

            "LONDON (AP) — AstraZeneca’s release Monday of encouraging data about its coronavirus vaccine from its U.S. trial raised hopes that the drug company could bury doubts about the shot and put a troubled rollout behind it. But hours later, U.S. officials issued an unusual statement expressing concerns the company had included “outdated information” from its study and that it may have provided “an incomplete view of the efficacy data.”",
            "A company spokesman said Tuesday it was “looking into it.”",
            "Even before this latest stumble, AstraZeneca had made missteps in reporting data and faced a blood clot scare. Health officials worried that those past issues could cause lasting harm to the shot that is key to global efforts to stop the pandemic and undermine vaccine confidence more broadly.",
            "“The way they handled their data early on, AstraZeneca basically shot themselves in the foot,” Julian Tang, a virologist at the University of Leicester, said even before the latest issue arose. “Even though the new study confirms what we previously thought about the vaccine’s efficacy, people may have lingering doubts,” he said. “Unfortunately, that might mean more people will die of COVID.”",
            "Britain was the first to authorize the vaccine in December, based on partial results from the U.K., Brazil and South Africa. Those results suggested the shot was about 70% effective but were clouded by a manufacturing mistake the researchers didn’t immediately acknowledge. Insufficient data about how well the vaccine protected older people also led some countries including Germany and France to initially restrict its use to younger populations before reversing course.",
            "In the U.S., officials suspended AstraZeneca’s study in 30,000 Americans for an unusual six weeks last fall, as frustrated regulators sought details about neurological problems reported in Britain; ultimately there was no evidence the vaccine was to blame.",
            "But on Monday, the company announced that the shot was about 79% effective in stopping symptomatic COVID-19 — data that Mene Pangalos, head of AstraZeneca’s research and development in biopharmaceuticals, called “much cleaner” than previous releases.",
            "He expressed hope it “puts to bed any doubts.”",
            "Instead, in the early hours of Tuesday, the Data and Safety Monitoring Board experts from the U.S. National Institutes of Health said they were concerned by the information released.",
            "“We urge the company to work with the DSMB to review the efficacy data and ensure the most accurate, up-to-date efficacy data be made public as quickly as possible,” it said.",
            "Even if the company clears up the misunderstanding — and it’s not yet clear what the U.S. experts are asking for exactly — it could have a lasting impact.",
            "Tang noted the decades-old controversy over the measles vaccine as a cautionary tale.",
            "“There was absolutely no evidence to prove the (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine caused autism,” he said. But despite the retraction of the paper that made that claim, Tang said some people still worry about the vaccine. He said AstraZeneca’s issues may be even tougher to overcome “because every week it seems like there’s some new concern.”",
            "Last week, more than a dozen countries temporarily halted their use of the AstraZeneca shot, after reports of rare blood clots in some people who received it. The European Medicines Agency concluded the shot was not responsible, but even though its investigation was standard procedure when unusual side effects are detected, the process inadvertently drew more unwelcome attention to the company.",
            "In Norway, a top official warned on Monday it might not be able to resume its use of the AstraZeneca vaccine because so many people were rejecting it.",
            "“People clearly say that they do not want the AstraZeneca vaccine,” Marte Kvittum Tangen, who heads a Norwegian doctors’ association, told broadcaster NRK.",
            "Last week in Bucharest, Romania, vaccination coordinator Valeriu Gheorghita said 33,000 AstraZeneca immunization appointments had been canceled in 24 hours and that about a third of the 10,000 people scheduled to receive the vaccine did not show up. In Belgrade, Serbia, a sprawling exhibition center set up for people to get the AstraZeneca vaccine was mostly deserted on Monday.",
            "“This is unfortunately more about perception than it is the science,” said Dr. Bharat Pankhania, an infectious diseases specialist at Britain’s University of Exeter.",
            "“We have now seen, on several parameters, that the AstraZeneca vaccine provides protection and is safe,” he said. “But the narrative for the public has not been as clear,” he said, criticizing politicians for undermining confidence in the vaccine without evidence.",
            "France is a prime example of the confusion.",
            "French President Emmanuel Macron initially suggested the vaccine wasn’t effective for older people, before backtracking. But then France only authorized AstraZeneca’s vaccine for use in adults 65 and under, citing a lack of data. Then the government changed its mind, based on new data, and said it’s fine for all adults and started singing its praises. Then came the blood clot reports and the government suspended use of the vaccine all together. When France restarted AstraZeneca, it for anyone under 55.",
            "The whiplash-inducing messages come at a time when France — like much of continental Europe — is seeing a spike in cases that is close to overwhelming its hospitals and prompting threats of new lockdowns.",
            "Vaccine rollouts have also been slow in many European Union countries, as compared to those in Britain and the United States. The European Commission has often blamed AstraZeneca for troubles with the vaccination drive, expressing outrage over repeated delayed deliveries — and threatening to ban exports of vaccines outside the bloc. But messy logistics have also played a role.",
            "The tepid support for the AstraZeneca vaccine in Europe stands in contrast to the position of governments in developing countries, which are desperate for supplies.",
            "Dr. Bruce Aylward, a senior adviser at the World Health Organization, said the U.N. agency has a long list of countries “very keen” to get the shot as soon as possible. “We simply cannot get enough of it,” he said.",
            "But some experts have worried that the skepticism in Europe could eventually cast a pall over the vaccine worldwide. They suggested one measure that could reassure a jittery public about the shot: a green light from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.",
            "“If the U.S. regulator looks at this data and authorizes AstraZeneca, that will carry a lot of weight,” said Jimmy Whitworth, a professor of international public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.",
            "AstraZeneca said it would be submitting its data to the FDA within weeks.",
            "At a vaccination center in Lisbon, 68-year-old Rui Manuel Martins dismissed any concerns about the AstraZeneca shot, saying millions had been immunized with very few ill effects.",
            "“There’s always some cases of people rejecting any medications,” he said before receiving his first dose. “It’s better to be vaccinated rather than not.”",

            "COX’S BAZAR, Bangladesh (AP) — A devastating fire raced through a sprawling Rohingya refugee camp in southern Bangladesh on Monday, destroying hundreds of shelters and leaving thousands homeless, officials and witnesses said.",
            "The fire at Balukhali camp in Cox’s Bazar district broke out in the late afternoon and spread quickly through at least four blocks, said Mohammad Shamsud Douza, additional commissioner of the government’s Refugee, Relief and Repatriation Commission. He said at least four units of firefighters were struggling to control the blaze due to its rapid spread.",
            "Louise Donovan, a spokeswoman for the U.N. refugee agency, said in an email that fire services, rescue and response teams and volunteers were at the scene.",
            "“So far the fire has affected shelters, health centers, distribution points and other facilities. Volunteers are supporting those affected,” she said.",
            "No casualties were immediately reported, but deaths and injuries were feared. No details on the missing could be confirmed. Two Rohingya refugees told The Associated Press at the scene that the fire had spread very quickly and continued to rage into the night Monday.",
            "Several videos posted on social media showed clouds of smoke billowing from the camp.",
            "Bangladesh has sheltered more than a million Rohingya Muslims, the vast majority having fled Myanmar in 2017 in a major crackdown by Myanmar’s military. The U.N. has said the crackdown had a genocidal intent, a charge Myanmar rejects.",
            "Bangladesh has hosted the refugees in crowded refugee camps and is eager to begin sending them back to Buddhist-majority Myanmar. Several attempts at repatriation under a joint agreement failed because the Rohingya refused to go, fearing more violence in a country that denies them basic rights including citizenship.",
            "In January, another fire destroyed hundreds of shanty-like homes in the camp, leaving thousands without shelter."

            "JERUSALEM (AP) — Uncertainty hovered over the outcome of Israel’s parliamentary election Wednesday, with both Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and sworn political rivals determined to depose him apparently lacking a clear path to a governing coalition.",
            "Deadlock in the 120-seat parliament was a real possibility a day after the election, which had been dominated by Netanyahu’s polarizing leadership.",
            "With about 90% of the vote counted by Wednesday morning, Netanyahu’s Likud party and its ultra-Orthodox and far-right allies fell short of a 61-seat majority — even if the Yamina party of Netanyahu ally-turned-critic Naftali Bennett were to join a Netanyahu-led government. Bennett has refused to endorse either side.",
            "At the same time, a small Arab party emerged as a potential kingmaker on Wednesday morning after the latest count indicated it would cross the threshold to get into parliament. Like Bennett, the head of the Ra’am party, Mansour Abbas, has not ruled out joining either camp.",
            "“We’re not in anyone’s pocket,” he told the 103 FM radio station.",
            "“We’re willing to have contact with both of the sides with anyone who is trying to form a government and sees himself as a future prime minister,” Abbas added, reflecting the long road of negotiations ahead. “If there’s an offer we will sit, we will talk.”",
            "With key players on both sides ruling out an alliance with Abbas, a fifth election also remained a possibility if neither camp can form a coalition. In that case, Netanyahu would remain a caretaker prime minister while facing a corruption trial and possible confrontation with U.S. President Joe Biden over Iran.",
            "The final tally of the votes cast at regular polling stations was near complete on Wednesday, Israeli media said. But even then, much could still change. The elections commission was still counting about 450,000 absentee ballots from voters who cast them outside their home polling place.",
            "The initial results showed the country as deeply divided as ever, with an array of small sectarian parties dominating the parliament.",
            "The results also signaled a continuing shift of the Israeli electorate toward the right wing, which supports West Bank settlements and opposes concessions in peace talks with the Palestinians. That trend was highlighted by the strong showing of an ultranationalist anti-Arab religious party.",
            "After three previous inconclusive elections, Netanyahu had been hoping for a decisive victory that would allow him to form a government with his traditional ultra-Orthodox and hard-line nationalist allies and seek immunity from corruption charges.",
            "In an address to supporters early Wednesday, a subdued Netanyahu boasted of a “great achievement” but stopped short of declaring victory. Instead, he appeared to reach out to his opponents and called for formation of a “stable government” that would avoid another election.",
            "“We must not under any circumstances drag the state of Israel to new elections, to a fifth election,” he said. “We must form a stable government now.”",
            "Bennett could play an outsized role. He shares Netanyahu’s hard-line nationalist ideology and would seem to be more likely to ultimately join the prime minister. But Bennett has not ruled out joining forces with Netanyahu’s opponents.",
            "During the campaign, Netanyahu emphasized Israel’s highly successful coronavirus vaccination drive. He moved aggressively to secure enough vaccines for Israel’s 9.3 million people, and in three months the country has inoculated some 80% of its adult population. That has enabled the government to open restaurants, stores and the airport just in time for election day.",
            "He also tried to portray himself as a global statesman, pointing to the four diplomatic accords he reached with Arab countries last year. Those agreements were brokered by his close ally, then-President Donald Trump.",
            "Netanyahu’s opponents say the prime minister bungled many other aspects of the pandemic, particularly by allowing his ultra-Orthodox allies to ignore lockdown rules and fuel a high infection rate for much of the year.",
            "Over 6,000 Israelis have died from COVID-19, and the economy continues to struggle with double-digit unemployment.",
            "They also point to Netanyahu’s corruption trial, saying someone who is under indictment for serious crimes is not fit to lead the country. Netanyahu has been charged with fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in a series of scandals that he dismisses as a witch hunt by a hostile media and legal system.",
            "The Biden administration has kept its distance, a contrast to Trump’s support. Netanyahu has hardly mentioned the new American president, with whom he’s clashed over how to rein in Iran’s nuclear capabilities.",
            "After the election results come in, attention will turn to the country’s figurehead president, Reuven Rivlin.",
            "He will hold a series of meetings with party leaders and then choose the one he believes has the best chance of forming a government as his prime minister-designate. That could set off weeks of horse-trading."

            "The case won’t be heard until the fall, and it’s unclear how the new administration will approach Tsarnaev’s case. The initial prosecution and decision to seek a death sentence was made by the Obama administration, in which Biden served as vice president.",

            "Tsarnaev, now 27, was convicted of all 30 charges against him, including conspiracy and use of a weapon of mass destruction and the killing of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer during the Tsarnaev brothers’ getaway attempt. The appeals court upheld all but a few of his convictions."

Fewer than 2 of every 100 U.S. taxpayers reporting an income of more than $1 million in 2020 were audited, according to the study by Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse issued Thursday.",
            "Audits fell from nearly 50,000 in 2012 to just over 11,000 last year. There were 637,000 people in the U.S. who reported a million dollars or more of annual income last year — compared with about 337,000 in 2012.",
            "The increasing number of free passes to wealthy tax cheats is further distorting a tax system that already appears shockingly unjust, especially as the nation struggles to dig itself out of the economic hole created by COVID-19.",
            "Funding cuts to the very agency that can pull in more revenue are a key part of the problem. The TRAC study blamed deep cuts in IRS staffing and budget for hamstringing its ability to audit wealthy tax cheats, letting billions of dollars in tax revenue “slip through its fingers.”",
            "“Over the past decade, Congress has imposed severe funding and staffing cuts at the Internal Revenue Service, cuts that have seriously undermined the agency’s ability to administer tax laws in a fair and effective manner,” the TRAC report said.",

            "The report, by the treasury inspector general for tax administration, concluded that the IRS should “prioritize” collecting those unpaid taxes.",
            "“With its limited resources, it is important to determine if the IRS is effectively addressing nonpayment by high-income taxpayers,” the report noted. The owed money would likely be paid with some pressure, the report concluded, because the taxes are a relatively small portion of the taxpayers’ assets.",
            "In response to the report, Senate Finance Committee chair Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) called on the IRS to again target wealthy taxpayers who are dodging their obligations.",
            "“The inspector general’s report reiterates wealthy tax cheats are stealing billions from the American people,” Wyden said in a statement. “The report notes the IRS could make significant progress in cracking down on tax cheats by focusing on those who make the most money and owe the most in unpaid tax bills.”",
            "The TRAC report also found the IRS is falling down on the job regarding corporate audits. Nearly 2 out of every 3 of the 755 biggest corporations in the nation — those with more than $20 billion in assets — weren’t audited last year. But in 2012, nearly all of those returns (93%) were audited by the IRS.",
            "The corporate audits in 2012 turned up $10 billion in unreported taxes. Far fewer audits turned up only $4.1 billion owed during fiscal year 2020, according to the TRAC report.",
            "After the Treasury Department report, the IRS defended its strategy of going after tax cheats as the most efficient, based on “robust historical datasets.”"

            "SAO PAULO (AP) — Police in Brazil are starting to employ a dictatorship-era national security law against critics of President Jair Bolsonaro, while lawyers and activists rally to provide them with legal help and accuse the government of trying to silence dissent.",
            "On Friday, demonstrators challenged police in the capital by parading with anti-Bolsonaro signs a day after four protesters were detained. They had called the president “genocidal” for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and displayed a cartoon depicting him next to a Nazi swastika. Officers took no action Friday as about 40 people protested for an hour.",
            "The national security law, which dates from 1983, near the end of the country’s military dictatorship, makes it a crime to harm the heads of the three branches of government or expose them to danger. The vague measure has recently been used to detain or investigate Bolsonaro critics.",
            "Geography teacher Katia Garcia said she showed up in front of the president’s office Friday because the arrests had inspired her.",
            "“They were jailed because the description ‘genocidal’ suits our president very well,” Garcia said, wearing a face mask and face shield. “He has contributed to our health care system collapsing, for the lack of vaccines. Police can’t silence us.”",
            "There have been previous news-making charges against prominent critics of the president, including a newspaper columnist, a political cartoonist and a popular YouTube star, but the law is increasingly being employed against ordinary citizens. Courts haven’t upheld any of the arrests so far, but lawyers are expressing alarm that the tactic is becoming commonplace.",
            "Both demonstrations in Brasilia called for Bolsonaro’s impeachment due to his administration’s alleged failings in the pandemic, which has caused almost 290,000 deaths in Brazil. The country has reported nearly 3,000 deaths each day this week.",
            "On several instances, the president has complained that he is being unfairly vilified, most recently Thursday night during a live Facebook broadcast.",
            "“They call me a dictator. I want you to point at one thing I did in two years and two months that was autocratic,” he said while complaining about a newspaper column that used the word genocidal to describe him.",
            "Brasilia police said Thursday that the four detained protesters violated the national security law “as they showed a Swastika in association to the symbol of the president of the Republic.” But Brazil’s federal police force, which decides whether cases brought by local police deserve to go ahead in national security crimes, dismissed the case and released three of the four demonstrators. One was held on an outstanding warrant from a previous case.",
            "Federal police have conducted more than 80 investigations under the security law during Bolsonaro’s first two years, and more than 10 in the first 45 days of 2021, according to the newspaper O Globo. The yearly average before the conservative leader took office was 11.",
            "The cases appear to almost entirely target Bolsonaro’s critics, human rights organizations and activists say.",
            "One case last year involved a sociologist and a businessman who paid for two billboards that insulted Bolsonaro by saying he wasn’t worth a gnawed piece of fruit. That investigation was requested by Justice Minister André Mendonça, who called it a crime against the president’s reputation. It was dismissed in October.",
            "On Friday night, unsuccessful presidential candidate Ciro Gomes said the federal police are investigating him for calling the president “a thief” in a radio interview in November. The request for the probe was signed by Bolsonaro himself, Gomes said on his social media channels.",
            "“I don’t particularly care about this act against me, but I think it is serious that Bolsonaro tries to intimidate opponents and adversaries,” the left-leaning Gomes said.",
            "On Monday, police invoked the national security law to force Felipe Neto, a popular YouTuber, to give testimony after he referred to Bolsonaro as “genocidal” in one of his broadcasts. Federal police dismissed the case two days later amid a public outcry.",
            "Neto, who was named by Time magazine lasts year as one of the world’s 100 most influential people, was also targeted in November with allegations of corrupting minors. Those charges were also dropped.",
            "“From the start, I knew that this attempt at intimidation was not aimed at scaring me. It was to scare the Brazilian people,” Neto told The Associated Press by phone.",
            "“I have means to defend myself, but most teachers, journalists and members of civil society do not,” added Neto, who this week set up a legal defense fund to help anyone who faces similar charges for criticizing Bolsonaro and needs an attorney.",
            "O Globo said in an editorial Friday that the spirit of the national security law runs counter to Brazil’s constitution in the promotion of civil liberties.",
            "“The national security law should be revoked and replaced by a more modern tool that is capable of reconciliating the protection of the rule of law and the respect to individual rights,” the newspaper said. “Among those are the full — and essential — freedom of speech.”",

            "Hassan’s inauguration comes two days after she announced the death of President John Magufuli, after he had not been seen in public for more than two weeks. Magufuli had denied that COVID-19 was a problem in Tanzania, saying that national prayer had eradicated the disease from the country. But weeks before his death, Magufuli acknowledged that the virus was a danger.",
            "A major test of Hassan’s new presidency will be how she deals with COVID-19. Under Magufuli, Tanzania, one of Africa’s most populous countries with 60 million people, made no efforts to obtain vaccines or promote the use of masks and social distancing to combat the virus. This policy of ignoring the disease endangers neighboring countries, say Africa health officials.",
            "When Magufuli was absent from view, other Tanzanian officials flatly denied that he was sick, but Hassan sought to reassure the nation, saying it was “normal” for human beings to suffer colds and other illnesses.",

            "In her first public address as president, Hassan announced 21 days of mourning for Magufuli and public holidays on March 22 and March 25, the day the late president will be buried.",
            "“It’s not a good day for me to talk to you because I have a wound in my heart,” said Hassan. “Today I have taken an oath different from the rest that I have taken in my career. Those were taken in happiness. Today I took the highest oath of office in mourning,” she said.",
            "She said that Magufuli “who always liked teaching” had prepared her for the task ahead. “Nothing shall go wrong,” she assured, urging the nation’s people to be united.",
            "“This is the time to stand together and get connected. It’s time to bury our differences, show love to one another and look forward with confidence,” she said. “It is not the time to point fingers at each other but to hold hands and move forward to build the new Tanzania that President Magufuli aspired to.”",

            "After Magufuli selected her as his running mate in 2015, Hassan became Tanzania’s first female vice president. She was the second woman to become vice president in the region since Uganda’s Specioza Naigaga Wandira who was in office from 1994 to 2003.",
            "Born in Zanzibar, Tanzania’s semi-autonomous archipelago in 1960, Hassan went to primary school and secondary school at a time when very few girls in Tanzania were getting educations as parents thought a woman’s place was that of wife and homemaker.",

She worked for a World Food Program project in Tanzania in 1992 and then attended the University of Manchester in London to earn a postgraduate diploma in economics. In 2005, she got a Master’s degree in community economic development through a joint program between the Open University of Tanzania and Southern New Hampshire University in the U.S.",
            "Hassan went into politics in 2000 when she became a member of the Zanzibar House of Representatives. In 2010 she won the Makunduchi parliamentary seat with more than 80% percent of the vote. In 2014 she was appointed a Cabinet minister and became Vice-Chairperson of the Constitutional Assembly tasked with drafting a new constitution for Tanzania where she won respect for deftly handling several challenges.",
            "As president, Hassan’s first task will be to unite the ruling party, Chama Cha Mapinduzi, behind her, said Ed Hobey-Hamsher, Senior Africa Analyst with Verisk Maplecroft risk analysts. The party has been in power since Tanzania’s independence.",
            "As a Muslim woman from Zanzibar, Hassan may find it difficult to win the support of the party’s mainland Christians, he said, warning that some entrenched leaders may develop “obstructionist strategies” against her. He said it’s likely that Hassan will start her rule by maintaining the status quo and not embarking on a significant Cabinet reshuffle.",

            "NEW YORK (AP) — The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention relaxed its social distancing guidelines for schools Friday, saying students can now sit 3 feet apart in classrooms.",
            "The revised COVID-19 recommendations represent a turn away from the 6-foot standard that has forced some schools to remove desks, stagger scheduling and take other steps to keep children away from one another.",
            "Three feet “gives school districts greater flexibility to have more students in for a prolonged period of time,” said Kevin Quinn, director of maintenance and facilities at Mundelein High School in suburban Chicago.",
            "In recent months, schools in some states have been disregarding the CDC guidelines, using 3 feet as their standard. Studies of what happened in some of them helped sway the agency, said Greta Massetti, who leads the CDC’s community interventions task force.",
            "While there is evidence of improved mental health and other benefits from in-person schooling, “we don’t really have the evidence that 6 feet is required in order to maintain low spread,” she said.",
            "Also, younger children are less likely to get seriously ill from the coronavirus and don’t seem to spread it as much as adults do, and “that allows us that confidence that that 3 feet of physical distance is safe,” Massetti said.",
            "The new guidance:",
            "— Removes recommendations for plastic shields or other barriers between desks. “We don’t have a lot of evidence of their effectiveness” in preventing transmission, Massetti said.",
            "— Advises at least 3 feet of space between desks in elementary schools, even in towns and cities where community spread is high, so long as students and teachers wear masks and take other precautions.",
            "— Says spacing can also be 3 feet in middle and high schools, so long as there’s not a high level of spread in the community. If there is, spacing should be at least 6 feet.",
            "The CDC said 6 feet of distance should still be maintained in common areas, such as school lobbies, and when masks can’t be worn, such as when eating.",
            "Also, students should continue to be spaced 6 feet apart in situations where there are a lot of people talking, cheering or singing, all of which can spread droplets containing the coronavirus. That includes chorus practice, assemblies and sports events.",
            "The CDC said teachers and other adults should stay 6 feet from one another and from students.",
            "CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said the revised recommendations are an “evidence-based roadmap to help schools reopen safely, and remain open, for in-person instruction.”",
            "“Safe in-person instruction gives our kids access to critical social and mental health services that prepare them for the future, in addition to the education they need to succeed,” she said in a statement.",
            "Last year, the CDC advised that one way for schools to operate safely was by keeping children 6 feet apart, the same standard applied to workplaces and other settings.",
            "In contrast, the World Health Organization suggested 1 meter — a little over 3 feet — was sufficient in schools. The American Academy of Pediatrics says to desks should be spaced 3 feet apart and “ideally” 6 feet.",
            "The CDC guidance was problematic for many schools that traditionally had 25, 30 or more children per classroom in closely grouped desks. Some schools adopted complicated, hybrid scheduling, that might, for example, have half a class come to school on some days and the other half on other days.",
            "The Ridley School District in suburban Philadelphia took steps like that to follow the 6-foot guideline after the CDC emphasized it last summer. But neighboring communities went with 3 feet, “and we’re not seeing the data really reflect a different spread rate,” said Lee Ann Wentzel, the district’s superintendent.",

            "TOKYO (AP) — In yet another setback for the postponed Tokyo Olympics — and another involving comments about women — games’ creative director Hiroshi Sasaki resigned on Thursday after making demeaning comments about a well-known female celebrity in Japan.",
            "The Tokyo Olympics are scheduled to open in just over four months, dogged by the coronavirus pandemic, record costs, and numerous scandals. And all of this converges as the Olympic torch relay starts next week from northeastern Japan, a risky venture with 10,000 runners set to crisscross Japan for four months.",
            "When the International Olympic Committee awarded Japan the games 7 1/2 years ago, Tokyo billed itself as “a safe pair of hands.” It has evolved into anything but that.",
            "Japanese organizers did well with initial planning and organization. But they have been buffeted by the pandemic and seem snake-bitten with the Olympics causing new problems and more expenses almost daily. Support has plummeted with various polls suggesting about 80% of Japanese want the Olympics canceled or postponed again. They cite the costs and the risks of holding the mega-event during a pandemic.",
            "“The IOC and Japanese politics are male-dominated territories,” Dr. Barbara Holthus, deputy director of the German Institute for Japanese Studies in Tokyo, told The Associated Press. “Japanese politicians have a long history of furthering gender inequalities — besides many other inequalities.”",
            "In February, the president of the organizing committee Yoshiro Mori was forced to resign after making sexist comments, saying women talk too much in meetings. Two years ago, the head of the Japanese Olympic Committee Tsunekazu Takeda was also forced to step down in a bribery scandal connected to vote-buying involving IOC members.",
            "Sasaki was in charge of the opening and closing ceremonies for the Olympics, which are scheduled to begin on July 23. He also designed the Tokyo handover ceremony at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, and arranged a one-year-to-go event in July at Tokyo’s new National Stadium.",
            "Last year he suggested to planning staff members in online “brainstorming exchanges” that well-known entertainer Naomi Watanabe could perform in the ceremony as an “Olympig.”",
            "Watanabe is a fashion icon and very famous in Japan. Sasaki’s “Olympig” reference was an obvious play on the word “Olympic.”",
            "The story was first reported by the weekly magazine Bunshun, and the corresponding controversy took off almost instantly. Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike called Sasaki’s comments “extremely embarrassing.”",
            "“When we are talking about what we deliver from Tokyo, or from Japan, we shouldn’t be sending a negative message,” Koike said Thursday.",
            "Sasaki released a statement saying he was stepping down. He said he had also called Seiko Hashimoto, the president of the organizing committee, and tendered his resignation.",
            "“For Ms. Naomi Watanabe, my idea and comments are a big insult. And it is unforgivable,” Sasaki said. “I offer my deepest regrets and apologize from the depth of my heart to her, and those who may have been offended by this.”",
            "“It is truly regrettable, and I apologize from the bottom of my heart,”",
            "Hashimoto said in a Thursday news conference that she had accepted his resignation. She said a replacement would come quickly, and also indicated she had tried to persuade him to stay.",
            "“I did feel that way but he explained, and his intention was very strong,” Hashimoto said. “That is how I felt. For those reasons I decided to accept his resignation.”",
            "Hashimoto also said she talked with IOC member John Coates, who oversees preparations for Tokyo.",
            "“The IOC also received the (magazine) article and they were quite concerned,” Hashimoto said.",
            "Hashimoto, who has appeared in seven Olympics and won a bronze medal in 1992, took over a month ago when Mori made similar sexist comments and was forced out. Hashimoto has acted quickly and appointed 12 women to the organizing committee’s executive board, increasing female membership to 42%. It had been 20%.",
            "Sasaki formerly worked for the giant Japanese advertising company Dentsu Inc., which has been a key supporter of these Olympics. It is the official marketing partner and has helped to raise a record of $3.5 billion in local sponsorship, almost three times as much as any previous Olympics.",
            "The torch relay for the Olympics kicks off next week from northeastern Japan and will be a severe test with 10,000 runners crisscrossing Japan for four months, heading to the opening ceremony and trying to avoid spreading COVID-19. Japan has controlled the virus better than most countries and has attributed about 8,700 deaths to the virus.",
            "Organizers and the IOC insist the Olympics will go forward during the pandemic with 11,000 Olympic and 4,400 Paralympic athletes entering Japan. Official costs for Tokyo are $15.4 billion but several government audits show the real cost might be twice that much.",
            "A University of Oxford study says Tokyo is the most expensive Olympics on record."

            "Asian Americans were already worn down by a year of pandemic-fueled racist attacks when a white gunman was charged with attacking three Atlanta-area massage parlors and killing eight people, most of them Asian women.",
            "Hundreds of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders turned to social media to air their anger, sadness, fear and hopelessness. The hashtag #StopAsianHate was a top trending topic on Twitter hours after the shootings that happened Tuesday evening.",
            "“I think the reason why people are feeling so hopeless is because Asian Americans have been ringing the bell on this issue for so long ... We’ve been raising the red flag,” said Aisha Yaqoob Mahmood, executive director of the Atlanta-based Asian American Advocacy Fund, which does political and advocacy work across Georgia.",
            "Many were also outraged that the suspect, 21-year-old Robert Aaron Long, was not immediately charged with hate crimes. Authorities said Long told police the attack was not racially motivated, and he claimed that he targeted the spas because of a “sex addiction.” Six of the seven slain women were identified as Asian.",
            "Law enforcement needs “some training understanding what a hate crime is. This man identified targets owned by Asians,” said Margaret Huang, president and CEO of the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups. The gunman “was very clearly going after a targeted group of people.”",
            "Being Asian American herself, Huang said the shootings felt personal. She is worried that not classifying the attack as a hate crime will “absolutely discourage others from coming forward and seeking help.”",
            "She also cringed at the comments of a sheriff’s captain who said of the gunman, “It was a really bad day for him.”",
            "The remark “appeared to be trying to explain and justify” the suspect’s actions. “Hopefully it was a misstatement,” Huang said.",
            "Mahmood said Asian American business owners in the Atlanta area were already fearful because of incidents like graffiti and break-ins. The shootings will raise that worry to new heights.",
            "“A lot of Asian American business owners in the beauty parlor industry and food service — these are often the most visible front-line faces in the community,” Mahmood said.",

            "As much despair as Asian Americans feel, Seshadri said, the shootings also mark a flashpoint.",
            "“Our folks are pissed off and ready to fight,” Seshadri said. “The way we get through this is together by organizing our people and feeling solidarity.”",
            "Arizona Asian Chamber of Commerce CEO Vicente Reid is planning a vigil next week in the Phoenix suburb of Mesa, which has a high concentration of Asian American-owned shops and restaurants. He thinks the slayings have galvanized the local community to go beyond vigils.",
            "“I think there is this whole outlet of this younger generation who’s passionate and has the energy. They just need someone to step up and lead them,” Reid said.",
            "For the past several weeks, Asian Americans have questioned how to deal with a recent wave of assaults — many on the elderly — that have coincided with the pandemic. The virus was first identified in China, and former President Donald Trump and others have used racial terms to describe it.",
            "Numerous Asian American organizations say Trump’s rhetoric has emboldened people to express anti-Asian or anti-immigrant views. Nearly 3,800 incidents have been reported to Stop AAPI Hate, a California-based reporting center for Asian American Pacific Islanders, and its partner groups, since March 2020. Nationally, women reported hate crimes 2.3 times more than men.",
            "Following the release Wednesday of a report showing a surge in white supremacist propaganda in 2020, the Anti-Defamation League told The Associated Press that a significant amount of the propaganda included anti-immigrant rhetoric.",
            "The anti-hate group said 10% of propaganda descriptions in its inventory contained negative references to immigration, multiculturalism or diversity. The 522 physical flyers, stickers or banners included the use of words such as “invasion, deport, disease, illegal, infection and virus,” the ADL said.",
            "There were also seven propaganda incidents with direct anti-China references to COVID-19.",
            "Meanwhile, Asian Americans are thankfully getting support from many non-Asian allies, Mahmood said.",

            "Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.) says biases drove Republican opposition to Rep. Deb Haaland’s (D-N.M.) confirmation as the 54th secretary of the Interior Department and that GOP colleagues are holding women of color to a different standard, an argument she will make in a speech Monday ahead of the vote.",
            "Haaland, a member of the Pueblo of Laguna tribe of New Mexico, stands to become the first Native American Cabinet secretary in American history. The final confirmation vote, scheduled for 5:30 p.m., comes after a weekslong Republican campaign to paint Haaland as a “radical” and “extreme” threat to America’s fossil fuel economy and Western “way of life.”",
            "“I think we need to be honest with ourselves about what is going on here,” Smith plans to say in a speech on the Senate floor Monday afternoon, according to prepared remarks shared with HuffPost. “Once again, a woman and a woman of color is being held to a different standard, and we need to name it. We have got to come to grips with the reality that time after time, strong women, and especially women of color, are attacked when white men with the same views are welcomed to walk through the door, unopposed.”",
            "Despite her record of bipartisanship and championing environmental causes, Haaland’s nomination proved among President Joe Biden’s most contentious. During her confirmation hearing last month, Republican Sens. Steve Daines (Mont.), John Barrasso (Wyo.) and others bankrolled by the fossil fuel industry repeatedly attacked her for her past statements opposing oil and gas leasing on federal lands and her support for the Green New Deal, a progressive set of guiding principles to rein in planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.",
            "Daines has labeled Haaland a “far-left ideologue” with a record of hostility toward extractive industries. And in a floor speech last week, Barrasso said Haaland’s “policy views and lack of substantive answers during her nomination hearing disqualify her for this job.”",
            "Notably, Daines and Barrasso voiced no concern when President Donald Trump put William Perry Pendley, a conservative lawyer with extreme anti-environmental views and a history of lobbying for the sale of federal lands and of ridiculing Native Americans over their religious beliefs, in charge of the Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Land Management. The two GOP senators also recently voted to confirm Biden’s Agricultural Secretary Tom Vilsack and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who share Biden and Haaland’s views about the need for aggressive action to rein in climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions.",
            "Smith will not call out Republican colleagues by name, according to her prepared remarks. But she’ll leave no doubt about who she feels has treated Haaland unfairly.",
            "“One Republican senator I serve with on the Indian Affairs Committee labeled Haaland ’a hardline ideologue with radical views,’” she plans to say, referring to Daines. “This from a person who spent months promoting the false and widely debunked conspiracy theories about voter fraud in the last election.”",
            "“Another Republican senator called Rep. Haaland ‘a socialist, left-of-Lenin, whack job,’” Smith will add, referring to comments from Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.). “Later, he said he meant to call her merely an ‘extremist.’”",
            "“At their worst, these attempts to portray Rep. Haaland as extreme and unqualified to lead show how much work we still have to do to reckon with our country’s history of disparaging, disrespecting and erasing Native people, and how this tragic history is reflected in the biases on exhibit during Representative Haaland’s confirmation,” Smith will say. “This is so clear when we see that so few Republicans could even acknowledge the historic nature of Rep. Haaland’s nomination, choosing instead to focus on hostile questions about her tweets or whether she understands the law.”",
            "Smith plans to defend Haaland as a “strong, capable, competent leader” who will be a steward of America’s public lands and empower Indigenous communities. And she will highlight Haaland’s bipartisan record; in 2019, Haaland introduced more bipartisan bills than any other House freshman.",
            "“If that’s what a hardline ideologue looks like, may we all aspire to model ourselves on Rep. Haaland,” she’ll say.",
            "Smith won’t be the first to question what’s really fueling such fierce Republican opposition to Haaland’s nomination. In a recent opinion piece in USA Today, former Democratic Sens. Mark Udall (Colo.) and Tom Udall (N.M.) wrote that “the exceptional criticism of Rep. Haaland and the threatened holds on her nomination must be motivated by something other than her record.”"

            "Police in Georgia arrested Robert Aaron Long, 21, on Tuesday after he allegedly opened fire at three massage spas and killed eight people, including six women of Asian descent.",
            "The murders sent a chilling message to Asian Americans across the country who have been enduring heightened race-based violence, particularly since the COVID-19 pandemic began. There were nearly 4,000 incidents of anti-Asian racism reported in the last year, and many believe Tuesday’s shootings are just the most violent and disturbing recent example of hate crimes targeting this community.",
            "But law enforcement officials insisted Wednesday that it was “too early” to determine whether the shootings were racially motivated, and said Long had told investigators he targeted the spas in order to “take out” the “temptation” from his “sexual addiction” issue.",
            "“He was pretty much fed up and kind of at the end of his rope, and yesterday was a really bad day for him, and this is what he did,” Cherokee County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson Capt. Jay Baker said Wednesday.",
            "The statement angered lawmakers, activists, celebrities and members of the Asian American and Pacific Islander community, who said that claim diminishes the role of racism and misogyny in the murders. The same officer was later found to have promoted merchandise last year that demonized the Asian community in relation to COVID-19.",
            "Yet law enforcement’s statements in Georgia only serve as a reminder of the failures of the American criminal justice system, specifically when it comes to how equipped police departments are to properly investigate crimes that stem from race-based bias and hatred. Police are often reluctant or outright refuse to link crimes to racial animus, which only further traumatizes people in the targeted community.",
            "“Law enforcement has to be able to look at ... not only tensions in their local community and outreach to those communities, but when there’s some catalytic, more broad event, whether it’s the pandemic, or perceived terror attack, or something else, to be able to reach out to those communities really in real time,” said Brian Levin, director at the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism and a professor of criminal justice at the California State University, San Bernardino.",
            "From Line Officers To Federal Agencies",
            "Georgia did not even have a functioning hate crime law until recently. Gov. Brian Kemp (R) signed the legislation into law in June 2020, weeks after armed white men pursued and shot Ahmaud Arbery, a Black man who was jogging, in what many called a modern-day lynching.",
            "The state actually had a hate crime law on the books before that, but the Georgia Supreme Court overturned it in 2004 for being “unconstitutionally vague.”",
            "The new law allows for additional penalties to be imposed in crimes motivated by a victim’s race, national origin, religion, sexual orientation or other factors. The law also mandates that members of law enforcement collect and report data on hate crimes they investigate.",
            "Before Kemp signed the law, Georgia was one of only four U.S. states without a hate crimes law. The lack of hate crime documentation and reporting in police departments in Georgia and other states means that law enforcement is likely unfamiliar with how to handle routine incidents, let alone violent ones like what took place on Tuesday.",
            "Jeannine Bell, a professor at the Indiana University Maurer School of Law, told HuffPost that it was crucial for authorities to rethink how they view hate crimes in order to understand their impact.",
            "“To think of them as special protection for minorities is just a fundamental misunderstanding of the way in which hate crime operates,” said Bell.",
            "Even if the authorities do have resources and designated departments to investigate hate crimes, oftentimes those same authorities are trained, especially in homicide cases, to look at perpetrators rather than at their motives from the very beginning of a crime. Motives are usually an afterthought.",
            "High Bar To Prosecute",
            "The Justice Department defines a federal hate crime as a crime “motivated by bias against a race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, or disability.” A hate or bias incident, however, is defined as an act of prejudice that does not involve violence, threats, or property damage and is not necessarily a crime.",
            "Law enforcement agencies across the U.S. report data on hate crimes annually, but doing so is only voluntary. That means statistics are incomplete. And state laws against hate crimes vary widely, resulting in unequal protections for similar violent crimes in different jurisdictions. Depending on the state, hate crimes can either be classified as an independent offense or used to enhance the penalty of another criminal act ― assault, murder, etc. In Georgia, vandalism to a place of worship is considered an independent offense, but under the new 2020 law, a hate crime enhancer can be added to a crime that involves biases or prejudice.",
            "While police officers can investigate whether hate was a motivator in a crime, prosecutors may not want to bring hate crime charges because of the high level of proof required.",
            "“Prosecutors have to establish beyond a reasonable doubt, that every element of a crime ... must be established unanimously [regarding] the intentional selection, or the discriminatory selection of victims, and that’s very difficult to achieve,” said Levin.",
            "When prosecutors are discouraged from bringing hate crime charges against a defendant, it sends a message to authorities down the chain, who then become unmotivated to investigate bias in a crime.",
            "“It’s not just cops who are hesitant. Judges are legit hesitant. Prosecutors are really hesitant, and they’re the individuals with the most power in these cases, and they are hesitant to charge hate crime cases,” said Bell. “So law enforcement officers are getting a signal from people in the justice system who have lots of power.”",
            "When those crimes don’t get processed as hate crimes, the domino effect continues. The lack of prosecuted crimes leads to an issue with the categorization of crimes, and subsequently, the undercount of hate crimes both at the state and federal levels.",
            "Further complicating the matter, depending on the state, an additional hate crime enhancer or charge may not significantly impact the outcome or sentencing of a case, explained Levin, especially if a perpetrator has already received a maximum sentence, leaving prosecutors less likely to pursue them.",
            "One week after his inauguration, President Joe Biden issued a memorandum denouncing racism against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the U.S. and issued guidance on how to better collect data and assist with the reporting of anti-Asian hate incidents. Despite collecting data since 1990, the FBI’s data on hate crimes remains inconsistent and largely undercounted.",
            "“Prosecutors may not be terribly interested in them because they don’t have a high offense level, but someone scrawls a slur on your home … you deserve to have the state, say ‘hey, that was the wrong thing to do, we’re gonna punish that, and we’re gonna punish it in a way that’s public and embarrassing for the person who did it,’’ said Bell.",
            "Regaining Trust In Impacted Communities",
            "Even with its challenges, both Bell and Levin agree that it is incumbent for the criminal justice system as a whole — from the FBI to the state and local police departments — to document, train, categorize and prosecute hate crime cases.",
            "That requires the parties involved to look beyond the facts of a specific case and be proactive about marginalized communities enduring incidents of hate, especially at a time where trust between minority communities and law enforcement is fragile.",
            "“It’s very important to stress that hate crimes aren’t just about minorities. Anyone who has a race can be the victim of a hate crime” said Bell.",
            "Even if a police department is not investigating whether a crime was hate-motivated, or the available facts do not satisfy the legal requirements of a hate crime, that does not automatically mean that bias played no role, which is a crucial element for a targeted community to heal.",
            "“Impacted communities want some kind of not only validation of their fears, but also a concrete understanding that the authorities are looking at possible hate crime angles,” said Levin.",
            "In this case, Levin and Bell said that the Georgia police should not rule out a hate crime, especially in the early stages of an investigation.",
            "For those in communities targeted by race-based violence, Wednesday’s press conference was reminiscent of the aftermath of the 2015 murder of three Muslim students in North Carolina. Immediately after the killings, police framed the crime as a parking dispute.",
            "Family members of the victims and activists across the country protested that narrative, which several media outlets also picked up, and said it made it harder to achieve justice for the victims. Law enforcement eventually walked back their statements, acknowledging the role of bias, and the district attorney recognized the perpetrator’s anti-Muslim, anti-religion hate. But family members said it was too little, too late, and that it downplayed the dangers of Islamophobia.",
            "Now, members of the Asian community find themselves in a similar position: mourning the deaths of those killed and while also protesting the law enforcement narrative and speaking out against both anti-Asian racism and a system that has failed vulnerable communities too many times."

            "A third person died in the northern city of Hpakant when police fired into a crowd of demonstrators, local media reported. A fourth victim, a woman, died after being shot in the head in Mandalay, the country’s second-largest city, as security forces were conducting clearance operations.",
            "In Yangon, video posted on social media showed crowds of people, some wearing hard hats and gas masks, running down a street amid sounds of gunfire. The demonstrators quickly sprayed vapor from fire extinguishers as they retreated.",
            "The use of fire extinguishers — common now in protests across Myanmar — is intended to smother tear gas and also create a vapor screen that makes it harder for police to pursue or shoot demonstrators.",
            "There were also reports of injuries from live rounds and rubber bullets in other parts of Yangon, including Insein district, where billows of black smoke could be seen after security forces reportedly set roadblocks on fire.",
            "On Saturday, the civilian leader of Myanmar’s government in hiding vowed to continue supporting a “revolution” to oust the military leaders who seized power in the Feb. 1 coup. Mahn Win Khaing Than, who was named the acting vice president by Myanmar’s ousted lawmakers and is a member of deposed leader Aung San Suu Kyi’s political party, addressed the public for the first time since the coup.",

            "At the end of the message, he flashed the three-finger salute that has become a symbol of resistance to the military rulers.",
            "Also Saturday, security forces again opened fire on demonstrators, killing four in Mandalay, two in Pyay in south-central Myanmar, and one in Twante, a suburb of Yangon. Details of all seven deaths were posted on multiple social media accounts, with some accompanied by photos of the victims.",
            "The actual death toll is likely to be higher, as police apparently seized some bodies, and some of the victims suffered serious gunshot wounds that doctors and nurses working at makeshift clinics would be hard-pressed to treat. Many hospitals are occupied by security forces, and as a result are boycotted by medical personnel and shunned by protesters.",

            "Saturday’s killings did not faze demonstrators in Yangon who crowded a downtown commercial area past the official 8 p.m. curfew to hold a mass candlelight vigil and sing about their cause. The mostly young protesters rallied at an intersection where they usually gather for daytime protests.",
            "After-dark rallies were also held in Mandalay and elsewhere.",

            "“I wish city officials would stop talking about this case so much, but at the same time I don’t find any evil intent that they were trying to tamper with this case,” Cahill said. The judge has already instructed members of the jury pool to avoid all news coverage about the case.",
            "Chauvin is charged with murder and manslaughter. Attorneys have been questioning potential jurors to settle on 12 who will deliberate and two to be alternates.",
            "Floyd, a Black man, was declared dead on May 25 after Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee against his neck for about nine minutes. Floyd’s death sparked sometimes violent protests in Minneapolis and beyond and led to a national reckoning on racial justice. Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter. At least three weeks have been set aside for jury selection.",
            "In the midst of jury selection, Minneapolis last week agreed to pay $27 million to settle a civil rights lawsuit from Floyd’s family over his death. Floyd family attorney Ben Crump called it the largest pretrial settlement ever for a civil rights claim. The settlement includes $500,000 for the south Minneapolis neighborhood that includes the 38th and Chicago intersection that has been blocked by barricades since Floyd’s death, with a massive metal sculpture and murals in his honor. The city didn’t immediately say how that money would be spent.",
            "The first potential juror questioned Monday volunteered that she had “inadvertently” heard about the $27 million settlement, and that she knew it was a record. She said she presumed it meant the city didn’t feel it would prevail in the civil case.",
            "“When I heard that I almost gasped at the amount,” she said, adding that she couldn’t promise she could disregard it. Cahill excused her and said he appreciated her honesty.",
            "The process of questioning jurors has been long and nuanced, with attorneys for both sides trying to ferret out potential jurors who may be biased. The defense is striking people who tell the court they already have strong feelings about Chauvin’s guilt. The prosecution, meanwhile, is blocking potential jurors who seem inclined to give police the benefit of the doubt.",
            "The seven jurors selected so far include five men and two women. Four of the jurors are white, one is multiracial, one is Black and one is Hispanic. The jurors range in age from their 20s to their 50s.",
            "The earliest opening statements would begin is March 29.",
            "Three other former officers face an August trial on charges of aiding and abetting second-degree murder and manslaughter."

            "“Why Meghan Quit Buckingham,” reads the headline of the issue out Saturday. The figure meant to depict Meghan responds, “Because I couldn’t breathe anymore!”",
            "The scene is pointedly evocative of the death of George Floyd, a Black man who was killed last summer by a Minneapolis police officer who kneeled on his neck. “I can’t breathe,” Floyd said repeatedly, as police refused to let him up.",
            "The provocative cartoon was Charlie Hebdo’s response to Meghan and Prince Harry’s interview with Oprah Winfrey last week, which revealed that there were conversations in the royal family before their son was born about “how dark” his skin might be.",
            "The couple didn’t reveal who made the remarks, but Winfrey later clarified that it wasn’t the queen or Prince Philip.",
            "In a statement on behalf of the queen following the interview, Buckingham Palace said that allegations of racism made by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex were “concerning” and being “taken very seriously.” Prince William told a reporter on Thursday that “we’re very much not a racist family.”",
            "Meghan also revealed in the interview that life as a royal was so isolating that she contemplated suicide.",
            "Response to the Charlie Hebdo issue was extremely varied.",
            "Many defended the magazine’s right to print the cartoon as a matter of free speech. Others bashed the magazine for attacking the queen (while some praised it for doing just that).",
            "The comparison between Meghan and Floyd did not sit well with many people: Though Markle experienced racism, she didn’t lose her life. Others saw that to be the exact point of the cartoon, arguing that Markle’s experiences aren’t comparable to Floyd’s death, yet the world seems to be far more transfixed by them.",

            "The teams behind the Perseverance’s mission worked with a Navajo engineer, Aaron Yazzie of the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, in conjunction with the Navajo Nation to develop a list of 50 terms that could be used for naming purposes, according to a NASA press release issued on Thursday.",
            "Several of the terms were inspired by the rugged terrain the Perseverance — translated in Navajo to “Ha’ahóni” — has encountered on Mars’ surface; for instance, “tséwózí bee hazhmeezh,” which can be translated as “rolling rows of pebbles, like waves.”",
            "Other potential names on the list included the Navajo words for strength (bidziil), respect (hoł nilį́), red rock (tsé łichíí), diligence (yéigo) and “amongst the sand” (séítah).",
            "Yazzie said that using the language in such a manner was a unique opportunity “to inspire Navajo youth not just through amazing scientific and engineering feats, but also through the inclusion of our language in such a meaningful way.”",

            "House Democrats’ campaign arm, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, announced Tuesday that it is ending a short-lived policy prohibiting firms that the DCCC hires or recommends to its official candidates from working for candidates challenging incumbent House Democrats in primaries.",
            "The DCCC introduced the policy, commonly known as a “blacklist,” in March 2019, following a 2018 election cycle in which two high-profile progressive challengers ousted longtime Democratic members in districts where Republicans are not competitive.",
            "The blacklist had the support of many House Democrats from safe Democratic seats who bristled at the idea of money from their dues payments going toward consulting firms that might aid primary opponents.",
            "The DCCC’s ban immediately elicited an outcry from progressives and a never-ending stream of critical press coverage as outlets pressed the party committee to answer for apparent efforts to evade the blacklist by using shell companies.",
            "“I don’t think the blanket ban ever made sense. And we’re gonna replace it with a new approach,” Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D-N.Y.), the new DCCC chairman, told Politico, which first reported the policy’s reversal.",
            "Sure enough, the questionnaire that prospective DCCC vendors must complete to apply for contracts no longer requires firms to attest that they recognize the DCCC’s prohibition on companies that work for primary challengers.",
            "Maloney takes over the DCCC’s chairmanship from Rep. Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.), who managed the unique feat of angering progressives as well as Black and Latino members of the House Democratic Caucus, who accused her of running a team that was not sufficiently diverse.",
            "Bustos was expected to expand the size of Democrats’ House majority. Instead, Democrats suffered significant losses and barely held on to their majority. (Bustos announced her departure shortly after the election.)",
            "Like Bustos, Maloney is a centrist whose foremost task is maintaining Democratic control of the House. In his successful December bid to run the DCCC, however, Maloney won support from progressives, who appreciated his professed interest in healing divisions within the Democratic caucus. He even vowed to reevaluate the consultant blacklist ― a promise on which he has now delivered.",
            "The Congressional Progressive Caucus PAC, which supports members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and left-leaning candidates running in open seats, does not endorse candidates challenging incumbents.",
            "The CPC nonetheless opposed the blacklist and welcomed news of the change.",
            "“Progressive infrastructure is essential to broadening the reach of our movement, building a stronger Democratic party, and delivering transformative change for the American people,” Reps. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) and Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), co-chairs of the PAC, said in a joint statement.",
            "Waleed Shahid, a spokesperson for Justice Democrats, a left-wing group that has played an active role in five successful House primary challenges since 2018, likewise applauded the decision as “an important victory for progressives.”",
            "But Shahid warned that it would be monitoring the DCCC’s hiring to ensure “that a formal ban isn’t simply replaced with an informal ban.”",
            "In fact, when the DCCC announced the blacklist, a senior Democratic official seeking to minimize the change told HuffPost that an informal ban on such vendors had long been in place.",
            "In practice though, the policy forced the consulting firms that conduct polling, produce advertisements and design fundraising operations to pick sides in a way that was unprecedented in recent memory.",
            "Marie Newman, an Illinois progressive who was in the midst of her second primary bid to unseat then-Rep. Dan Lipinski, a conservative Democrat, told The Intercept in April 2019 that the blacklist made it harder for her to retain consultants than in the 2018 election cycle.",
            "“This has been very expensive for my campaign — it’s cost time and money and effort and frustration, but we’re working through it,” she told The Intercept.",
            "Progressives objected to the blacklist on a number of grounds, initially focusing on the barriers it would erect for primary challengers seeking to provide voters a choice in districts where the Democratic Party is the only game in town.",
            "Beginning in 2019, Justice Democrats strictly limited its own involvement in House primaries to districts where Democrats are dominant. That way, the group’s efforts could never be construed as contributing to the election of a Republican in a competitive seat.",
            "“When over 70% of congressional districts have no competitive general election, primaries are often the only venue where voters can have a real say in our democracy,” Shahid told HuffPost on Tuesday.",
            "And while the DCCC promised to protect progressive incumbents against primary challengers with equal vigor, the party proved powerless against at least one centrist challenger’s efforts to circumvent the policy. Antone Melton-Meaux, an attorney who challenged Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) in the Democratic primary in August, used shell companies to conceal the identities of vendors that did not want to be blacklisted by the DCCC.",
            "The Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party and the Campaign Legal Center, an ethics watchdog, filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission against Melton-Meaux’s campaign for violating election disclosure laws. But neither the complainants nor the DCCC, which deferred to attorneys when asked about Melton-Meaux’s conduct, were capable of stopping him.",
            "Ultimately, the best argument against the ban was likely that it forced many talented political consultants to work exclusively for progressive candidates, depriving DCCC-endorsed contenders of the largest possible talent pool.",
            "“The blacklist treated progressive consultants as a group that should be crushed, but some of the most innovative firms were barred from key districts because of it,” Sean McElwee, whose polling firm Data for Progress consults for Justice Democrats, tweeted on Tuesday. “The party would be stronger if it worked with progressive firms.”"

            "MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico’s lower chamber approved a marijuana legalization bill Wednesday, setting the country on the path to becoming one of the world’s largest legal marijuana markets.",
            "Deputies approved the legislation in general terms, but continued debating details late into the night. The approved legislation, which needs to return to the Senate, would permit recreational use of marijuana, but establish a system of licenses required for the entire chain of production, distribution, transformation and sales.",
            "It would also require that individuals, and not just associations of users, have a permit to grow plants for personal use. Each individual would be allowed to have six plants with a maximum of eight per household.",
            "Adults could use marijuana without affecting others or children, but if caught with more than one ounce (28 grams) they would be fined. They could face jail time if they had more than 12 pounds (5.6 kilograms).",
            "Opposition parties did not support the legislation, which they say will lead to increased drug use.",
            "In 2015, Mexico’s Supreme Court ruled in favor of the recreational use marijuana. In 2019, the court ordered the government to create legislation, arguing that prohibiting its use was unconstitutional.",
            "The court has given lawmakers until April 30 to pass a law.",
            "President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has expressed support and his party, Morena, has a majority in the congress that is moving the legislation. Still, with campaigns underway for national legislative elections in June, the final form of the legislation is still evolving.",
            "Critics fear some changes made by the lower chamber threaten the original intent.",
            "For example, in the latest version, lawmakers did away with establishing a new government agency specifically for the regulation of marijuana. Instead, management of the new market will go to the existing National Commission Against Addictions, which experts say does not have the capacity to regulate something so complex.",
            "“They’re going to make the law inoperable,” said Lisa Sánchez, director of Mexico United Against Crime, one of the nongovernmental organizations that has been pushing marijuana legalization for years.",
            "Lawmakers favoring the bill say it will move the marijuana market out of the hands of Mexico’s powerful drug cartels to the government.",
            "But experts fear transnational corporations will be the primary beneficiaries rather than consumers or the farmers who have formed the lowest rung of the drug chain.",
            "Medicinal marijuana use has been legal in Mexico since 2017 and is allowed in a number of other Latin American countries. But only Uruguay allows recreational use in the region.",
            "Even if the Senate were to approve the lower chamber’s bill without additional changes, it would take time for it to take effect. An entire regulatory framework would have to be developed. That has been the case of medicinal marijuana, which only began to function in January with the establishment of the necessary regulations."

            "Pedestrian traffic-safety measures have been “a total failure” according to an advocacy group’s new report that found U.S. pedestrian fatalities jumped 45% over the last decade as planners prioritized vehicle speed and traffic flow over the lives of those on foot.",
            "The report, “Dangerous by Design 2021,” compiled by the urban planning nonprofit Smart Growth America, found that from 2010 to 2019, nearly every state in the U.S. grew more dangerous for pedestrians than the year prior, even though overall traffic fatalities trended downward. It also found alarming disparities in deaths based on the victims’ location, age and race.",
            "“Our current approach to addressing the rising number of people struck and killed while walking has been a total failure,” says the report, released on Wednesday. It urges transportation planners to place greater priority on the safety of people not behind the wheel.",
            "Black people were found to have been struck and killed by drivers at an 82% higher rate than white non-Hispanic people during the years 2010 to 2019. The fatality rate in the lowest-income neighborhoods was nearly twice that of middle-income neighborhoods.",
            "“Low-income communities are significantly less likely to have sidewalks, marked crosswalks, and street design to support safer, slower speeds,” the report states. “It is likely that many of the people walking in these lower-income census tracts are also lower-income themselves.” People in lower-income communities are less likely to have cars, the report adds.",
            "“We urgently need to change the way we design and build roads to prioritize safety, not speed, as we currently do,” Beth Osborne, transportation director for Smart Growth America, said in a statement. “The obsession with keeping traffic moving and avoiding delay at all costs in hopes of saving drivers mere seconds creates the very dangers highlighted in this report.”",
            "Florida was by far the most deadly state for pedestrians, according to the report, and seven of the nation’s 10 most dangerous metropolitan areas were in the Sunshine State.",
            "Florida’s Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford metro area ranked first in a calculation that considered deaths, population and the number of people who walk to work. The Orlando area has topped the planning group’s most-dangerous chart in three of four previous editions of the report that stretch back to 2009.",
            "Like Florida, the nine other states in the Top 10 are along the southern continental U.S. Alabama and New Mexico are second and third.",
            "Of the 20 most dangerous metro areas, 17 were in Southern states. Florida’s Orlando area was followed by Bakersfield, California. Memphis, Tennessee shared third place with Florida’s Palm Bay-Melbourne-Titusville area.",
            "“Eighty-four of the 100 largest metropolitan areas grew more dangerous for people walking since the previous edition of Dangerous by Design,” the report states.",
            "Florida Transportation Secretary Kevin J. Thibault dismissed the report in a statement to HuffPost, saying its analysis of select data points “results in an inaccurate portrayal.”",
            "“The report compares states and metropolitan areas across the nation, but does not take into account important geographic and demographic nuances, resulting in a one size fits all methodology for the assessment,” Thibault said.",
            "Thibault said Florida’s pedestrian and bicycle safety program has received high praise from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. NHTSA did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.",
            "The report offers recommended changes in road designs, speed limits and pedestrian crosswalks as ways to reduce deaths. These include narrowing traffic lanes, which has been found to decrease speed, and eliminating high-speed wide turns for sharp-angle turns instead.",
            "Lower vehicle speed dramatically reduces the chance of a pedestrian dying if hit by a car. A pedestrian struck by a 40 mph vehicle has an 85% chance of dying, compared with a 45% chance at 30 mph and 5% at 20 mph, according to National Traffic Safety Board data cited in the report."

            "As members of the Oath Keepers paramilitary group shouldered their way through the mob and up the steps to the U.S. Capitol, their plans for Jan. 6 were clear, authorities say. “Arrest this assembly, we have probable cause for acts of treason, election fraud,” someone commanded over an encrypted messaging app some extremists used to communicate during the siege.",
            "A little while earlier, Proud Boys carrying two-way radios and wearing earpieces spread out and tried to blend in with the crowd as they invaded the Capitol led by a man assigned “war powers” to oversee the group’s attack, prosecutors say.",
            "These two extremist groups that traveled to Washington along with thousands of other Trump supporters weren’t whipped into an impulsive frenzy by President Donald Trump that day, officials say. They’d been laying attack plans. And their internal communications and other evidence emerging in court papers and in hearings show how authorities are trying to build a case that small cells hidden within the masses mounted an organized, military-style assault on the heart of American democracy.",
            "“This was not simply a march. This was an incredible attack on our institutions of government,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Jason McCullough said during a recent hearing.",
            "The Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers make up a fraction of the more than 300 Trump supporters charged so far in the siege that led to Trump’s second impeachment and resulted in the deaths of five people, including a police officer. But several of their leaders, members and associates have become the central targets of the Justice Department’s sprawling investigation.",
            "It could mean more serious criminal charges for some rioters. On the other hand, mounting evidence of advance planning could also fuel Trump’s and his supporters’ claims that the Republican former president did not incite the riot and therefore should not be liable for it.",
            "Defense attorneys have accused prosecutors of distorting their clients’ words and actions to falsely portray the attack as a premeditated, orchestrated insurrection instead of a spontaneous outpouring of election-fueled rage to stop Congress’ certification of Trump’s defeat by Democrat Joe Biden.",
            "And prosecutors’ case against a man described as a leader in the Proud Boys’ attack took a hit last week when a judge ordered him released while he awaits trial, calling some of the evidence against him “weak to say the least.”",
            "The Oath Keepers began readying for violence as early as last November, authorities say. Communications show the group discussing logistics, weapons and training, including “2 days of wargames.”",
            "“I need you fighting fit” by the inauguration, one Ohio member, Jessica Watkins, told a recruit in November, according to court documents. “If Biden becomes president our way of life as we know it is over. Our Republic would be over. Then it is our duty as Americans to fight, kill and die for our rights,” she said in another message later that month.",
            "As Jan. 6 neared, they discussed stationing a “quick reaction force” outside Washington that could bring in weapons “if something goes to hell,” according to court documents. Days before the attack, one man suggested getting a boat to ferry “heavy weapons” across the Potomac River into their “waiting arms.”",
            "“I believe we will have to get violent to stop this,” that man, Thomas Caldwell of Virginia, said in a November message to Watkins. On Jan. 1, he took to Facebook to decry what he viewed as a rigged election, saying “we must smite them now and drive them down,” authorities say.",
            "Authorities have acknowledged there’s no evidence Caldwell was a dues-paying member of the Oath Keepers but have described him as a supporter who appeared to play a “leadership role” within the group.",
            "There were plans for some Oath Keepers to be there in “grey man” mode without identifiable militia gear so they could blend in with the crowd.",

            "Nordean, a Proud Boys chapter president from Washington state known as Ruffio Panman, tapped his social media following to solicit donations of money and tactical gear for the rally, prosecutors said. On the day of Tarrio’s arrest, Nordean posted a link to a podcast in which he discussed baseless claims about fraud in the election.",
            "“Democracy is dead? Well, then no peace for you. No democracy, no peace,” he said.",
            "Publicly, Tarrio announced on social media that the Proud Boys wouldn’t be wearing their customary yellow-and-black polo shirts on Jan. 6 so they could be “incognito.” Joseph Biggs, a self-described Proud Boys organizer from Florida, echoed that in a social media post directed at counter-protesters.",
            "“We will be blending in as one of you. You won’t see us,” Biggs wrote. “We are going to smell like you, move like you, and look like you.”",
            "Privately, according to prosecutors, the Proud Boys arranged for members to communicate using specific frequencies on Baofeng radios, Chinese-made devices that can be programmed for use on hundreds of frequencies, making it difficult for outsiders to eavesdrop.",
            "One of the Proud Boys who heeded the call to meet in Washington was Dominic Pezzola. He traveled from Syracuse, New York, on Jan. 5 and stayed with other members at a hotel, authorities say.",
            "Another group of members came from the Kansas City area. Investigators believe their chapter leader, William Chrestman, brought a helmet, a gas mask and an ax handle that he would conceal as a flag.",

            "___",
            "Long before the riot, Trump refused to condemn the Proud Boys during his Sept. 29 presidential debate against Biden, instead saying the group should “stand back and stand by.” Proud Boys members celebrated his words on social media, before the president later claimed not to know who they were. It’s unclear whether the Oath Keepers were on the White House radar.",
            "Proud Boys members, who describe themselves as a politically incorrect men’s club for “Western chauvinists,” have frequently engaged in street fights with antifascist activists at rallies and protests. Vice Media co-founder Gavin McInnes, who founded the Proud Boys in 2016, sued the Southern Poverty Law Center for labeling it as a hate group.",
            "The Oath Keepers are a loosely organized group of extremists who actively recruit current and former military, police and first responders who pledge to fulfill the oath to defend the Constitution against all enemies — foreign or domestic.",
            "In the weeks before the attack, Trump and his supporters were making increasingly false and incendiary comments, designed to mobilize supporters to work to overturn the election results — even though there was no widespread fraud in the election, as was confirmed by election officials across the country and by Trump’s attorney general.",
            "Trump encouraged thousands at the rally preceding the riot to “fight like hell,” but lawyers for the former president adamantly denied during his impeachment trial that he had incited the attack. They pointed to a remark during his speech in which he told the crowd to behave “peacefully” that day.",

They’ve had enough,” he said in a Signal message to a group around 1:40 p.m., authorities say. A little later, Rhodes, who has not been charged in the attack, instructed the group to “come to South Side of Capitol on steps.”",
            "Around 2:40 p.m., members of a military-style “stack” who moved up Capitol stairs in a line entered the building through a door on the east side, authorities say. Lawmakers and Vice President Mike Pence had been evacuated from the House and Senate chambers just about 20 minutes earlier.",
            "“We are in the mezzanine. We are in the main dome right now. We are rocking it. They are throwing grenades, they are fricking shooting people with paint balls. But we are in here,” Watkins declared over a channel called Stop the Steal J6 on the walkie-talkie app Zello.",
            "“Get it, Jess. ... Everything we (expletive) trained for,” someone responded, according to the communications obtained by WNYC’s “On the Media” program and detailed in court documents.",
            "Caldwell, who did not join the stack, climbed up to the west side balcony, authorities say.",
            "“We are surging forward, doors breached,” he said in a Facebook message about 10 minutes after the group went inside, according to court documents. Roughly 15 minutes later he sent another message: “Inside.”",
            "Caldwell received a Facebook message saying “all members are in the tunnels under capital seal them in,” authorities said. “Turn on gas,” the message said.",
            "Hours after the siege, Caldwell was already talking about another attack “at the local level,” authorities say.",
            "“If we’d had guns I guarantee we would have killed 100 politicians. They ran off and were spirited away through their underground tunnels like the rats they were,” Caldwell said in a message to a friend.",
            "___",
            "The Proud Boys met at the Washington Monument and were already at the Capitol before Trump finished addressing thousands of supporters near the White House. Listening to the president’s speech wasn’t part of their plan, prosecutors say.",

            "Nordean was spotted having a brief exchange near the Capitol with Robert Gieswein, a bat-wielding Colorado man. Proud Boys planning for Jan. 6 had discussed using non-members, or “normies,” like Gieswein to “burn that city to ash” and “smash some pigs to dust,” prosecutors said.",
            "The Proud Boys arrived at the east side of the Capitol before noon. Nordean allegedly positioned them at a Capitol grounds pedestrian entrance guarded by a handful of police officers behind a movable metal barrier.",
            "Around 12:50 p.m., just before the joint session of Congress was scheduled to start, a crowd including Proud Boys members broke through a front line of Capitol police officers and past sets of metal barriers. Nordean moved to the front of the crowd and “stalked” the line of officers to intimidate them and rile up the crowd, prosecutors wrote.",
            "As the mob advanced to another line of officers in the Capitol’s west plaza, Chrestman faced them and shouted, “Do you want your house back?”",

            "The Black woman had been accused by a store owner of shoplifting before the confrontation last month. When stopped by a police officer outside the store, the woman denied the accusations and opened her bag. An officer can be heard telling her: “Oh, come on, they said you stole, tell me what you took,” adding: “I don’t have time for B.S. You better be quick with me.”",
            "When she then ran from him with her child in her arms, he chased her, ordered her to put down the child, tackled her and pepper sprayed her. At one point, another officer arrives to pull away the woman’s child as she’s clutching the toddler’s arm. The first officer then tackles the mother. (The child’s face is blurred out in the screenshot below.)",
            "Police said the toddler was not sprayed or physically injured, though clearly she was extremely emotionally distraught. Another officer, trying to calm the desperate toddler, can be heard asking a colleague to block the scene from the public with his car because it “doesn’t look good that I have to restrain, like, a 3-year-old.”",
            "The officer involved has been placed on administrative leave pending an internal investigation. The unidentified woman was charged with trespassing and given a desk appearance ticket.",

            "It’s the same police department where one officer was suspended and two were placed on leave last month after police pepper-sprayed and handcuffed a 9-year-old Black girl at her home. Her parents had called for help when their child experienced what her mother described to police as a mental health breakdown.",
            "Interim Department Chief Cynthia Herriott-Sullivan said at a news conference Friday held to respond to mounting local outrage over the latest confrontation that officials believed police on the scene were within department guidelines.",
            "But Herriott-Sullivan, who called the confrontation “unsettling,” said: “Just because we can do certain things, should we? Can we get to the same place by utilizing a different strategy?”",
            "She added: “We do have policies on the use of things such as pepper spray .... generally ... if a person is physically resisting then you’re safe on pepper spray usage. But obviously you don’t want to take it too far.”",
            "Herriot-Sullivan called for officers to “come to a resolution of certain situations with the least amount of confrontation involved.”",
            "The video also captured an officer arguing aggressively with a bystander who was filming the scene with his cellphone. “I know you got a job to do,” the bystander says before the officer cuts him off. One officer tells the bystander to “shut the hell up, and get out of here.”",
            "Rochester’s Police Accountability Board said in a statement it was “disturbed” by the latest footage, and noted “troubling parallels” with the confrontation with the 9-year-old girl. Two of the officers were on both scenes, according to the board, which did not reveal what role they played.",
            "“Both incidents involved Black mothers. Both involved Black children. Both involved Black people obviously in crisis. Both involved officers using pepper spray on or around a Black child,” the statement noted.",
            "Neither family crisis teams nor mental health professionals were called to either scene, the board noted.",
            "And “both involved apparent intimidation of bystanders filming the incident,” the statement added. “Without the courage of those bystanders, who were willing to stand up and hold the police accountable, both incidents may never have been brought to light.”",
            "The department is still dealing with the consequences stemming from the death a year ago of Black Rochester resident Daniel Prude. Officers put a “spit hood” over his head to subdue him after he was found wandering the streets naked. His death was ruled a homicide caused by “complications of asphyxia in the setting of physical restraint.”",

            "PLAINS OF UR, Iraq (AP) — Pope Francis and Iraq’s top Shiite cleric delivered a powerful message of peaceful coexistence Saturday, urging Muslims in the war-weary Arab nation to embrace Iraq’s long-beleaguered Christian minority during an historic meeting in the holy city of Najaf.",
            "Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani said religious authorities have a role in protecting Iraq’s Christians, and that Christians should live in peace and enjoy the same rights as other Iraqis. The Vatican said Francis thanked al-Sistani for having “raised his voice in defense of the weakest and most persecuted” during some of the most violent times in Iraq’s recent history.",
            "Al-Sistani, 90, is one of the most senior clerics in Shiite Islam and his rare but powerful political interventions have helped shape present-day Iraq. He is a deeply revered figure in Shiite-majority Iraq and his opinions on religious and other matters are sought by Shiites worldwide.",
            "The historic meeting in al-Sistani’s humble home was months in the making, with every detail painstakingly discussed and negotiated between the ayatollah’s office and the Vatican.",
            "Early Saturday, the 84-year-old pontiff, traveling in a bullet-proof Mercedes-Benz, pulled up along Najaf’s narrow and column-lined Rasool Street, which culminates at the golden-domed Imam Ali Shrine, one of the most revered sites in Shiite Islam. He then walked the few meters (yards) to al-Sistani’s modest home, which the cleric has rented for decades.",
            "A group of Iraqis wearing traditional clothes welcomed him outside. As a masked Francis entered the doorway, a few white doves were released in a sign of peace. He emerged just under an hour later, still limping from an apparent flare-up of sciatica nerve pain that makes walking difficult.",
            "The “very positive” meeting lasted a total of 40 minutes, said a religious official in Najaf, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief media.",
            "The official said al-Sistani, who normally remains seated for visitors, stood to greet Francis at the door of his room — a rare honor. Al-Sistani and Francis sat close to one another, without masks. Al-Sistani, who rarely appears in public — even on television — wore black robes and a black turban, in simple contrast to Francis’ all-white cassock.",
            "The official said there was some concern about the fact that the pope had met with so many people the day before. Francis has received the coronavirus vaccine but al-Sistani has not. The aging ayatollah, who underwent surgery for a fractured thigh bone last year, looked tired.",
            "The pope removed his shoes before entering al-Sistani’s room and was served tea and a plastic bottle of water. Al-Sistani spoke for most of the meeting. Francis paused before leaving al-Sistani’s room to have a last look, the official said.",
            "The pope arrived later in the ancient city of Ur for an interfaith meeting in the traditional birthplace of Abraham, the biblical patriarch revered by Christians, Muslims and Jews.",
            "“From this place, where faith was born, from the land of our father Abraham, let us affirm that God is merciful and that the greatest blasphemy is to profane his name by hating our brothers and sisters,” Francis said. “Hostility, extremism and violence are not born of a religious heart: they are betrayals of religion.”",
            "Religious leaders stood to greet him. While Francis wore a mask, few of the leaders on the tented stage did. The meeting was held in the shadow of Ur’s magnificent ziggurat, the 6,000-year-old archaeological complex near the modern city of Nasiriyah.",
            "The Vatican said Iraqi Jews were invited to the event but did not attend, without providing further details. Iraq’s ancient Jewish community was decimated in the 20th century by violence and mass emigration fueled by the Arab-Israeli conflict, and only a handful remain.",
            "The Vatican said the historic visit to al-Sistani was a chance for Francis to emphasize the need for collaboration and friendship between different religious communities.",
            "In a statement issued by his office after the meeting, al-Sistani affirmed that Christians should “live like all Iraqis, in security and peace and with full constitutional rights.” He pointed out the “role that the religious authority plays in protecting them, and others who have also suffered injustice and harm in the events of past years.”",
            "Al-Sistani wished Francis and the followers of the Catholic Church happiness, and thanked him for taking the trouble to visit him in Najaf, the statement said.",
            "For Iraq’s dwindling Christian minority, a show of solidarity from al-Sistani could help secure their place in Iraq after years of displacement — and, they hope, ease intimidation from Shiite militiamen against their community.",
            "Iraqis cheered the meeting of two respected faith leaders.",
            "”We welcome the pope’s visit to Iraq and especially to the holy city of Najaf and his meeting with Grand Ayatollah Ali Al-Sistani,” said Najaf resident Haidar Al-Ilyawi. “It is an historic visit and hope it will be good for Iraq and the Iraqi people.”",
            "Francis arrived in Iraq on Friday and met with senior government officials on the first-ever papal visit to the country. It is also his first international trip since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, and his meeting Saturday marked the first time a pope had met a grand ayatollah.",
            "On the few occasions where he has made his opinion known, the notoriously reclusive al-Sistani has shifted the course of Iraq’s modern history.",
            "In the years after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion he repeatedly preached calm and restraint as the Shiite majority came under attack by al-Qaida and other Sunni extremists. The country was nevertheless plunged into years of sectarian violence.",
            "His 2014 fatwa, or religious edict, calling on able-bodied men to join the security forces in fighting the Islamic State group swelled the ranks of Shiite militias, many closely tied to Iran. In 2019, as anti-government demonstrations gripped the country, his sermon lead to the resignation of then-prime minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi.",
            "Iraqis have welcomed the visit and the international attention it has given the country as it struggles to recover from decades of war and unrest. Iraq declared victory over the Islamic State group in 2017 but still sees sporadic attacks.",
            "It has also seen recent rocket attacks by Iran-backed militias against U.S. military and diplomatic facilities, followed by U.S. airstrikes on militia targets in Iraq and neighboring Syria. The violence is linked to the standoff between the U.S. and Iran following the Trump administration’s withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear accord and its imposition of crippling sanctions on Iran. President Joe Biden has said he wants to revive the deal.",
            "Francis’ visit to Najaf and nearby Ur traverses provinces that have seen recent instability. In Nasiriyah, where the Plains of Ur is located, protest violence left at least five dead last month. Most were killed when Iraqi security forces used live ammunition to disperse crowds.",
            "Protest violence was also seen in Najaf last year, but abated as the mass anti-government movement that engulfed Iraq gradually petered out.",

            "President Joe Biden signed an executive order directing the sprawling apparatus of the federal government to promote voting rights on Sunday, the 56th anniversary of the Bloody Sunday march in Selma, Alabama.",
            "But while Biden warned of an “all-out assault on the right to vote” in a speech on Sunday morning, the content of his executive order ― which mostly focuses on promoting voter registration and making election information more accessible ― highlights the reality of the president’s own limited powers to directly combat GOP-backed state legislation aiming to make it more difficult to vote.",
            "The executive order directs federal agencies to expand access to voter registration and election information, orders the General Services Administration to develop a plan to update and improve the federal website Vote.gov, directs the National Institute of Standards and Technology to come up with recommendations to improve voting access for people with disabilities, promotes voter registration among members of the military and other overseas federal government employees, and creates a steering group on Native American voting rights led by the White House’s Domestic Policy Council.",
            "“Every eligible voter should be able to vote and have it counted,” Biden told the Martin Luther and Coretta Scott King Unity Breakfast, according to prepared remarks for his virtual address. “If you have the best ideas, you have nothing to hide. Let more people vote.”",
            "The breakfast is an annual Selma-based event that commemorates the Bloody Sunday march in 1965.",
            "In his speech, Biden pointed to the wave of state legislation sponsored by Republicans since the 2020 election that aims to increase voter identification requirements, cut early voting hours and sites, and either eliminate or restrict absentee and mail-in balloting. Many of the Republicans pushing such bills have endorsed former President Donald Trump’s false claims about mail-in ballot and other voter fraud in last year’s election.",
            "A senior Biden administration official, previewing the executive order on a call with reporters, said one of its goals is to send a signal about the importance of voting rights, even while Biden’s powers in that area are limited.",
            "“The president doesn’t have executive authority to prevent a state from taking that kind of action,” the administration official said. “[The order] uses the president’s bully pulpit to send a message to all the states and to all voters about the importance of democracy and shoring up democracy.”",
            "In his speech Sunday morning, Biden reiterated his calls for Congress to pass both a sweeping democracy reform bill and a renewed Voting Rights Act. The Democratic-controlled House passed democracy reform legislation last Wednesday, but fierce Republican opposition means both it and a strengthened Voting Rights Act are dead in the water in the Senate unless Democrats move to reform the filibuster.",
            "Biden’s remarks invoked the legacy of the late Georgia Rep. John Lewis, who was one of dozens of marchers injured by Alabama state troopers and local law enforcement while trying to cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge on that Sunday in 1965.",
            "“The legacy of the march in Selma is that while nothing can stop a free people from exercising their most sacred power as citizens, there are those who will do everything they can to take that power away,” Biden said."

            "SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — Major League Baseball teams in California can welcome a limited number of fans back to ballparks on April 1 under new state rules announced Friday that will also let Disneyland and other theme parks reopen for the first time in more than a year.",
            "The changes allow people to attend other outdoor sporting events and live performances in limited numbers that go into effect on baseball’s opening day, when the San Diego Padres, Los Angeles Angels and Oakland A’s all have home games. The A’s confirmed they will have fans in the stands.",
            "Disneyland officials did not say when the park would reopen. But when it does, only people who live in California can buy tickets. The same goes for MLB games and outdoor performances, as public health officials try to limit mixing while continuing to roll out coronavirus vaccinations.",
            "Indoor events such as NBA games and concerts are not included in the new rules announced by the administration of Gov. Gavin Newsom.",
            "The state is acting because the rates of new coronavirus cases and hospitalizations are declining while the number of people receiving vaccines is increasing, said Dr. Mark Ghaly, California’s top public health official.",
            "“Today’s announcement is focused on building in some of the compelling science about how the virus behaves, and how activities when done a certain way can reduce risk,” Ghaly said.",
            "California divides its counties into four color-coded tiers based on the spread of the virus. The purple tier is the most restrictive, followed by red, orange and yellow. Attendance limits are based on what tier a county is in.",
            "Outdoor sports are limited to 100 people in the purple tier. The limits increase to 20% capacity in the red tier, 33% in the orange tier and 67% in the yellow tier.",
            "Teams and event organizers can only sell tickets regionally in the purple tier. In the other tiers, teams and organizers can sell tickets to anyone living in California. No concessions will be allowed in the purple tier, while in others, concession sales will only be available at seats.",
            "Enforcing the rules will be left to venues. Ghaly and Dee Dee Myers, director of the Governor’s Office of Business and Economic Development, said organizers will have to sell tickets in advance and can cross-check to confirm hometowns to help with contact tracing if needed.",
            "Myers acknowledged that some people will try to beat the system, but she said officials hope people will respect the guidelines.",
            "The Oakland A’s announced rules that give a glimpse of what life will be like for fans during the pandemic. They will be seated in pods of two or four seats, and tickets will only be available on the MLB Ballpark app.",
            "Fans can order concessions on their phones and have them delivered to their seats. No tailgating is allowed, and teams will not accept cash inside the stadium. People who don’t have debit cards can purchase one with cash at a limited number of locations inside the venue.",
            "“We are excited to safely welcome fans back to our ballpark for the upcoming season,” A’s President Dave Kaval said.",
            "Theme parks can open in the red tier at 15% capacity and boost attendance limits as virus rates decrease. Again, only people who live in California can buy tickets. Indoor rides at outdoor parks will be allowed because they are typically short and can allow for proper spacing.",
            "“We can’t wait to welcome guests back and look forward to sharing an opening date soon,” Ken Potrock, president of Disneyland Resort, said in a statement.",
            "Disneyland employees have been furloughed or out of a job for nearly a year. Andrea Zinder, president of the local United Food and Commercial Workers Union that represents Disney workers, said employees are “excited to go back to work and provide Californians with a bit more magic in their lives.”",
            "Disney fan Kenny King Jr.said he became an annual Disneyland passholder a decade ago and typically takes his family there five times a year.",
            "King, 38, and his family, who live in Pleasant Hill, last went to Disneyland in February 2020 for his birthday. He’s excited to return with his 8-year-old daughter, who had just started enjoying rides such as Big Thunder Mountain Railroad and Space Mountain, and to take his 2-year-old son, who was mesmerized by the lights and sounds when he went to the park last year.",
            "“We’ll sit there at the house sometimes and we’ll be like man, I just miss Disneyland,” King said.",
            "He said he’s confident Disney will take appropriate safety measures. “They’ve had plenty of time to game plan on that,” he said."

            "Walker, who owned a gun legally, faced charges of attempted murder of a police officer and assault after the March 2020 raid in which police fired at least 20 shots, killing Taylor. Those charges were dropped in May after a grand jury said it lacked evidence to convict. Jefferson Commonwealth’s Attorney Tom Wine said at the time that the charges could be revived after more thorough investigation.",
            "The prosecutor has now asked that the charges be permanently dismissed. A hearing on the request is scheduled for March 8, according to WLKY, the CBS affiliate in Louisville.",
            "“Every piece of evidence from when they falsely arrested and indicted him a year ago up till today prove that Kenny acted in self defense and was immune from prosecution,” Walker’s attorney, Steve Romines, said in a statement. “Yet he was framed and charged to cover up Breonna’s killing. This is but a first step.”",
            "Louisville Metro Police officers in plainclothes battered down Taylor’s door late at night with a search warrant involving a drug investigation. Walker, who said he thought the intruders may have been Taylor’s ex-boyfriend, fired one shot. Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron (R) claimed Walker’s bullet struck an officer in the leg, though a ballistics report couldn’t rule out friendly fire. Police responded with a barrage of at least 20 bullets, 10 of them fired blindly. Taylor, a 26-year-old Black EMT, was hit at least five times and died.",

            "BAGHDAD (AP) — Pope Francis arrived in Iraq on Friday to urge the country’s dwindling number of Christians to stay put and help rebuild the country after years of war and persecution, brushing aside the coronavirus pandemic and security concerns to make his first-ever papal visit.",
            "The pope, who wore a facemask during the flight, kept it on as he descended the stairs to the tarmac and was greeted by two masked children in traditional dress. But health measures appeared lax inside the airport despite the country’s worsening coronavirus outbreak.",
            "Iraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein said Iraqis were eager to welcome Francis’ “message of peace and tolerance” and described the visit as a historic meeting between the “minaret and the bells.” Among the highlights of the three-day visit is Francis’ private meeting Saturday with the country’s top Shiite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, a revered figure in Iraq and beyond.",
            "Francis’ plane touched down at Baghdad’s airport just before 2 p.m. local time (1100 GMT). A red carpet was rolled out on the tarmac in Baghdad’s international airport with Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi on hand to greet him. Francis was visibly limping in a sign his sciatica, which has flared and forced him to cancel events recently, was possibly bothering him.",
            "A largely unmasked choir sang songs as both pope and premier made their way to a welcome area in the airport. People wandered around without masks, and the pope and the prime minister took theirs off as they sat down for their first meeting — seated less than two meters (yards) apart — and later stood next to each other shaking hands and chatting.",
            "The pope later rolled down the window and waved to some of the hundreds of people who gathered along the airport road to watch his motorcade pass. The airport road was the scene of regular attacks in the chaotic years after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion.",
            "Iraqis were keen to welcome him and the global attention his visit will bring, with billboards depicting Francis with the slogan “We are all Brothers.”",
            "The government is eager to show off the relative security it has achieved after years of wars and militant attacks that nevertheless continue even today. Francis and the Vatican delegation are relying on Iraqi security forces to protect them, including with the expected first use of an armored car for the popemobile-loving pontiff.",
            "Francis is breaking his year-long COVID-19 lockdown to refocus the world’s attention on a largely neglected people whose northern Christian communities, which date from the time of Christ, were largely emptied during the violent Islamic State reign from 2014-2017.",
            "For the pope, who has often traveled to places where Christians are a persecuted minority, Iraq’s beleaguered Christians are the epitome of the “martyred church” that he has admired ever since he was a young Jesuit seeking to be a missionary in Asia.",
            "In Iraq, Francis is seeking to not only honor its martyrs but deliver a message of reconciliation and fraternity. The few Christians who remain in Iraq harbor a lingering mistrust of their Muslim neighbors and face structural discrimination long predating both IS and the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that plunged the country into chaos.",
            "“The Pope’s visit is to support the Christians in Iraq to stay, and to say that they are not forgotten,” the Chaldean patriarch, Cardinal Luis Sako, told reporters in Baghdad this week. The aim of Francis’ visit, he said, is to encourage them to “hold onto hope.”",
            "The visit comes as Iraq is seeing a new spike in coronavirus infections, with most new cases traced to the highly contagious variant first identified in Britain. The 84-year-old pope, the Vatican delegation and travelling media have been vaccinated; most Iraqis have not.",
            "The Vatican and Iraqi authorities have downplayed the threat of the virus and insisted that social distancing, crowd control and other health care measures will be enforced. The Vatican spokesman, Matteo Bruni, said this week the important thing is for Iraqis to know that the pope came to Iraq as an “act of love.”",
            "“I come among you as a pilgrim of peace, to repeat ‘you are all brothers,’” Francis said in a video-message to the Iraqi people on the eve of his visit. “I come as a pilgrim of peace in search of fraternity, animated by the desire to pray together and walk together, also with brothers and sisters of other religious traditions.”",
            "Christians once constituted a sizeable minority in Iraq but their numbers began dwindling after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion. They fell further when IS militants in 2014 swept through traditionally Christian towns across the Nineveh plains. Their extremist brand of Islam forced residents to flee to the neighboring Kurdish region or further afield.",
            "Few have returned, and those who have found their homes and churches destroyed.",
            "Returnees have had to contend with more struggles. Many cannot find work and blame discriminatory practices in the public sector, Iraq’s largest employer. Since 2003, public jobs have been mostly controlled by majority Shiite political elites, leaving Christians feeling marginalized.",
            "While hard numbers are hard to come by, there were an estimated 1.4 million Christians in Iraq in 2003. Today the number is believed to be around 250,000.",
            "During his visit, Francis will pray in the Baghdad church that was the site of one of the worst massacres of Christians, the 2010 attack by Islamic militants that left 58 people dead. He will honor the dead in a Mosul square surrounded by shells of destroyed churches and meet with the small Christian community that returned to Qaraqosh. He will bless their church, which was used as a firing range by IS.",
            "The Vatican and the pope have frequently insisted on the need to preserve Iraq’s ancient Christian communities and create the security, economic and social conditions for those who have left to return. But that hasn’t necessarily translated into reality.",
            "“I am the only priest in Mosul. Every Sunday I hold mass at 9 a.m., and only around 70 people attend,” said the Rev. Raed Adil Kelo, parish priest of the Church of the Annunciation in the onetime de-facto IS capital.",
            "Before 2003, the Christian population was 50,000, he said. It had dwindled to 2,000 before IS overran northern Iraq.",
            "He doesn’t expect more to return, but he said Francis’ visit would have immeasurable importance for those who stayed.",
            "“This visit will bring peace to Iraq” he said.",

            "AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Texas’ power grid manager was fired Wednesday amid growing calls for his ouster following February’s deadly blackouts that left millions of people without electricity and heat for days in subfreezing temperatures.",
            "Bill Magness, CEO of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, becomes the second senior official to depart in the wake of the one of the worst blackouts in U.S. history. The state’s top utility regulator resigned Monday.",
            "Magness was given a two-month termination notice by ERCOT’s board in a meeting Wednesday night. The move came as the grid operator is now under investigation by the House Oversight Committee.",
            "“During this transition period, Bill will continue to serve as President and CEO and work with state leaders and regulators on potential reforms to ERCOT,” the organization said in a statement.",
            "Magness, who made more than $876,000 in salary and other compensation in 2019, was the target of much of the outrage over the blackouts that began Feb. 15 when a winter storm plunged temperatures into single digits across Texas, causing skyrocketing demand for electricity to heat homes. Grid operators unplugged more than 4 million customers as the system buckled, which Magness has said was necessary to avert an even more catastrophic blackout that could have lasted months.",
            "But the power did not flip back on for days for millions of residents, and the prolonged outages quickly escalated to a crisis of tragic proportions, as people trying to keep warm died of carbon monoxide poisoning and others froze to death. The storm and resulting blackouts have been blamed for more than 40 deaths in Texas, but the full toll may not be known for months.",
            "At the Texas Capitol last week, lawmakers investigating the outages laid into Magness for his handling of the storm.",
            "Over hours of testimony, Magness defended actions that he said kept the grid that serves most of Texas’ 30 million residents intact.",
            "“It worked from keeping us (from) going into a blackout that we’d still be in today, that’s why we did it,” Magness said last Thursday. “Now it didn’t work for people’s lives, but it worked to preserve the integrity of the system.”",
            "Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has accused ERCOT of misleading the state about the readiness of the grid, placing blame for the outages almost singularly on the grid operators. His outrage has not extended to the state’s Public Utility Commission, which oversees ERCOT and is led by Abbott appointees.",
            "But the commission has also increasingly come under fire. Chairwoman DeAnn Walker resigned after struggling in two lengthy appearances before lawmakers following the blackouts, but said others should also accept responsibility for the outages.",
            "At least six ERCOT board members have stepped down in the aftermath of the blackouts. Many of them lived out of state, a fact that only intensified anger toward ERCOT as the crisis unfolded."

            "SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California will begin setting aside 40% of all vaccine doses for the state’s most vulnerable neighborhoods in an effort to inoculate people most at risk from the coronavirus and get the state’s economy open more quickly.",
            "Two officials in Gov. Gavin Newsom’s administration shared details Wednesday on condition of anonymity.",
            "The doses will be spread out among 400 ZIP codes with about 8 million people eligible for shots. Many of the neighborhoods are concentrated in Los Angeles County and the Central Valley. The areas are considered most vulnerable based on metrics such as household income, education level, housing status and access to transportation.",
            "Once 2 million vaccine doses are given out in those neighborhoods, the state will make it easier for counties to move through reopening tiers that dictate business and school reopenings.",
            "Right now, a county can move from the most restrictive purple tier to the lower red tier based on several metrics, including having 7 or fewer new COVID cases per 100,000 people per day over a period of several weeks. That metric will change to 10 new cases or fewer. In the red tier, businesses such as restaurants and gyms can open for indoor services at limited capacity.",
            "Also in the red tier, schools that want to access new state funding must provide in-person learning for students in transitional kindergarten through grade 6 and at least one grade each in middle and high school.",
            "About 1.6 million vaccine doses already have been given to people in those 400 ZIP codes, and the state will hit the 2 million mark in the next week or two, officials said.",

            "The changes mark a fresh round of twists in California’s vaccination and reopening plans. People age 65 and over, farmworkers, educators and emergency service workers are also eligible for shots.",
            "More counties have already been moving into the red tier as caseloads, hospitalizations and deaths drop. The state’s average 2.2% test positivity rate over 7 days is a record low.",
            "Officials are making it easier to move through reopening tiers, arguing the likelihood of widespread transmission that can overwhelm hospitals will decrease as more people are vaccinated. That’s particularly true as the most vulnerable populations that are more likely to get seriously ill receive the shots.",
            "While race and ethnicity are not explicit factors in designating vaccinations, the 400 vulnerable ZIP codes overlap heavily with neighborhoods with higher populations of Blacks, Latinos and Asian and Pacific Islanders, officials said.",
            "Los Angeles County could move into the next phase of reopening with fewer restrictions as early as next week, though any actual lifting of coronavirus-related constraints would not happen immediately, county officials said earlier Wednesday.",
            "Most San Francisco Bay Area counties have advanced to the next phase, which allows restaurants and movie theaters to open indoors at 25% capacity and gyms to operate at 10% capacity.",

            "Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.), whose state deployed some of its Guard members to Washington, released a statement Thursday morning saying her contacts at the National Guard had told her about a request from Capitol Police for a 60-day extension of the troops providing security in and around the complex.",
            "“No one likes seeing the fortress-like security around the Capitol. And no one wants to again have a security problem in and around this symbolic place,” she said. “But whether an extension has been requested or the mission is indeed terminating on March 12, it’s critical that members of Congress get a briefing on what’s behind these decisions.”",
            "“We all have the same goal: to get back to the point where Capitol Police is capable of protecting us without the Guard’s help, and all parties feel confident we can protect the people’s business,” Slotkin continued, adding that she learned the request had been made in the last 36 hours.",
            "Neither the Capitol Police nor the D.C. Guard responded to HuffPost’s request for comment.",
            "Security is still a concern at the Capitol two months after armed supporters of former President Donald Trump carried out a deadly insurrection that damaged the complex and forced lawmakers to evacuate their chambers. FBI Director Christopher Wray testified to Congress on Tuesday that the domestic terrorism on Jan. 6 was “metastasizing across the county.”",
            "On Thursday, security around the Capitol heightened after intelligence revealed a potential plot by far-right extremists to attack the complex again. The potential threat is tied to the QAnon conspiracy theory that Trump will regain power on March 4.",
            "The Capitol Police released a statement on Wednesday regarding the increased security, saying the department is working with “local, state and federal partners” to prevent any attacks on the Capitol. The statement did not mention the reported request to extend the National Guard’s stay by two months.",
            "“We have obtained intelligence that shows a possible plot to breach the Capitol by an identified militia group on Thursday, March 4. We have already made significant security upgrades to include establishing a physical structure and increasing manpower to ensure the protection of Congress, the public and our police officers.”",
            "The threat had not materialized as of Thursday evening, though the House canceled its session out of caution. When asked if there was any additional information about the potential plot, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the FBI and Department of Homeland Security had warned that “the threat from domestic violent extremism, particularly racially motivated and anti-government extremists, did not begin or end on Jan.6.”",
            "“I’m not going to outline any security steps from here at any point in time, but I can say that … the president personally remains deeply engaged in tracking these threats, in receiving regular updates ― as he does from his team ― about threats, of course, but about incidents happening across the country,” she said. “It’s something he is personally engaged in.”",
            "Asked at a press conference on Thursday about the Capitol Police’s reported request for more National Guard troops, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said that “decisions about security are made by the security leadership here, and we’ll see what the ask is.”",
            "“We should have them here as long as they are needed, and the silliness of this being ‘Inauguration Day’ … falls into the realm of let’s not waste our time on it,” she said. “We have to have what we need, and when we need it, and in the numbers we need it. But that’s a security decision.”"

            "“Donald Trump was an aberration,” Kerry said, contrasting the 45th president’s policies — which were generally more focused on benefiting polluting industries than the environment — with President Joe Biden’s agenda, which has emphasized climate change as a key national security policy. “He was a hiccup in the digestive system of history.”",
            "Kerry stressed that recent consequences of climate change — including the wildfires that ravaged the West Coast in 2020 and natural disasters like Hurricane Maria — were evident, and America had been given a “grace moment” to make up for “four terribly lost years, destructive years, that had no basis in science, no basis in fact.”",
            "“And that, unfortunately, unleashed among reluctant nations a permissiveness that expanded beyond just the United States’ absence,” Kerry said.",

            "He also speculated that if the U.S and other global powers continue to invest in technologies such as carbon storage and electric vehicles, the effect would be akin to the Industrial Revolution, creating “such an economic shift in nations that no biased demagogue is going to be able to undo that ... because the marketplace will have made such a commitment and moved so far in its transformation.”",
            "Finally, Kerry addressed COVID-19 and pointed out that the coronavirus and climate change were not mutually exclusive threats.",

            "At 9:45 a.m. a protective service liaison to the Capitol Police wrote, “Good morning Sir, what I have is the Ellipse is permitted for 30k but they expecting for there to be much more. Freedom Plaza original permit was 5k and it was raised to 30k, the permit outside Sylven Theater is permitted for 15K.”",
            "The agents were particularly interested in the right wing extremist group, Proud Boys. They noted how many were in Washington, that they were staying at a downtown hotel, and what they planned.",
            "In a briefing at noon on that day, just as Trump was encouraging supporters to “ fight like hell,” a Federal Protective Service email said about 300 Proud Boys were at the U.S. Capitol.",
            "“No incidents at this time,” the email said. But then it warned, “The Proud Boys are threatening to shut down the water system in the downtown area, which includes government facilities.”",
            "The email noted there was a man in a tree with what appeared to be a rifle near the Ellipse, and about 25,000 people were around the White House, including some who were hiding bags in bushes outside the building.",
            "“Together we stand!” the officer signed off.",
            "About 20 minutes later, a protective service officer whose name was redacted sent an email that read, “POTUS is encouraging the protesters to march to capitol grounds and continue protesting there.” POTUS stands for president of the United States.",
            "In a series of emails that followed, protective service officers messages offered a blow-by-blow account of the march to the Capitol from the rally where Trump spoke.",
            "“Protesters moving towards the capitol down Pennsylvania, Constitution and Madison in numbers estimated 10-15,000,” read an email sent at 12:28 p.m.",
            "The officers tracked them across the city and at 12:57 p.m. a message read, “Large group just breached the USCP barricade on the West Front,” referring to the Capitol Police barriers on west side of the Capitol Building.",
            "About a half hour later, they reported several police officers were injured, and then at 2:14 a message screamed “CAPITOL HAS BEEN BREACHED. PROTESTERS ARE NOW INSIDE THE CAPITOL.” Two minutes later they reported the House and Senate chambers were being locked down.",
            "“Shots fired 2nd floor house side inside the capitol,” read a message at 2:45, probably the moment when a Capitol Police officer fatally shot Ashli Babbitt, a Trump supporter who tried to hurl herself through a broken interior window into the Speaker’s Lobby just outside the House chamber where lawmakers were taking cover.",
            "Intelligence agents used Facebook to monitor dozens of protests planned for Jan. 6 and beyond, according to emails. These rallies had names such as the “Yugest Trump Parade of All (45 Exclamation Points)!,” “Fight for President Trump and Your Rights,” and “Wild Protest for Donald Trump (The Republican Mandate).” Some events were permitted, others were not.",
            "Officers in the Virginia suburb of Vienna were already on edge two days before the Capitol breach after a video of a small, half-hour protest at the home of Republican Sen. Josh Hawley __ a Trump supporter __ attracted more than 100,000 pageviews.",
            "“They claim they are coming back tonight,” Vienna Deputy Chief Daniel Janickey said in Jan. 5 emails to Fairfax County officials.",
            "“WE will have some officers out there tonight monitoring in case (the) group shows up,” Janickey wrote. “Hawley and his staff have hired armed private security for (the) next 48 hours.”",
            "Those protesters didn’t return. But within 24 hours, Fairfax County, Virginia, officials realized their Washington counterparts had much more trouble on their hands.",
            "At 3:10 p.m. on Jan. 6, Fairfax County’s deputy county executive, Dave Rohrer, emailed more than 25 county officials: “Subject: Awareness - Police Mutual Aid Request U.S. Capitol Police.”",
            "That was about two hours after the first windows had been broken.",
            "The U.S. Capitol had been breached, he said.",
            "“It is obvious to me based on my experience and knowledge that an emergency exists,” said Rohrer. He said he had authorized the Fairfax County Police Department to send Civil Disturbance Unit officers and commanders “to assist gaining control for safety reasons.”",
            "He added that they were monitoring the deployment closely. The redacted email refers to an early June episode when police from several jurisdictions used tear gas to violently break up a peaceful and legal protest in Lafayette Square, across the street from the White House.",
            "On Jan. 6, Rohrer said he reminded commanders on the scene “that they are to cease operations if at any point they determine they are being used in an inappropriate, unethical, illegal manner, or are not under a competent authority... Maintaining life safety, regaining and establishing a safe perimeter, etc., should be the initial focus.”",
            "Just 12 minutes later, Rohrer had an update: They were suspending any fire, rescue or emergency service transportation to hospitals in the District of Columbia and “upgrading response and command structure.”",
            "For hours, Fairfax County’s police monitored Metro stations and acted as back up to Washington police, according to the emails. They were also checking with hotels where some in the mob were staying. Rohrer noted that many had been staying in Alexandria and Arlington..",
            "The hotels “reported some problems with crowds and disorderly conduct the past few nights,” he said.",
            "That evening, at 8:31 p.m., a Federal Protective Service memo alerted “there is a report of an armed militia group headed to dc from west Virginia. Query ongoing.”",
            "As midnight approached, Rohrer emailed again. Although the Capitol was quiet, “Intel will be monitored throughout the night and, unfortunately, PD and US Capitol Police are investigating several threats targeting residences of Capitol VIPs or family members received late tonight.”",
            "By Jan. 7, Fairfax County Police Department Major Shawn Bennett was bristling at Capitol Police Chief Terry Gainer’s critique of the police response.",
            "“Gainer throws a lot of shame but he doesn’t offer any answers to what ‘specifically’ he would have done differently to keep the initial group from breaking down the barriers,” emailed Bennett.",
            "Also on Jan. 7, Fairfax County Executive Bryan Hill was thanking his staff.",
            "“Our Police Department’s Civil Disturbance Unit answered the call yesterday, and as much as I hated to activate you, it was an activation to preserve our republic,” he wrote. “I am hopeful we will never again see what we witnessed yesterday, but I am most hopeful that yesterday’s events will galvanize our county and our nation as we do our best to vaccinate, maintain calm and create a sense of unity.”",

            "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Vernon Jordan, who grew up in the segregated South to become an influential leader in the American civil rights movement, Washington politics and Wall Street, has died at age 85, his daughter said on Tuesday.",
            "Jordan, who in 1980 was badly wounded by a white supremacist sniper in Indiana, died on Monday night peacefully and “surrounded by loved ones,” daughter Vickee Jordan said in a statement.",
            "His role as a Washington insider took him all the way to the White House, where he was a close friend, golfing buddy and adviser to President Bill Clinton in the 1990s. Jordan never held a formal government job, but no one knew better than Jordan how favors, access and requests worked in Washington.",
            "In a statement, Clinton and his wife, Hillary Clinton, called him a “wonderful friend,” adding, “Vernon Jordan brought his big brain and strong heart to everything and everybody he touched.” Clinton mentioned Jordan’s instrumental role in desegregating the University of Georgia in 1961, his career in law and business, and his work with civil rights groups.",
            "Jordan grew up in a housing project in Atlanta before his family bought a home and he was the only Black person in his class at DePauw University in rural Greencastle, Indiana.",
            "After graduating, Jordan earned a law degree from Howard University and returned to Atlanta to work for a civil rights attorney. Among his cases was one that integrated the University of Georgia at a time of racial segregation in Southern states. Jordan helped escort his two young Black clients past jeering protesters on their first day of class.",
            "Jordan later went to work for the NAACP and the United Negro College Fund before becoming head of the National Urban League in 1971. He worked well into his 80s, going back and forth between the jobs at the Akin Gump international law and lobbying firm in Washington and the Lazard financial management firm in New York.",
            "“To the world, Vernon was a towering civil rights figure, a confidant to presidents, and a counselor to CEOs and governments around the globe. And he was all of those things. But to those of us at Akin Gump, Vernon was also a wise and trusted mentor and friend,” the firm said in a statement.",
            "“His achievements were doubly remarkable considering the obstacles he overcame as a Black man rising from the virulent racism of America’s segregated Deep South. Vernon burned brighter than the rest of us, with a vitality amplified by his imposing frame and resonant voice,” Lazard Chairman and CEO Kenneth Jacobs wrote in a memo to employees.",
            "‘ROSA PARKS OF WALL STREET’",
            "After gains in voting rights and equal access laws, Jordan’s approach was to push for greater economic opportunities for Black people, even in corporate boardrooms.",
            "At an Urban League event Jordan said he told the organization’s corporate benefactors, “Don’t just give us money and don’t just show up for the Equal Opportunity Day dinner. That is not enough when you look at Black consumer power in this country. It’s not enough for you to come and shake our hands and be our friends. We want in.”",
            "Under his leadership, the Urban League began issuing its annual State of Black America reports to assess the social and economic status of Black Americans.",
            "U.S. companies such as American Express, Xerox, Dow Jones, Bankers Trust, RJR Nabisco, Revlon and Sara Lee put him on their boards, where he was often the only Black member.",
            "Jordan was close to President Jimmy Carter in the 1970s, and Carter reportedly offered him cabinet jobs. Jordan would eventually become critical of Carter, saying he had not delivered on his economic promises to Blacks.",
            "In 1980, Jordan was badly wounded as he exited the car of a white woman who was an Urban League member in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Joseph Paul Franklin, a former Ku Klux Klansman and member of the American Nazi Party who was convicted of a series of race-related murders, admitted to the ambush but was acquitted. He told authorities he hated interracial couples.",
            "After 10 years at the Urban League, Jordan wanted something different and joined Akin Gump. Tall and imposing, he earned a reputation for being a charming and persuasive “Washington wise man.” After Clinton was elected president in 1992, he chose Jordan, whom he had known since the early 1970s, to head his transition team.",
            "In 2008 when Barack Obama was running to be the first Black president, Jordan stuck by his longtime friends and supported Hillary Clinton for the Democratic Party’s nomination. According to the Financial Times, Jordan told Obama, “I am too old to trade friendship for race.”",
            "Jordan’s first wife, Shirley Jordan, died of multiple sclerosis in 1985. They had one child. In 1986 he married Ann Dibble.",

            "“The patients are, of course, going through a little bit of a difficult time, as you can imagine,” Dr. Adolphe Edward, the CEO of El Centro, said at a briefing. “This was a major accident, and we are taking care of them in the emergency room department.”",
            "In total, 25 passengers were riding in the SUV that collided with the truck, including some children, a hospital spokesperson said at a later press conference. Seven patients were taken to El Centro, including the one who died upon arrival. Three patients were taken to Pioneers Memorial Hospital, and four were flown to Desert Regional Medical Center in Palm Springs.",
            "The driver of the big rig suffered “moderate injuries” and was taken to the hospital, Sanchez told HuffPost. The driver of the SUV died.",
            "El Centro said all of the remaining patients it has are in stable condition. Their injuries include fractures, head injuries and chest injuries.",
            "UPDATE: A previous version of this story misstated the number of dead based off a statement released by the El Centro Regional Medical Center. This story has been updated with the accurate number given by the California Highway Patrol."

            "While sharing plans to beef up security ahead of potential unrest, the city of Minneapolis said it is reversing its decision to hire “social media influencers” to help spread information during former officer Derek Chauvin’s trial for the killing of George Floyd.",
            "David Rubedor, director of the city’s Neighborhood and Community Relations Department, apologized on Monday for last week’s announced hirings, saying that these individuals would not have been tasked with influencing the public, as the word “influencer” suggests, but with communicating about things like lane closures and security alerts.",
            "“This was never about trying to persuade or change public opinion about any particular message, but it was about getting important information out quickly and in an equitable way,” he said. “While I believe and support the intention of this recommendation, we have seen that the impact has caused harm in our communities, and for that, I am sorry.”",
            "The city announced last week that it would pay six social media influencers $2,000 each to help spread information during the trial, targeting Black, Native American, Somali, Hmong and Latinx communities, as local station WCCO reported. Rubedor said residents in these communities had complained of not receiving information and resources that they needed that are available through the city.",
            "The name “social media influencer,” however, immediately launched propaganda concerns and distrust within the community, which is still reeling from the death of Floyd, who was Black.",
            "Toussaint Morrison, one local community organizer who plans to provide grassroots coverage of the trial, was among those expressing concern that the influencers’ messages would be biased.",
            "Speaking with HuffPost on Monday, he said he remained unswayed by the city’s apology and wanted to see more physical work done to repair trust within the community.",
            "“Their gesture to hire social media influencers to speak to the community shows you how bad the trust has gotten,” he said, emphasizing that if you’re in a relationship, “you don’t hire people to rebuild the trust.”",
            "“The relationship’s done,” he said.",
            "Morrison suggested the city use the money allocated to these “influencers” for free meals, sending counselors to housing encampments and sending police officers to talk with people and not enforce anything.",
            "“When you break the trust with someone, you can’t just say I’m going to be here, can you meet me,” he said. “You have to clean up the mess that you made.”",
            "Chauvin faces second-degree murder and manslaughter charges after putting his knee on Floyd’s neck during an arrest last May. Floyd died, launching nationwide racial justice protests that were largely peaceful.",
            "Minneapolis city officials said Monday that they plan to have over a dozen law enforcement agencies from across the state assisting with public safety during and after Chauvin’s trial. The city plans to fully deploy law enforcement and National Guard soldiers during the trial’s closing arguments and verdict, expected around mid to late April, said Commander Scott Gerlicher of the Minneapolis Police Department’s Special Operation and Intelligence Division at Monday’s presentation.",
            "“We will be in place and ready to prevent and restore any issues until we are no longer needed. That could be a period of a very short time, or however long that needs to be, we will be there,” said Gerlicher.",
            "The soldiers and law enforcement officers are meant to focus on protecting property and accompanying fire and EMS crews responding to emergency calls. The soldiers and state troopers will also work to prevent vehicles from entering specific areas to protect pedestrians and officers, Gerlicher said.",
            "“Setting fires, damaging property, assault or riotous actions towards anybody and illegal weapons, throwing objects — these are all things that we just cannot tolerate and that our operation is designed to address,” he said."

            "As allegations of human rights violations in Xinjiang mount, with a growing number of Western lawmakers accusing China of genocide, Beijing is focusing on discrediting the female Uighur witnesses behind recent reports of abuse.",
            "Chinese officials have named women, disclosed what they say is private medical data and information on the women’s fertility, and accused some of having affairs and one of having a sexually transmitted disease. The officials said the information was evidence of bad character, invalidating the women’s accounts of abuse in Xinjiang.",
            "“To rebuke some media’s disgusting acts, we have taken a series of measures,” Xu Guixiang, the deputy head of Xinjiang’s publicity department, told a December news conference that was part of China’s pushback campaign. It includes hours-long briefings, with footage of Xinjiang residents and family members reading monologues.",
            "A Reuters review of dozens of hours of presentations from recent months and hundreds of pages of literature, as well as interviews with experts, shows a meticulous and wide-reaching campaign that hints at China’s fears that it is losing control of the Xinjiang narrative.",
            "“One reason that the Communist Party is so concerned about these testimonies from women is because it undermines their initial premise for what they’re doing there, which is anti-terrorism,” said James Millward, a professor of Chinese history at Georgetown University and expert in Xinjiang policy.",
            "“The fact that there are so many women in the camps ... who don’t have the faintest appearance of being violent people, this just shows how this has nothing to do with terrorism.”",
            "Uighurs make up most of the million people that a U.N. estimate says have been detained in Xinjiang camps under what the central government calls a campaign against terrorism. Accusations by activists and some Western politicians include torture, forced labour and sterilisations.",

            "China’s foreign ministry on Monday declined to answer questions on the specific information released about the women but said “some anti-China forces ignore facts and truth and wantonly fabricate all kinds of Xinjiang-related lies. People of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, including Xinjiang women, live and work in peace and contentment.”",
            "Beijing has rejected calls for an independent U.N. investigation into Xinjiang’s internment programme. Journalists and diplomats have not been permitted access to the camps outside of tightly controlled government tours. Uighurs in Xinjiang have told Reuters they fear reprisals for speaking to the press while in China.",
            "‘LIES AND SLANDER’",

            "In January, the Twitter account of China’s U.S. embassy was suspended for a tweet that said Uighur women had been “baby-making machines” before Beijing instituted its system of camps.",
            "“The biological, the reproductive, the gendered aspect of this is particularly horrifying to the world,” said Georgetown’s Millward. China “seems to have recognised that... You now see them trying in this clumsy way to respond.”",
            "During a regular daily press briefing last week, foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin held up images of witnesses who had described sexual abuse in Xinjiang. The account of one of them, he said, was “lies and rumours” because she had not recounted the experience in previous interviews. He gave medical details about the woman’s fertility.",
            "Xinjiang officials in January said a woman who had spoken to foreign media had syphilis, and they showed images of medical records - unsolicited information that was not directly related to her account.",
            "A Xinjiang government official said of another witness last month: “Everyone knows about her inferior character. She’s lazy and likes comfort, her private life is chaotic, her neighbours say that she committed adultery while in China.”",
            "Last week, the top spokeswoman for China’s foreign ministry, Hua Chunying, tweeted images of four named witnesses, saying they had “raked their brains for lies”, adding “they will never succeed”.",

            "The protesters in Yangon were chased as they tried to gather at their usual meeting spot at the Hledan Center intersection. Demonstrators scattered and sought in vain to rinse the irritating gas from their eyes, but later regrouped.",
            "The coup reversed years of slow progress toward democracy in Myanmar after five decades of military rule. It came Feb. 1, the same day a newly elected Parliament was supposed to take office. Ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi’s party would have led that government, but instead she was detained along with President Win Myint and other senior officials.",
            "The army has leveled several charges against Suu Kyi — an apparent effort by the military to provide a legal veneer for her detention and potentially to bar her from running in the election the junta has promised to hold in one year. On Monday, Suu Kyi made a court appearance via videoconference and was charged with two more offenses, her lawyer Khin Maung Zaw told reporters.",
            "Accused of inciting unrest, she was charged under a law that dates from British colonial days and has long been criticized as a vaguely defined catch-all law that inhibits freedom of expression. That charge carries a maximum sentence of two years in prison. The other charge from Monday carries a one-year sentence.",
            "Following her detention on the day of the coup, the 75-year-old Suu Kyi was initially held at her residence in the capital of Naypyitaw, but members of her National League for Democracy party now say they don’t know where she is.",
            "Since the takeover, a movement of protests in cities across the country has been growing — and the junta’s response has become increasingly violent.",
            "The U.N. said it had “credible information” that at least 18 people were killed and 30 were wounded across Myanmar on Sunday. Counts from other sources, such the Democratic Voice of Burma, an independent television and online news outlet, put the death toll in the 20s.",
            "Any of the reports would make it the highest single-day death toll since the military takeover. The junta has also made mass arrests, and the independent Assistance Association for Political Prisoners reported that as many as 1,000 people were detained Sunday, though it has only confirmed 270 of those. Several journalists have been among those detained, including one for The Associated Press.",
            "At least five people are believed to have been killed Sunday in Yangon when police shot at protesters, who have remained non-violent despite provocation from the security forces and pro-military counter-demonstrators.",
            "People erected makeshift sidewalk shrines Monday at the spots where several of the victims were shot and also paid their respects by standing outside the hospitals where the bodies were being released to families.",
            "In Dawei, a small city in southeastern Myanmar where an estimated five people were killed Sunday, the number of protesters on the streets Monday was lower than usual. Marchers there split into smaller groups, parading through the city to the applause of bystanders who also made the three-finger salutes adopted by the resistance movement to show their support.",
            "Confirming the deaths of protesters has been difficult amid the chaos and general lack of news from official sources, especially in areas outside Yangon, Mandalay and Naypyitaw. But in many cases, there was evidence posted online such as videos of shootings, photos of bullet casings collected afterwards and gruesome pictures of bodies.",
            "In a statement published Monday in the state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper, Myanmar’s Foreign Ministry declared that the junta “is exercising utmost restraint to avoid the use of force in managing the violent protests systematically, in accordance with domestic and international laws in order to keep minimum casualties.”",
            "But U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres strongly condemned the crackdown, calling the use of lethal force against peaceful protesters and arbitrary arrests “unacceptable,” and expressed serious concern at the increase in deaths and serious injuries, said U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric.",
            "“What the world is watching in Myanmar is outrageous and unacceptable,” the U.N.’s independent expert on human rights in Myanmar, Tom Andrews, said in a separate statement. “Words of condemnation are necessary and welcome but insufficient. The world must act. We must all act.”",
            "He proposed that countries could institute a global embargo on the sale of arms to Myanmar, “tough targeted and coordinated sanctions” against those responsible for the coup, the crackdown and other rights abuses, and sanctions against the business interests of the military.",
            "Social media posts from Myanmar have increasingly urged the international community to invoke the doctrine of the “responsibility to protect” to intervene directly to restrain the junta.",
            "Any kind of coordinated measures, however, would be difficult to implement as two permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, China and Russia, would almost certainly veto them on the basis of being opposed to interference in the internal affairs of other countries.",
            "In Washington, White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan issued a statement saying the U.S. is “alarmed” by the violence and stands in solidarity with Myanmar’s people, “who continue to bravely voice their aspirations for democracy, rule of law, and respect for human rights.”",
            "Washington has imposed sanctions on Myanmar because of the coup, and Sullivan said it would “impose further costs on those responsible,” promising details “in the coming days.”",

            "Among the arrests made Sunday, the independent Assistance Association for Political Prisoners was able to identify about 270 people, bringing to 1,132 the total number of people the group has confirmed being arrested, charged or sentenced since the coup.",

            "COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — With the floodgates set to open on another round of unemployment aid, states are being hammered with a new wave of fraud as they scramble to update security systems and block scammers who already have siphoned billions of dollars from pandemic-related jobless programs.",
            "The fraud is fleecing taxpayers, delaying legitimate payments and turning thousands of Americans into unwitting identity theft victims. Many states have failed to adequately safeguard their systems, and a review by The Associated Press finds that some will not even publicly acknowledge the extent of the problem.",
            "The massive sham springs from prior identity theft from banks, credit rating agencies, health care systems and retailers. Fraud perpetrators, sometimes in China, Nigeria or Russia, buy stolen personal identifying information on the dark web and use it to flood state unemployment systems with bogus claims.",
            "The U.S. Justice Department is investigating unemployment fraud by “transnational criminal organizations, sophisticated domestic actors, and individuals across the United States,” said Joshua Stueve, a spokesman for the department’s criminal division.",
            "The Labor Department inspector general’s office estimates that more than $63 billion has been paid out improperly through fraud or errors — roughly 10% of the total amount paid under coronavirus pandemic-related unemployment programs since March.",
            "“We’re all learning that there is an epidemic of fraud,” said U.S. Rep. Kevin Brady of Texas, the ranking Republican on the House’s powerful Ways and Means Committee. Brady said the $63 billion estimate “is larger than the entire budget of the Department of Homeland Security.”",
            "“These are frightening levels of fraud,” he said.",
            "California has been the biggest target, with an estimated $11 billion in fraudulent payments and an additional $19 billion in suspect accounts. Colorado has paid out nearly as much to scammers — an estimated $6.5 billion — as it has to people who filed legitimate unemployment claims.",
            "Other estimates, according to AP reporting across the states, range from several hundred thousand dollars in smaller states such as Alaska and Wyoming to hundreds of millions in more populous states such as Massachusetts and Ohio.",
            "The nationwide fraud has fed on twin vulnerabilities: a flood of jobless benefit applications since the pandemic began that has overwhelmed state unemployment agencies and antiquated benefit systems that are easy prey for crafty and persistent criminals.",
            "In Ohio, weekly first-time unemployment claims have ranged from 17,000 to more than 40,000 during the pandemic. But since late last month, those claims have topped more than 140,000 some weeks, with many of them believed to be fraudulent. The state has paid at least $330 million in fraudulent pandemic unemployment benefit claims.",
            "Trying to catch so many bogus claims delays payouts to Ohioans who are legitimately in need of help. In the Columbus suburb of Upper Arlington, Cynthia Sbertoli was receiving $228 a week after she was laid off in March from her job with a nonprofit that runs high school student exchange programs.",
            "Her benefits were put on hold in January after she informed the state that someone had tried to use her identity in a scam to claim benefits. She thought the problem was resolved but has yet to see a renewal of her benefit checks, which she and her husband use to help pay for a son’s vision and auditory therapy.",
            "“It’s just not a good way to take care of people,” said Sbertoli, 49.",
            "In Indiana, Kentucky and Maryland, officials have said that for certain weeks in the new year at least two-thirds of the claims they received were classified as suspicious due to problems verifying identities. It’s not the first brush with serious fraud for Maryland. In July, officials said they’d discovered a massive criminal enterprise that had stolen more than $500 million in unemployment benefits.",
            "Among states that have been hardest hit are those participating in the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program adopted by Congress last year. It has been a lifeline for out-of-work freelancers and gig workers who normally don’t qualify for unemployment insurance, but it’s also been a boon for criminals who use stolen identities to make claims. Nearly 800,000 of the 1.4 million claims Ohio has received through this program have been tagged for potential fraud.",
            "Scams have been so widespread that the U.S. Department of Justice is setting aside money to hire more prosecutors. In New York alone, the Department of Labor says it has referred “hundreds of thousands of fraud cases” to federal prosecutors.

            "Federal health officials are urging gymgoers to wear a mask at all times while exercising indoors after two separate reports published Monday found high coronavirus transmission during high-intensity exercise classes at gyms in Hawaii and Illinois.",
            "COVID-19 outbreaks in both states late last summer were linked to fitness centers that were not reliably enforcing physical distancing, consistent and correct mask use, or reminding patrons and staff to stay home when ill, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in its reports.",
            "In Illinois, the CDC said, 68% of the 81 people who attended indoor exercise classes at one unidentified Chicago facility between Aug. 24 and Sept. 1 ended up contracting the virus. Of those who contracted the virus, 44% admitted they attended an indoor exercise class either on or after the day that their symptoms first started, the CDC said.",
            "The Chicago gym’s guests were required to wear a mask upon entry, had their temperatures taken and were screened for coronavirus symptoms. Workout equipment was also stationed at least six feet apart and class sizes were minimized to help reduce virus transmission. Once exercising, however, guests were allowed to remove their masks, which is largely how the virus is believed to have spread.",
            "In addition to 76% of guests admitting to wearing masks infrequently while exercising, three people admitted to attending a class on the same day or after they received a positive COVID-19 test result, the CDC said.",
            "Unfortunately for gymgoers, these safety failures created an extremely high-risk environment for virus transmission that was rather predictable, Joshua Epstein, an epidemiology professor at NYU’s School of Global Public Health, told The Washington Post.",
            "“It’s high respiration in a closed space. Yes, people brought masks but evidently [a majority] said they wore them rarely, including some attendees with COVID. Some were symptomatic and some knew that they were positive. All of those are very, very high-risk circumstances,” he said.",
            "In the case of Hawaii, 21 COVID-19 cases were linked to a fitness instructor who taught group classes at two fitness facilities in Honolulu immediately before he started showing symptoms of the virus on June 29. One of his infected students, a 46-year-old man who worked as a personal trainer, went on to give fitness classes at a third gym before he was hospitalized for the virus.",
            "According to the CDC’s report, the fitness instructor sporadically wore a mask when he taught his group classes. During an indoor yoga class on June 27, he wore a mask while his 27 students did not. None of the participants showed symptoms of the virus in the two weeks after. Only one was tested for the virus, and they tested negative.",
            "The following day, on June 28 ― roughly 38 hours before the man began showing symptoms ― he instructed an indoor stationary cycling class for 10 people. No one wore a mask, though all participants, including the instructor, stayed at least six feet apart.",
            "“Doors and windows were closed, and three large floor fans were directed toward the participants for cooling. [The instructor] was on a pedestal facing participants, shouting instructions and encouragement,” the CDC said.",
            "Four out of the 10 participants did not test positive for the virus in the week after. The other six, who went on to attend the following day’s cycling class on June 29 with the same instructor and room setting, later tested positive for the virus. Four other people who attended that day’s class, but not the one on June 28, also tested positive.",
            "The CDC concluded that the infections were likely facilitated by the participants’ lack of masks, poor room ventilation, and possible aerosol emission from the instructor’s shouting.",
            "“Aerosol emission during speech has been correlated with loudness, and COVID-19 outbreaks related to intense physical activity and singing have been previously reported,” the report states.",
            "“To reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission in fitness facilities, staff members and patrons should wear a mask, and facilities should enforce consistent and correct mask use (including during high-intensity activities) and physical distancing,” the CDC said. Indoor ventilation should also be improved, and gyms should remind staff and patrons to stay home when sick.",
            "The CDC has previously advised gymgoers to physically distance from others, to frequently wash their hands, and to wear a mask indoors, even when exercising.",
            "“If the intensity of the exercise makes it difficult to wear a mask, it is especially important to do [that activity] outdoors away from others,” the CDC said, while recommending that individuals carry more than one mask to swap out if it gets moist from sweat.",
            "“For healthy people, wearing masks during exercise has not been shown to be harmful. However, individuals affected by lung disease, such as asthma or COPD, or heart disease, should be evaluated by a healthcare provider before attempting exercise with any mask,” the CDC added."

            "“My impression is that they will definitely go ahead with the slaughter and destruction of the animals and it’ll be difficult for us to prevent it,” he said.",
            "Masramon said he would push for the return of blood samples taken from the animals and impounded by authorities on Thursday to be released and tested “to prove if there is any bluetongue”.",
            "The Agriculture Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It said earlier on Friday that it would make appropriate decisions after analyzing information from the inspection.",
            "The vessel originally left Cartagena to deliver the cattle to Turkey. But authorities there blocked the shipment and suspended live animal imports from Spain, fearing bluetongue infection.",
            "That rejection turned the ship into an international pariah. Several countries refused it entry even to replenish animal feed, forcing the cows to go several days with just water.",
            "The cows likely have severe health problems after their “hellish” crossing, said animal rights activist Silvia Barquero, director of the Igualdad Animal NGO.",
            "“What has happened to the waste produced by all these animals for two months? We are sure they are in unacceptable sanitary conditions,” Barquero told Reuters.",
            "The Agriculture Ministry’s experts counted 864 animals alive on board. Twenty-two cows died at sea, with two corpses still aboard. The remains of the others that died were chopped up and thrown overboard during the journey, the report said.",
            "Ownership of the cattle is unclear. The exporter, World Trade, said it is not responsible because it sold the animals, Masramon said. Reuters has been unable to reach World Trade for comment.",
            "A second ship, the ElBeik, also set sail from Spain in December with a cargo of nearly 1,800 cows. It is currently moored off the Turkish Cypriot port of Famagusta.",

            "The McMichaels were arrested and charged with murder and aggravated assault months after police say the younger McMichael shot and killed the unarmed 25-year-old.

            "authors": "Melissa Jeltsen",
            "date": "2021-02-26"
        },
        "articleContent": [
            "One of the strange byproducts of the coronavirus pandemic is the effect it has had on capital punishment in the United States. In 2020, as COVID-19 tore through the nation claiming hundreds of thousands of lives, there were only 17 executions, the lowest number since 1991. Ten of them were conducted by the federal government. Only two states ― Texas and Missouri ― executed anyone once the pandemic began.",
            "As a result, the U.S. has now gone more than 230 days ― the longest period in 40 years ― without any state carrying out an execution. It is fitting that Texas, which has long led the country in the number of executions, aims to break the states’ streak next week with the planned execution of Ramiro Ibarra.",
            "In 1972, the Supreme Court ruled that the death penalty in practice was arbitrary and capricious, which resulted in a moratorium on executions until 1976 as states rewrote their capital punishment laws. Texas restarted executions in 1982 and fast gained the dubious distinction of being the death penalty capital of the U.S. In the years since, it has killed 570 people on death row, more than a third of the country’s total number of executions.",
            "Any complete history of capital punishment in the U.S. must look at Texas, and that is what Maurice Chammah ― a staff writer at The Marshall Project, a nonprofit news outlet focused on criminal justice issues ― does in his new book, “Let the Lord Sort Them: The Rise and Fall of the Death Penalty.” Meticulously detailed and carefully reported, the book examines how the U.S. came to embrace and then reject capital punishment. It tells the story of the death penalty through the eyes of those touched by it: the lawyers, family members, executioners, chaplains and death row prisoners themselves.",
            "HuffPost spoke to Chammah recently about his work. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.",
            "How did you decide to write a book on this topic?",
            "The backstory is that before I was even a journalist, I got interested in the death penalty. My first job after college was at a nonprofit in Austin called the Texas After Violence Project. It was a small research outfit that was collecting oral histories around the death penalty. I spent a year driving all throughout Texas and doing these interviews with family members of murder victims, family members of people who have been executed, prosecutors. I thought there’s such a wealth of legal history here.",
            "Fast forward a couple years and I realized journalism is the path that I wanted to be on. Over the course of my journalism career, I kept coming back to death penalty cases, and eventually around 2015 I realized that I had developed enough knowledge that I could wrap it together into a book. I was also inspired by reading a handful of key nonfiction books that try to get at big complex historical events through these very intimate glances at people’s lives, like Isabel Wilkerson’s “The Warmth of Other Suns.”",
            "I’ve noticed in my own reporting that most people have really strong feelings about the death penalty that stem from their upbringing and their moral beliefs. When you began this work, did you have a strong position on capital punishment?",
            "No, actually. I had grown up with a certain amount of discomfort at the fact that the state I lived in [Texas] was the epicenter of executions. But I had not, as a kid, thought a bunch about it.",
            "When I was younger, the dominant cultural understanding of the death penalty was [as follows]: Whether or not there are problematic cases here and there, really bad crimes are committed by really evil people and those evil people deserve the harshest punishment possible. That was pretty common and it’s still common in certain circles in the U.S. But I’ve watched that change over the course of my own journalistic career.",
            "One thing I really admired in the book is the empathy present in your reporting. You flesh out characters on both sides of the debate with nuance and understanding. Was that something that you were thinking about in designing how the book was going to be told?",
            "I didn’t want anyone in the book to come off as evil because that has just not been my experience of the world. I had met plenty of prisoners who had committed terrible crimes and they didn’t seem like bad people when I was interacting with them. I also had interviewed plenty of prosecutors who had been accused of nefarious things like hiding evidence, but who believed themselves to be trying to do the right thing.",
            "There were plenty of times during reporting and writing that I had a tendency or a desire to caricature people. The reason I ended up not doing that is partially because the people I interviewed trained me out of it. I’m thinking specifically of Danalynn [a defense attorney who plays a central role in the book]. She was defending people who committed crimes but that had trained her into seeing every kind of person ― even people on the other side of the courtroom ― with a certain amount of empathy. She then was carrying that into just all of her daily interactions, including with this reporter. I would ask questions that suggested a kind of caricature and she herself would say, well, that’s not really fair.",
            "I’m wondering what you make of the waxing and waning media coverage of the death penalty. I moved to the U.S. in 1998 and there was a lot of attention paid to it at the time because of George W. Bush’s history in Texas. Why has the attention shifted over time?",
            "That’s a really good question and there’s no one answer, obviously, because the vagaries of media coverage and public attention are really hard to define. But through the ’80s and ’90s, there was a series of high-profile cases and the way that executions got covered tended to be primarily about evil people getting their justice. I think of the ’70s through the ’90s as the heyday of the coverage of serial killers and some high-profile executions of fairly famous mass murderers. At the end of the ’90s, it’s really a coincidence of history that the governor from the most executing state runs for president and there’s a political interest in focusing on Texas and the death penalty. George Bush’s execution record was kind of an oddity on the national stage and so it attracted a lot of reporters.",
            "It reached this fever pitch where he is running for president and the country is peaking on executions. I think that there was a moment at the peak of the death penalty when there was a real appetite for questioning the sort of dominant narrative of capital punishment.",
            "And then we have 9/11. It’s an event that’s very hard to figure into the history because it is complex, but I’ve had some lawyers say to me that they feel like after 9/11, the dominant sense in American culture of who was a villain shifted from serial killers and death row prisoners to al Qaeda members and terrorists.",
            "After that point, you see the death penalty pop up into the public sphere in a huge way only when there’s a really compelling innocent case. The death penalty cases that dominate public attention between 2001 and the present include Troy Davis, Cameron Todd Willingham, Rodney Reed. There’s this tendency for the one-off cases to gather all the attention.",
            "The Trump executions shifted it yet again, from these one-off cases to a sense that this is a system and there’s systemic issues here that we need to address. It was fascinating to me to watch press coverage of the Trump executions because it felt like such a seismic shift away from the way that the death penalty was discussed in the media in the ’90s and early 2000s.",
            "What are you hoping to achieve with this book?",
            "I hope that readers come away feeling a real sense of ownership of the criminal justice system and its harsh tendencies that we all came to accept as a country 20, 30 years ago. Now, on the left and even on the right, there’s a lot of discomfort with some of the exaggerated qualities of our criminal justice system, the really harsh punishments, the overstuffed, multitudinous prisons. It can be easy to blame the past for that. I want people to have a sense of like this is our system and we are all culpable for building it and we’re also all culpable for the future. There’s a tendency in public policy to lay the blame on someone else. I wanted the book to give readers a real sense that they’re part of the system too, even if they have never thought much about the death penalty or criminal justice."

            "MELILLA, Spain (Reuters) - The last statue of former Spanish dictator Francisco Franco was removed on Tuesday from the city gates of Melilla, a Spanish enclave and autonomous city on the northwest African coast.",
            "Without much fanfare, a group of workmen operated a mechanical digger and heavy drills to chip away at the brick platform on which the statue stood, lifted it off by a chain around its neck and carted it away in bubble wrap on a pickup truck.",
            "The statue, erected three years after Franco’s death in 1978, commemorated his role as commander of the Spanish Legion in the Rif War, a conflict fought in the 1920s by Spain and France against the Berber tribes of the Rif mountainous region of Morocco.",
            "“This is a historic day for Melilla,” Elena Fernandez Trevino, in charge of education and culture in the enclave, said on Monday after the local assembly voted to take the statue down, pointing out that it was “the only statue dedicated to a dictator still in the public sphere in Europe.”",
            "Only the far-right Vox party voted against the move, arguing that the statue celebrated Franco’s military role and not his dictatorship, so the Historical Memory Law, a 2007 statute calling for the removal of all symbols connected to Franco’s regime, should not apply.",

            "Nyjah Huston, a four-time world skateboarding champion, and Edward Essa, the owner of a home in the Fairfax District in Los Angeles, held a party last month with at least 40 people that was shut down by police after receiving a complaint. At least two other parties were held at the home last fall, authorities said.",
            "Huston and Essa were both charged with creating a nuisance, a misdemeanor. Neither could be reached for comment, the Los Angeles Times reported Saturday.",
            "The Jan. 9 party took place when coronavirus cases were surging at an unprecedented rate following the holidays. Hospitals had exhausted their ICU beds capacity and officials were constantly urging residents not to gather in large groups.",
            "Officers had previously shut down events at the home on Sept. 12-13 and Oct. 17 and issued warnings to the residents that large gatherings violated the mayor’s public order, officials said.",
            "After the January party, Mayor Eric Garcetti ordered the L.A. Department of Water and Power to cut off electric service to the home in the 800 block of North Curson Avenue.",

            "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Florida was a model citizen when it came to elections in 2020. The state showed off its years of voting reforms. Even as Donald Trump railed against voting systems elsewhere, he praised Florida and urged his supporters to trust its vote-by-mail system. And, indeed, results were reported quickly and accurately. Turnout soared.",
            "It was all overseen by GOP officials. And Trump won, continuing Republicans’ growing dominance in the state.",
            "Yet three months later, Florida Republicans have set out to overhaul the state’s voting system anyway. GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis on Friday proposed an array of voting changes, while state lawmakers have introduced legislation that makes it harder to vote by mail. To explain the efforts, Florida Republicans point not to evidence of problems but to the potential for voter fraud and suspicion about the process. “We want everyone to vote, but we don’t want anyone to cheat,” DeSantis said Friday.",
            "Florida Republicans’ push to change voting laws shows how deep false claims about mass voter fraud spread by Trump have burrowed into Republicans’ belief system. The party is now stampeding to solve a problem that most nonpartisan experts and courts say does not exist. Their efforts are threatening to dismantle years of bipartisan moves to boost voting in several states, including places where the GOP has thrived under the current system.",
            "And it would result in making it more difficult to vote.",
            "“We cannot comprehend where they’re coming from,” said Anjenys Gonzalez-Eilert of Florida Common Cause, noting the GOP has long been a supporter and beneficiary of mail voting in the state.",
            "Similar efforts are being repeated across the country. State Republican lawmakers in Georgia, Arizona and Pennsylvania have introduced voting bills, many aimed at curbing mail voting.",
            "The legislation reflects Republicans’ widespread belief that new rules making it easier to vote by mail during the pandemic largely benefited Democrats and caused “irregularities.” Although there were no signs of widespread irregularities, they often point to vote totals tilted in Democrat Joe Biden’s favor as mail ballots were counted days after Election Day — a pattern that was new to many states but not a sign of fraud.",
            "But that was not an issue in Florida. It has long allowed its election offices to start the laborious process of preparing mail ballots for counting — removing them from their envelopes and verifying voters’ signatures well before Election Day. While ballot counts in many states new to mail voting dragged on for days, Florida’s count was quick and efficient.",
            "There was no evidence of fraud in Florida. Of the roughly 50 legal cases Trump and his allies brought challenging the election, none were filed in Florida. (Even in those states where Trump claimed there was fraud and tried to overturn the election, dozens of courts rejected his legal claims and no significant cases were proved.)",
            "Florida officials take pride in their recent record. Ever since the drama of the 2000 presidential election recount — when “hanging chads” turned the state into a national joke — the state has worked to shed its image as the exemplar for elections gone wrong.",
            "Election officers have worked to shore up trust in the state’s election system — by changing how ballots are designed, modernizing vote-counting equipment and investing millions of dollars to protect against cyberthreats.",
            "Even DeSantis took credit for November’s performance. “We did it right,” he said Friday before supporters in West Palm Beach.",
            "Still, he argued for tightening voting laws. His proposal includes restricting the use of drop boxes where voters can deposit mail ballots and preventing other people from dropping off voters’ ballots, a practice many label “ballot harvesting.” DeSantis also seemed to endorse the Republican bill that would make mail balloting harder by requiring voters to request a mail ballot every year, rather than allow them to make one request that stands for two years’ worth of elections.",
            "The proposal is notable because for years Republicans dominated vote by mail in Florida, and it was embraced by the state’s many older voters. It helped the GOP cement a durable statehouse majority and narrowly win statewide races.",
            "But the Republicans in Florida lost that edge last year. Trump railed against mail voting, and GOP voters’ trust in the system sank, according to polls. In Florida, his complaints alarmed state Republicans, and Trump sent out tweets stating that in Florida, where he voted by mail, the system was “Safe and Secure, Tried and True.”",
            "In the end, Democrats in the state outvoted Republicans by mail for the first time in years as a record 4.9 million Floridians voted by mail. Democrats cast 680,000 more mail ballots than Republicans did.",
            "The new bill would essentially wipe those new Democratic voters from the rolls ahead of 2022, when DeSantis and Sen. Marco Rubio lead the list of incumbent Republicans up for reelection. “Republicans used to have the advantage, and now it’s the Democrats who have the advantage. So now it’s time to make a change,” said campaign strategist Mac Stipanovich, a former Republican.",
            "“There’s no doubt that these are voter suppression efforts,” said Stipanovich, adding that the tactic in Florida could make voting by mail more difficult for people who are poor, less educated and don’t have extensive experience in voting.",
            "Republicans have pushed a similar change in Arizona, another state where GOP lawmakers helped create a bipartisan, popular system but are now moving to change it. Their effort suffered an early blow this week when the Arizona Senate voted down a bill to purge about 200,000 people from the state’s absentee voter list. One Republican senator joined all 14 Democrats to kill the measure in a 15-15 tie.",
            "In Georgia, a formerly red state that Democrats narrowly won both in November and then in two Senate runoff elections in January, lawmakers held a heated hearing over Republican proposals to curtail mail voting and eliminate early in-person voting on Sundays, when Black churches often send parishioners to the polls.",
            "In Florida, state Sen. Dennis Baxley, the bill’s author, says he isn’t trying for any partisan advantage but simply wants to reverse a 2007 measure that created the two-year window. Notably, Baxley was the lawmaker who helped pass that measure. He now says he can’t remember his reasoning at the time. “Lots has happened in 13 years,” he said. “I just think it’s time for a reset.”"

            "NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin touched a market capitalization of $1 trillion as it hit yet another record high on Friday, countering analyst warnings that it is an “economic side show” and a poor hedge against a fall in stock prices.",
            "The world’s most popular cryptocurrency jumped to an all-time high above $54,000, setting it on course for a weekly jump of more than 11%. It has surged roughly 64% so far this month and was last up 5.5% at $54,405.",
            "Bitcoin’s gains have been fueled by signs it is gaining acceptance among mainstream investors and companies, from Tesla and Mastercard to BNY Mellon.",
            "All digital coins combined have a market cap of around $1.7 trillion.",
            "“If you really believe there’s a store of value in bitcoin, then there’s still a lot of upside,” said John Wu, president of AVA Labs, an open-source platform for creating financial applications using blockchain technology.",
            "“If you look at gold, it has a market cap $9 or $10 trillion. Even if bitcoin gets to half of gold’s market cap, that still growth of 4X, or $200,000. So I don’t know when it stops rising,” he added.",
            "Still, many analysts and investors remain skeptical of the patchily regulated and highly volatile digital asset, which is little used for commerce.",
            "Analysts at JP Morgan said bitcoin’s current prices were well above estimates of fair value. Mainstream adoption increases bitcoin’s correlation with cyclical assets, which rise and fall with economic changes, in turn reducing benefits of diversifying into crypto, the investment bank said in a memo.",
            "“Crypto assets continue to rank as the poorest hedge for major drawdowns in equities, with questionable diversification benefits at prices so far above production costs, while correlations with cyclical assets are rising as crypto ownership is mainstreamed,” JP Morgan said.",
            "Bitcoin is an “economic side show,” it added, calling innovation in financial technology and the growth of digital platforms into credit and payments “the real financial transformational story of the COVID-19 era.”",
            "Other investors this week said bitcoin’s volatility presents a hurdle for it to become a widespread means of payment.",
            "On Thursday, Tesla boss Elon Musk - whose tweets have fueled bitcoin’s rally - said owning the digital coin was only a little better than holding cash. He also defended Tesla’s recent purchase of $1.5 billion of bitcoin, which ignited mainstream interest in the digital currency.",
            "Bitcoin proponents argue the cryptocurrency is “digital gold” that can hedge against the risk of inflation sparked by massive central bank and government stimulus packages designed to counter COVID-19.",
            "Yet bitcoin would need to rise to $146,000 in the long-term for its market cap to equal the total private-sector investment in gold via exchange-traded funds or bars and coins, according to JP Morgan.",
            "Rival cryptocurrency ether traded down 0.3%, at $1,934.67, still near a record of $1,951 reached earlier on Friday. It has been lifted by growing institutional interest, after its futures were launched on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.",

            "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Air Force inspector general will do a second investigation into racial and ethnic disparities across the force, service leaders said Friday, expanding the review to include gender and additional racial categories such as Asian and American Indian.",
            "The latest review comes just two months after the IG released a report concluding that Black service members in the Air Force are far more likely to be investigated, arrested, face disciplinary actions and be discharged for misconduct. The December report found that “racial disparity exists” for Black service members but that the data did not explain why it happens.",
            "The new study also reflects broader campaigns within the Defense Department and the Biden administration to root out extremism and racism. President Joe Biden declared domestic extremism an urgent national security threat in the wake of the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. The crowd that breached the building as lawmakers were preparing to certify the election was overwhelmingly white and included members of far-right groups.",
            "Acting Air Force Secretary John Roth, who ordered the latest review, said the IG will go directly to Air Force and Space Force service members for input. A survey that will go out to the force soon will look at several different categories: Asian, American Indian/Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, Hispanic/Latino and gender.",
            "“The IG team has already begun to gather information contained in a wide array of previous reports, studies and various databases across the Department of the Air Force,” Roth said. “Although the data is helpful, the most important information will come directly from our Airmen and Guardians.” Guardians are members of the Space Force.",
            "The Pentagon is also grappling with a wider effort to expand diversity within the ranks, and a campaign to tackle racism and extremism. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, earlier this month, ordered military leaders to spend time talking to their troops about extremism in the ranks, after a number of former and current military members took part in the U.S. Capitol assault.",
            "Austin said units must take a day during February or March for the so-called “stand down.”",
            "In addition, the Defense Department late last year endorsed a new slate of initiatives to more aggressively recruit, retain and promote a more racially and ethnically diverse force. And it called for a plan to crack down on participation in hate groups by service members and draft proposed changes to the Uniform Code of Military Justice.",
            "The report by the Air Force inspector general that was released in December said Black members of the Air Force and Space Force are less likely to be promoted to higher enlisted and officer ranks, and one-third of them believe they don’t get the same opportunities as their white peers."

            "The nations, ranging from Indonesia to Nigeria and Brazil, are home to the vast majority of the global population. COVAX officials expect that 145 of those countries will be able to vaccinate around 3% of their citizens by the summer.",
            "That still leaves billions without a jab that could protect them from severe illness, even as the coronavirus continues to evolve in unexpected ways and pharmaceutical companies continue to provide most of the vaccines they produce to rich nations.",
            "“The vaccine distribution has really been a story of have and have-nots,” Niko Lusiani of Oxfam America told HuffPost.",
            "In the U.S., for instance, all Americans who want a shot will be able to access one by the end of July, President Joe Biden said on Tuesday. Twelve percent of the population has already begun the process of vaccination, according to a Bloomberg tracker. And the U.S. is just the sixth in the world in terms of vaccinating its population, per The New York Times.",
            "In comparison, as of last week, nearly 130 countries had not yet delivered a single dose of vaccine to their combined population of 2.5 billion people, the WHO said.",
            "Amid a truly international crisis, governments are rejecting a united approach in favor of reinforcing inequalities on the basis of national citizenship. And that won’t only hurt residents of countries that are slow to get the vaccine. Experts believe that a lengthy global vaccination process will prolong the coronavirus’s grip on the globe. On Friday, a report in the medical journal The Lancet argued that the current inequitable distribution of vaccines leads to a greater risk of mutations that defy existing vaccines.",
            "“We have to pay attention to what’s going in the rest of the world. Otherwise, we will be constantly threatened by variants and different lineages of the virus that will have evolved outside of the United States,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, Biden’s chief medical adviser, told the “L.A. Times Today” show on Spectrum News 1 in an interview aired on Tuesday.",
            "The WHO has said halting the spread of COVID-19 means vaccinating around 70% of the global population. Not counting this month’s COVAX distribution, the Bloomberg tracker projects that at the current global vaccination rate, it will take almost five years to cover 75% of the world’s population.",
            "The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development warned last week that doing too little to fairly spread the vaccines being produced would cost the international economy upward of $9 trillion. Yet the U.S., which under Biden has begun to participate in COVAX, and similar countries are still doing relatively little to quickly supply the developing world with a reasonable amount of vaccines.",
            "The organizing principle for COVAX was that by forming a group to invest in vaccine research and production, countries could ensure that each of them would receive enough vaccines for 20% of their populations ― likely to be health workers and the elderly.",
            "“Not only from a moral perspective but from an epidemiological perspective, we would be targeting the vaccine at the most risky areas,” Oxfam’s Lusiani said.",
            "Wealthier nations committed funding to COVAX ― the U.S. has pledged $4 billion through the vaccine nonprofit Gavi ― and poorer countries agreed to buy vaccines through the mechanism or to receive donated shots.",
            "But as officials at international organizations implemented the plan, developed countries rapidly struck their own deals with vaccine manufacturers. The U.S. and the European Union have placed orders for more than 3 billion doses separately from COVAX, while COVAX has only secured 1.1 billion vaccine shots, Duke University research shows.",
            "“Rich countries went into the pharmacy and cleared the shelves. COVAX came in afterwards to try and find whatever was left,” Lusiani told HuffPost. (The Duke figures include agreements to buy vaccines that companies have not yet fully developed, tested or mass produced. Nearly all of COVAX’s current stock is the AstraZeneca-Oxford variety, though it also possesses some Pfizer vaccines.)",
            "Given that they have their own deals on top of their COVAX promises, wealthy nations are now understood to be treating COVAX stock as backups for their own stockpiles, with some humanitarian advocates asking them to commit to donating some of their national supplies to the mechanism once they hit domestic vaccine targets. But that approach has created alarming amounts of competition in the market for vaccines: At least one advanced country, Canada, has used COVAX and its own budget to secure enough vaccines for a population five times its size.",
            "“COVAX itself is competing with rich countries to buy up a limited supply and that to us is the main problem,” Lusiani said.",
            "Some poorer nations are similarly trying to secure vaccine deals outside of COVAX. One way to do so is through separate negotiations with the companies producing the drugs: Duke reports that large countries like Brazil and India have done that by touting their sizable production facilities, while smaller nations like Peru have reached deals to host clinical trials.",
            "Some countries are leaning on political strategy: China and Russia are keen to boost their relationships abroad, particularly among U.S. allies, so governments like Pakistan and Hungary have turned to them, presenting the possibility of their vaccines being used rather than Western drugs as a diplomatic win.",
            "This mishmash of approaches is unlikely to produce a comprehensive solution, however ― and it could lead to broken promises with deadly consequences as firms working with new technology fail to meet all the vast commitments they have made.",
            "Instead, aid groups like Oxfam want a cohesive strategy that prioritizes vaccine delivery over corporate concerns like preventing other companies from learning how to make patented vaccines and securing the highest price from countries in a global bidding war.",
            "“That’ll benefit all of us,” Lusiani said."

            "WASHINGTON (AP) — Deadly weather will be hitting the U.S. more often, and America needs to get better at dealing with it, experts said as Texas and other states battled winter storms that blew past the worst-case planning of utilities, governments and millions of shivering residents.",
            "This week’s storms — with more still heading east — fit a pattern of worsening extremes under climate change and demonstrate anew that local, state and federal officials have failed to do nearly enough to prepare for greater and more dangerous weather.",
            "At least two dozen people have died this week, including from fire or carbon monoxide poisoning while struggling to find warmth inside their homes. In Oklahoma City, an Arctic blast plunged temperatures in the state capital as low as 14 degrees below 0 (-25 Celsius).",
            "“This is a different kind of storm,″ said Kendra Clements, one of several businesspeople in Oklahoma City who opened their buildings to shelter homeless people, some with frostbite, hypothermia and icicles in their hair. It was also a harbinger of what social service providers and governments say will be a surge of increased needs for society’s most vulnerable as climate and natural disasters worsen.",
            "Other Americans are at risk as well. Power supplies of all sorts failed in the extreme cold, including natural gas-fired power plants that were knocked offline amid icy conditions and, to a smaller extent, wind turbines that froze and stopped working. More than 100 million people live in areas under winter weather warnings, watches or advisories, and blackouts are expected to continue in some parts of the country for days.",
            "The crisis sounded an alarm for power systems throughout the country: As climate change worsens, severe conditions that go beyond historical norms are becoming ever more common. Texas, for example, expects power demand to peak in the heat of summer, not the depths of winter, as it did this week.",
            "The dire storms come as President Joe Biden aims to spend up to $2 trillion on infrastructure and clean energy investment over four years. Biden has pledged to update the U.S. power grid to be carbon-pollution free by 2035 as well as weatherize buildings, repair roads and build electric vehicle charging stations.",
            "“Building resilient and sustainable infrastructure that can withstand extreme weather and a changing climate will play an integral role” in creating jobs and meeting Biden’s goal of “a net-zero emissions future,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday.",
            "The storms are big news this week, especially in light of their effect on COVID-19 vaccinations as well as freezing Americans, but that doesn’t mean they won’t become more common, experts say.",
            "“This definitely was an anomaly,″ but one that is likely to occur more frequently as a result of climate change, said Sara Eftekharnejad, assistant professor of electrical engineering and computer science at Syracuse University.",
            "“There probably needs to be better planning, because we’re starting to see more extreme weather events across the country,″ she said, whether it’s severe cold in Texas or the intense heat wave in California last year that fueled deadly wildfires.",
            "Better forecasting — both short-term and long-term — would help avoid catastrophic failures such as the current outages in Texas and other states, as would large-scale storage systems that can supply electricity when demand spikes and a greater diversity of power sources, Eftekharnejad and other experts said.",
            "Climate change also is hurting military readiness. Damage from a 2018 hurricane at Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida and 2019 flooding at Nebraska’s Offutt Air Force Base, for example, led the Pentagon to send service members as far away as Britain to train.",
            "Another 2018 hurricane that hit North Carolina’s Camp Lejeune, home to one-third of the U.S. Marine Corps’ capability, caused enough damage to degrade training overall, senior U.S. military authorities concluded.",
            "Hardening military installations against worsening natural disasters will cost trillions. But it has to be done, said Joan VanDervort, a former longtime Defense Department climate expert now with the Center for Climate and Security think tank. “We have eyes overseas that are looking at our vulnerability and seeing how we respond. ... There are enemies out there that will certainly take advantage of it.”",
            "Michael Craig, an assistant professor of energy systems at the University of Michigan, said the events in California and Texas show that “what we have now is not going to do it in the face of climate change. It’s only going to get worse from here.″",
            "The disaster in Texas and other states “is a reminder that our nation’s critical infrastructure is vulnerable to extreme weather events and we can no longer turn a blind eye to the resiliency investments needed to protect it,″ said Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, who met with Biden at the White House last week.",
            "“The cost associated with addressing climate change and improving our infrastructure’s resilience is always going to be less than the cost of rebuilding or failing to act,″ Carper said.",
            "Meanwhile, federal regulators are looking into the operations of the bulk-power system during the severe winter storm that affected states from Louisiana to Minnesota.",
            "In Texas, where wind power is a growing source of electricity, the wind turbines generally are not equipped to withstand extended low temperatures, as they are in Iowa and other cold-weather states. Modifying the turbines slightly to withstand freezing temperatures is one step needed to confront climate change, said Roy McCann, professor of electrical engineering at the University of Arkansas.",
            "While some Republican politicians, including Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, have tried to pin blame on wind and solar power for the outages, traditional thermal power plants, which rely mostly on natural gas, provide the bulk of power in the state and were the larger problem.",

            "She made even more history on Thursday in Japan, where women are still rare in the boardrooms and positions of political power.",
            "The 56-year-old Hashimoto was named president of the Tokyo Olympic organizing committee after a meeting of its executive board, which is 80% male. She replaces 83-year-old Yoshiro Mori, a former Japanese prime minister who was forced to resign last week after making sexist comments about women.",
            "Essentially, he said women talk too much.",
            "“Now I’m here to return what I owe as an athlete and to return back what I received,” Hashimoto told the board, according to an interpreter.",
            "Hashimoto had been serving as the Olympic minister in the cabinet of Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga. She also held a portfolio dealing with gender equality and women’s empowerment. She said she would be replaced as Olympic minister by Tamayo Marukawa.",
            "She brought up the issue of gender equality repeatedly, and focused on problems at the organizing committee, which is male-dominated, has no female vice presidents and has an executive board made up of 80% men. It employs about 3,500 people.",
            "“Of course, it is very important what Tokyo 2020 as an organizing committee does about gender equality,” she said, sitting between two males — CEO Toshiro Muto and spokesman Masa Takaya. “I think it will be important for Tokyo 2020 to practice equality.”",
            "International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach said Hashimoto was “the perfect choice” for the job.",
            "“With the appointment of a woman as president, the Tokyo 2020 Organizing Committee is also sending a very important signal with regard to gender equality,” Bach said in a statement.",
            "Hashimoto competed in cycling in three Summer Olympics (1988, 1992 and 1996) and in speedskating in four Winter Olympics (1984, 1988, 1992 and 1994). She won a bronze medal — her only medal — at the 1992 Albertville Games in speedskating. According to historian Dr. Bill Mallon, her seven appearances is the most by any “multi-season” athlete in the games.",
            "Japan-born Naomi Osaka, speaking about Hashimoto after her semifinal victory over Serena Williams at the Australian Open, said “you’re seeing the newer generation not tolerate a lot of things.”",
            "“I feel like it’s really good because you’re pushing forward, barriers are being broken down, especially for females,” Osaka said. “We’ve had to fight for so many things just to be equal. Even a lot of things we still aren’t equal.”",
            "The new president is tied to the Olympics in many ways. She was born in Hokkaido in northern Japan just five days before the opening ceremony of the 1964 Tokyo Games. Her name “Seiko” comes from “seika,” which translates as Olympic flame in English.",
            "According to widely circulated reports in Japan, Hashimoto was reluctant to take the job and was one of three final candidates considered by a selection committee headed by 85-year-old Fujio Mitarai of the camera company Canon.",
            "The selection committee met for three consecutive days, a rushed appointment with the postponed Olympics opening in just over five months in the middle of a pandemic and facing myriad problems.",
            "Polls show about 80% of the Japanese public want the Olympics canceled or postponed again. There is fear about bringing tens of thousands of athletes and others into Japan, which has controlled the coronavirus better than most countries. There is also opposition to the soaring costs.",
            "The official cost is $15.4 billion, though several government audits say the price is at least $25 billion, the most expensive Summer Olympics on record according to a University of Oxford study.",
            "Naming a woman could be a breakthrough for gender equality in Japan, where females are under-represented in boardrooms and in politics. Japan ranks 121st out of 153 countries on the World Economic Forum’s annual gender equality ranking.",
            "Mori, before stepping down, tried to offer the job last week to 84-year-old Saburo Kawabuchi, a former head of the country’s soccer federation. But reports of the behind-closed-door deal were widely criticized by social media, on Japanese talk shows, and in newspaper reports.",
            "Kawabuchi quickly withdrew from further consideration.",
            "Hashimoto is not without her critics. A Japanese magazine in 2014 ran photographs of her kissing figure skater Daisuke Takahashi at a party during the Sochi Olympics, suggesting it was sexual harassment, or power harassment. She later apologized, and Takahashi said he did not feel harassed.",
            "“About my reckless actions, I feel regret for an action I took seven years ago,” she said when asked about it on Thursday. “Back then as well as today, I am still reflecting on myself and what I have done — and what it has evolved into.”",
            "Two other former Olympians were also reported to have been in the running for Mori’s job: Yasuhiro Yamashita, the president of the Japanese Olympic Committee who won gold in judo in 1984, and Mikako Kotani, who won two bronze medals in synchronized swimming at the 1988 Seoul Olympics.",
            "Kotani is the sports director for the Tokyo Olympic organizing committee. That committee’s leadership is dominated by men, who make up 80% of the executive board.",
            "Japan began to roll out vaccines on Wednesday, a critical move that might boost the Olympics. It is several months behind Britain, the United States and other countries.",
            "Widespread vaccination is unlikely in Japan when the Olympics open on July 23 with 11,000 athletes, followed by the Paralympics on Aug. 24 with 4,400 athletes. The plan is to keep the athletes in a “bubble” at the Athletes Village, at venues and at training areas. The IOC has said it will not require “participants” to be vaccinated, but is encouraging it.",
            "In addition to the athletes, tens of thousands of officials, media, sponsors and broadcasters will also have to enter Japan. Many of them will operate outside the “bubble” in an Olympics that is driven by television and the billions the IOC receives from selling broadcast rights.",
            "The first challenge for Hashimoto could be pulling off the torch relay that begins on March 25 in northeastern Japan. It will crisscross the country with about 10,000 runners, and end at the opening ceremony in Tokyo."

            "As nightfall threatened to plummet temperatures again into single digits, officials warned that homes still without power would likely not have heat until at least Tuesday, as frustration mounted and the state’s electric grid came under growing demand and criticism.",
            "“Things will likely get worse before they get better,” said Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo, the top elected official in the county of nearly 5 million people around Houston.",
            "Law enforcement reported two men were found dead along Houston-area roadways. Causes of death were pending, but officials said the subfreezing temperatures were likely to blame.",
            "The toll of the worsening conditions included the delivery of new COVID-19 vaccine shipments, which were expected to be delayed until at least midweek. Massive power outages across Houston included a facility storing 8,000 doses of Moderna vaccine, leaving health officials scrambling to find takers at the same time authorities were pleading for people to stay home.",
            "Temperatures nosedived into the single-digits as far south as San Antonio, and homes that had already been without electricity for hours had no certainty about when the lights and heat would come back on, as the state’s overwhelmed power grid began imposing blackouts that are typically only seen in 100-degree Fahrenheit (38-degree Celsius) summers.",
            "The storm was part of a massive system that brought snow, sleet and freezing rain to the southern Plains and was spreading across the Ohio Valley and to the Northeast. The Southwest Power Pool, a group of utilities across 14 states, called for rolling outages because the supply of reserve energy had been exhausted. Some utilities said they were starting blackouts, while others urged customers to reduce power usage.",
            "“We’re living through a really historic event going on right now,” said Jason Furtado, a professor of meteorology at the University of Oklahoma, pointing to all of Texas under a winter storm warning and the extent of the freezing temperatures.",

            "“This weather event, it’s really unprecedented. We all living here know that,” said Dan Woodfin, senior director of system operations at the Electric Reliability Council of Texas. He defended preparations made by grid operators and described the demand on the system as record-setting.\n\n“This event was well beyond the design parameters for a typical, or even an extreme, Texas winter that you would normally plan for. And so that is really the result that we’re seeing,” Woodfin said.",

            "The largest grocery store chain in Texas, H-E-B, closed locations around Austin and San Antonio, cities that are unaccustomed to snow and have few resources to clear roads. The slow thaw and more frigid lows ahead was also taking a toll on Texas’ distribution of COVID-19 vaccines.",
            "State health officials said Texas, which was due to receive more than 400,000 additional vaccine doses this week, now does not expect deliveries to occur until at least Wednesday.",
            "The weather also put existing vaccine supply in jeopardy. Rice University on Monday abruptly began offering vaccines on its closed Houston campus after Harris Health System told the school it had about 1,000 vaccines that “were going to go to waste,” said Doug Miller, a university spokesman.",

Schneider said she didn’t feel comfortable driving with the roads covered in snow and ice. She said she hadn’t seen a serious snowfall in Dallas since her childhood.",
            "“I really didn’t think it’s would be this serious,” Schneider said.",
            "Teresa and Luke Fassetta, trundling through the snow carrying grocery bags, said the store lost power while they were shopping. The couple said they lost power overnight, then got it back around 9 a.m., and they were hoping it would still be on when they arrived home. If not, Teresa said, “we just have a bunch of blankets and candles and two cats to keep us warm.”",

By midmorning, 3,000 flights had been canceled across the country, about 1,600 of them at Dallas/Fort Worth International and Bush Intercontinental airports in Texas. At DFW, the temperature was 4 degrees Fahrenheit (-15 degrees Celsius) — 3 degrees (-16 degrees) colder than Moscow.",
            "In Houston, officials said Bush Intercontinental Airport runways would remain closed until at least 1 p.m. Tuesday, a day longer than previously expected.",
            "The storm arrived over a three-day holiday weekend that has seen the most U.S. air travel since the period around New Year’s. More than 1 million people went through airport security checkpoints on Thursday and Friday. However, that was still less than half the traffic of a year ago, before the pandemic hit with full force.",
            "The southern Plains had been gearing up for the winter weather for the better part of the weekend. Texas Gov.

Asa Hutchinson each activated National Guard units to assist state agencies with tasks including rescuing stranded drivers.",

            "YANGON, Myanmar (AP) — Security forces in Myanmar intensified their crackdown against anti-coup protesters on Monday, seeking to quell the large-scale demonstrations calling for the military junta that seized power earlier this month to reinstate the elected government.",
            "More than 1,000 protesters were rallying in front of the Myanmar Economic Bank in Mandalay, the country’s second-largest city, when at least 10 trucks full of soldiers and police arrived and started firing slingshots toward the protesters before they even got out of the trucks, according to a photographer who witnessed the events.",
            "The soldiers and police then attacked the protesters with sticks and slingshots, and police could be seen aiming long guns into the air amid sounds that resembled gunfire. Local media reported that rubber bullets were also fired into the crowd, and that a few people were injured.",
            "Police were also seen pointing guns toward the protesters.",
            "In the capital, Naypyitaw, protesters gathered outside a police station demanding the release of a group of high school students who were detained while joining in anti-coup activities.",
            "One student who managed to escape told reporters that the pupils — thought to range in age from 13 to 16 — were demonstrating peacefully when a line of riot police suddenly arrived and began arresting them. It wasn’t clear exactly how many students were rounded up, but estimates put the figure at between 20 and 40.",
            "Earlier Monday, Myanmar’s military leaders extended their detention of deposed leader Aung San Suu Kyi, whose remand was set to expire and whose freedom is a key demand of the crowds of people continuing to protest the Feb. 1 coup.",
            "Suu Kyi will now be remanded until Feb. 17, when she will likely appear in court by videoconference, according to Khin Maung Zaw, a lawyer asked by Suu Kyi’s party to represent her. The Nobel laureate remains under house arrest on a minor charge of possessing unregistered imported walkie-talkies.",
            "Suu Kyi’s extended detention is likely to further inflame tensions between the military and the protesters who have taken to the streets of cities across the Southeast Asian nation seeking the return of the government they elected.",
            "Protesters continued to gather across Myanmar on Monday, following a night in which authorities cut the country’s internet access and increased the security presence in major cities seeking to curtail demonstrations.",
            "Thousands of engineers marched on the streets of Mandalay chanting and holding signs that read: “Free our leader,” “Who stands with justice?” and “Stop arresting people illegally at midnight.”",
            "In Yangon, the country’s most populous city, fewer protesters gathered on Monday due to the loss of the internet and reports of military vehicles on the streets. Nevertheless, more than 1,000 anti-coup demonstrators were outside the Central Bank of Myanmar building, where there were also military trucks full of soldiers, riot police, water cannon trucks and armored personnel carriers.",
            "Demonstrators carried placards that read “#SupportCDM #SaveMyanmar.” CDM refers to the civil disobedience movement that has seen doctors, engineers and others in Myanmar refuse to work until the military releases elected political leaders and returns the country to civilian rule.",
            "Some protesters posed for photographs in front of military vehicles while holding red signs that read “Join in CDM.”",
            "When the military seized power, it detained Suu Kyi and members of her government and prevented recently elected lawmakers from opening a new session of Parliament. The junta, led by Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, said it stepped in because the government failed to properly investigate allegations of fraud in last year’s election, which Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy party won in a landslide. The state election commission refuted that contention, saying there is no evidence to support it.",
            "The military justified its move by citing a clause in the 2008 constitution, implemented during military rule, that says in cases of national emergency, the government’s executive, legislative and judicial powers can be handed to the military commander-in-chief.",
            "It is just one of many parts of the charter that ensured the military could maintain ultimate control over the country it ruled for 50 years following a 1962 coup. The military is allowed to appoint its members to 25% of seats in Parliament and it controls several key ministries involved in security and defense.",
            "An order on Sunday that appeared to be from the Ministry of Transport and Communications told mobile phone service providers to shut down internet connections from 1 a.m. to 9 a.m. Monday. It circulated widely on social media, as did a notice said to be from service provider Oredoo Myanmar containing the same details.",
            "On Sunday, ambassadors from the United States and Canada and 12 European nations called on Myanmar’s security forces to refrain from violence against those “protesting the overthrow of their legitimate government.”",

            "The Southwest Power Pool, a group of utilities covering 14 states, imposed rolling two-hour blackouts to ease the extreme demand for heat and electricity, saying they were “a last resort to preserve the reliability of the electric system as a whole.”",
            "The outages forced a Texas county to scramble to get more than 8,000 doses of Moderna’s coronavirus vaccine into arms after a public health facility lost power early Monday and its backup generator also failed, said Rafael Lemaitre, a spokesman for Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo.",

            "As more details emerged about coronavirus, Meyer realised Gill had displayed several symptoms of the disease, including low oxygen levels, lethargy and losing his appetite.",
            "She contacted his specialist asking if there was a possibility of it having been coronavirus and discovered they were already investigating. “They were trying to locate tissue samples to test as they couldn’t understand why Andy had become so ill.",
            "“The specialist said, as they’d learned more about Covid-19, they began thinking there was a real possibility Andy might have been infected by it.”",
            "Unfortunately, the right tissue samples weren’t found to test and Gill was cremated so Mayer accepts she will “never know” for certain. However, she and medical and scientific experts believe it is likely Gill had coronavirus.",
            "She has tracked family and friends in contact with Gill at the time of his illness and discovered others got sick – including the band’s 26-year-old tour manager who was hospitalised with “respiratory distress”.",
            "Mayer, who has co-written the book Good Grief: Embracing Life at a Time of Death, with her mother, told HuffPost UK the grim milestone of 100,000 coronavirus deaths being surpassed is “particularly painful” for those who lost loved ones not even counted in that figure.",
            "“It is a horrific figure and the death toll in the UK has been enormous,” she said. “Andy would have been a very early coronavirus death and there will be an awful lot of people who were not recognised in the first wave of this pandemic.",
            "“We are now confronted by the narrative of the government saying they ‘did all they could’ when they manifestly didn’t.”",
            "Mayer says understanding when coronavirus first hit the UK is crucial for learning lessons. “It isn’t a question of blame,” she said. “But the issue of when it was first here is linked to the slowness of response.",
            "“Knowing when the virus first emerged is an integral part of understanding its nature and ability to change and makeshift.”",
            "Mayer added: “China was massively at fault for not notifying people about the true extent of coronavirus fast enough.",
            "“But this was compounded by having a UK government who just didn’t take it seriously enough at first.”",

            "Daughter Ozel Ekrem, 40, who lives in London with her husband and two daughters, last saw her father in person on March 8 when they all enjoyed a family barbecue.",
            "At that point, she said, everyone was living life normally as the government messaging suggested little to worry about.",
            "“Things were terrible in Italy but as the government didn’t seem worried enough to take action, it made the public think there was no need to be concerned,” she said.",
            "“The government was saying at that stage it was only the elderly who were affected so even when my dad became ill and went to hospital, we thought: ‘He’s only 60, he’ll be OK.’”",
            "Ekrem says it was actually her mother who became ill first around the middle of March 2020 and went to A&E with breathing difficulties concerned about her angina. “They told my mum she would either get better or worse and sent her home. They should have tested her for coronavirus.”",
            "Then Niyazi, a British Cypriot who was a restaurateur before working in catering supplies, began struggling with his breathing too, and was admitted to hospital.",
            "He was not sent to intensive care or put on a ventilator and Ekrem says the family spoke to him daily via video messaging and never anticipated his death.",
            "“I spoke to him through FaceTime that morning and he gave me a thumbs up. I feel robbed of my kind and generous dad and never got the chance to say goodbye.”",
            "Ekrem, who works in public relations, was still attending large scale events around the time she last saw her dad. His grandchildren were still at school and her mum was still going to work as a teacher.",
            "“I feel guilty now – what if I took coronavirus to my dad from London when I last saw him?” she said. “Or what if he got it from his grandchildren going to school? Or what if my mum had it when she was ill and the hospital sent her home without testing and she infected her husband?",
            "“We understand the seriousness of coronavirus now, but when my dad became ill, we hadn’t even gone into lockdown.",
            "“The information in the beginning was very poor and precautions were zero.”",
            "Serap, who was married to Niyazi for 40 years with three children and six grandchildren, told HuffPost UK that if it had been known that coronavirus was around earlier in the UK, action could have been taken to prevent such a huge death toll.",
            "“I’m absolutely devastated and still cannot believe he has gone,” she said. “We couldn’t even bury him properly as a Muslim as he could not have the formal prayers in the mosque.",
            "“A Transit van took him to the funeral as funeral cars wouldn’t take Covid patients, There were only a few of us and we were only allowed 15 minutes. We couldn’t even throw soil as the digger did that.",
            "“He wasn’t even given the dignity of a proper burial or prayers.”",
            "She added: “None of the 100,000-plus people who have died deserved this. We should have shut down everything earlier.”",
            "Sarah Nicola, 46, of Cumbria, lost her mum Helen, 79, to coronavirus on March 25, 2020, two days after she was admitted to hospital. Doctors suspected Covid but only received the positive result after her death.",
            "“We couldn’t believe it when they said it was coronavirus as my mum didn’t go anywhere or go out,” she said. “However, district nurses went round to dress her weeping legs from water retention. We believe she got it from a nurse who didn’t have PPE and later had symptoms and was quarantined.”",
            "Nicola says her mum had the underlying health condition of heart failure, but this was managed with medication and she “would still be here if it wasn’t for Covid” as her illness was manageable.",
            "She believes the government was “very much minimising the disease” in the early days and only telling people to look for certain symptoms including a dry continuous cough.",
            "“Lockdown came too late,” she said. “If the government had relayed the seriousness of everything, we would have made sure we didn’t have any district nurses or carers coming into the home and managed ourselves.",
            "“Coronavirus must have been around for a long time before they realised. But the government was trying to play it down.",
            "“Finding out the situation late on will have caused so many needless deaths.”",
            "Experts say coronavirus was widespread in the UK much earlier than initially thought with people returning from Christmas holidays abroad and skiing holidays reporting classic Covid symptoms.",
            "A coronavirus tracking app designed by scientists at King’s College, London, has hinted at sustained community transmission of Covid-19 in the UK as early as December 2019.",
            "Tim Spector, lead scientist on the Zoe Covid symptom study app and professor of genetic epidemiology at King’s College, London, told HuffPost UK that many people reported their symptoms retrospectively and they have seen “large numbers reporting classic Covid symptoms between Christmas and New Year and in some cases, even earlier”.",
            "“Finding out about deaths that happened earlier teaches us lessons about how poor our surveillance in the early part of last year was,” he said.",
            "“It was just not picked up on at all.”",
            "Spector says one of the issues was that initially the government only recognised a few symptoms of Covid – while their app has 24 symptoms listed, including loss of smell which the government did not recognise until May.",
            "“We have had e-mails and anecdotes from hundreds and thousands of people saying they had symptoms since December.",
            "“There is no doubt in my mind that these people had Covid. If there had been testing then, they would have shown as positive.",
            "“The commonest source was people going abroad for Christmas and going on skiing holidays.”",
            "Spector told HuffPost UK that while these reports show coronavirus was around in December or even earlier, the UK didn’t notice as a country until mid-February.",
            "“It exposes how slow we were to react. We were in denial,” he said.",
            "“The delay in picking up coronavirus cases changed our attitude to the first lockdown. People thought the numbers weren’t that high and that we had more time.”",
            "Spector added: “We are catching up and need to learn from our past mistakes and be better at planning.",
            "“There are many people who became ill and even died of coronavirus early on who were not recognised. It was definitely underestimated.”"

            "The epicentre of the earthquake was off the coast of Fukushima prefecture at a depth of 60 km (36 miles), the Japan Meteorological Agency said.",

            "MONTREAL — As the Lunar New Year begins, many in Montreal’s Chinatown hope the year of the Ox will bring a better fortune than the last.",
            "But restauranteur Benny Shek doesn’t dare to hope for the future.",
            "“Today is an exception,” he said, bluntly, pointing at his temporary staff of eight scrambling to put together orders for poon choi, a Cantonese dish made with carefully layered abalone, mushrooms, shrimp, fish, pork and chicken and eaten during Chinese New Year.",
            "A year ago, his Chinatown restaurant, Kim Fung, was bustling. On weekends, tourists and locals alike would be queuing to get inside the popular restaurant known for its dim sum and Cantonese fare.",
            "Now, the once busy Shek remains grounded, seated around a flurry of tablets and portable phones, fielding orders from six different delivery apps he’s signed up for since the pandemic.",
            "Takeaway, he said, is not how Chinese food should be enjoyed.",
            "“Chinese food is meant to be eaten here — hot!” Shek, 63, said.",
            "The Hong Kong native said he’s only making 10 per cent of his usual sales. He’s laid off almost all of his 25 staff, leaving behind two — a waitress and cook.",
            "Kim Fung restaurant is known for its dim sum, but diners can’t enjoy the traditional cart service, pictured here in this post by twofoodphotographers.",
            "Racism, work-from-home, lack of tourism all blows to Chinatown’s health",
            "One year on, Chinatown, situated by the Old Port — is home to 160 businesses employing 400 people — is fighting for its survival. At the height of the pandemic, Montreal was considered the seventh deadliest place in the world for COVID-19 related deaths due outbreaks in old-age residences.",
            "Due to this stigma, Chinatown and the Chinese community were disproportionately affected by increased cases of racism, vandalism and break-ins. Last year, local leaders asked the government for $1 million in relief funds to save Chinatown and revitalize the area. Consultations are still underway, and nothing has been finalized.",
            "The bulk of Chinatown’s clientele — tourists and office workers — have stayed away due to travel bans and work-from-home measures. With the recent 8 p.m. curfew in Montreal, it has placed added strain on businesses.",
            "The city is also home to the most restaurants per capita in North America, and when the pandemic hit, Chinatown’s cash-only businesses had to quickly adapt to new measures of contactless payments and delivery apps that take up to 30 per cent commission fees.",
            "Younger, social-media savvy restauranteurs were able to hit the ground running when dine-in service closed again in September. Meanwhile, older mom-and-pop shops who refrained from delivery apps or social media were left behind. With local, elderly residents remaining mostly indoors, foot traffic to Chinatown suffered as well.",
            "Joe Lee, 40, owner of Chinese restaurant Mon Nan, said it’s been difficult being open four hours a day due to the curfew, versus his usual 3 a.m. closing time a year ago. Since then, he’s had to lay off 40 per cent of his staff and rely on delivery apps, but he wished the companies would lower the commission fees as seen in B.C. and Ontario, where they have dropped to 15 per cent.",
            "On the upside, his wife, Shan Cheung, 35, used social media for promotion and brought 20 per cent new clientele.",
            "One lesson from the pandemic, Lee learned, is to scale down the menu after COVID-19.",
            "“We don’t need 200 items, maybe just 30, tops,” Lee said.",
            "Nearby Cantonese barbeque restaurant Dobe and Andy echoed similar experiences. Co-owner Eric Ku, 38, said he and his two brothers attracted new clientele through Instagram and opened a takeaway counter through the summer.",
            "“It had a food-truck vibe,” Ku said, explaining how the pandemic has given him time to re-imagine the restaurant. Similar to Lee, scaling down the menu, testing modern recipes and refining items to warrant a small price increase, will be his next task. Ku said this Chinese New Year will be different, with no lion dances coming through Chinatown and smaller family dinners.",
            "Dobe and Andy’s owners have driven business through their strong Instagram presence, and it’s evidently paying off for Chinese New Year.",
            "To combat anti-Asian sentiments earlier this year, Chinatown community members partnered with restaurants to distribute thousands of fortune cookies with different messages, such as: “Discrimination hurts; solidarity cures.”",
            "Local food blogger, Jason Lee, commends such campaigns, but was disappointed by the lack of allyship outside the community to condemn racism against Asians.",
            "“Why are [the Chinese community] the only ones finding ways to educate people not to be racist?” Lee asked.",
            "Racism is a topic some Asians are shy to discuss, but it’s happening. Elderly folks are most vulnerable; many Asian restaurants employ older staff as cooks, waiters and delivery drivers, and some have been racially attacked.",
            "“Personally, I was verbally sworn [at] repeatedly in the bus on my way home. This was the very week ‘[former US President Trump] called the coronavirus on television ‘kung flu’ and the ‘China virus,’” wrote Montreal Chinese Association vice-president Bryant Chang, 69, in a text. He works as a part-time food delivery driver for Mirama restaurant. He added racism against Asian people has been “very real and visible on all fronts” after COVID-19.",
            "Statistics Canada published a survey in July 2020 saying 30 per cent of respondents who identified as Chinese said they’ve perceived an “increase in harassment or attacks on the basis of race, ethnicity, or skin colour” since the start of the pandemic.",
            "In the US., there’s been a spate of attacks against elderly Asian-Americans recently. A Thai man was violently pushed to his death and a Filipino man was slashed in the face with a boxcutter on the New York City subway. Celebrities such as Daniel Dae Kim and Daniel Wu have spoken up about the attacks, calling for help and offering a $25,000 cash reward for information on the suspects.",
            "Fo Niemi, executive director of the Center for Research-Action on Race Relations, said more reporting is needed. With an older, immigrant population such as Chinatown, many are reluctant to report racist incidents.",
            "“Asians are perceived as ‘model minorities’,” Niemi said, adding that culturally, it’s uncommon for Chinese targets to voice their troubles publicly. Many unknown victims may be suffering in silence.",
            "But some who know the area well have faith in its resilience. Since the times of prohibition, Chinatown has constantly reinvented itself, said Melissa Simard, founder of Round Table Tours and Chinatown food guide since 2015.",
            "In the past, Chinatown was a place to satiate vices. There was the red-light district, massage parlours, opium dens and illegal gambling houses. “It was a party place,” Simard said, adding the area cleaned up after The Second World War and later became more pan-Asian with the wave of immigration in the 1980s and exodus of Cantonese speakers to the suburbs.",
            "Simard said she’s confident Chinatown will weather the pandemic. “It’s been through worse,” she said.",
            "As for Shek, Lee and Ku, they believe they can stay afloat at least until the summer. But change will need to come quickly.",
            "“Chinatown is already fading. For it to survive, it needs to be revitalized, or else it will die,” said Lee."

For the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Class of 2021, high school would never be about Friday night football and innocent first kisses.",

            "The shooting catapulted some students into the spotlight as they rallied for gun control and landed on the cover of Time magazine. But that was just a sliver of the experience of those in this largely affluent, palm-tree studded suburb. In the shadows, many struggle at times to manage daily life.",

He joined the student-led March For Our Lives, registered first-time voters in various states and now works on gun-reform policy. He sounds assured and self-confident in his passion for enacting change, but it’s been a process.",
            "“I was trying to be an activist whereas inside I wasn’t very OK with myself,” Servaites said. “I’ve learned to cope. I’ve learned to come to terms with what I’ve gone through.”",

But at the same time I know I wouldn’t be able to handle it,” said 17-year-old Siccone, who avoids malls, movie theaters and other public places.

            "A federal magistrate judge in Virginia ordered Eduardo Nicolas Alvear Gonzalez to remain jailed and transferred to Washington, D.C., for his next hearing on charges related to the Jan. 6 siege.",
            "Gonzalez, 32, of Ventura, California, was dubbed “The Capitol Rotunda Doobie Smoker” on a video posted on YouTube. When somebody on the video asked why he was smoking weed in the Capitol, Gonzalez responded in part by saying, “Freedom,” according to the FBI.",
            "Gonzalez bragged about handing out marijuana to others who stormed the Capitol and could be heard saying, “Time to smoke weed in here!” on a video, Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew Bosse said.",
            "Bosse said Gonzalez frequently posts videos about conspiracy theories on YouTube to an audience that he claims numbers in the tens of thousands.",
            "“He has fallen under the sway of a web of conspiracy theories that is not just bizarre but dangerous,” Bosse said.",
            "Gonzalez has talked on his videos about believing that we may be living in a simulation, that the Earth is flat and that the Smithsonian Institution is hiding evidence of giants, according to Bosse. Gonzalez also promotes central tenets of the QAnon conspiracy theory, including the baseless beliefs that Hollywood celebrities and other elites are operating a Satanic child sex trafficking cult and sacrificing children, the prosecutor said.",
            "“This is sheer wild-eyed nonsense,” he said. “But if you believe that, what wouldn’t you do? The defendant was not just there sitting in his basement, absorbing this material. He’s acting on it, amplifying it and rebroadcasting it.”",
            "Defense attorney Rodolfo Cejas noted that it isn’t illegal to believe in conspiracy theories. “It may be strange. It may be a variety of things. It’s not a crime,” he said.",
            "U.S. Magistrate Judge Lawrence Leonard said beliefs like those expressed by Gonzalez ordinarily are not factors in deciding if a defendant poses a flight risk or a danger to the community “unless those beliefs turn to actions,” he added.",
            "“The court is not weighing whether or not someone who believes in QAnon poses a risk of danger to the community just based on those beliefs. The question for the court is whether or not those beliefs may tend to lead to action, action that could cause a risk of harm to the community,” Leonard said.",
            "Gonzalez was arrested on Tuesday at a friend’s apartment in Virginia Beach on misdemeanor charges, including entering and remaining in a restricted building and disorderly conduct in the Capitol building.",
            "Videos show him wearing a sun hat, a fanny pack and red, white and blue American flag pants at the Capitol. A family member who recognized Gonzalez from videos on YouTube contacted the FBI on Jan. 20, a court filing says.",

            "Seven Republicans joined Democrats in a 57-43 Senate vote to convict Trump, but it was far short of the two-thirds required.",

            "“Even those opposed to the conviction, like Senate Minority Leader McConnell, believe Donald Trump was guilty of a ‘disgraceful dereliction of duty’ and ‘practically and morally responsible for provoking’ the violence unleashed on the Capitol,” Biden wrote.",

            "“I’m thinking about all those who lost their lives, all those whose lives were threatened, and all those who are still today living with terror they lived through that day,” he wrote. “And I’m thinking of those who demonstrated the courage to protect the integrity of our democracy — Democrats and Republicans, election officials and judges, elected representatives and poll workers — before and after the election.”",
            "He added: “This sad chapter in our history has reminded us that democracy is fragile. That it must always be defended. That we must be ever vigilant.

            "WASHINGTON (AP) — The number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits fell slightly last week to 793,000, evidence that job cuts remain high despite a substantial decline in new viral infections.",
            "Last week’s total declined from 812,000 the previous week, the Labor Department said Thursday. That figure was revised higher from the previously-reported figure of 779,000. Before the virus erupted in the United States in March, weekly applications for jobless aid had never topped 700,000, even during the Great Recession.",
            "The job market’s improvement slowed through the fall and in the past two months has essentially stalled. Over the past two months combined, employers have cut 178,000 jobs. Nearly 10 million jobs remain lost to the pandemic.",
            "Though the unemployment rate fell in January to 6.3% from 6.7%, that was mainly because many people who had lost jobs stopped looking for one. The government doesn’t count people as unemployed unless they’re actively seeking work.",
            "All told, 20.4 million people were receiving unemployment benefits in the week that ended Jan. 23, the latest period for which data are available. That’s up from 17.8 million from the week before.",
            "The job market’s persistent weakness is fueling President Joe Biden’s push for a $1.9 trillion economic rescue package. Biden’s proposal would extend, through August, two federal unemployment benefit programs that are set to expire in mid-March. His proposal would also raise the federal unemployment benefit to $400 a week from the current $300.",
            "Some economists, including former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, have raised concerns that such a huge spending package would risk igniting inflation by fueling a burst of consumer spending later this year as the virus is gradually brought under control.",
            "Yet on Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell highlighted the struggling job market and said he thought that any worrisome surge in inflation would be unlikely. If it did arise, Powell said, the Fed has the financial tools it needs to quell inflation. For now, inflation remains below the Fed’s target rate.",
            "“We are still very far from a strong labor market whose benefits are broadly shared,” Powell said.",
            "A driving force behind the Biden administration’s push for more aid is the impending expiration of the extended jobless benefits in barely more than a month. More than 11 million people would lose benefits as a result, according to a report by the Century Foundation. Unlike the previous expiration of extended unemployment aid, which occurred on Dec. 26, the cut-off would be phased in between March 14 and April 11.",
            "The job market won’t likely be close to fully recovered by then. Many economists expect a burst of growth and hiring later this year after vaccines are more widely administered, especially if Congress provides significantly more aid to households, small businesses and states and cities. But that isn’t likely for many months.",
            "Once vaccinations become more widely distributed and administered in the coming months, economists expect growth and hiring to pick up, particularly if Congress provides significantly more financial aid to households, small businesses and states and cities.",
            "For now, the job market is sputtering. About 4 million people who are out of work have stopped searching for jobs and so aren’t counted as unemployed. Powell said that if these people were counted among the officially jobless, the unemployment rate would be nearly 10%.",
            "In his remarks to the Economic Club of New York, the Fed chair also highlighted the uneven nature of the layoffs in this pandemic. Job losses among the highest-earning one-quarter of Americans have been just 4%, while job losses among the poorest one-quarter have been “a staggering 17%,” Powell said.",
            "Layoffs have also fallen disproportionately on Black workers. In December, 18% of people who sought unemployment aid were black, even though African Americans make up 13.5% of the workforce, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. By contrast, nearly 50% of the applicants were white, even though 77% of workers are white."

The foreign-made knockoffs are becoming increasingly difficult to spot and could put health care workers at grave risk for the coronavirus.",
            "These masks are giving first responders “a false sense of security,” said Steve Francis, assistant director for global trade investigations with the Homeland Security Department’s principal investigative arm. He added, “We’ve seen a lot of fraud and other illegal activity.”",
            "Officials could not name the states or the company involved because of the active investigation.",
            "Nearly a year into the pandemic, fraud remains a major problem as scammers seek to exploit hospitals and desperate and weary Americans. Federal investigators say they have seen an increase in phony websites purporting to sell vaccines as well as fake medicine produced overseas and scams involving personal protective equipment. The schemes deliver phony products, unlike fraud earlier in the pandemic that focused more on fleecing customers.",
            "3M, based in Maplewood, Minnesota, is among the largest global producers of the N95 mask, which has been approved by the U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health and is considered the gold standard in protection against the coronavirus. The company delivered some 2 billion N95 masks in 2020 as the pandemic soared, but in earlier months of the pandemic, when masks were in short supply, fraudsters starting popped up.",
            "“They’re not coming from authorized distributors,” said Kevin Rhodes, 3M’s vice president and deputy general counsel. “They’re coming from companies really just coming into existence.”",
            "Rhodes encouraged medical facilities and even workers to look on the company’s website for tips on how to spot fakes, namely through packaging or faulty trademarks.",
            "“These products are not tested to see if they make the N95 standards,” he said “They’re not interested in testing them. They’re interested in making as many as they can as cheaply as possible.”",
            "During the pandemic, Homeland Security Investigations has used its 7,000 agents in tandem with border officials, the Food and Drug Administration and the FBI to investigate scams, seize phony products and arrest hundreds of people to help stop fraud. The effort is based at the National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center, a government watchdog aimed at enforcing international trade laws and combating intellectual property theft.",
            "There have been already more than 1,250 raids by law enforcement that resulted in the seizure of 10 million counterfeit 3M masks alone. The company has filed more than a dozen lawsuits over reports of fraud, counterfeiting and price gouging.",
            "There are many other reports of fraudulent masks that have reached frontline workers.",
            "In the latest matter, Homeland Security investigators sent an email warning of potential fraud to certain states. The email, viewed by The Associated Press, said 3M N95 mask models 1860 and 1860S may have been provided by a company called Q2 Solutions and the masks may be fraudulent. The masks have a seal that says “Peru,” which is not used outside of Latin America. The company is based in Miami and has offices around the U.S. and globally. It did not respond to requests for comment.",
            "Officials in Washington state examined their mask supply, which had come from a different company, and discovered that 300,000 masks they had purchased for about $1.4 million were counterfeit. Officials are investigating.",
            "Beth Zborowski of the Washington State Hospital Association said the fraud has the potential to affect 1.9 million masks but they are mostly in stockpile now rather than general circulation.",
            "She said the mask supplier had been vetted and the masks “passed all the physical and visual inspection test.” Zborowski said that for a time, the association could not get the masks directly from 3M, but the company now is expediting its order after learning of the fraud.",
            "Health care workers “have plenty of anxieties on a day-to-day basis. They don’t need to also worry about whether their masks are fake,” she said.",

            "“After two long years of pursuing litigation, I am grateful to the courts for holding Associated Newspapers and The Mail on Sunday to account for their illegal and dehumanizing practices,” she said in a statement shared with HuffPost.",
            "“These tactics (and those of their sister publications MailOnline and the Daily Mail) are not new; in fact, they’ve been going on for far too long without consequence,” the royal added. “For these outlets, it’s a game. For me and so many others, it’s real life, real relationships, and very real sadness. The damage they have done and continue to do runs deep.”",
            "She said that while “the world needs reliable, fact-checked, high-quality news,” the tabloid’s work is “the opposite” of that.",
            "“We all lose when misinformation sells more than truth, when moral exploitation sells more than decency, and when companies create their business model to profit from people’s pain,” she continued.",

            "“I share this victory with each of you,” the royal added, “because we all deserve justice and truth, and we all deserve better.”",
            "The judge presiding over the case, Sir Mark Warby, said in his judgement that Meghan had a “reasonable expectation” that the letter she wrote to her father would remain private and that the subsequent articles published by the Mail in 2019 “interfered with that reasonable expectation.”",
            "“It was, in short, a personal and private letter,” he wrote. “The majority of what was published was about the claimant’s own behaviour, her feelings of anguish about her father’s behaviour – as she saw it – and the resulting rift... These are inherently private and personal matters.”",
            "After the ruling, a spokesperson for Associated Newspapers said: “We are very surprised by today’s summary judgment and disappointed at being denied the chance to have all the evidence heard and tested in open court at a full trial. We are carefully considering the judgment’s contents and will decide in due course whether to lodge an appeal.”",

            "Britney Spears’ father remains a co-conservator over her estate, but a judge denied his objections on Thursday as to how the joint conservatorship will be delegated — a ruling celebrated by supporters of the #FreeBritney movement.",
            "The 39-year-old singer filed a petition in Los Angeles Superior Court last August to remove her father, Jamie Spears, as her conservator. The elder Spears has fulfilled the role since 2008 when the court-sanctioned conservatorship was implemented. The conservatorship gives him control over his daughter’s financial and personal decisions.",
            "The judge in the case, Brenda Penny, denied the singer’s petition to immediately remove her father from the conservatorship, but, in November, agreed to add the financial company Bessemer Trust as co-conservator.",
            "On Thursday, Penny heard more arguments in the ongoing case. The New York Times noted the judge “did not order any substantial changes to the conservatorship,” but did deny some objections put forth by Jamie Spears as to how his daughter’s conservatorship will be delegated.",
            "The objections included claims that the order establishing the joint conservatorship with Bessemer Trust had wrongly reduced his powers over his daughter’s estate, Variety reported.",
            "According to NBC News, Jamie Spears’ attorney also asked that his client retain the power to delegate his daughter’s investments.",
            "Penny rejected these objections and reaffirmed her earlier position that both Jamie Spears and Bessemer Trust would have power over the singer’s estate.",
            "The issue of the singer’s conservatorship has come under renewed scrutiny and interest in recent weeks following the release of “Framing Britney Spears,” a documentary by The New York Times examining the legal arrangement.",
            "Some fans believe the singer has been manipulated and controlled by her father and have sought to #FreeBritney.",
            "For the moment, Jamie Spears, along with Bessemer Trust, controls the singer’s finances. Jodi Montgomery, a licensed conservator, replaced Jamie Spears as the singer’s personal conservator in 2019 after he stepped down from the role due to health issues. Montgomery will remain in that role until September.",
            "As TMZ noted, several people with #FreeBritney signs gathered outside the courthouse in Los Angeles on Thursday to express their support for the singer. #FreeBritney Zoom rallies were also held ahead of the hearing.",
            "Britney Spears’ attorney, Samuel Ingham, said in court that the purpose of the co-conservatorship order was to give both Jamie Spears and Bessemer Trust “an equal division of responsibility, in the hopes that they would sit down and figure out together the best way to handle this complex estate for the benefit of my client.”",
            "He added that while it’s “no secret that my client does not want her father as co-conservator,” he recognized that Jamie Spears’ removal from the role “is a separate issue” for another day."

            "A doctor in Naypyitaw said the woman who was shot in the head was in a critical condition and not expected to survive. Social media video verified by Reuters showed her with other protesters some distance from a row of riot police as a water cannon sprayed and several shots could be heard.",

            "UNITED NATIONS (AP) — North Korea has modernized its nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles by flaunting United Nations sanctions, using cyberattacks to help finance its programs and continuing to seek material and technology overseas for its arsenal, U.N. experts said.",
            "The panel of experts monitoring sanctions on the Northeast Asian nation said in a report sent to Security Council members Monday that North Korea’s “total theft of virtual assets from 2019 to November 2020 is valued at approximately $316.4 million,” according to one unidentified country.",
            "The panel said its investigations found that North Korean-linked cyber actors continued to conduct operations in 2020 against financial institutions and virtual currency exchange houses to generate money to support its weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs.",
            "In its weapons development, the experts said, Kim Jong Un’s government has also produced fissile material — an essential ingredient for producing nuclear weapons — and maintained its nuclear facilities.",
            "“It displayed new short-range, medium-range, submarine-launched and intercontinental ballistic missile systems at military parades,“ they said. “It announced preparation for testing and production of new ballistic missile warheads and, development of tactical nuclear weapons ... and upgraded its ballistic missile infrastructure.“",
            "The panel recommended that the Security Council impose sanctions on four North Korean men: Choe Song Chol, Im Song Sun, Pak Hwa Song, and Hwang Kil Su.",
            "The Security Council has imposed increasingly tough sanctions on North Korea since its first test explosion of a nuclear device in 2006. It has banned most of the country’s exports and severely limited its imports, trying to pressure Pyongyang into abandoning its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.",
            "But the report’s summary and some key findings and recommendations, obtained by The Associated Press, make clear that North Korea remains able to evade sanctions and develop its weapons and to illicitly import refined petroleum, access international banking channels and carry out “malicious cyber activities.”",
            "North Korea’s arsenal escalated to a major threat to the United States following tests in 2017 that included a detonation of a purported thermonuclear warhead and flight tests demonstrating its ICBMs could reach deep in the American mainland.",
            "A year later, Kim initiated diplomacy with South Korea and then-U.S. President Donald Trump that derailed in 2019 when the Americans rejected North Korea’s demands for major sanctions relief in exchange for a piecemeal deal partially surrendering its nuclear weapons capabilities.",
            "Last year, North Korea’s already battered economy decayed further amid the COVID-19 pandemic, which led Kim to close the country’s borders. That severely limited the legal and illegal transfer of goods and movement of people, according to the experts.",
            "At a North Korean political conference, Kim sharply criticized his government’s economic agencies for unspecified passiveness and “self-protecting tendencies,” the North’s state media reported Tuesday. His remarks follow a ruling party congress last month where he called for greater state control over the economy while also vowing to continue all-out efforts to boost his nuclear program, which North Korea sees as a deterrent to the U.S. and thus an assurance of the Kim dynasty’s continued existence.",
            "With his diplomatic efforts stalemated, Kim must start all over again with President Joe Biden, who previously called him a “thug” and criticized Trump for summit spectacles instead of significant nuclear reductions.",
            "In August 2019, the U.N. panel said North Korean cyber experts illegally obtained proceeds “estimated at up to $2 billion” to fund its weapons programs.",
            "The panel said in the new report that it investigated “malicious” activities by the Reconnaissance General Bureau — North Korea’s primary intelligence agency, which is on the U.N. sanctions blacklist — including “the targeting of virtual assets and virtual asset service providers, and attacks on defense companies.”",
            "North Korea continues to launder stolen cryptocurrencies especially through over-the-counter virtual asset brokers in China to acquire fiat currency which is government backed, like the U.S. dollar, the experts said.",
            "The panel said it is investigating a September 2020 hack against a cryptocurrency exchange that resulted in approximately $281 million worth of cryptocurrencies being stolen, and transactions on the blockchain indicating the $281 million hack is related to a $23 million second hack in October 2020.",
            "“Preliminary analysis, based on the attack vectors and subsequent efforts to launder the illicit proceeds strongly suggests links to the DPRK,” the experts said, using the initials of the country’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.",
            "According to one unnamed country, North Korea also continues to generate illegal revenue by exploiting freelance information technology platforms using the same methods it does to access the global financial system ― false identification, use of virtual private network services, and establishing front companies in Hong Kong, the panel said.",
            "The experts said they investigated attempted violations of the U.N. arms embargo, including illegal actions of blacklisted companies. They cited the Korea Mining Development Trading Corporation, alleged military cooperation by North Korea, and the use of the country’s overseas diplomatic missions for commercial purposes.",
            "The panel said it also investigated “the country’s continued illicit import of refined petroleum, via direct deliveries and ship-to-ship transfers, using elaborate subterfuge.“",
            "It cited images, data and calculations from an unidentified country showing that between Jan. 1 and Sept. 30 last year North Korea received shipments of refined petroleum products exceeding “by several times” the annual ceiling of 500,000 barrels set by the Security Council.",
            "U.N. sanctions ban North Korean coal exports, and the panel said shipments of coal appear to have been largely suspended since late July 2020.",
            "It said that last year, North Korea continued to transfer fishing rights in violation of sanctions, which earned the country $120 million in 2018, according to an unnamed member state.",
            "Under a 2017 sanctions resolution, all North Korean nationals working overseas were to be repatriated by Dec. 22, 2019. The experts said they investigated North Korean workers earning income in sub-Saharan Africa as well as information technology workers dispatched by the Munitions Industry Department."

            "JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pleaded not guilty on Monday as his trial on corruption charges resumed in a Jerusalem courtroom just weeks before national elections in which he hopes to extend his 12-year rule.",
            "Netanyahu was indicted last year for fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three separate cases. In recent months, Israelis have held weekly protests calling on him to resign over the charges and criticizing his government’s response to the coronavirus crisis. Protesters gathered outside the courthouse could be heard inside the room where the hearing was being held.",
            "He stands accused of accepting lavish gifts from wealthy friends and offering to grant favors to powerful media moguls in exchange for favorable coverage of him and his family. The latest hearing was postponed last month due to lockdown restrictions on public gatherings.",
            "Israel’s longest serving leader is also the first sitting prime minister to go on trial for corruption. Israeli law requires Cabinet ministers to resign when charged with criminal offenses, but does not specifically address the case of a prime minister under indictment.",
            "Netanyahu has denied any wrongdoing and has dismissed the charges against him as a “witch-hunt” orchestrated by biased law enforcement and media. He has refused to step down and has used his office as a bully pulpit against critics and the criminal justice system.",
            "At Monday’s hearing, Netanyahu’s lawyers submitted a written response pleading not guilty. They then argued against the cases on procedural grounds, saying the attorney general had not properly approved the investigations in writing.",
            "After around 20 minutes, Netanyahu left the courtroom without explanation and his motorcade departed.",
            "The hearing continued in his absence, with his lawyers arguing for more than an hour that constitutional procedures had not been followed. The judges appeared skeptical and repeatedly called on the defense lawyers to wrap it up. The prosecution then rejected those arguments, saying the attorney general had approved the investigations in dozens of meetings.",
            "At the start of his trial last May, Netanyahu was flanked by a cohort of Likud party allies as he railed against the media, police, judges and prosecutors. He said the trial aimed to “depose a strong, right-wing prime minister, and thus remove the nationalist camp from the leadership of the country for many years.”",
            "Netanyahu has served as Israel’s prime minister since 2009, and in the past two years has managed to hang onto power through three tumultuous, deadlocked elections. His flimsy ruling coalition collapsed in December, and he now faces a major battle for reelection in March 23 parliamentary elections.",
            "Netanyahu hopes to campaign on having pulled the country out of the pandemic through one of the world’s most successful vaccination campaigns. He boasts of having personally secured millions of doses from major drug makers, allowing Israel to vaccinated more than a third of its population of 9.3 million. He hopes to vaccinate the entire adult population by late March.",
            "But his government has faced heavy criticism for other aspects of its response to the crisis. The country is only now starting to emerge from its third nationwide lockdown, and the closures have sent unemployment skyrocketing.",
            "An emergency government formed last May to combat the coronavirus outbreak has been mired in bickering. The country’s leaders have struggled to enact consistent policies and repeatedly accused each other of playing politics with the pandemic. Israel has meanwhile reported nearly 700,000 cases since the outbreak began, including 5,121 deaths.",
            "One major controversy concerns Israel’s ultra-Orthodox Jewish community, many of whom have openly flouted restrictions on public gatherings. Netanyahu will need the ultra-Orthodox parties to form a ruling coalition, and his critics accuse him of turning a blind eye to their violations.",
            "Polls show Netanyahu’s Likud winning the most seats but struggling to form a 61-seat majority coalition in the Knesset, Israel’s parliament. The margin of victory could be extremely tight, potentially allowing a small, fringe party to decide who heads the next government.",

            "The flood was caused when a portion of Nanda Devi glacier broke off in the Tapovan area of the northern state of Uttarakhand on Sunday morning. A video shared by officials and taken from the side of steep hillside shows a wall of water surging into one of the dams and breaking it into pieces with little resistance before continuing to roar downstream.",
            "The Rishiganga hydropower plant on the Alaknanda River was destroyed, while the Dhauliganga hydropower plant on the Dhauliganga River was damaged, said Vivek Pandey, a spokesman for the paramilitary Indo Tibetan Border Police. Flowing from the Himalayan mountains, both rivers meet before merging with the Ganges River.",
            "Pandey said at least 42 workers got trapped inside two tunnels at the Dhauliganga plant. While 12 workers trapped inside one tunnel were rescued, at least 30 others were still stuck inside the other tunnel, he said.",
            "Another 140 workers at the two plants were missing, Pandey said.",
            "Surjeet Singh, a police official, said nine bodies were recovered so far amid intensified rescue operations that went into the night. Authorities installed halogen lights in the area to continue rescue operations.",
            "“Paramilitary forces have gone 150 meter down in the tunnel to rescue people. The operation is expected to continue until we bring these people out alive,” said Pravin Alok, a spokesman for the State Disaster Relief Force.",
            "There were also houses that were damaged in the flooding, said Ravi Bejaria, a government spokesman, though he had no details on the number and whether any of the residents were injured, missing or dead.",
            "More than 2,000 members of the military, paramilitary groups and police were helping in the rescue operation, Bejaria said. Pandey said soldiers who are experts in mountaineering and rescue operations had been called in.",
            "“The situation is under control and there is no need for panic,” he said.",
            "Officials said when the glacier broke it sent water trapped behind it as well as mud and other debris surging down the mountain and into other bodies of water. Many villages were evacuated as authorities issued an advisory urging people living on the banks of the Alaknanda and Dhauliganga rivers to move to safer places immediately.",
            "Anjal Prakash, research director and adjunct professor at the Indian School of Business who has contributed to U.N.-sponsored research on global warming, said that while data on the cause of the disaster in not yet available, “this looks very much like a climate change event as the glaciers are melting due to global warming. The impact of global warming on glacier retreat is well-documented.”",
            "Authorities emptied two dams farther down the river to stop the flood waters from reaching towns of Haridwar and Rishikesh, where popular tourist spots on the banks of the Ganges River were shut and all boating activities were stopped.",
            "“It all started sometime around 10 in the morning. We heard a bang, which shook our village,” Dinesh Negi, a resident of Raini village, told The Associated Press by phone.",
            "He said they watched from their village high above one of the rivers as the water turned muddy and surged in a torrent.",
            "“We knew something wrong had happened,” Negi said. “We could see the fury of the river.”",
            "Uttarakhand police chief Ashok Kumar said officials immediately alerted residents living in the area and evacuated them to safer places.",
            "Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a tweet said he was “constantly monitoring the unfortunate situation.” He added: “India stands with Uttarakhand and the nation prays for everyone’s safety there.”",
            "In 2013, thousands of people were killed in Uttarakhand after heavy rains triggered landslides and floods, washing away thousands of houses and roads and cutting communication links in many parts of the state."

            "The U.S. saw more avalanche deaths last week than in any other week since 1910, with 14 people killed in avalanches from Jan. 31 to Feb. 6, officials said.",
            "The recent deaths ― in Colorado, Utah, Montana, California, Alaska, and New Hampshire ― raise this season’s total since mid-December to 21, according to records compiled by the Colorado Avalanche Information Center (CAIC), which is part of the Colorado Department of Natural Resources.",
            "There’s an average of 27 avalanche deaths each season, with most occurring in January and February, according to the CAIC. The most deaths ever reported was in 1910, when a massive avalanche in Washington state swept away two trains stuck in snowdrifts, killing 96 people.",
            "Brian Lazar, the CAIC’s deputy director, blamed recent winter weather patterns across the country for creating unstable accumulations of packed snow, which have led to “a particularly dangerous year across the U.S.” (Before the past deadly week, two other people had already died in avalanches this year, on Jan. 8 and Jan. 30.)",
            "“Over the last week or two we’ve seen a number of fairly substantial storms sweep through the area,” Lazar told HuffPost. One such quickly moving snowstorm in Colorado dumped 20 inches of snow near Aspen last week.",
            "These heavy storms leave behind an unstable snowpack that’s “ripe for human triggers and that’s what we’ve been seeing across the last week,” said Lazar.",
            "According to the Utah Avalanche Center, 90% of avalanche incidents are triggered by a victim or someone in the victim’s party. Within five seconds of the fracture, dry slabs of snow can fall at speeds of 60-80 miles per hour. Wet avalanches are typically much slower, traveling around 20 miles per hour.",
            "Toby Weed, a forecaster for the Utah Avalanche Center, likened being in an avalanche to being in a car accident.",
            "“It happens really quickly and it’s really violent,” Weed, who said he was in a few avalanches before becoming a forecaster, told Salt Lake City station Fox 13 News last week. “Nobody wants to get caught, much less buried, in an avalanche. It’s a horrible thing to live through and to die doing.”",
            "A terrifying video posted to Instagram on Saturday captures one such fast-moving wall of snow overtaking a group of people along a mountainside in Utah. A follow-up video shows the area covered in a fresh coat of white and one man partially buried alive, with little more than his head exposed after immediate help from a man identified as his brother.",
            "If you get buried, creating an airway or clearing air space around your mouth is particularly vital. That’s because most avalanche victims die from carbon dioxide poisoning after breathing in their exhaled air while buried in the snow, which is said to quickly harden like concrete around them.",
            "“Statistics show that 93 percent of avalanche victims can be recovered alive if they are dug out within the first 15 minutes, but then the numbers drop catastrophically. After 45 minutes, only 20-30 percent are still alive and after two hours almost no one is alive. In other words, you don’t have much time,” the Utah Avalanche Center’s website states.",
            "Most of the avalanche deaths recorded in the U.S. since the 1950s have occurred in Colorado and involved backcountry skiers, according to records kept by the CAIC.",
            "So far this season, 15 of the 21 reported deaths involved skiers and eight of them were in Colorado. In the case of the 14 recent avalanche victims, nine of them were backcountry skiers.",
            "The higher number of avalanche deaths generally in Colorado is due to the state’s extremely mountainous terrain, which creates plenty of avalanche slopes and opportunity for snowpack. State residents are also likely to live within a few miles of avalanche terrain, said Lazar.",
            "“It stands to reason that if you put more people traveling around avalanche terrain, the chance of people to interact with that terrain increases,” he said.",
            "This winter, there is also a possibility that the coronavirus pandemic is driving more people to engage in recreation outdoors, where they can socially distance themselves. However, there’s no definite relationship between that and the recent rise in deaths, Lazar noted.",
            "“We don’t have hard numbers on that kind of stuff,” he said, adding that prior to the pandemic there had already been an increase in people exploring the outdoors. The coronavirus likely accelerated that a little bit, he said.",
            "Lazar recommended that anyone planning to travel to an avalanche-prone area prepare in advance by visiting avalanche.org."

            "Whipping up panic about sex trafficking at the Super Bowl has become as durable a tradition as nachos, Budweiser ads and a milquetoast halftime show.",
            "Every year, anti-trafficking organizations and law enforcement officials pitch news outlets the same story: The annual event causes a huge influx of sports fans to the host city, which invites a huge influx in sex workers, which results in a huge spike in human trafficking.",
            "These claims are inevitably accompanied by large-scale publicity campaigns and police crackdowns. This year, in preparation for Super Bowl LV, Tampa authorities have spent the last month putting up billboards (“Don’t buy it, Tampa Bay”), ticketing strip clubs and organizing prostitution stings.",
            "“We know from past experience with major sporting events there will be some who travel for the exclusive purpose of taking advantage of women and children,” Hillsborough County Sheriff Chad Chronister said after a Jan. 11 vice roundup that netted 71 arrests.",
            "This narrative sounds convincing, a reasonable response to a widespread, severe and growing societal scourge.",
            "There’s just one problem: It’s a lie.",
            "A Solution In Search Of A Problem",
            "There has never been any evidence that major sporting events are associated with a rise in human trafficking. Studies of Germany and South Africa failed to find any link between the World Cup and an increase in trafficking. An analysis of the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver found that the market for sex work actually shrank during the sporting event — mostly due to increased police presence and extra traffic.",
            "The Super Bowl is no different. Despite waves of ominous warnings every year, no city has demonstrated a rise in human trafficking before or after the big game. Arrest records following the 2017 Super Bowl in Houston turned up low-level busts for prostitution and driving under the influence. An FBI raid in Atlanta timed to coincide with the 2019 Super Bowl turned out to be a standard-issue vice roundup of sex workers.",
            "This isn’t even the first time the myth has appeared in Tampa. Last time the city hosted the Super Bowl in 2009, police spokesperson Andrea Davis told reporters afterward that the department “didn’t see a huge influx in prostitutes coming into Tampa. The arrests were not a lot higher. They were almost the same.”",
            "“There’s not any more trafficking; there are just more arrests,” said Blair Hopkins, the deputy director of the Sex Workers Outreach Project Behind Bars, a nonprofit organization that provides assistance to currently and formerly incarcerated sex workers. For the past month, Hopkins and her colleagues have been bailing out sex workers caught up in pre-Super Bowl stings. The organization has also released a list of policy proposals for safeguarding sex workers and is trying to put the sports-and-trafficking myth to rest.",
            "“None of the women we’re working with even knew it was the Super Bowl this weekend,” she said.",
            "The Super Bowl Myth Doesn’t Make Sense",
            "Beyond the numerous academic dissections and journalistic investigations, the Super Bowl trafficking narrative simply runs counter to any reasonable understanding of the market for sex work.",
            "“As soon as you start thinking about logistics, it totally falls apart,” Hopkins said. “Why would you take the risk of cramming a bunch of trafficked women into a van and taking them to Tampa, where the hotels are extortionate and there are cops everywhere? And for what? To stroll the streets?”",
            "Sex work, like most other professions in America, is highly stratified. The upper echelons of the sector — the part most likely to appeal to wealthy luxury-box football fans — features the women least likely to be trafficked. High-income sex workers mostly see regulars and generally spend hours in the company of their clients. Rather than working for managers (the term “pimp” is racialized and isn’t generally used by sex workers), they often have assistants to help them screen potential clients for safety. They mostly work indoors and have little need for physical protection.",
            "Meanwhile, the low end of the market — street-based sex work — is characterized by low pay, long hours and significant risk of arrest and bodily harm. Nearly all of the women working in red-light districts are poor; the vast majority work independently. While sexual exploitation is a real risk, it doesn’t come from international criminal networks. It comes from low income, lack of access to housing, drug addiction and domestic abuse.",
            "As well as denying the realities of sex work, the sports-trafficking myth also contradicts the realities of the Super Bowl. Despite the high-roller stereotype, Super Bowl attendees are only slightly wealthier than the national average. Most male visitors travel to the game with their families. Host cities typically see a slight uptick in online sex advertisements over Super Bowl weekend, but it’s far from the weeks-long avalanche of demand depicted in media stories.",
            "Trafficking Myths Aren’t Helping",
            "Even if the link between the Super Bowl and human trafficking was real, it’s not clear that the publicity campaigns and law enforcement crackdowns are helping sex workers vulnerable to exploitation.",
            "“If you want to change your life or transition into working a 9-to-5 job, how are you going to do that with a prostitution arrest on your record?” said Ashunte Coleman, a former sex worker and the founder of Ladies Intervention Project for Success Tampa, a nonprofit that provides supplies to trans sex workers.",
            "Coleman noted that the most vulnerable sex workers are trans women of color, who face the most severe risk of violence from clients and harassment from police. Encouraging the population to associate sex work with human trafficking only subjects them to more scrutiny — while doing nothing to address the reasons they’re engaged in street-based sex work in the first place.",
            "“What my girls need is housing, jobs, affirming medical care and education,” Coleman said. “What they’re getting are a bunch of cops trying to push them off the streets and out of sight.”",
            "Few anti-trafficking efforts associated with the Super Bowl provide meaningful assistance to low-income sex workers. In 2018, Minneapolis announced that it would provide sex trafficking victims with housing in advance of the big game. The offer, however, lasted only 10 days. The morning after the Super Bowl, the women were sent back to the streets.",
            "Sports-related anti-trafficking efforts also have a blind spot for labor trafficking. The vast majority of victims in the United States are engaged in forced labor. Most are recruited from overseas with false promises of high wages and fair working conditions, then they’re exploited by their employers. Victims are typically poor and undocumented and work in low-paid sectors like construction, food preparation and hotel cleaning — exactly the sectors that spike in connection with the Super Bowl. Yet no host city has ever announced a crackdown on exploitative employers in the months before the game.",
            "The Myth Won’t Die, But It’s Changing",
            "Recent years have seen a shift in media coverage around the Super Bowl and anti-trafficking efforts. Rather than claiming the game causes a spike in demand, advocates describe the event as illustrating a constant, lingering problem.",
            "“It happens year round,” Kimberly Overman, the chair of the Hillsborough County Human Trafficking Task Force, told the Tampa Bay Times earlier this week. Local news reports now feature disclaimers that although the Super Bowl doesn’t in fact correspond with a rise in trafficking, the problem is everywhere and could happen to anyone.",
            "This is not a sign of progress. Casting human trafficking as a major year-round problem simply trades one myth for another. Numerous academic studies have found that sex trafficking is a relatively limited phenomenon in the United States. Federal authorities initiate fewer than 600 investigations per year; the entire state of Florida convicted just eight people of sex trafficking in 2019.",
            "As this message has begun to permeate the population, police have also started to move away from the Super Bowl-spikes-sex-trafficking story. Tampa, like dozens of other cities across the United States, is shifting to a “Nordic” model of sex work regulation, in which police target customers rather than sellers. The strategy is designed to keep sex workers out of the criminal justice system while reducing the aggregate demand for their services.",
            "While this does represent an improvement over the previous strategy of nonstop prostitution stings, Hopkins noted that trading sex worker arrests for customer arrests creates its own problems, driving risk-averse customers out of the marketplace and leaving sex workers with fewer and sketchier options.",
            "“When it gets riskier to patronize sex workers, you’re going to get a different kind of client,” Hopkins said. “It removes the good ones and leaves more of the bad ones.”",
            "Nor does the “end demand” strategy protect sex workers from arrest. Rather than picking them up for prostitution, police officers often book sex workers for loitering, drug possession or other crimes of poverty. And, most important, it does nothing to change the fundamentally antagonistic relationship between law enforcement and sex work.",
            "“Women still can’t go to the police about a predator targeting them,” Hopkins said. The criminalization of paid sex means workers can’t report assaults, thefts or other abuses without risking arrest. Nor does it include any accountability mechanisms to prevent police from carrying out abuses ― or, as has happened in the run-up to the Super Bowl, arresting women for prostitution anyway.",
            "“It’s politically advantageous to paint these women as victims,” she said, “but it doesn’t address any of the risks they actually face.”"

            "MIAMI (AP) — Jenn Greenberg is pretty busy helping her kindergartner with virtual classes and taking care of a toddler in her Florida home. But somehow she has also found the time to help dozens of seniors she has never met navigate the confusing, often chaotic process of getting a COVID-19 vaccine.",
            "Greenberg is part of a 120-member volunteer force helping South Florida residents 65 and older clear the daunting hurdles of state-run registration systems that are poorly organized and rely heavily on a technology that is often like a foreign language to them.",
            "The problem has emerged in numerous states, where the absence of a streamlined national system has forced local governments to hurriedly cobble together a puzzling patchwork of vaccine distribution and administration plans.",
            "“I realized how many barriers were in place which made lining up appointments very difficult,” said Greenberg, 36, who was inspired to volunteer her services after she saw how much work it took to get her own parents and grandparents signed up.",
            "“Unfortunately, there are many people in need,” she said.",
            "When Florida expanded eligibility for the vaccine to the general elderly population in late December, anxious seniors camped out overnight at vaccination sites, phone lines rang unanswered and websites crashed.",
            "Many seniors have also been thrown by having to register online instead of making an appointment by phone or in person.",
            "Recognizing a need to simplify the process, school principal Russ Schwartz and registered nurse Katherine Quirk of Parkland established the South Florida COVID-19 Vaccination Info page on Facebook.",
            "First set up last month, the page was conceived to be a one-stop shop for seniors — somewhere they could find all the information they needed to sign up for shots. The Facebook group alerted members when vaccination hotlines were listing available spots or when a website was about to accept bookings.",
            "The page’s organizers soon found, however, that seniors aren’t necessarily glued to their cellphones and laptops, and that it would be much easier for them if someone could sign up on their behalf.",
            "“A lot of our seniors, when they are using their cellphones, you tell them to send you a photo or go to an app and they can’t,” Schwartz said. “It takes them more time. It’s just not their language.”",
            "Volunteering has turned into a full-time job for some of the group’s participants as they toggle back and forth between the online registration platforms of hospitals, grocery stores and county governments; check on state vaccination supplies and make repeated calls to overloaded hotlines.",
            "Currently there are about 3,000 seniors waiting for one of the 120 volunteers to help them. To boost its efforts, the group is also encouraging younger Facebook users to pitch in and help their older relatives navigate the online systems.",
            "“We are very proud of how we have been able to help, but it has been overwhelming,” Quirk said.",
            "Group members’ inboxes are filled with emails thanking them for their assistance and displaying photos of strangers with their sleeves rolled up as they prepare to receive the coveted shots.",
            "Georgie DeNitto cried after a volunteer told her over the phone that she would receive a shot in the next two days. The 72-year-old Wellington, Florida, resident said her 14-year-old grandson called her after she got vaccinated.",
            "“He said ‘I can’t wait, because I haven’t seen you and now you can come over to my house,’’ DeNitto said, her voice heavy with emotion. “And he lives like eight minutes away.”",
            "Similar volunteer groups have popped up in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, and would-be volunteers in Georgia and Southern California have sought advice on establishing them in those states, Schwartz said.",
            "Florida state Rep. Anna Eskamani, an Orlando Democrat, is concerned the majority of the vaccines in her state seem to be available through online platforms, and that local officials are overly relying on social networks to alert constituents of vaccine availability.",
            "She says that the systems not only negatively affects seniors, but also exacerbate income and racial disparities. Eskamani says wealthier communities are already seeing greater vaccination coverage than lower-income neighborhoods.",
            "“There should be robo-dialing, there should be door knocking. We should be going into communities,” she said. “People feel it’s like a gameshow, like a race and it shouldn’t be like that. It should be a more thoughtful and strategic approach that is centralized.”",
            "A new online system launched last Friday by the state government for residents to preregister for coronavirus vaccine appointments has aimed to centralize efforts, but it does not match people to all the different places where they could get a vaccine.",
            "Meanwhile, vaccines are going to waste. Last week, Florida state officials acknowledged that 3,344 doses of vaccine were spoiled, in part because they were not used fast enough before the medicine went bad.",
            "Volunteers like Greenberg, Schwartz and Quirk are helping to change that. They have become the first point of contact now for some vaccination providers who count on them to find patients who can show up at the last minute to receive leftover doses that otherwise would have to be thrown out.",
            "On a recent evening, Greenberg was able to quickly enlist 105 seniors for a vaccine clinic the following day at a community center in Hollywood, Florida, where officials worried about not being able to use leftover doses.",
            "Another time, she tracked down a man who had written a letter to the editor of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel because he hadn’t been able to book an appointment for his 65-year-old wife, who suffers from acute respiratory distress syndrome.",
            "“We are just trying to get shots in arms,” Greenberg said. “It is rare to find somewhere you can volunteer where you feel so connected to the people you are helping.”",

            "Authorities deployed thousands of security forces mainly outside India’s capital, where farmers have camped at three main sites for more than two months. The farmers have said they won’t leave until the government rolls back the laws.",
            "Saturday’s blockade started at noon and lasted for three hours. No violence was immediately reported.",
            "Several rounds of talks between farmers with the government have failed to produce any breakthroughs. The government has said the laws are necessary to modernize Indian agriculture.",
            "On Friday, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar defended the laws in Parliament, dampening hopes of a quick settlement as he made no new offer to resume talks with the farmers.",
            "The protests turned violent on Jan. 26, India’s Republic Day, when a group of of farmers riding tractors veered from the protest route and stormed the 17th century Red Fort. Hundreds of police officers were injured as were scores of farmers. One protester died.",
            "Farmer leaders condemned the violence but said they would not call off the protest.",
            "Since then, authorities have heavily increased security at protest sites outside New Delhi’s border, adding iron spikes and steel barricades to stop the farmers from entering the capital.",
            "Meanwhile, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights called on authorities and protesters to exercise “maximum restraint.”",
            "“The rights to peaceful assembly & expression should be protected both offline & online. It’s crucial to find equitable solutions with due respect to #HumanRights for all,” the UN body said in a tweet late Friday."

            "The night before, Biden met with 10 Republican senators pitching their $618 billion alternative, and let them know it was insufficient to meet the country’s needs. The president made it clear that he won’t delay aid in hopes of winning GOP support.",

            "The two sides are far apart, with the Republican group of 10 senators focused primarily on the health care crisis and smaller $1,000 direct aid to Americans than the $1,400 payments Biden proposed, while the president is leading Democrats toward a more sweeping rescue plan to shore up households, local governments and a partly shuttered economy.",
            "At the White House, press secretary Jen Psaki reiterated Biden’s view that the risk is not in crafting too large a package, but in providing too little aid. She said the president was hopeful GOP ideas will be brought forward, and said nothing precludes Republicans from participating in the process.",
            "“We need to make sure people get the relief they need,” she said.",
            "White House officials have previously cited the U.S. Chamber of Commerce as evidence of broad support for their plan, but the nation’s most prominent business group issued a letter Tuesday that urged a bipartisan compromise.",

            "The cornerstone of the GOP plan is $160 billion for the health care response — vaccine distribution, a “massive expansion” of testing, protective gear and funds for rural hospitals, similar to what Biden has proposed.",
            "But from there, the two plans drastically diverge. Biden proposes $170 billion for schools, compared to $20 billion in the Republican plan. Republicans also would give nothing to states, money that Democrats argue is just as important, with $350 billion in Biden’s plan to keep police, fire and other workers on the job.",
            "The GOP’s $1,000 direct payments would go to fewer households, individuals earning up to $40,000 a year, or $80,000 for couples. That’s less than Biden’s proposal of $1,400 direct payments at higher income levels, up to $300,000 for some households..",
            "The Republicans offer $40 billion for Paycheck Protection Program business aid. But gone are Democratic priorities such as a gradual lifting of the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour.",
            "According to Schumer, Biden told Democratic senators he had let the Republicans know “he’s willing to make some modifications.”",
            "But both Biden and Yellen recalled the lessons of the government response to the 2009 financial crisis, which some have since said was inadequate as conditions worsened. Biden said he told the Republicans their offer was “way too small,” Schumer said.",
            "Winning the support of 10 Republicans would be significant, potentially giving Biden the votes needed in the 50-50 Senate to the 60-vote threshold typically required to advance legislation. Vice President Kamala Harris is the tie-breaker.",

            "A former Ohio police officer who fatally shot 47-year-old Andre Hill, an unarmed Black man who had been holding a cellphone, has been indicted by a grand jury in Hill’s death.",
            "Adam Coy, who shot Hill on Dec. 22 after responding to a nonemergency call, was indicted on charges of murder, felonious assault and dereliction of duty, Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost said Wednesday.",
            "Coy, a 17-year veteran of the force, was fired from the Columbus Police Department a few days after the deadly incident.",
            "Columbus Public Safety Director Ned Pettus Jr. said at the time that Coy had not lived up “to the oath of a Columbus Police officer, or the standards we, and the community, demand of our officers,”",
            "“The shooting of Andre Hill is a tragedy for all who loved him in addition to the community and our Division of Police,” Pettus said in a statement.",

            "“When [Hill] came around the car, that is when Officer Coy observed a firearm and yelled, ‘There’s a gun in his other hand, there’s a gun in his other hand,’ and then there were shots,” Detweiler said in the interview, according to CNN.",
            "Detweiler noted that she hadn’t observed any threats from Hill and that Coy had not warned Hill of the impending shots. She added that she could not remember whether Coy had told Hill to drop the supposed gun.",
            "The body camera footage of the incident lacked audio because Coy had not activated the body camera, the Associated Press reported. The footage was captured by an automatic “look back” feature.",
            "Coy and the other officers at the scene have been scrutinized for their lack of action after the shooting. Hill did not receive first aid for several minutes — but police did place him in handcuffs.",
            "Thomas Quinlan, the Columbus police chief who resigned last week, said after the shooting that he was “shaken” by the lack of humanity shown by the officers.",
            "“As a police chief, and just as a human being, the events of the last week have left me shaken, and heartbroken for the family of Andre Hill,” Quinlan said in December."

            "President Joe Biden plans to create a task force to reunite migrant families separated at the U.S.-Mexico border and unwind certain asylum restrictions in an effort to undo some of the Trump administration’s most damaging policies.",
            "The task force, announced on Tuesday, will aim to identify the more than 500 children separated from family members who have yet to be located and will present proposals to the president and other federal agencies to help reunite those families.",
            "The task force is to be led by Alejandro Mayorkas, Biden’s pick to lead the Department of Homeland Security, and will include officials from DHS, the Department of Health and Human Services and the State Department.",
            "Former President Donald Trump’s family separation policy took more than 5,400 children from their parents at the border in 2017 and 2018. The goal was to deter families from coming to the U.S., through a “zero tolerance” approach, even though many were asylum-seekers with the right to pursue relief here. Instead, when they arrived at the border, the families were torn apart so the parents could be prosecuted for illegal entry while their children were sent to stay in separate facilities, in foster homes, or with other families.",
            "Some of these children were infants and toddlers; many experienced severe trauma as a result of that separation. The president of the American Academy of Pediatrics called it “government-sanctioned child abuse.”",
            "Trump ended the policy amid public pressure nearly a year after it began, and a court-ordered the government to reunite the families. While the government reunited most of the roughly 4,000 children covered by the court order with their parents, the parents of 545 children had not yet been found as of October, according to a court filing. For some families, it was too late, as the parents had been deported back to their home countries.",
            "Biden vowed to do more to reunite those families. He castigated Trump for the separations during a presidential debate in October.",
            "“Their kids were ripped from their arms and separated,” Biden said. “And now they cannot find over 500 sets of those parents and those kids are alone. Nowhere to go. Nowhere to go. It’s criminal.”\n\nBeginning the reunification process is among Biden’s several efforts to rehaul the immigration system decimated by Trump. In his first few hours as president, Biden issued several immigration-related executive orders and proposed a new bill that includes a pathway to citizenship for millions of undocumented people in the country.\n\nAlthough Biden is likely to face resistance from Republicans, immigration reform advocates and experts have applauded the president’s plans for prioritizing such matters.\n\nAlong with the new family reunification task force, Biden also launched a series of efforts to restore the U.S. asylum system by working with foreign governments to ensure that Central American refugees and asylum-seekers can obtain proper legal protections.\n\nThe administration announced it will scale back Migrant Protection Protocols, a Trump-issued program that has forced more than 65,000 asylum-seekers to wait in Mexico ― sometimes for years ― until their day in U.S. immigration court. It is unclear what will happen to the people currently stranded in Mexico as a result of MPP.\n\nTuesday’s executive order also rescinds Trump’s memorandum requiring family sponsors to repay the government if relatives receive public benefits.\n\nThe reforms also instruct federal agencies to review the public charge rule ― a seldom-used policy in place since the 1880s that allows the federal government to deny entry to immigrants, especially green card holders, who are deemed to be overly reliant on public benefits, such as cash assistance programs. Trump expanded the rule, causing fears in the undocumented community about seeking health care and vaccinations."

            "How do we prepare our children against discrimination? This cannot just be a one-off conversation. All children can benefit from talking openly about diversity and bias. But for kids in groups more likely to be a target of discrimination, such conversations can be even more critical.",
            "We know from research conducted by the American Association of Pediatrics that experiencing racial discrimination or even seeing racial discrimination can have a huge mental and physical impact on a child’s health.",
            "Children can also be affected by any injustice they see around them. Perceived discrimination has been linked to physical and mental health problems including anxiety, depression, obesity, high blood pressure and substance abuse. Many of these problems are believed to stem from the chronic stress associated with being a potential target of discrimination. Anxiety leads to the release of the stress hormone cortisol, which can lead to chronic health conditions.",
            "Discrimination-related stress can also affect how kids feel about themselves. It might prevent them from speaking up in class, or from participating in activities that are important to them.",
            "Racial bullying in classrooms and playgrounds – and increasingly online – can take various forms, such as being treated differently or excluded because of skin colour, name-calling or jokes about skin colour, nationality or culture.",
            "“You cannot play with us because you wear a turban.”",
            "“You smell of curry.”",
            "“Why do you have such weird hair?”",
            "Several parents, for instance, have mentioned to me that their black or dual-heritage children have their hair touched a lot even by strangers. ‘Mixedness’ can often be fetishised, which is also a form of racial discrimination and prejudice. Children should be equipped to know how to handle it if strangers ask to touch their hair, or touch it without their permission. Children have to be taught boundaries around their own bodies, and learn to say that it is not OK for others to comment on their skin colour or their hair. They should, in turn, also learn that it is not OK to go and touch a child’s hair or call it “crazy” or “weird”.",
            "So it is important to talk to children and empower them in knowing how to deal with an unfairness associated with their own skin colour. Talking openly with children can prepare them for dealing with discrimination and help them keep discrimination-related stress in check.",
            "If you have been talking about race and discrimination for a while, then this can be an ongoing conversation and children will already have some understanding of why they are being perceived as different. Children can be prepared to recognise signs of racism, and to have some prepared comeback remarks. Teach young people how to speak up about disrespectful language directed at themselves or others, and set boundaries, by saying things such as:",
            "“That didn’t sound kind.”",
            "“That sounds prejudiced.”",
            "“Please stop saying that.”",
            "“Please move out of my way.”",
            "Role play can help children prepare reactions to any situation where they feel threatened or excluded. Also be clear that you will understand if they don’t feel safe speaking up. In such situations, they should feel OK to get adult help.",
            "At this young age, while it is important that children learn to stand up for themselves where they feel comfortable to do so, they should not be dealing with such situations on their own, and they should feel empowered to ask for help, even from busy adults. Asking for help and support is not a sign of weakness. Asking for help in a clear manner is important with words such as: “Please listen to me. This is important.”",
            "Give them tools so that they can bounce these harmful or insulting things back and understand that they do not have to internalise any racism they encounter. The ‘dustbin’ technique can help children actively refuse to accept any insults hurled at them. For example, if someone says to them “I don’t want to sit with you” or “I don’t want to be your friend”, they can metaphorically throw these words away rather than absorbing and internalising them, by saying “I will find someone else to sit with” or “I will find another friend”.",
            "If a child has been supported in developing a strong identity and self-worth, they can be taught to tackle exclusion with resilience.",
            "Depending on the level of discrimination or bullying a child has faced, the school should be involved in this too. School governors and school boards have to be mindful of the laws that cover racial discrimination and bullying. If a child has felt excluded, then their feelings are valid.",
            "Saying “I am sure they didn’t mean it” is not the right approach. Instead, help children find the language to articulate how they are feeling. Give them space for their feelings, even if our natural urge is to jump in and reassure them or distract them from feeling uncomfortable or unhappy.",
            "When you talk about history with your children, it is important to talk about the activism within these communities who faced such oppression, and the resilience and strength that people showed. Doing so helps children understand that people can always stand up and speak up. This can empower children so that they do not see themselves or others from their heritage as victims.",
            "For instance, Viola Desmond, a black woman, challenged racial segregation in Nova Scotia in 1946 and was later the first Canadian woman to be featured on a $10 bill. Desmond’s story can show children the idea that people can make a change based on their actions. This can show them that if they ever face racism they have the choice to resist.",
            "Finally, if you’ve had conversations with your child about how people can treat others differently because of their skin colour or other differences, then they will be better prepared to recognise it, and deal with it when it happens to them. They will know that any exclusion has less to do with them, and more with the stereotypes and prejudices that others hold.",
            "An anti-racism checklist we can all follow",
            "Maintain diversity in toys and books.\n\nDecolonise the curriculum and education.\n\nQuestion and actively challenge negative views and stereotypes children see in movies, cartoons, books.\n\nAsk teachers questions about what books children are reading, and what your school’s racial education framework and policy is.\n\nBe mindful of your own implicit and overt actions and words.\n\nActively challenge prejudiced views and statements rather than ignoring them. The aim is not tolerance but full integration and acceptance.\n\nUse family stories and intergenerational narratives to inspire pride in their own culture and heritage.\n\nTalk about privilege and how it affects how people are treated in society.\n\nTeach children not to dismiss other people’s experiences of racism, but be respectful of their feelings.\n\nHelp children understand that racism is much more than just someone being mean or rude.\n\nEmpower them with role play, tools and strategies to counter any racism they encounter.\n\nMaintain open-ended conversations and discussions to help you understand how children see themselves and others.\n\nAsk questions such as “What makes you different? What makes you special?” that can help children explore self-identity.",

            "WASHINGTON (AP) — He was an arm-draping pol as a senator. He hung out in the Senate cloakroom chatting up legislators as vice president. He pitched himself during the presidential campaign as someone who could “get people working together” and lower the temperature in a Washington overheated by Donald Trump.",
            "Now, after his first full week as president, Joe Biden is coming face to face with the potential limitations of his ability to work across the aisle as he pushes for a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill that is the first big test of his tenure.",
            "Republicans are balking at the price tag and Democrats are sending signals that they’re willing to push the bill through without GOP help as Biden’s campaign pitch to be a deal-maker appears to be giving way to the reality of a Senate that does not resemble the one he once inhabited.",
            "In a nod to reality, Biden told reporters on Friday: “I support passing COVID relief with support from Republicans if we can get it. But the COVID relief has to pass ― no ifs, ands or buts.”",
            "The White House has not given up hope of landing some GOP support for the package, and Biden’s call list bears that out. But some of Biden’s courtship is also directed at members of his own party to make sure a deal gets done.",
            "He has called Sen. Susan Collins of Maine several times since his inauguration, and the moderate Republican says she has a “closer relationship” with Biden than she did with Trump.",
            "Biden has made repeated calls to senators in his own party, including two centrists ― Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona ― who have expressed some concerns about the package, according to three people familiar with the calls who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the private conversations.",
            "A retail politician who never misses a chance for small talk or schmooze, Biden has been penned in somewhat by the pandemic, which limits the face-to-face interactions on which he thrives. But there’s still his peerless phone book, built over four decades of dealing with senators on both sides of the political divide.",
            "“When he decides to make one of those calls, he doesn’t really require a call sheet, a sheet that tells him exactly what to say to a member of Congress and how to outline the bill,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in an interview on MSNBC. “He knows. He’s known a lot of these people for decades.”",
            "Claire McCaskill, a former Democratic senator from Missouri, says Biden is “workman-like in terms of his outreach and it was not unusual for me to run into Joe Biden in the Senate cloakroom when he was vice president” to Barack Obama.",
            "“He burned up the phone lines,” McCaskill said. “Obama was terrible at that part of the job, while Biden was good at it, to both parties.”",
            "Having spent 36 years in the Senate and eight as vice president, Biden made bipartisan outreach a central promise, even when many in his party argued that Republicans no longer were interested in working across the aisle.",
            "Biden’s most notable deal-making success came in the Obama-era fiscal showdowns during the rise of the tea party Republicans. The landmark agreements locked in tax and spending cuts for a decade ― and soured some progressive Democrats on Biden’s brand of compromise.",
            "As vice president, Biden was a trusted emissary to Capitol Hill for Obama, who had served just four years in the Senate.",
            "Biden arrived as a presence in the halls of Congress at several critical junctures. He helped cut a 2010 deal to prevent the expiration of Bush-era tax cuts, then negotiated on the landmark Budget Control Act of 2011 that slashed spending and walked the country back from the 2012 “fiscal cliff” of looming tax increases and budget reductions.",
            "“Biden’s chief virtue as a negotiator is the understanding that ‘Look, you have politics on your side, I have politics on my side, we both have to live within our political constraints,’” said Rohit Kumar, former deputy chief of staff to Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. “His pitch: ‘I know there are certain things you can’t do and I am not going to make them deal breakers. We have to get a deal I can sell, a deal you can sell.’”",
            "As senator, Biden also prized his relationships with colleagues, even though his nightly commute home to Delaware cut into his ability to socialize with other lawmakers.",
            "“Well, I don’t want to ruin him, but he did work with us on occasion,” said former Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.",
            "Lott said Biden was not someone he recalls as often being in the room when Senate leadership was trying to work out a deal on major bills. But Lott pointed to two major instances when he was: the 1994 crime bill and the 2002 Iraq War resolution, a pair of measures for which Biden has since expressed regret.",
            "Still, Lott said Biden’s relationship with McConnell was real and could pay dividends again.",
            "“They worked out an agreement that basically is what they’ve been working off ever since,” Lott said. “Somebody in the media referred to Biden then as the McConnell whisperer.”",
            "Still, the Senate has changed markedly since Biden first joined decades ago, with different skills now in currency as senators gain status on social media, raise money beyond their home states and spend less time socializing with one another in Washington.",
            "Biden’s style of old-school, one-on-one cajoling may be less persuasive for senators from either party who cultivate their own brands and don’t necessarily rely on proximity to presidential power to raise their profiles.",
            "And, of course, policy matters. The parties are more split than ever over the legislative remedies for the nation, a partisan divide that political scientists see as on par with the rifts of the Civil War era.",
            "Biden aides worry that Republicans will continue to balk no matter how many personal phone calls they get from the president or post-pandemic invitations they receive to high-profile events at the White House.",
            "Their boss may be the last one to buy in to that.",
            "“There’s people who say you can’t work with the other side,” Biden said a year ago. “And if that’s the case, prepare your children for a totally different U.S., a totally different world. I don’t believe it.”",

            "Americans give President Joe Biden solid marks for his first day in office, a set of new HuffPost/YouGov polling finds, rating him positively both on his inaugural address and on a series of executive actions he has signed.",
            "The results align with other polls on the beginning of the Biden presidency, which find him taking office with an average approval rating of about 55%. That’s a considerably higher starting point than President Donald Trump had, although it falls below the robust initial job approval “honeymoons” that were common for new White House occupants from the 1950s up through the end of the 1980s.",
            "Trump’s ratings throughout his four years in office remained both notably low and remarkably steady. The stability was likely due in part to his status as a polarizing figure, as well as broader forces of calcifying partisanship. Biden’s broader base of support offers more of a cushion, but also further room for volatility.",
            "In the HuffPost/YouGov survey, 43% of Americans say they feel Biden’s inauguration was meant for people like them, compared to 29% who say it was not. Four years ago, the public was about evenly split on whether Trump’s inauguration was meant for people like them.",
            "Similarly, Americans say by a 17-percentage-point margin that it would be a good thing if Biden’s actions as president are in line with his behavior as a candidate. In 2017, they said by a 22-point margin that it would be a bad thing if Trump’s presidency continued along the same lines of his candidacy.",
            "The poll finds that 57% of Americans say they either watched the inauguration or consumed later news coverage about it. As is generally the case with political events, the audience was self-selecting: people who chose to tune in are more politically engaged than the public at large and are significantly more likely to be supporters of Biden.",
            "Given that friendly audience, the reception for Biden’s inaugural address was ― perhaps unsurprisingly ― positive. Roughly three-quarters rated his speech as either good or excellent, with similar shares describing it as optimistic and giving them hope. In Four years ago, 55% of Americans who tuned into Trump’s inauguration speech rated it good or excellent.",
            "Immediately following his inaugural address, Biden signed 17 executive actions, more than half of which reversed Trump-era policies. In a second HuffPost/YouGov survey, which gauged opinions on nine of those actions, all polled at least slightly above-water, with most garnering majority support.",
            "Continuations of two Trump-era policies ― a moratorium on evictions and foreclosures, and an extension of the pause on federal student loan payments ― were among the most popular. But reversals of several Trump policies, including actions to keep the U.S. in the World Health Organization, rejoin the Paris climate accord, and halt construction of the border wall with Mexico, also saw net-positive ratings.",
            "Two-thirds or more of the public say they support extending the pause on federal student loans (67% approve) and the moratorium on evictions and foreclosures (70%), as well as banning workplace discrimination based on a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity (69%) and asking Americans to wear masks for 100 days while instituting new mask requirements for federal buildings and contractors (70%).",
            "Biden’s move to keep the U.S. in the World Health Organization was backed by 57%, while about half approve of the U.S. rejoining the Paris climate accord and halting construction of a wall on the border between the U.S. and Mexico.",
            "Less of a strong consensus was found on reversing the Trump administration’s “travel ban” for passport holders from seven Muslim-majority countries (45% approve, 41% disapprove) and canceling the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline (38% approve and 34% disapprove).",
            "None of the actions asked about in the poll received greater than 41% disapproval, and none saw more than a third of the public strongly opposed.\n",
            "Underlying those numbers is near-unanimous backing from Biden’s supporters, sometimes coupled with relatively muted reactions by his opponents. Most of the executive actions included in the survey had 90% support or higher among voters who backed Biden in 2020.",
            "A majority of Trump voters do disapprove of rolling back some of his most highly touted proposals, including the travel ban and the wall. Only about half, though, disapprove of the new mask-wearing guidance, and even fewer of the extended pause on student loan payments.",
            "On balance, Trump voters are more likely than not to support extending the eviction and foreclosure moratorium, as well as banning sexual-orientation or gender-identity based workplace discrimination.",
            "The rest of the public, comprising nonvoters and those who picked a third-party candidate, give positive ratings to all of the executive actions included in the survey, although they’re much more likely to say they’re unsure.",
            "The HuffPost/YouGov polls, each consisting of 1,000 completed interviews, were conducted Jan. 20-22 and Jan. 21-25 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.",

            "Most surveys report a margin of error that represents some but not all potential survey errors. YouGov’s reports include a model-based margin of error, which rests on a specific set of statistical assumptions about the selected sample rather than the standard methodology for random probability sampling.

            "White House press secretary Jen Psaki said late Sunday that Biden had invited Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and her colleagues “for a full exchange of views” after the lawmakers sent a letter to Biden outlining a rebuttal to his $1.9 trillion proposal for additional relief.",
            "“As has been widely reported, the President received a letter today from 10 Republican Senators asking to meet with him to discuss their ideas about the actions needed to address these crises,” Psaki said in a statement. “In response, the President spoke to Senator Collins, and invited her and other signers of the letter to come to the White House early this week.”",
            "Biden’s plan includes $1,400 relief checks for many Americans and a large expansion of unemployment benefits. In their letter, the Republicans countered with a package that would be 70% smaller ― although they said it could quickly pass through Congress. The plan includes $1,000 checks for most Americans and additional funds for vaccines and testing.",
            "“In the spirit of bipartisanship and unity, we have developed a COVID-19 relief framework that builds on prior COVID assistance laws, all of which passed with bipartisan support,” the group, which includes Sens. Collins, Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), Rob Portman (Ohio) and Mitt Romney (Utah). “Our proposal reflects many of your stated priorities, and with your support, we believe that this plan could be approved quickly by Congress with bipartisan support.”",

Americans of both parties are looking to their leaders to meet the moment.”",

            "date": "2021-01-28"
        },
        "articleContent": [
            "Former President Donald Trump did not do federal workers many favors. He instigated a partial government shutdown that left them furloughed for five weeks. He played political games with their annual raises. And he tried to weaken their unions and civil service protections.",
            "President Joe Biden has already sent a very different message as the new boss of the federal workforce.",
            "Biden signed an executive order last Friday repealing three controversial orders from the Trump administration that undermined federal job security and collective bargaining rights. On the same day, he revoked a separate action from Trump that would have converted certain career jobs in the federal government to political positions, so that more people could be hired and fired by political appointees.",
            "On Wednesday, Biden also took a step toward addressing political interference in scientific research, a hallmark of Trump’s tenure that affected federal workers in different agencies. Biden’s plan creates a task force that will spend four months reviewing government policies and identifying cases of partisan meddling. Although the order does little substantively, several researchers applauded it as an important first step in safeguarding scientific integrity.",
            "Overall, the quick actions by Biden signal a new era for federal workers who were buffeted throughout the Trump years. The previous administration tended to equate regular government workers with the so-called “swamp,” happily pushing them out of jobs and even using them as pawns in Trump’s fight with Congress for border wall funding.",
            "Trump’s efforts to hobble federal labor unions, although they gained less attention than furloughs and shutdown threats, were just as significant.",
            "One of his orders would have made it easier to fire federal workers, by gutting their grievance process and giving them less time to improve their performance. Another sought to renegotiate union contracts on a tighter timeline, in hopes of securing agreements on less favorable terms for workers. The third took aim at “official time”: hours that union representatives can devote to union-related issues while on government time.",
            "The American Federation of Government Employees called these initiatives “illegal union-busting.” Union officials saw the trio of executive orders as an attempt to weaken government unions into oblivion, by restricting their powers so much that workers would see no point in being members anymore. (The federal government functions under a ”right to work″ system, in which workers are not obligated to pay fees to unions that represent them.)",
            "Brian Deese, director of Biden’s National Economic Council, told reporters Friday that the repeal of those executive orders would “protect and empower federal employees who dedicate their careers to serving the American people, many in very difficult circumstances in this pandemic.”",
            "The quick reversal of the Trump orders signified a new relationship with the White House, said Tony Reardon, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents 150,000 workers in 33 agencies. Reardon said Biden personally told him during the presidential campaign that he would withdraw the orders if he was elected.",
            "“I would say that it’s night and day,” Reardon said in an interview. “Having those folks who are supportive of federal employees and have a deep respect for the work federal employees do, it’s something I am just incredibly happy about.”",
            "Federal unions sued to stop Trump’s executive orders from going into effect, successfully putting them on hold for a while. But even then Trump managed to carry out some of the same goals through a little-known government body called the Federal Service Impasse Panel, which referees labor disputes between federal agencies and the unions representing workers.",
            "Stocked with Trump appointees, the panel was ruling in favor of management in roughly 90% of the cases it took on, according to an analysis by the union Reardon heads. The panel essentially rewrote a contract at the Department of Health and Human Services, over the union’s objections.",
            "Reardon said the union has asked the Biden administration to go back to the table to negotiate certain contracts, saying the Trump administration did not bargain in good faith. The union also wants Biden to boot Trump’s appointees from the impasse panel, who are not confirmed by the Senate.",
            "“We need qualified appointees who are neutral and fair,” he said.",
            "Federal workers will probably find it easier to secure regular across-the-board raises moving forward, as well. Trump sometimes threatened to institute pay freezes for the federal workforce, though his proposals were often erratic. Before leaving office he called for a 1% annual raise, then revised it to zero.",
            "The 2.6% across-the-board raise federal workers received last year was the largest since 2009. (There was a three-year freeze under former President Barack Obama following the national financial crisis he inherited.)",
            "Democrats hold narrow majorities in both the House and Senate and are more likely than Republicans to advocate for pay increases and improved benefits. Last week, Democratic lawmakers introduced a bill in the House that would expand the paid family leave program for federal workers."

            "Lady Eliza and Lady Amelia Spencer were just 5 years old when their aunt, Princess Diana, died, but the 28-year-old twins still have fond memories of the late Princess of Wales.",
            "The twins, whose father is Diana’s brother, Charles Spencer, spoke about their relationship with Diana for a Tatler magazine cover story, published this week.",
            "“We always just knew her as our aunt,” Lady Eliza said in the magazine’s March 2021 issue, calling Diana “incredibly warm, maternal and loving,” with a “talent for reading children’s hearts.”\n\n“Growing up in South Africa, I really had very little idea of how significant she was in the world until I was much older,” Eliza added.\n\nEliza also recalled an incident with her aunt that occurred when the family went to a beach in South Africa and a photographer approached them.\n\n“Obviously it could have been quite terrifying for us, being so young and not understanding what was happening,” Eliza recalled. “But she turned it into a game of who could get back to the car first. It was amazing how she protected us in a way that made us feel safe and not frightened. We had no idea what she was doing at the time.”",
            "Princess Diana died on August 31, 1997, after a car she was traveling in crashed after being pursued by paparazzi in Paris. Her partner at the time, Dodi al-Fayed, also died in the wreck, as did Henri Paul, the driver of the car. Bodyguard Trevor Rees was the only survivor.\n\nAt the time of Diana’s death, Prince William was 15 and Prince Harry was only 12. Harry recently spoke about how camera flashes still trigger memories of his mother’s death.\n\n“I think being part of this family, in this role and this job, every single time I see a camera, every single time I hear a click, every single time I see a flash, it takes me straight back,” Harry said, while speaking to journalist Tom Bradby for the documentary, “Harry And Meghan: An African Journey,” in 2019.\n\n“So in that respect, it’s the worst reminder of her life as opposed to the best,” the Duke of Sussex added.\n\n“Everything I do reminds me of her,” he said. “But as I said ― with the role ― with the job and the sort of the pressures that come with that, I get reminded of the bad stuff, unfortunately.”",
            "Princes William and Harry will come together this year ― pending coronavirus pandemic setbacks ― to unveil a statue in honor of Diana on what would’ve been their mother’s 60th birthday: July 1, 2021.\n\nKensington Palace issued a statement about the statue, saying that it’s meant to recognize Diana’s “positive impact in the UK and around the world.”\n\n“The princes hope that the statue will help all those who visit Kensington Palace to reflect on their mother’s life and her legacy,” the statement added.",

            "The Senate voted 84-15 to confirm Yellen, with all opposition coming from Republicans, several of whom have expressed concerns about President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus aid proposal, tax and spending plans.",
            "The Senate later on Monday evening was expected to receive articles of impeachment against former President Donald Trump, a move that has also stoked some partisan divisions.",
            "Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Yellen had made history for a second time, seven years after she became the first woman to chair the Federal Reserve.",
            "“At the Treasury Department, there are long hallways where portraits hang of all 77 Treasury Secretaries — all men, all the way back to Alexander Hamilton,” Schumer wrote on Twitter. “I’m thrilled to vote for Janet Yellen today and add the first portrait of a woman to that hallway.”",
            "Yellen will play a key role in working with Congress on Biden’s coronavirus stimulus plans and on his pledges to invest $2 trillion in infrastructure, green energy projects, education and research to boost American competitiveness.",
            "Treasury will oversee Biden’s plans to help finance these initiatives by raising the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21% and increase taxes on those making over $400,000 a year.",
            "Republicans have expressed concerns over the price tag and increased debt in a return to fiscal conservatism after running up deficits during Trump’s term with the 2017 tax cuts and nearly $5 trillion in coronavirus spending.",
            "Yellen told senators at her confirmation hearing last week that they needed to raise the minimum wage and “act big” on stimulus measures or risk a longer, more painful recession brought on by the pandemic.",
            "SANCTIONS REVIEW",
            "Yellen also said during her confirmation hearing that she would conduct an immediate review of U.S. financial sanctions policy administered by Treasury to ensure that they were used “strategically and appropriately” after a major ramp-up of such measures under the Trump administration.",
            "Yellen’s confirmation less than a week after Biden took office is quick by recent standards. Her Republican predecessor, Steven Mnuchin, was not confirmed until three weeks after Trump’s 2017 inauguration on a party-line vote.",

            "WASHINGTON ― Live by the Sharpie. Die by the ballpoint.",
            "From the border wall with Mexico to the ban on transgender people in the military to travel prohibitions on majority-Muslim countries to the withdrawal from the Paris climate accord, many of former President Donald Trump’s proudest accomplishments have been undone in just the first days of successor Joe Biden’s administration.",
            "Trump’s failure to codify his preferred policies through legislation, relying instead on a black Sharpie marker to scrawl his signature onto executive actions and then show them off for the cameras, left them vulnerable to Biden’s signature on countermanding orders. And so far, the new president has signed dozens of them ― albeit with a ballpoint pen and less flourish, but every bit as effective ― wiping out much of Trump’s “legacy” in a matter of days.",
            "“Elections have consequences,” said a former Trump adviser on condition of anonymity.",
            "Biden took office at noon last Wednesday and did not arrive at the White House until nearly 4 p.m. Yet within two hours, he had signed 17 executive actions, including orders reentering the United States into the Paris agreement to combat climate change, ending the “national emergency” that Trump had declared to let him raid money for his border wall from the military construction budget, suspending Trump’s ban on travel from a group of majority-Muslim nations, revoking Trump’s order blocking the counting of undocumented immigrants in the 2020 census, and reinstating the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that halts deportation of many immigrants who came into the country illegally as young children.",
            "In the following days, Biden restored collective bargaining power for federal employees and ordered the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to find ways to keep workers across a range of industries safe from COVID-19.",
            "And on Monday, the new president rescinded the ban that Trump had imposed on transgender people serving in the military.",
            "“It’s simple: America is safer when everyone qualified to serve can do so openly and with pride,” Biden said in an Oval Office ceremony.",
            "The rapid-fire reversals highlight Trump’s reliance on implementing change on his own rather than building support for his ideas in Congress in order to pass laws.",
            "On his promise to build a wall along the southern border, for example, Trump neglected it entirely during the two years Republicans controlled both the House and Senate, then triggered a monthlong government shutdown to try to coerce Congress into giving him funds to construct it, and finally declared a national emergency that provided a justification for him to raid military construction budgets ― taking money that otherwise would have gone for such things as schools and on-base housing for service members and their families. Doing so allowed him to build 453 miles of new steel fencing along the 2,000-mile Mexican border, although only about 80 miles are in stretches where no previous barrier existed. (Trump had promised hundreds of times during his 2016 campaign that he would force Mexico to pay for the wall, but in four years he never made that request even once, and Mexico never paid a dime.)",
            "One former White House official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said that in Trump’s first year, after failing to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the White House focused on passing the tax cut bill. “They got it through while he had both houses of Congress,” the former official said.",
            "Cutting taxes, though, is a perennial priority for Republicans and almost certainly would have passed a GOP-controlled Congress with or without Trump’s backing. Legislation pushing Trump’s own agenda, on the other hand, was almost nonexistent.",
            "Indeed, the one notable exception was in 2018, when Trump’s proposal to severely restrict immigration ― long a priority of top policy aide Stephen Miller ― was given a vote on the Senate floor and received just 41 yeas, the fewest of any of the plans under consideration that day.",
            "The former White House aide said that vote pretty much ended Trump’s interest in immigration legislation. “That ship sailed after that first effort,” he said.",
            "Biden, for his part, acknowledged that executive orders and memorandums can only get him so far.",
            "“I’m proud of today’s executive actions, and I’m going to start by keeping the promises I made to the American people,” he said in the Oval Office on Inauguration Day, a tall brown stack of binders on his desk awaiting his signature. “These are just executive actions. They are important, but we’re going to need legislation for a lot of the things we’re going to do.”"

            "And Matt LaFleur didn’t trust them to get a touchdown with the game on the line.",
            "In a decision that will be debated for a long, long time, LaFleur kicked a field goal with 2:05 left and the Packers trailing 31-23 instead of going for it on fourth-and-goal at the 8-yard line. The Packers couldn’t get a stop after that, giving up a questionable pass interference penalty on a late flag with less than two minutes left to go, which helped allow the Buccaneers to run out the clock on a 31-26 win. Brady is heading to his 10th Super Bowl, and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers are going to their second Super Bowl in franchise history.",
            "There have been many disappointments for Rodgers in the playoffs. He hasn’t made a Super Bowl in 10 years, and has only made one in his career. Rodgers got the chance to have an NFC championship game at home, and had an opportunity to win it in the fourth quarter. He’ll wonder about the opportunities that Green Bay missed Sunday, particularly when they had the ball at the 8-yard line with a few minutes to go.",
            "Aaron Rodgers tries to rally Packers",
            "A little more than a minute into the third quarter, it seemed like the Buccaneers were going to run away with the NFC title.",

The Buccaneers reconsidered punting on fourth-and-4, then completed a short pass for the first down and a 39-yard pass to Scotty Miller for a touchdown with one second left. To start the second half, Aaron Jones lost a fumble and Brady hit Cameron Brate on a short touchdown for a 28-10 lead.",
            "Rodgers wasn’t ready to concede. He hit a touchdown to Robert Tonyan and then Brady made his first big mistake, an interception to Adrian Amos. Rodgers marched the Packers back down and hit Davante Adams for a short touchdown. Equanimeous St. Brown dropped the two-point conversion (that would be a big play when the Packers later went for a field goal on fourth down instead of trying for a touchdown), but the Bucs’ lead had been cut to 28-23 with a quarter to go.",
            "Brady looked like he’d counterpunch when he led the Buccaneers into Green Bay territory, but a pass to Mike Evans was just out of his reach, deflected and intercepted by Jaire Alexander. The Packers turned back that scoring opportunity, but the offense couldn’t move the ball and had to punt.",
            "Brady threw another pick to Alexander, under heavy pressure on a third-down blitz, but the defense held again. Two three-and-outs with the Packers trailing by less than a touchdown will haunt Green Bay and Rodgers.",
            "But they still had a chance to tie, before a baffling decision.",
            "Packers can’t get a late stop",
            "Brady led a field-goal drive. He hit Chris Godwin for 11 yards. Then he threw a tight end screen to Rob Gronkowski for 27 more. That set up a Ryan Succop 46-yard field goal and a 31-23 lead.",
            "Brady led a field-goal drive that put the Buccaneers ahead 31-23 with 4:42 remaining. Rodgers answered. He marched the Packers downfield in the final minutes. He hit Marquez Valdes-Scantling for 29 yards, then Davante Adams for a first down at the Tampa Bay 8-yard line.",
            "He threw two incompletions after that. Then came two plays that the Packers will be replayed for a long time. On third down, it seems Rodgers had a chance to run to the end zone. He could have at least gotten close. But he forced a pass to the middle into heavy coverage, which was incomplete.",
            "It seemed like the game would ride on a fourth down play. But LaFleur sent out the field-goal team. The thought was that the Packers needed a touchdown and a two-point conversion, which would be difficult. LaFleur clearly thought he had a better chance of the defense getting a stop to give Rodgers the ball back, but it was a huge gamble.",
            "The Packers needed a stop and thought they had one when Brady threw incomplete to Tyler Johnson. Kevin King held onto Johnson but it seemed there was no flag, until the back judge far behind the play threw a flag seconds after the ball hit the ground. Replays showed that King did grab Johnson’s jersey, but it was a debatable call in a game that had very few penalties. The Buccaneers got one more first down after that to win it.",
            "The Packers did have their chances. They’ll have a lot to think about in the offseason, particularly why they didn’t let Rodgers try to put them in position to tie the game on a fourth down that will be talked about in Wisconsin until next season. And beyond.",

            "WUHAN, China (AP) — A year ago, a notice sent to smartphones in Wuhan at 2 a.m. announced the world’s first coronavirus lockdown, bringing the bustling central Chinese industrial and transport center to a virtual standstill almost overnight. It would last 76 days.",
            "Early Saturday morning, however, residents of the city where the virus was first detected were jogging and practicing tai chi in a fog-shrouded park beside the mighty Yangtze River.",
            "Life has largely returned to normal in the city of 11 million, even as the rest of the world grapples with the spread of the virus’ more contagious variants. Efforts to vaccinate people for COVID-19 have been frustrated by disarray and limited supplies in some places. The scourge has killed more than 2 million people worldwide.",
            "Traffic was light in Wuhan but there was no sign of the barriers that a year ago isolated neighborhoods, prevented movement around the city and confined people to their housing compounds and even apartments.",
            "Wuhan accounted for the bulk of China’s 4,635 deaths from COVID-19, a number that has largely stayed static for months. The city has been largely free of further outbreaks since the lockdown was lifted on April 8, but questions persist as to where the virus originated and whether Wuhan and Chinese authorities acted fast enough and with sufficient transparency to allow the world to prepare for a pandemic that has sickened more than 98 million.",
            "Wuhan has been praised for its sacrifice in the service of the nation, turning it into a sort of Stalingrad in China’s war against the virus, commemorated in books, documentaries, TV shows and florid panegyrics from officials including head of state and leader of the Communist Party Xi Jinping.",
            "“We think Wuhan is a heroic city. After all, it stopped its economy to help China deal with the pandemic. This is a noble act,” said resident Chen Jiali, 24, who works at an internet shopping company.",
            "China on Saturday announced another 107 cases, bringing its total since the start of the pandemic to 88,911. Of those, the northern province of Heilongjiang accounted for the largest number at 56. Beijing and the eastern financial hub of Shanghai both reported three new cases amid mass testing and lockdowns of hospitals and housing units linked to recent outbreaks.",
            "Authorities are wary of the potential for a new surge surrounding next month’s Lunar New Year holiday and are telling people not to travel and to avoid gatherings as much as possible. Schools are being let out a week early and many have already shifted to online classes. Mask wearing remains virtually universal indoors and on public transport. Mobile phone apps are used to trace people’s movements and prove they are both virus-free and have not been to areas where suspected cases have been found.",
            "Since the end of the lockdown, Wuhan has largely been spared further outbreaks, something residents such as chemistry teacher Yao Dongyu attribute to heightened awareness resulting from the traumatic experience of last year.",
            "“At that time, people were very nervous, but the government gave us huge support. It was a very powerful guarantee, so we got through this together,” said Yao, 24. “Since Wuhan people went through the pandemic, they’ve done better in personal precautions than people in other regions.”",
            "China has doggedly defended its actions in the early days of the outbreak, saying it helped buy time for the rest of the world while pushing fringe theories that the virus was brought to the city from outside China, possibly from a laboratory in the U.S.",
            "After months of negotiations, China finally gave permission last week for the World Health Organization to send a team of international experts to begin investigating the virus’ origins. They are currently undergoing two weeks of quarantine.",
            "A panel of experts commissioned by the WHO criticized China and other countries this week for not moving to stem the initial outbreak earlier, prompting Beijing to concede it could have done better.",
            "Meanwhile, in Hong Kong in southern China, thousands of residents were locked down Saturday in an unprecedented move to contain a worsening outbreak in the city.",
            "Hong Kong has been grappling to contain a fresh wave of the coronavirus since November. More than 4,300 cases have been recorded in the last two months, making up nearly 40% of the city’s total.",

            "Biden is looking to jump-start his first 100 days in office with action and symbolism to reassure a divided and very weary public that help is in the offing. He also knows that what a president can do on his own is limited so he is calling for Congress to act while he is being candid with Americans that dark days are ahead.",
            "“The crisis is not getting better. It’s deepening,” Biden said Friday about the impact of the pandemic. “A lot of America is hurting. The virus is surging. Families are going hungry. People are at risk of being evicted again. Job losses are mounting. We need to act.”",
            "“The bottom line is this: We’re in a national emergency. We need to act like we’re in a national emergency,” he said.",
            "Biden’s first moments as president were meant to steady American democracy itself.",
            "He took the oath just before noon Wednesday in front of a Capitol that still bore scars from the insurrection that took place precisely two weeks earlier and was aimed at stopping Biden’s ascension to power. The violence underscored the fragile nature of the peaceful transfer of power and led to the historic second impeachment of Donald Trump.",
            "Biden resisted calls to move the inauguration to a more secure indoor setting. He was intent on preserving the usual inauguration trappings as a signal that normalcy could be achieved even though there were signs everywhere that things were far from normal: a military presence that resembled a war zone, guests on the dais wearing masks, a National Mall filled with 200,000 American flags standing in for the American people who were asked to stay away because of the pandemic.",
            "Biden was plain-spoken and direct about the confluence of crises the nation faces. More than 410,000 Americans have lost their lives to the pandemic, millions are out of work and the aftershocks of a summer reckoning with racial justice are still felt.",
            "“You can hear this collective sigh of relief that Trump is gone, but we have no time for a sigh of relief because of the cascading crises,” said Eddie Glaude Jr., chair of the department of African American studies at Princeton University. “We don’t want to assume that the election of Biden solves everything. The scale of the problems is immense and the question for us is do we respond at scale.”",
            "The changes within the White House have been swift.",
            "After Trump’s departure, his final staffers cleared out and a deep clean began. The White House had been the site of multiple COVID-19 outbreaks and, in a physical manifestation of a new approach to the virus, plastic shields were placed on desks, and scores of new staffers were told to work from home.",
            "New pictures were hung on the West Wing walls and the Oval Office received a fast makeover. Gone was a painting of Andrew Jackson and the Diet Coke button of the desk; in came images of Robert Kennedy and Cesar Chavez. But the most important symbol, the clearest break from the previous administration, came from the president himself.",
            "When Biden sat down at the Resolute Desk to sign the first batch of his executive orders on Wednesday, he was wearing a mask. Trump had resisted wearing one, putting one on only occasionally and instead of turning mask-wearing into a polarizing political issue.",
            "Biden urged all Americans to wear a mask for the next 100 days and used his platform to model the same behavior, one of several ways he tried to change the tone of the presidency in his first few days.",
            "Daily press briefings returned, absent the accusations of “fake news” that marked only sporadic briefings in the Trump era. Biden held a virtual swearing-in for hundreds of White House staffers, telling them to treat each other with respect or they would be dismissed, a marked change from the contentious, rivalry-driven Trump West Wing. Calls to the leaders of Canada and Mexico were made without drama.",
            "The executive actions Biden signed during the week were a mix of concrete and symbolic actions meant to undo the heart of Trump’s legacy. Biden halted construction of the border wall, rejoined the World Health Organization and the Paris climate accord, and bolstered the means for production for vaccines.",
            "But the might of the executive actions pales in comparison to the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package that he requested from Congress. Biden has not ruled out asking Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., to push it through by tactics requiring only Democratic support. But the president, who spent decades in the Senate, hoped to persuade Republicans to support the measure.",
            "“Leaning on executive action makes sense at the start, you can get things going and show momentum right away without waiting for Congress,” said Robert Gibbs, former press secretary for President Barack Obama. “But this is going take a while. Like it was for us in 2009, change doesn’t come overnight.”",
            "“Everything he inherited is likely to get worse before we see improvement,” Gibbs continued. “One thing you learn on January 20th is that you suddenly own all of it.”",
            "Just two Cabinet nominees were confirmed by week’s end, to the frustration of the White House. But with the Friday night announcement that Trump’s impeachment trial will not begin until the week of Feb. 8, Biden aides were optimistic that the Senate would confirm more before then.",
            "The trial looms as an unwelcome distraction for the Biden team. But while Trump will shadow the White House, Biden aides have noted that the former president commands far less attention now that his Twitter account is gone. They have expressed confidence that the Senate can balance the impeachment proceedings with both Cabinet confirmations and consideration of the COVID-19 relief bill.",
            "Biden has made clear that steering the nation through the pandemic will be his signature task and some Republicans believe that Trump’s implosion could create an opening to work across the aisle on a relief deal.",
            "“There is a very narrow permission structure for congressional Republicans who want to move past the Trump era and want to establish their own political identities,” said Kevin Madden, a Republican strategist who was a senior adviser on Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign. Romney is now a Utah senator.",
            "“There is an old saying: ‘Make the main thing the main thing.’ And the Biden White House knows that’s the main thing,” Madden said. “If they can improve the pandemic response in the next 100 days, then they can move on to other priorities, they’ll have the capital for legislative fights. But they need to get it right.”",

            "When President Joe Biden announced his $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill last week, the opening bid drew mostly positive reviews from progressive observers.",
            "But a handful of influential left-wing members of Congress, activists and commentators cried foul, arguing that Biden’s proposal failed to deliver on his promise to provide all lower- and middle-income households with $2,000 relief payments.",
            "Biden is asking Congress to send $1,400 checks to all Americans. Together with a previous allotment of $600, the payments come to $2,000.",
            "Biden’s left-wing critics, including Democratic Reps. Cori Bush (Mo.), Rashida Tlaib (Mich.) and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.), maintain that Biden promised to provide $2,000 payments on top of the $600 already distributed. Anything short of that, these critics maintain, betrays the Georgia voters who cast votes for Democrats in the Jan. 5 Senate runoffs based on the promise of $2,000 payments.",
            "“The promise was for $2,000 survival checks,” tweeted Nina Turner, a close ally of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Turner is running in a special election to fill an open House seat from Cleveland, Ohio.",
            "The debate is about more than just the size of the cash payments: It reflects a larger argument over the most effective ways for the activist left to push Biden over the course of the next four years.",
            "On one side are lawmakers, activists and media personalities who have seized on the $2,000 payments as a means of signaling their skepticism of Biden and vigilance against any missteps.",
            "A second, larger camp of progressives regards criticism of the checks as a tactical error that undermines the left’s credibility and detracts from other priorities.",
            "The negative reaction to Biden’s proposal was “a bit myopic,” said Sean McElwee, a co-founder of the think tank and polling firm Data for Progress, who has consulted for groups that were instrumental in Ocasio-Cortez’s and Bush’s primary wins. “It speaks to the extent to which a lot of leftist discourse is a deeply surface-level analysis of politics.”",
            "Biden and his team maintain that he never intended to promise more than $2,000 total. In an implicit nod to the objections, on Jan. 14, then-Vice President-elect Kamala Harris tweeted out Biden’s full remarks on the subject.",
            "“We will finish the job of getting a total of $2,000 in cash relief to people who need it the most,” she quoted him as saying. “The $600 already appropriated is simply not enough.”",
            "Indeed, left-wing critics of Biden’s proposal do not exactly have the facts on their side.",
            "When then-President Donald Trump blew up congressional negotiations with his Dec. 22 call to deliver $2,000 payments, rather than $600 checks, Reps. Tlaib and Ocasio-Cortez jumped at the opportunity.",
            "Hours after Trump’s comments, the congresswomen drafted an amendment increasing the payments in a recently passed bill from $600 to $2,000. Just over a week later, the House passed an identical bill with a symbolic voice vote. But then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) blocked consideration of the bill in the Senate. Trump ended up signing the bill with $600 payments.",
            "Democrats subsequently used McConnell’s obstruction of the bill to help flip two Republican-held Senate seats in Georgia.",
            "Warren Gunnels, a senior aide to Sanders, whose advocacy for cash relief helped ensure its inclusion in the original relief package, described Biden’s proposal as both a fair effort to deliver on his promise as well as a major improvement on the status quo.",
            "“We fought like hell to get [$2,000] done, the GOP blocked it,” Gunnels tweeted. “Now, Biden included it in his plan. Folks, that’s a good start.”",
            "Pressed on the matter, some progressive critics of the Biden proposal, including the hosts of the popular podcast “Chapo Trap House,” have been willing to concede that Biden always intended to supplement the $600 payments rather than add $2,000 to the existing $600 payments.",
            "But regardless of the fine print of Biden’s plan, he and Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff blurred that distinction in order to win favor with Georgia voters before their successful Senate elections, the critics maintain.",
            "“We’ll put an end to the block in Washington on that $2,000 stimulus check ― that money that will go out the door immediately,” Biden told Democrats at a rally for Warnock and Ossoff on the day before the runoffs. “There’s no one in America with more power to make that happen than you the citizens of Atlanta, the citizens of Georgia. And that’s not an exaggeration. ... That’s literally true.“",
            "In a tweet attacking his Republican opponent, then-Sen. Kelly Loeffler, Warnock simplified the proposition as well. “Want a $2,000 check? #VoteWarnock,” the tweet said in a graphic featuring a $2,000 check from the U.S. Treasury.",
            "To avoid the perception of falling short of his promises and fortify Warnock, who is up for reelection in 2022, these progressives want Biden to err on the side of generosity and make the payments $2,000 rather than $1,400. After all, the first $600 payment had Trump’s signature on it.",
            "“The promise of ‘$2,000 checks’ was reiterated many times, including after $600 checks went out the door,” Claire Sandberg, a progressive organizer and former senior official on both of Sanders’s presidential campaigns. “It’s inevitable that a significant number of Americans will feel like a promise was broken if they get a $1,400 check in the mail instead of a $2,000 check.”",
            "In a note to a group of socialists, David Duhalde, a vice chair of the Democratic Socialists of America Fund, the DSA’s philanthropic arm, acknowledged the merit of the critique of Biden’s proposal before suggesting that an ill-fated battle to increase the payments risked making the left appear weak.",
            "“Jumping on a misunderstanding to make it look like we, the left, are losing, is a self-own,” he wrote.",
            "Spokespeople for Biden, Warnock and Ossoff did not respond to HuffPost’s requests for comment on Sandberg’s argument and the overall critique of the politics of the relief checks.",
            "Regardless, it does not look like the left-wing members of Congress who initially expressed disappointment in Biden are pressing forward with the matter. Spokespeople for Reps. Bush and Tlaib, as well as Justice Democrats, a group aligned with them, did not respond to a request for comment on whether they would mobilize against a bill that does not include a full $2,000 check. A spokesperson for Ocasio-Cortez declined to comment.",
            "Instead, progressive leaders in Congress are using the occasion to reiterate their calls for recurring monthly cash payments of $2,000.",
            "Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn), the Congressional Progressive Caucus whip, said on Twitter that she and other progressives are soliciting support from House colleagues for a letter to Biden calling for recurring checks.",
            "“One more check is not enough during this public health and economic crisis,” Omar states in the letter obtained by HuffPost. “To truly build back better, families need stability and certainty through ongoing relief ― they cannot be at the mercy of Congressional gridlock.”",
            "One reason progressive activists and lawmakers are so invested in the cash payments debate one way or another is that they see it as a backdoor route to the establishment of more permanent cash assistance, such as a universal basic income program.",
            "They have also been eager to tout the political benefits of promising and delivering on material improvements in ordinary Americans’ lives. In an effort to combat claims that left-wing slogans had hurt Democrats at the polls in November, the climate-focused Sunrise Movement, Data for Progress and Justice Democrats jointly published a memo advising Democrats to turn the Senate runoffs in Georgia into a referendum on $1,200 stimulus checks.",
            "But Data for Progress’s McElwee contends that increasing pandemic unemployment benefits and increasing federal aid to state and local governments should be higher priorities than pressing Biden to up the onetime payment from $1,400 to $2,000.",
            "He is also concerned about lawmakers’ vulnerability to pressure from a new crop of left-wing media influencers, such as Jimmy Dore, who seem more concerned with growing their audiences than with advancing practical solutions. Following the November election, Dore, a populist shock jock whose YouTube channel has more than 850,000 subscribers, led a sometimes nasty campaign to get left-wing members of Congress to withhold their support for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) unless she agreed to allow a vote on Medicare for All.",
            "Dore panned Biden’s proposal on his Tuesday show. After playing a clip of Biden using the word “literally” in his Atlanta speech, Dore joked that Biden was “literally full of shit” about the $2,000 checks.",
            "“Progressives who understand this stuff and have a policy platform really shouldn’t be allowing the message to be overtaken by people who don’t have strategic instincts and are largely trying to build media platforms for themselves,” McElwee said. “Because ultimately that will redound negatively to the health of our movement and our ability to deliver smart and effective policy concessions.”"

            "Less than a few days into President Joe Biden’s administration, America’s Roman Catholic bishops are already displaying deep disagreements over how to deal with the progressive faith of the country’s second Catholic president.",
            "Chicago’s Cardinal Blase Cupich issued a rare, sharp rebuke on Twitter in response to his brother bishops’ Inauguration Day letter to President Joe Biden, a letter that both congratulated and criticized Biden.",
            "The bishops’ inauguration letter ― which blasted Biden’s stance on abortion and other culture war issues ― was “ill-considered,” Cupich insisted.",
            "“Aside from the fact that there is seemingly no precedent for doing so, the statement, critical of President Biden, came as a surprise to many bishops, who received it just hours before it was released,” Cupich wrote on Twitter.",
            "This unusual public airing of grievances was a response to a letter from Los Angeles Archbishop José H. Gomez, the president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. Gomez’s letter stated that there are some areas where the bishops agree with Biden’s politics ― such as the president’s “longstanding commitment to the Gospel’s priority for the poor.” At the same time, he emphasized that Biden’s policies on abortion rights, contraception, marriage and gender “would advance moral evils and threaten human life and dignity.”",
            "“For the nation’s bishops, the continued injustice of abortion remains the ‘preeminent priority,‘” Gomez wrote, quoting a voting guide the bishops’ conference put together for American Catholics.",
            "“Preeminent does not mean ‘only,’” Gomez added. “We have deep concerns about many threats to human life and dignity in our society. But as Pope Francis teaches, we cannot stay silent when nearly a million unborn lives are being cast aside in our country year after year through abortion.”",
            "While always upholding longstanding church teaching on abortion, Pope Francis has also cautioned against Roman Catholics becoming “obsessed” with issues like abortion rights, gay marriage and contraception, urging his flock to focus on serving the poor and oppressed.",
            "Cupich, who was tapped by Francis to become archbishop and later a cardinal, said Gomez’s statement was crafted without normal vetting procedures.",
            "“The internal institutional failures involved must be addressed, and I look forward to contributing to all efforts to that end, so that, inspired by the Gospel, we can build up the unity of the Church, and together take up the work of healing our nation in this moment of crisis,” Cupich wrote.",
            "Cupich’s office did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.",
            "Cupich’s own statement on Biden’s inauguration did not explicitly mention the president’s stance on abortion rights. Cupich asked that “every life be valued, protected and nurtured as we rebuild a nation once again dedicated to its founding ideals of liberty and justice for all.”",
            "Cardinal Joseph W. Tobin of Newark, New Jersey, another Francis-appointed cardinal, told Catholic News Service on Thursday that it’s difficult to understand how Biden can reconcile his Catholic faith with his stance on abortion rights. Still, Tobin said he doesn’t understand people who “use very harsh words and want to cut off all communication with the president because of this.”",
            "Pope Francis’s Inauguration Day message to Biden did not reference the president’s stance on abortion. Francis urged the president to pursue reconciliation and peace in the United States.",
            "“I pray that your decisions will be guided by a concern for building a society marked by authentic justice and freedom, together with unfailing respect for the rights and dignity of every person, especially the poor, the vulnerable and those who have no voice,” Francis wrote in the letter.",
            "Biden is a lifelong Catholic who has spoken often about how his faith has supported him through periods of suffering. He has grappled with the issue of abortion throughout his political career, walking back his opposition to federal funding for abortion only when he became a front-runner for the Democratic nomination for president in 2019.",
            "As of this week, Biden’s administration is preparing to reverse a Trump administration policy that prohibited U.S. funding for nongovernmental groups that provide or refer patients for abortions.",
            "Biden’s liberal stances on culture war issues may place him at odds with Catholic doctrine, but he’s not alone. Most American Catholics ignore church teaching on contraception, and a majority say abortion should be legal in all or most cases.",
            "Some American bishops have expressed concern that Biden’s policy positions will create “confusion” in the pews about church doctrine. Gomez has said he plans to create a working group to address the matter.",
            "Over the past few decades, the USCCB’s moral vision has narrowed to the point where the bishops treat abortion as though it matters more than any other moral issue, said Natalia Imperatori-Lee, a scholar of Catholicism at Manhattan College. She pointed out that the USCCB did not issue letters calling out former President Donald Trump for his racism, disregard for the environment or his alleged sexual misconduct and assaults.",
            "The USCCB’s response to Biden is partly a result of the way white American Catholicism has entered the mainstream, Imperatori-Lee said. She said white Catholics have reached a level of economic success that has aligned them with the Republican Party, which uses sexual morality issues to get people to the polls and ensure the conservative court appointments. But there’s no guarantee that “pro-life” judges will make “pro-life” decisions, she said ― referring to the fact that a mostly Catholic Supreme Court allowed federal executions to go forward even though Francis has said the death penalty is wrong in all cases.",
            "Ultimately, Imperatori-Lee said, she thinks most American Catholics see Biden as a “devout Catholic, doing his best for his country and his world, trying to advance the common good in a pluralistic society.”",
            "“Do the bishops want to join in this work of seeking the common good, or do they want to be a stumbling block to it?” she asked."

He was hospitalized with the disease in late December. He had several health scares in recent years, including multiple heart attacks, a lung cancer diagnosis and a stroke.",
            "King died at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. The news was announced “with profound sadness” on his official Twitter account by the company he co-founded, Ora Media:",
            "“For 63 years and across the platforms of radio, television and digital media, Larry’s many thousands of interviews, awards, and global acclaim stand as a testament to his unique and lasting talent as a broadcaster,” read the statement.",
            "“Larry always viewed his interview subjects as the true stars of his programs, and himself as merely an unbiased conduit between the guest and audience,” it continued. “Whether he was interviewing a U.S. president, foreign leader, celebrity, scandal-ridden personage, or an everyman, Larry liked to ask short, direct, and uncomplicated questions. He believed concise questions usually provided the best answers, and he was not wrong in that belief.”",
            "CNN President Jeff Zucker paid tribute to King, describing him as “the scrappy young man from Brooklyn” with a “history-making career.”",
            "“We are so proud of the 25 years he spent with CNN, where his newsmaker interviews truly put the network on the international stage,” Zucker said in a statement released on Twitter.",
            "King was best known for his two-and-a-half decade run as the raspy-voiced host of “Larry King Live,” CNN’s longest-running program and one of its most-watched.",
            "He rose above personal tragedy, financial despair and half a dozen divorces to become one of the most revered and prolific interviewers in broadcasting.",

            "King was born Larry Harvey Zeiger on Nov. 19, 1933, in Brooklyn, New York. He was raised in an Orthodox Jewish household by his parents, Jennie Zeiger (nee Gitlitz), a garment worker from Lithuania, and Aaron Zeiger, a restaurant owner from Ukraine. He had a young brother named Marty.",
            "King was 9 years old when his father died suddenly of a heart attack, forcing his mother to go on welfare. Soon after, the family packed up its home in Brooklyn’s Brownsville neighborhood and moved roughly seven miles southwest to a tiny attic apartment in Bensonhurst.",
            "Larry King was a baseball fanatic from a young age and spent his childhood idolizing the Brooklyn Dodgers and fantasizing about broadcasting their games one day. He later became a die-hard New York Yankees fan after the Dodgers moved to Los Angeles.",
            "King lost interest in school following his father’s death, barely finished high school and never enrolled in college. He became a self-proclaimed “radio freak,” spending countless hours listening to broadcasts of baseball games to help fill a void left by his father’s death.",
            "“By the time I was in junior high school, I already knew. You could see it in the school yearbook,” King wrote in his 2009 bestselling autobiography, “My Remarkable Journey.” “They asked me what I wanted to be, and I told them: a radio announcer.”",
            "At 23, King took a train to Miami to pursue his dream of working in broadcasting. He landed his first radio job at WAHR (now WMBM), helping to clean and to perform administrative tasks at the small station.",
            "The aspiring broadcaster got his big break a few weeks later when a morning disc jockey suddenly quit, and King was tapped to fill the open spot.",
            "Moments before going on air for the first time, the station manager called him into his office to suggest his new host drop “Zeiger” in favor of a less “ethnic” last name. And so on May 1, 1957, he made his radio debut as Larry King. (He didn’t change his name legally until 1959.)",
            "King gained notoriety after making the switch to local station WKAT, where his morning radio show was broadcast live from a Jewish deli called Pumpernick’s. The show started out by airing interviews with restaurant patrons or staff members before reeling in enough listeners to attract big names such as Bobby Darin and Jimmy Hoffa.",
            "The Pumpernick’s spot created more opportunity for King to pick up other local gigs, including a weekly interview show at a small TV station and a column in the Miami Herald.",
            "After bouncing around local radio and TV stations, King’s reign as one of Miami’s most regarded figures came crashing down in 1971 when he was arrested on grand larceny charges.",
            "King’s arrest followed years of poor personal finance decisions in the 1960s that left him nearly broke. When his imprisoned friend gave him thousands of dollars to pass along to a law firm on his behalf, King decided to pay off his own debts with the cash instead. He was slapped with the charges shortly after his former friend was released from prison.",
            "Though the case was eventually dismissed, King’s employers dropped him anyway. It would be years before he was offered another gig in Miami.",
            "King was working at Miami’s WIOD radio station in 1977 when he received the call that would launch his career to the national stage. Ed Little, then president of the Mutual Broadcasting System radio network, offered him his own all-night national radio talk show.",
            "From midnight to 5:30 a.m. Eastern Time every weeknight until its final broadcast in 2010, King interviewed guests and took questions from callers. The show won a Peabody Award in 1982 and captured the attention of listeners across the country, including media mogul Ted Turner.",
            "In 1985, Turner hired King to host a nightly hourlong TV show on CNN, which had launched in 1980. The opportunity would be a defining moment in King’s career.",
            "“Larry King Live” hosted hordes of celebrities — U.S. presidents, world leaders, entertainers and athletes — in the 25 years the show was on the air.",
            "King interviewed nearly everyone worth noting in more than 6,000 episodes of “Larry King Live,” which averaged more than 1 million viewers nightly.",
            "The tenacious interviewer earned “Larry King Live” a Peabody Award in 1992, the same year billionaire Ross Perot announced his presidential bid on the show.",
            "A 1993 episode featuring a debate between Perot and Al Gore won the title of CNN’s most-watched segment until 2015.",
            "King was often criticized for throwing out softball questions, though he denied this was intentional. He preferred his interviews to develop organically, adopting a more conversational style rather than sticking to a script or preparing a set of questions, he said.",
            "“You’ve got to know basics,” he wrote in his autobiography. “But if you have the time to draw people out, I find it’s better to know very little. You can always get into the whos, whats, and whys. It’s not only better than knowing too many of the whos ― it’s more fun.”",
            "His unthreatening style appealed to guests and scored him countless interviews with people who would otherwise skip journalists who would pose more aggressive questions. New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd once called his show “the resort area of American journalism.”",
            "King was drawn to celebrity gossip, sometimes devoting the bulk of a segment to a scandal rather than to serious news coverage. His show received record-high ratings during the infamous O.J. Simpson slow-speed chase on a Los Angeles freeway in a white Bronco.",
            "“Larry King Live” covered the former NFL star’s arrest and double-murder trial extensively, and King scored Simpson’s first interview after he was acquitted.",
            "Watch King discuss Perot’s presidential announcement below:",
            "King shied away from revealing his political leanings for most of his broadcasting career. He briefly abandoned this position when he came out in support of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential election.",
            "“Larry King Live” ran until December 2010, earning the title of CNN’s longest-running program of all time. In January 2011, British journalist Piers Morgan took over King’s time slot with “Piers Morgan Tonight.” (Morgan’s show was dropped from the network in 2014.)",
            "Besides the Peabodys, King also won GLAAD Media’s Vanguard Award in 1999 and was honored with two lifetime achievement awards: One at the 2011 News & Documentary Emmy Awards and again in 2015 from the Association for International Broadcasting.",
            "King was inducted into the Radio Hall of Fame in 1989 and the Broadcasting Hall of Fame in 1992. He earned a star on Hollywood’s Walk of Fame in 1997.",
            "King also earned numerous honorary degrees from universities, including Brooklyn College, George Washington University and Columbia University.",
            "He was a prolific writer, authoring more than 20 books, including a novel, a children’s book and his autobiography.",
            "He made cameos in dozens of TV series and movies, including “Ghostbusters,” “Contact” and “Enemy of the State.” He also provided the voice of “Doris the Ugly Stepsister” in three installments of the “Shrek” animated film series.",
            "King suffered multiple heart attacks in the decades leading up to his death. He was a heavy smoker but never touched a cigarette again after his first heart attack in 1987. After receiving quintuple bypass heart surgery in 1988, King founded the Larry King Cardiac Foundation to help patients afford expensive treatments associated with heart-related illnesses.",
            "King wasn’t shy about his love of women and sex. He was known for making numerous trips to the altar, tying the knot eight times over his lifetime ― twice to the same woman.",
            "King married his high school sweetheart, Freda Miller, at 19, though the couple’s parents had the marriage annulled within a year.",
            "In 1961, he married Annette Kaye, but the union ended months later. She gave birth to King’s first child, Larry King Jr., in 1961. The elder King never knew Kaye was pregnant and didn’t know he had a son until 1994, when King Jr. reached out to him at the request of his dying mother.",
            "Playboy Bunny Alene Akins became King’s third wife soon after his split from Kaye. King adopted Akins’ son, Andy, from a previous marriage. The couple divorced in 1963. They remarried in 1968, had a daughter, Chaia King, and divorced again in 1971.",
            "In between King’s two marriages to Akins, he married (and subsequently divorced two years later) fourth wife Mickey Sutphin. They had a daughter, Kelly, who would be adopted by Sutphin’s next husband.",
            "King married his fifth wife, Sharon Lepore, in 1976. By 1983, the marriage had fizzled. He met and married his sixth wife, Julie Alexander, in 1989, before separating the following year.",
            "King’s seventh wife was his last. He met actress and singer Shawn Southwick in front of the Tiffany’s in Beverly Hills, California, in 1996 and married her the following year. They had their first son, Chance, in 1999 and another son, Cannon, in 2000.",
            "The couple filed for a divorce in 2010 but reconciled after three months. But the marriage came to an end nearly a decade later when King filed for a divorce in 2019, citing “irreconcilable differences.”",
            "Death was a subject King thought about deeply in his later years. Though he was raised Jewish, he declared himself an atheist during various interviews on his shows.",
            "Because he didn’t believe in an afterlife, he told The New York Times in a 2015 profile, he had arranged to be cryogenically frozen and hoped scientists could later revive him with the help of future advancements in modern medicine.",
            "‘‘I can’t get my head around one minute being there and another minute absent,’’ he told the Times before cooly describing his ideal funeral. “I would like the ceremony to begin, ‘Today we are honoring a 160-year-old man who was caught in bed by an irate husband. And the funeral is late because it took six days to wipe the smile off his face.’ ’’",
            "King is survived his sons Larry King Jr., Chance King and Cannon King. He is predeceased by his son Andy King and daughter Chaia King."

            "Prince Harry responded to a news story that he and Meghan Markle were quitting social media, noting in a wide-ranging interview with Fast Company published Friday that they had closed their main social media account months ago.",
            "“We woke up one morning a couple of weeks ago to hear that a Rupert Murdoch newspaper said we were evidently quitting social media,” the Duke of Sussex told Fast Company’s Katharine Schwab. “That was ‘news’ to us, bearing in mind we have no social media to quit, nor have we for the past 10 months.’”",
            "The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who announced their intention to step back as working members of the royal family in January 2020, paused activity on their record-breaking Sussex Royal Instagram account last March.",
            "Earlier this month, a report in The Sunday Times declared it “very unlikely” that the couple would use social media accounts for personal use again, or to promote the work of their non-profit Archewell Foundation.",
            "But Harry said that isn’t necessarily the case for the couple, who now reside in California with their son, Archie.",
            "“The truth is, despite its well-documented ills, social media can offer a means of connecting and community, which are vital to us as human beings,” the royal said.\n\n“We will revisit social media when it feels right for us — perhaps when we see more meaningful commitments to change or reform — but right now we’ve thrown much of our energy into learning about this space and how we can help,” he added.",
            "In the Fast Company interview, the Duke of Sussex was also asked about the online harassment he and Meghan faced in the U.K., which they’ve endured from the very start of their courtship.\n\n“I was really surprised to witness how my story had been told one way, my wife’s story had been told one way, and then our union sparked something that made the telling of that story very different,” the 36-year-old said. “That false narrative became the mothership for all of the harassment you’re referring to. It wouldn’t have even begun had our story just been told truthfully.”\n\nThe Duchess of Sussex, 39, has previously spoken about the “almost unsurvivable” online hate she faced while on maternity leave in 2019. Meghan said she was told she “was the most trolled person in the entire world ― male or female.”\n\nIn addition to personal harassment, Harry spoke about the dangers of disinformation online and how it contributed to the deadly U.S. Capitol riot in Washington on Jan. 6.\n\n“We have seen time and again what happens when the real-world cost of misinformation is disregarded. There is no way to downplay this,” the duke said. “There was a literal attack on democracy in the United States, organized on social media, which is an issue of violent extremism.”\n\n“We are losing loved ones to conspiracy theories, losing a sense of self because of the barrage of mistruths, and at the largest scale, losing our democracies. The magnitude of this cannot be overstated, as noted even by the defectors who helped build these platforms,” Harry added.",
            "The couple has continued to speak out against disinformation and online hate during virtual appearances over the last year.\n\nThe Sussexes’ new Archewell Foundation is also committed to focusing on online reform, through partnerships with the Archewell Foundation Fund for the UCLA Center for Critical Internet Inquiry and the Center for Humane Technology.\n\nIn terms of actions that internet and social media users can take, Meghan has previously offered “one clear, tangible thing” people can do to stop misinformation.\n\n“It really just includes not contributing to or even clicking on misinformation,” the former “Suits” actor said while speaking at Fortune’s Most Powerful Women virtual summit in September. “And when you know something is wrong, reporting it, talking about it, ensuring that the facts are getting out there.”\n\nSubscribe to HuffPost’s Watching the Royals newsletter for all things Windsor (and beyond)."

            "WASHINGTON (AP) — It’s taken only days for Democrats gauging how far President Joe Biden’s bold immigration proposal can go in Congress to acknowledge that if anything emerges, it will likely be significantly more modest.",
            "As they brace to tackle a politically flammable issue that’s resisted major congressional action since the 1980s, Democrats are using words like “aspirational” to describe Biden’s plan and “herculean” to express the effort they’ll need to prevail.",
            "A cautious note came from the White House on Friday when press secretary Jen Psaki said the new administration views Biden’s plan as a “first step” it hopes will be “the basis” of discussions in Congress. Democrats’ measured tones underscore the fragile road they face on a paramount issue for their minority voters, progressives, and activists.",
            "Immigration proponents advocating an all-out fight say Democrats’ new hold on the White House and Congress provides a major edge, but they concede they may have to accept less than total victory. Paving a path to citizenship for the estimated 11 million immigrants in the U.S. illegally, the centerpiece of Biden’s plan is “the stake at the summit of the mountain,” Frank Sharry, executive director of the pro-immigration group America’s Voice, said in an interview. He said proponents may have to accept “stepping stones” along the way.",
            "The citizenship process in Biden’s plan would take as little as three years for some people, eight years for others. It would make it easier for certain workers to stay in the U.S. temporarily or permanently, provide development aid to Central American nations in hopes of reducing immigration and move toward bolstering border screening technology.",
            "No. 2 Senate Democratic leader Richard Durbin of Illinois said in an interview this week that the likeliest package to emerge would start with creating a path to citizenship for so-called Dreamers. They are over 1 million immigrants who’ve lived in the U.S. most of their lives after being brought here illegally as children.",
            "Over 600,000 of them have temporary permission to live in the U.S. under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. Former President Barack Obama created that program administratively, and Durbin and others want to protect it by enacting it into law.",
            "Durbin, who called Biden’s plan “aspirational,” said he’ll push for as many other elements as possible, including more visas for agricultural workers and others.",
            "“We understand the political reality of a 50-50 Senate, that any changes in immigration will require cooperation between the parties,” said Durbin, who is on track to become Senate Judiciary Committee chairman. He said Senate legislation likely “will not reach the same levels” as Biden’s proposal.",
            "The Senate is split evenly between the two parties, with Vice President Kamala Harris tipping the chamber to Democrats with her tie-breaking vote. Even so, passing major legislation requires 60 votes to overcome filibusters or endless procedural delays. That means 10 Republicans must join all 50 Democrats to enact an immigration measure, a tall order.",
            "“Passing immigration reform through the Senate, particularly, is a herculean task,” said Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., who will also play a lead role in the battle. He said Democrats “will get it done” but the effort will require negotiation.",
            "Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who’s worked with Democrats on past immigration efforts, said “comprehensive immigration is going to be a tough sale” this year.",
            "“I think the space in a 50-50 Senate will be some kind of DACA deal,” he said.",
            "Illustrating the bargaining ahead, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, a moderate who’s sought earlier immigration compromises, praised parts of Biden’s plan but said she wants changes including more visas for the foreign workers her state’s tourism industry uses heavily.",
            "Democrats’ hurdles are formidable.",
            "They have razor-thin majorities in a House and Senate where Republican support for easing immigration restrictions is usually scant. Acrid partisan relationships were intensified by former President Donald Trump’s clamorous tenure. Biden will have to spend plenty of political capital and time on earlier, higher priority bills battling the pandemic and bolstering the economy, leaving his future clout uncertain.",
            "Democrats also must resolve tactical differences.",
            "Sharry said immigration groups prefer Democrats push for the strongest possible bill without concessions to Republicans’ demands like boosting border security spending. He said hopes for a bipartisan breakthrough are “a fool’s errand” because the GOP has largely opposed immigration overhauls for so long.",
            "But prevailing without GOP votes would mean virtual unanimity among congressional Democrats, a huge challenge. It would also mean Democrats would have to eliminate the Senate filibuster, which they may not have the votes to do, or concoct other procedural routes around the 60-vote hurdle.",
            "“I’m going to start negotiating” with Republicans, said Durbin. He said a bipartisan bill would be better “if we can do it” because it would improve chances for passage.",
            "Democrats already face attacks from Republicans, eyeing next year’s elections, on an issue that helped power Trump’s 2016 victory by fortifying his support from many white voters.",
            "House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said Biden’s proposal would “prioritize help for illegal immigrants and not our fellow citizens.” Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., who heads the Senate Republican campaign committee, said the measure would hurt “hard-working Americans and the millions of immigrants working their way through the legal immigration process.”",
            "Democrats say such allegations are false but say it’s difficult to compose crisp, sound-bite responses on the complex issue. It requires having “an adult conversation” with voters, Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., said in an interview.",
            "“Yeah, this is about people, but it’s about the economy” too, said Spanberger, a moderate from a district where farms and technology firms hire many immigrants. “In central Virginia, we rely on immigration. And you may not like that, but we do.”"

            "The COVID-19 vaccine rollout in the United States has been chaotic, but the bottom line is this: Two highly safe and effective vaccines are available, and millions of doses have already been given. Health officials are also optimistic that distribution will get better, and President Joe Biden has set an ambitious goal of doling out 100 million more doses of the vaccine by his 100th day in office.",
            "In the meantime, the majority of Americans just have to sit tight.",
            "It’s unclear when the vaccine will be available to everyone. Estimates range from this April to summer to the fall to the holidays. Sigh.",
            "It is tough to wait, especially when the past year has been so devastating and the stakes are so high. But health experts say there are some ways you can prepare to get the coronavirus vaccine, whenever it’s your turn. Here’s what to do:",
            "Familiarize yourself with your local eligibility guidelines — and check them weekly.",
            "Each state determines who gets priority in its vaccine rollout, and while there are similarities (all states put health care workers who spend time around infected patients at the top of their lists), the plans vary. Some states, for example, have prioritized people ages 65 and up; others have focused on individuals with high-risk medical conditions.",
            "So your first step should be to simply make sure you really understand the current prioritization and distribution plan in your area.",
            "“This information can be found on health department websites, shared in daily news conferences, or even posted to Twitter,” said Jonathan Leizman, chief medical officer of Premise Health.",
            "Because those plans are fluid and because they depend so heavily on supply — which is a major concern right now — people should check in on their state’s distribution plans regularly, suggested Ian Gonsenhauser, chief quality and patient safety officer at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center.",
            "“Once a week should be sufficient,” he said.",
            "Social media accounts from reputable sources, like local government officials and health departments, often distribute short summaries of the newest information, which can be an easy way to stay on top of vaccine-related news, Gonsenhauser said.",
            "Remember: The majority of Americans likely won’t roll up their sleeves until at least the spring. In a press briefing today, Dr. Anthony Fauci — the nation’s top infectious disease expert — said if 70-80% of Americans are able to receive the vaccine by mid or late summer, we could see some semblance of normalcy in the fall.",
            "Know your distribution sites.",
            "Once you have an understanding of the prioritization plan around you, “identify where in your area the vaccine is being offered,” Gonsenhauser said. “Is it being offered in mini clinics? In drug stores? Is it being offered at grocery stores, is it through your local health care system, or elsewhere?”",
            "Again, every state handles this in its own way, but you should be able to find sites through your state and/or local health department.",
            "Once you have a sense of where the vaccine is being offered near you, “I would find out the contact information, and contact them to see if you can already schedule your appointment,” Gonsenhauser said.",
            "Ask if there is a waitlist. And ask if you qualify to be placed on it. At this point, most vaccination sites are simply maintaining waitlists of people who already qualify to be vaccinated, and who would like to be contacted if there are extra doses. But some areas are allowing residents to sign up for alerts that will notify them when they are able to be vaccinated. (New Jersey, for example, is allowing people to preregister for vaccines and notices through a portal.)",
            "Again, plan to check on your local distribution sites regularly, since states are adding more all the time. Places like smaller pharmacies may not be offering the vaccine yet, but they might in the coming months — particularly as a likely second generation of vaccines becomes available.",
            "Check in with your doctor.",
            "If you’ve got a primary care physician, Gonsenhauser said, it’s a good idea to contact them and chat about any risk factors you might have for the vaccine.",
            "“There are only a few,” he said. “The vast majority of individuals find that the vaccine is perfectly safe.” However, if you’ve had an allergic reaction to other types of vaccines, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends you talk to your doctor before getting the COVID-19 vaccine. And people with an allergy to PEG or polysorbate should not get an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.",
            "The Biden administration has expressed a desire to enlist primary care physicians in helping to speed up vaccine distribution, explained Gail Shulby, co-chair of Duke University Health System’s universal flu vaccination and COVID-19 vaccination planning work groups. But at this point, there aren’t clear details about how that will all work.",
            "It’s still worth touching base with your doctor now. “I would recommend that if an individual happens to have the opportunity to interact with his or her primary care provider in the near term, that they express their desire to be vaccinated against the COVID-19 virus,” Shulby said.",
            "Also, your primary care doctor can answer questions you have about the process and can clear up any concerns you might have about the many vaccine-related myths currently circulating. “If you have a pre-existing condition and would like to consult a doctor before getting the vaccine, consider scheduling a virtual consult with your primary care provider,” Leizman recommended.",
            "All that said, it is not necessary to talk to your doctor in order to be vaccinated. So if you don’t have an established primary care physician or you’re unlikely to get an appointment with yours before you’re qualified to get the COVID-19 vaccine, don’t fret.",
            "“It’s certainly not a bad time to go try and find a primary care physician if you don’t have one. If this is the reason you go out and pursue one, that’s an added bonus,” Gonsenhauser said. “But it’s not required. They’ll go through all of this information with you when you go and get vaccinated for COVID.”",
            "Make a plan for vaccine day — and immediately after.",
            "“The same thing we ask people to do for voting, I would ask for this,” Gonsenhauser said.",
            "So, make sure you know when you can make an appointment. Make sure you remember the day it’s scheduled. Make sure that you have a way to get there on time and that you won’t miss it. Know that the appointment could take a while, particularly since vaccine providers have been instructed to watch recipients for 15 minutes after their shots to monitor for possible allergic reactions.",
            "Have a plan for after, too. You could develop common side effects like fever, chills or a headache and not necessarily be able to jump right back into work or child care. Expect to take it easy for a bit, and adjust your schedule accordingly.",
            "Be honest about where you are in the line. And continue to wear your mask.",
            "Coping with the emotions involved in knowing that there are vaccines available, but just out of reach, can be hard. And there are already many reports of people trying to use influence or tricks to jump the line.",
            "“People should not attempt to game the system by misrepresenting their qualifications for prioritization for vaccination,” Shulby said.",
            "Likewise, don’t think that you can harass a scheduler into somehow giving you an earlier time slot, or that you’ll get in sooner by making multiple appointments. The only thing that accomplishes is slowing everything down for everyone — you included, Gonsenhauser said.",
            "Also, both before and after you get vaccinated, it is essential that all Americans keep taking the same precautions. Wash your hands, maintain social distance, and wear a mask. It is going to be quite some time before we reach herd immunity and life is able to go back to normal.",
            "But we will get there eventually.",
            "“When you’re preparing to get the vaccine, stop and take a deep breath. Think about a future when the pandemic is a problem of the past, because that’s the promise of the vaccine,” Gonsenhauser said. “And that’s really the motivator for all of us to do this.”",

            "That was hours after then-President Donald Trump incited a mob of supporters to storm the Capitol and search for lawmakers to kill to stop them from certifying President Joe Biden’s win. They did this because they believed Trump’s lies about widespread election fraud that Republicans in Congress were parroting, too.",
            "It’s a lot to unpack. It was easily one of the darkest days in modern U.S. history.",
            "But now, two weeks later, with Biden sworn in and Trump gone, some of those same Republicans are celebrating Biden’s inauguration and American democracy, brushing aside the fact that they were very recently a serious threat to either one prevailing.",
            "“Biden takes the oath,” Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) tweeted Wednesday, weeks after leading the effort to overturn the election. “May God bless the United States of America.”",
            "“Congratulations to President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris,” House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.) tweeted Wednesday, weeks after voting to overturn the election and after lying on television that Trump won the election. “Now we must get to work to solve the challenges facing our country. We are all Americans, and together we will succeed, as we have for more than 230 years.”",
            "Sen. John Kennedy (La.), Rep. Michael Burgess (Texas), Rep. Darrell Issa (Calif.) and House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) were among the GOP lawmakers echoing messages of unity and celebrating the peaceful transfer of power from Trump to Biden, despite the fact that it was not peaceful and they were part of the reason why. Five people died during the insurrection, and these lawmakers still voted to invalidate the election results based on the same lies fueling the people who attacked the Capitol.",
            "There are other Republicans who may not have voted to overturn the election but who had been actively trying to invalidate the election results. They too are now celebrating Biden’s inauguration as if they did no such thing.",
            "“Congratulations to President Biden on his inauguration, and to Vice President Harris,” House Ways and Means Committee ranking member Kevin Brady (R-Texas) said in a statement, which doesn’t mention the last-ditch lawsuit he joined in December to try to overturn the election results without any evidence of fraud. “President Biden’s message of unity is crucial as we must work together, finding common ground where we can to help all Americans succeed.”",
            "The lawsuit Brady joined was one of more than 60 election lawsuits that Trump and his allies filed ― and lost, based on lack of merit ― in their efforts to discredit Biden’s win.",
            "Some GOP lawmakers who voted to toss out the election also took part in Biden’s inauguration. Cruz, McCarthy, Scalise and Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), who raised a fist in solidarity with the Capitol insurrectionists right before they stormed the building, were among those onstage with Biden as he was sworn in.",
            "“I thought it would be a good show of unity,” Scalise said in a Tuesday interview with The Advocate, a Louisiana-based publication, of his decision to bring former Democratic National Committee Chair Donna Brazile as his guest. “It’s important we all focus on trying to bring the country back together. We all need to play a role in trying to achieve that.”",
            "It was just two weeks earlier that Scalise, the No. 2 Republican in the House, was still spreading lies about widespread voter fraud and saying he had to “stand up for the rule of law” by voting to reject the presidential election results.",
            "“The Constitution requires that states carry out elections according to the rules established by state legislatures. In a number of states, that did not happen,” he falsely claimed in a statement. “We cannot turn a blind eye to states selectively choosing which election laws to follow.”",
            "The theme here is clear: Now that Biden is in the White House, Republicans in Congress are hoping you’ll forget that they attacked the foundations of American democracy ― an entirely self-serving political exercise that left five people dead."

            "Lawmakers in the House and Senate approved Lloyd Austin as the new defense secretary, giving the Pentagon its first Black secretary and ending weeks of debate over President Joe Biden’s choice of a former Army general for a job nearly always held by a civilian.",
            "After each chamber on Thursday approved a waiver that allowed Austin to take the job just a few years after leaving active military service, the Senate confirmed him Friday morning in a 93-2 vote.",
            "Austin is expected to be one of Biden’s closest advisers on foreign policy, especially on the issues of competing with China and reducing troop deployments in the Middle East. His appointment is a big step for a racially diverse federal institution whose leadership remains almost entirely white.",
            "He takes over the Defense Department, America’s largest employer, at a deeply complicated time for the military.",
            "Amid a monthslong Republican effort to tamper with the presidential election, top military officers and former defense secretaries repeatedly emphasized that the armed forces have no role in vital democratic processes like voting and transferring power between presidents. But after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol ― which some veterans and current service members participated in ― the Pentagon deployed thousands of troops to Washington to secure Biden’s inauguration.",
            "With the clear and growing risk of political fights pulling in uniformed personnel, congressional lawmakers are anxious to affirm the limits of the military’s reach in American democracy and to investigate and root out radicalization among the troops.",
            "Austin has told lawmakers that he’s committed to ending extremism within the Defense Department. “We can never take our hands off the wheel on this,” he said at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on Tuesday. “This has no place in the military of the United States of America.”",
            "But in its own way, Austin’s nomination by Biden boosted concerns about the politicization of the military. The job of defense secretary has only twice before gone to a former general. National security experts say that having a lifelong civilian in the role is important to signal that the armed forces are accountable to people outside their ranks who represent the broader country and to limit political ambition or partisanship among the troops.",
            "Both houses of Congress are needed to approve a special waiver for a retired officer to become defense secretary less than seven years after they’ve left the military. Austin retired in 2016. Several influential lawmakers, including Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Tammy Duckworth (Ill.) and Republican Sen. Tom Cotton (Ark.), argued that it was inappropriate for Austin to receive that waiver, particularly so soon after lawmakers gave a similar waiver to retired Marine Gen. Jim Mattis to take the job in 2017.",
            "Democratic leaders and most Republicans disagreed, however. The House passed the waiver early Thursday afternoon ― after suddenly canceling a public hearing with Austin ― and the Senate followed suit later in the day, clearing the way for its confirmation vote.",
            "“Can you give the president of the United States the benefit of the doubt?” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) asked her colleagues ahead of the vote, according to Politico.",
            "During his appearance before the Senate panel on Tuesday, Austin repeatedly committed to putting civilians in top decision-making roles, citing two well-respected deputies he already plans to bring in: Kathleen Hicks and Colin Kahl, who both have Defense Department experience in their résumés.",
            "And he outlined plans to address his potential conflicts of interest in managing the armed services, promising to probe how military leaders handle sexual assault cases ― an issue many officers are loath to lose control over ― and to recuse himself from decisions related to Raytheon, a major military contractor that placed Austin on its board after he retired. Additionally, he pledged to be responsive to the press and to congressional overseers, unlike his recent predecessors.",
            "The incoming Pentagon chief also said he will focus heavily on responding to Beijing’s expanding global influence, boosting U.S. alliances with other nations concerned about China and addressing fears that the military has not invested enough resources in the Pacific Ocean region. With Austin having spent much of his career in the Middle East, some lawmakers worry that he doesn’t have enough familiarity with Washington’s primary international rival.",
            "Austin calmed some of those worries by calling China “a pacing threat” on Tuesday, according to Zack Cooper, a former Pentagon official now with the American Enterprise Institute think tank. The phrase refers to the competitor who is most plausibly moving to challenge American defense strategy.",
            "“There will still be a lot of people who will be nervous about the degree of Asia expertise that he has,” Cooper said. But he added that Austin’s expected appointment of analysts deeply familiar with the region, like Kelly Magsamen and Ely Ratner, will further allay those fears.",
            "As one of the most prominent faces in the Biden administration, Austin can expect heavy scrutiny, including from skeptics of the waiver who will closely monitor how civilians fare in his Pentagon and from more liberal Democrats who hope to craft a more progressive foreign policy.",
            "Under former President Donald Trump, the military’s budget grew significantly and military actions abroad caused significantly more civilian deaths even as Trump reduced some foreign troop deployments. Lawmakers and activists will likely push Austin on human rights issues ― including U.S. support for the brutal Saudi-led coalition in Yemen and other controversial policies he has been involved in ― and trimming the defense budget.",
            "Austin’s historic confirmation makes him the second member of Biden’s Cabinet to take office, following Avril Haines as the first female director of national intelligence. Biden’s team wants to quickly fill top national security jobs because of a recent massive Russian hack of sensitive U.S. institutions and fears that other adversaries will exploit the presidential transition period."

            "LONDON (AP) — A lawyer for the publisher of the Daily Mail newspaper said Wednesday that the Duchess of Sussex had no reasonable expectation of privacy for a letter she sent to her estranged father after her marriage to Prince Harry.",
            "Arguing against the duchess’ privacy-infringement claim in a London court, attorney Antony White said “it’s to be inferred that the letter was written and sent by the claimant with a view to it being disclosed to third parties and read by the public.”",
            "He said ex-employees of Meghan and Harry would be able to shed light on the creation of the letter when the case comes to trial.",
            "The former Meghan Markle, 39, is suing publisher Associated Newspapers for invasion of privacy and copyright infringement over five February 2019 articles in the Mail on Sunday and on the MailOnline website, which published portions of a handwritten letter to her father, Thomas Markle, after her 2018 wedding to Harry, a grandson of Queen Elizabeth II.",
            "Associated Newspapers is contesting the claim, and a full trial is due to be held in the autumn at the High Court. In hearings this week the duchess is seeking a summary judgment that would find in her favor and dismiss the newspaper’s defense case without a trial.",
            "Meghan’s lawyer, Justin Rushbrooke, argued Tuesday that that the publisher had “no real prospect” of winning because “it’s a very straightforward case about the unlawful publication of a private letter.”",
            "Rushbrooke said Meghan’s five-page letter, sent in August 2018, was “a message of peace” intended for her father alone.",
            "But the defense argues Meghan wrote the letter as part of a media strategy to rebut a negative view conveyed by her father, and with help from the communications team in the royal couple’s Kensington Palace office.",
            "“Why was the Kensington Palace communications team involved at all in the wording of the letter if it was a wholly private letter?” White said.",
            "He said a full trial would be able to hear important evidence from former palace employees about how the contested letter was written.",
            "Lawyers representing four former Kensington Palace staffers, including ex-communications secretary Jason Knauf, said in a letter submitted to the court that “one or more of our clients” would be able to provide insight on “whether or not the claimant anticipated that the letter might come into the public domain,” and whether or not Meghan “directly or indirectly provided private information” to the authors of a book about her and Harry, called “Finding Freedom.”",
            "Meghan, an American actress and star of TV legal drama “Suits,” married Harry at Windsor Castle in May 2018. Their son, Archie, was born the following year.",
            "A year ago, Meghan and Harry announced they were quitting royal duties and moving to North America, citing what they said were the unbearable intrusions and racist attitudes of the British media. They recently bought a house in Santa Barbara, California.",

            "WASHINGTON ― One hundred and sixty years after the first Republican president was forced to put down a violent insurrection against the United States, the party’s 19th is leaving office after inciting one.",
            "Donald Trump plans to leave the White House for the final time Wednesday morning, 78 days after becoming only the fourth incumbent to lose reelection in a century and seven days after becoming the first president to be impeached twice.",
            "Democrat Joe Biden will take the oath of office at noon that day, becoming president and commander-in-chief of the United States, and leaving Trump suddenly vulnerable to both civil and criminal legal liabilities from which holding that office had shielded him for four years.",
            "Trump is facing lawsuits from women accusing him of sexual misconduct, including rape; criminal investigations by both state and federal prosecutors in New York; a Senate impeachment trial that could bar him from holding federal office again; and potentially both civil and criminal exposure for his weekslong efforts to spark chaos at the U.S. Capitol in order to prevent Biden from being certified as the winner of the 2020 election. The Jan. 6 riot, which Trump egged on with a rally near the White House, quickly turned bloody and ended with the deaths of a Capitol Police officer and four Trump supporters. A second officer died by suicide days later.",
            "“While Trump will not be receiving the Nobel Peace Prize, he will now be inducted into the Guinness Book of World Records for being the only president anywhere to have been impeached for the second time,” said Michael Cohen, Trump’s onetime lawyer who served federal prison time for, in part, his work to pay hush money to women who’d had affairs with Trump. “Congratulations, Donald, and best of luck in your future endeavors.”",
            "Trump’s first impeachment had come a year earlier, for trying to extort the new Ukrainian leader into publicly smearing Biden, whom Trump feared even in early 2019 as the Democratic challenger most likely to oust him.",
            "“The Trump legacy will include: the most corrupt administration in American history, the grandest handover of policymaking to corporations of all time, the most overt and vicious racism and anti-immigrant xenophobia of any administration in modern times, unparalleled incompetence, cruelty and callousness in its mismanagement of the pandemic, and rushing the globe toward climate catastrophe at the exact moment when the world needed the United States to pivot away from fossil fuel reliance,” said Robert Weissman, president of the liberal group Public Citizen. “There’s a long list of ‘accomplishments,’ far beyond these lowlights.”",
            "A Legacy Of Lies",
            "While Trump frequently claims he has done more than any previous president ― “In less than two years, my administration has accomplished more than almost any administration in the history of our country,” he told the United Nations just 20 months into his term ― in reality, he leaves office with among the thinnest portfolios of policy successes of any president in modern times.",
            "While establishment Republicans managed to achieve their decadeslong goals of large tax cuts for corporations, the rollback of environmental and worker safety regulations, and the appointment of more than 200 pro-business judges to the federal bench, Trump himself checked almost nothing off the agenda he pushed at the start of his 2016 presidential campaign.",
            "Trump promised he would renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement to benefit U.S. workers. Instead, it was renamed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement but remains functionally nearly identical, with the exception of some small tweaks lifted directly from the Trans-Pacific Partnership ― another trade pact Trump pulled out of and called the worst deal ever.",
            "He promised a large middle-class tax cut, but instead went along with a plan from congressional Republican leaders that gave the biggest benefit to the richest Americans. Although he again promised a middle-class tax cut heading into the midterm elections of 2018, Trump did nothing to enact one afterward.",
            "There were similar results with an infrastructure plan to rebuild the nation’s highways, bridges and airports and a health care plan to replace the Affordable Care Act: Trump repeatedly promised to push through these “tremendous” proposals but never even released a single word of either.",
            "Trump’s creation of a “Space Force,” which he appears to believe was a major accomplishment, was merely a bureaucratic renaming of the Air Force’s Space Command, which had existed since the Reagan presidency, with no change in mission or staffing. Democrats, however, were able to trade that Trump “win” for paid family leave for federal workers, a longtime priority of theirs.",
            "In foreign policy, Trump claimed he would “get tough” with China to help U.S. manufacturers. Instead, he launched a fruitless trade war that devastated American farmers and manufacturers both, while hurting consumers through higher prices ― all while he turned a blind eye to China’s escalating human rights abuses against its Muslim minority and increasingly totalitarian measures against all its citizens.",
            "He claimed he would remove the threat of a nuclear-armed North Korea, but in the end did nothing ― apart from trading “love letters” with its dictator, Kim Jong Un. In Western Europe, Trump accused traditional allies of “ripping off” the United States through the NATO military alliance and European Union trade policies. The attacks strained those relationships, inuring to the benefit of Russian dictator Vladimir Putin, who has long sought to drive a wedge between the trans-Atlantic allies and who helped Trump win election in 2016.",
            "Even Trump’s signature promise, that he would build a massive concrete wall along the 2,000-mile southern border of the U.S. and force Mexico to pay for it, was a failure. After four years, he managed to build only 80 miles of steel fencing in areas where there had been no barrier at all, using money he raided from the Pentagon’s construction budget meant for, among other things, schools and housing for military families. Mexico has not paid anything.",
            "Yet on that and any number of other issues, Trump would claim huge success, typically making assertions that were completely the opposite of the actual facts ― with those lies then amplified by Trump’s aides and allies.",
            "That, said longtime Florida Republican consultant Mac Stipanovich, was perhaps the most useful piece of Trump’s legacy: “Ruining the reputations of people who might otherwise have continued in public life with the extent of their moral bankruptcy still unknown,” Stipanovich said, offering as examples: “Bill Barr, Mike Pompeo, Lindsey Graham.”",
            "No Intention Of Fading Away",
            "Despite failing to deliver on his promises, despite a botched coronavirus response that began with months of denial, despite tens of thousands of lies to the public on any number of topics, and despite funneling many millions of dollars from domestic and foreign lobbyists, Republican donors large and small, and American taxpayers into his own pockets over his four years in office, Trump nevertheless received nearly 11 million more votes in 2020 than he had in 2016.",
            "“There are 74 million Americans who know exactly who Donald Trump was and voted for him anyway,” said one former White House official who spoke on condition of anonymity.",
            "Within days of losing the Nov. 3 election, Trump began capitalizing on that popularity to raise millions of dollars, first with the trumpeted aim of challenging the voters’ decision and then under the guise of supporting GOP candidates in two Senate runoff elections. But, in fact, he can use the proceeds of the “leadership PAC” he created for almost anything he wants, including paying himself an eight-figure salary. He wound up spending nothing at all on the Georgia Senate races. Trump has also vowed to remain involved in Republican politics by attacking incumbents who have not shown him sufficient loyalty and has hinted at another White House run himself in four years.",
            "Those threats have kept Republicans largely muted in their criticisms since the election. A recent Axios-Ipsos poll showed that, even after his incitement of the mob attack on the Capitol, 64% of Republicans said they supported his recent behavior, and 57% said they would like to see him as their 2024 nominee. Indeed, in the House impeachment proceedings against him a week after the attack on the Capitol, only 10 of the 211 Republican lawmakers voted with the Democrats in favor of the resolution.",
            "At a Republican National Committee gathering in Amelia Island, Florida, Trump called into a breakfast meeting the morning after the violence he had incited. “A lot of members sat quietly, while others cheered him,” said one member on condition of anonymity. “There were a lot of RNC members who were hesitant to say anything.”",
            "Yet that desperation to hang onto power, even if it meant shredding the Constitution and endangering the lives of his own vice president and hundreds of lawmakers, may finally bring an end to Trump’s political career. While Trump remains popular among Republicans, that support is less than it used to be, while his support among independent voters has plummeted.",
            "If enough Republican senators vote with Democrats to reach the two-thirds supermajority needed for conviction in his second impeachment trial, a subsequent simple majority vote in the Senate could then prevent him from holding any federal office for the rest of his life.",
            "And even if the conviction vote fails, the former White House official said, Trump likely will never recover from Americans’ searing memory of the insurrection itself, particularly as more details emerge and more prosecutions are filed in court. “It’ll be next to impossible because he’ll be saddled with it,” the official said. “He’ll be saddled with Jan. 6 forever.”"

            "Based on the beloved series of novels by Patrick O’Brian, the Peter Weir-directed blockbuster saw Crowe score some career-best reviews as a swashbuckling captain of the high seas alongside Paul Bettany.",
            "The film went on to pick up 10 Academy Award nominations ― ultimately losing most of them to “Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King” ― and has since earned a spot in the hearts of fans of old-fashioned war flicks, who’ve long campaigned for a sequel.",
            "So, it’s not entirely a surprise that Crowe spoke out in defense of the seafaring epic when someone on Twitter asserted that the film was best used as a sleep aid.",
            "“Lots of folk complaining about lack of sleep during the Pandemic. May I recommend Master And Commander starring the usually captivating, attention-grabbing Russell Crowe,” the Twitter user wrote alongside a photo of Crowe in the film. “I’ve never made it past the ten minute mark. You’re welcome. And thanks Russell.”",
            "That’s when Crowe went bombs-away, Twitter-style, lamenting that the film is lost on “kids these days.”",
            "“That’s the problem with kids these days. No focus,” Crowe replied. “Peter Weirs film is brilliant. An exacting, detail oriented, epic tale of fidelity to Empire & service, regardless of the cost. Incredible cinematography by Russell Boyd & a majestic soundtrack. Definitely an adults movie.”",
            "The Twitter user then responded to Crowe’s dig, writing, “I’m four years older than Russell.”",
            "The exchange launched a fleet of tweets praising the film, which started trending on Twitter with actor Josh Gad leading the charge and defending it as “the perfect movie.”",
            "Crowe has seemed keen to reunite with Weir for a sequel to the film, encouraging fans in a 2010 tweet not to give up hope and to pester a film executive about the project’s status.",
            "The actor has since dipped his toe back into the action genre with last year’s thriller “Unhinged,” which earned the somewhat-controversial distinction of being one of the first new movies to open domestically since the coronavirus pandemic shuttered movie theaters."

            "As House Republicans defended President Donald Trump from impeachment for inciting an insurrection that led to the sacking of the U.S. Capitol and five deaths, Rep. Brian Mast (R-Fla.) denounced the proceedings for failing to call any witnesses.",
            "“Has any one of those individuals who brought violence on this Capitol been brought here to answer whether they did that because of our president?” Mast asked. He then waited silently for 20 seconds for an answer, even though House rules did not permit other members to speak during his time. He added, “It appears I will receive no answer.”",
            "Mast’s stunt was meant to prove that insurrectionists weren’t motivated by Trump. But they were ― they’ve said so.",
            "Numerous insurrectionists have stated that they came to Washington, marched on the Capitol and stormed it on Trump’s orders. These statements can be read or heard in statements of facts and affidavits from the Department of Justice, on-the-ground news reports and interviews conducted after the insurrection, and from the livestreamed footage that the rioters took themselves.",
            "“Our president wants us here,” a man live-streaming from inside the Capitol building said, according to a New York Times report. “We wait and take orders from our president.”",
            "“The President asked for his supporters to be there to attend, and I felt like it was important, because of how much I love this country, to actually be there,” Larry Brock Jr., an Air Force veteran who was seen on the floor of the Senate in a helmet and fatigues while holding flex-cuffs, told The New Yorker. (Brock was later arrested.)",
            "“He said, ‘Hey, I need my digital soldiers to show up on January 6.’ And we all did,” Doug Sweet, a 58-year old who stormed the Capitol and was later arrested, told The Wall Street Journal.",
            "Jacob Chansley, the spear-carrying and fur hat-wearing insurrectionist known as the Q Shaman, reportedly came with a group of “patriots” from Arizona, according to prosecutors, “at the request of the President.”",
            "“My client had heard the oft-repeated words of President Trump,” Al Watkins, Chansley’s lawyer, said in a press release that also asked Trump to pardon Chansley. “The words and invitation of a president are supposed to mean something.”",
            "Robert Sanford, an ex-firefighter who threw a fire extinguisher at police officers at the Capitol, was reportedly “following the President’s instructions,” according to a friend who reported Sanford to the FBI.",
            "“We were invited here!” one insurrectionist can be seen in a live video yelling into a bullhorn on the Capitol steps. “We were invited by the president of the United States!”",
            "At one point, insurrectionists confronted police officers, according to an on-the-ground report in The New Yorker, and one man wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat told the officers to “stand down.”",
            "“You’re outnumbered,” the man said. “There’s a fucking million of us out there, and we are listening to Trump — your boss.”",
            "“There’s a lot of people here willing to take orders,” a man named Jeff told a New York Times reporter on the scene. “If the orders are given, the people will rise up.”",
            "Some insurrectionists stated their intent to follow Trump’s orders much earlier. For example, Daniel Goodwyn, a member of the Proud Boys, a far-right street fighting gang, quoted Trump’s statement to Proud Boys to “Stand back and stand by!” in a tweet on Nov. 7 before writing, “Await orders from our Commander in Chief.” This tweet was included as evidence in the charging documents after Goodwyn was arrested for entering the Capitol during the insurrection.",
            "This should not be surprising at all. For months, Trump and his allies fed his supporters lies that the election was stolen and then called on them to come to Washington and take part in stopping Congress from certifying President-elect Joe Biden’s victory.",
            "This started at the “Save America” rally on the National Mall, where Trump told his supporters to “fight like hell” or else “you’re not going to have a country anymore.”",
            "“[Y]ou’ll never take back your country with weakness,” Trump added. “You have to show strength and be strong.”",
            "Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s lawyer and the former mayor of New York City, called for a “trial by combat” to keep Trump in power.",

Pence reportedly escaped running into the mob by a matter of seconds.",

Over the past four years, he has been one of Trump’s most loyal, high-profile evangelical supporters. He’s criticized Trump very rarely and defended him staunchly through numerous controversies ― from the president’s 2017 travel bans to his aggressively obtained photo-op with a Bible during anti-racism protests last June in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd.",

He continued to do so on Jan. 6, a few hours before the riot, which led to the deaths of five people.",

            "The Trump administration executed Dustin Higgs, 48, early Saturday morning, shortly after the Supreme Court lifted a stay from a lower court.",
            "The government killed Higgs with a lethal injection of pentobarbital, over objections by his lawyers that lung damage from his recent bout of COVID-19 could make the execution extraordinarily painful. They had asked that the execution be delayed until his lungs recovered.",
            "Higgs was pronounced dead at 1:23 a.m. EST at the federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana.",
            "He was the 13th person executed under President Donald Trump’s unprecedented execution spree, and the third to die during Trump’s final week in office. Lisa Montgomery, who was the only woman on federal death row, was killed on Wednesday morning, and Corey Johnson, who had an intellectual disability and was also recovering from COVID-19, was put to death on Thursday. The final two executions took place after Trump was impeached, for the second time, for inciting violent rioters to storm the U.S. Capitol.",
            "One-third of the justices on the Supreme Court — which has repeatedly overturned decisions by lower courts to halt executions — were appointed by Trump. The decision to allow Higgs’s execution to proceed came down to a 6-3 split, with the liberal justices opposing the move.",
            "Higgs, who is Black, was executed just four days before the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden, who has said he will work to end the death penalty.",
            "Until the very end of his life, Higgs maintained his innocence.",
            "“Dustin was a fine man, a terrific father, brother, and nephew,” his lawyer Shawn Nolan said in a statement. “Dustin spent decades on death row in solitary confinement helping others around him, while working tirelessly to fight his unjust convictions. In spite of those awful circumstances, he remained true to his family, doing all he could to help raise his amazing children, who have grown up to be wonderful people. This is a true testament to Dustin’s character and to the man he had become.”",
            "“There was no reason to kill him, particularly during the pandemic and when he, himself, was sick with Covid that he contracted because of these irresponsible, super-spreader executions,” Nolan continued. “Rest in peace Dustin. Shame on all of those involved and all of those who have looked the other way.”",
            "Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, In a dissent outlining her opposition to allowing Higgs’s execution to go forward, slammed the federal government and the court for rushing through the killings. “This is not justice,” she wrote.",
            "“After waiting almost two decades to resume federal executions, the Government should have proceeded with some measure of restraint to ensure it did so lawfully. When it did not, this Court should have. It has not,” Sotomayor continued.",
            "“Because the Court continues this pattern today, I dissent.”",
            "Higgs was sentenced to death for his role in the 1996 murder of three women in a national park. The government did not claim he physically killed anyone. Another man, Willis Mark Haynes, was sentenced to life in prison for fatally shooting the victims. Higgs was prosecuted on the theory that he ordered Haynes to do the killings. Haynes says he acted of his own accord.",
            "In a clemency petition, Higgs’s lawyers argued that it was “arbitrary and inequitable” to punish Higgs more severely than the man who shot the women.",
            "Tanji Jackson, the sister of one of the victims, said in a statement released after the execution that she felt “mixed emotions” when she learned Higgs was scheduled to die.",
            "In the months leading up to his execution, Higgs’s lawyers filed a flurry of appeals in an attempt to spare his life.",
            "In December, he contracted COVID-19, as the virus swept through the prison complex in Terre Haute, where death row is located. At one point, the penitentiary had more cases of COVID-19 than any other federal prison in the country.",
            "Higgs and Corey Johnson, who was also sick with the coronavirus, sued to stop their executions, arguing that recent lung damage from COVID-19 made it more likely they would feel excruciating pain during the execution.",
            "When individuals are injected with a lethal amount of pentobarbital, it can cause pulmonary edema ― a condition in which fluid enters the lungs while the person is still conscious — inducing a painful sensation similar to suffocating or drowning. Medical experts have warned that receiving an overdose of pentobarbital would likely be even more painful for individuals recovering from COVID-19 because the virus often damages the lungs.",
            "Both men received stays of execution earlier this week after a federal judge found those concerns credible. But higher courts overruled those decisions, allowing the executions to go forward.",
            "A separate class-action lawsuit filed by two prisoners at Terre Haute — who are not on death row — sought to stop the executions on the grounds that holding such large gatherings at the prison complex risked their lives by potentially exposing them to COVID-19.",
            "The men asked for all executions to be halted until the pandemic was over or until they had been vaccinated. A federal judge ruled that the Bureau of Prisons could continue with the executions as long as staff followed COVID-19 protocols, such as wearing masks. But during Johnson’s execution on Thursday night, witnesses reported that two people working the execution did not wear a mask the entire time they were in the chamber.",
            "On Friday, the two non-death row prisoners asked a judge to stop Higgs’s execution or ban the staffers who had removed their masks from participating, arguing the government had violated the court’s order. In response, the government admitted masks came off but claimed it was briefly so staffers could communicate clearly. The government argued it wasn’t a violation of the court’s order because the order did not explicitly define “mask requirements.”",
            "The judge sided with the government and allowed Higgs’s execution to proceed as planned.",
            "Higgs grew up in a poor neighborhood in Poughkeepsie, New York. His father was largely absent, according to his clemency petition, but when he was around, he was an abusive and violent man.",
            "Higgs’s mother died of breast cancer when he was only 10 years old. His father was in prison at the time. Higgs was deeply traumatized by the abrupt death of his mother, according to family statements, and teachers said he struggled in school and seemed “lost.”",
            "One evening in 1996, when he was 23, he and two friends — Haynes and Victor Gloria — were hanging out with three women inside Higgs’s apartment.",
            "After an argument, the women — Tamika Black, 19, Tanji Jackson, 21, and Mishann Chinn, 23 — left on foot. The men followed in Higgs’s van and picked them up. Higgs drove the van into the Patuxent wildlife refuge. It was there that Haynes shot them.",
            "At Higgs’s trial, the government argued that he ordered Haynes to kill the women. Higgs was found guilty of three counts each of first-degree premeditated murder, first-degree murder committed during a kidnapping, and kidnapping resulting in death, along with firearms charges.",
            "Prosecutors pushed for Higgs to be sentenced to death, despite the fact he did not pull the trigger. “I have to think, ladies and gentlemen, this world would have been a better place without Dustin Higgs,” the prosecutor told the jury. “The hard truth is, ladies and gentlemen, it would be a better world in the future without Dustin Higgs.”",
            "Haynes vehemently disputes that Higgs ordered him to kill the women.",
            "“The prosecution’s theory of our case was bullshit,” he wrote in a 2012 affidavit. “Dustin didn’t threaten me. I was not scared of him. Dustin didn’t make me do anything, that night or ever.” Haynes said he was intoxicated when he shot the women and was not thinking straight.",
            "The government’s case was supported almost exclusively by the testimony of Victor Gloria, the other man present on the night of the killings. Shawn Nolan, one of Higgs’s attorneys, called Gloria an unreliable eyewitness who received a substantial deal in exchange for his cooperation.",
            "“The basis for which Mr. Higgs is on death row has been dismantled. He was not the shooter. He didn’t kill anybody,” Nolan said.",
            "Over half a million people signed a Change.org petition calling to halt his execution.",
            "Higgs leaves behind a son who was born shortly after he was incarcerated.",
            "“From a child to adulthood, my father was always there for me to confide in, to laugh with, to cry with, and even get upset with. But he was always there and has been my number one supporter, showed me what love is, and taught me to be a better man,” Higgs’s son wrote in a letter accompanying Higgs’ clemency petition. “I cannot imagine or think of where I could’ve ended up without the love and encouragement of my father.”"

            "President-elect Joe Biden this week proposed a COVID-19 relief package that would deliver one-time $1,400 checks to most Americans.",
            "The direct payments Congress sent most households last year in response to the coronavirus pandemic were so popular with the American public that lawmakers approved a second round of checks last month, and Biden promised to do a third.",
            "But Biden paired the checks with an array of other policies that are more complicated and outright unwelcome among Republicans on Capitol Hill, who have panned the proposal despite some support for additional direct payments. Even with Democrats controlling the Senate, passing the bill would be difficult.",
            "Buried inside the Biden plan, however, is an obscure policy that could be the nucleus for a program of sending people checks every month. It’s a proposal to expand the child tax credit, which currently pays working parents as much as $1,400 per child annually through refunds at tax time.",
            "Biden’s plan would boost the refunds to up to $3,600 per child and make it easier for lower-income families to get the full amount.",
            "Some Republicans like the idea of expanding the child tax credit.",
            "“A larger child tax credit is an excellent idea,” Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) told HuffPost in a statement Friday. “It will alleviate child poverty and continue to lower the parent tax penalty.”",
            "Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) championed a more generous child tax credit in 2017 as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. (One reason other Republicans went along is that the credit helped offset the loss of other family-friendly tax provisions in the law’s simplification of the tax code.)",
            "And Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) co-sponsored a bill with Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) to increase the tax credit in 2019.",
            "Biden’s proposal resembles the American Family Act, proposed in 2019 by Bennet and Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), which would have boosted the maximum credit to $3,600 ― and instead of paying out after you file your taxes, the Internal Revenue Service would distribute refunds in advance, on a monthly basis.",
            "Annual tax refunds are already one of the federal government’s most important antipoverty programs. Under Bennet-Brown, low-income parents would get about $300 per month in cash and would not need any earnings to qualify. Switching to monthly support would make life easier for parents, and increasing the benefit would slash child poverty by 40%.",
            "Biden retained the earnings requirement and omitted advance payments from his proposal, which would only apply for this year, but Democrats did include advance payments in one version of a coronavirus relief bill that passed the House last year. It’s not clear if the tax credit will remain a priority for Democrats.",
            "Recognizing that kids are expensive and that raising them presents obstacles to employment, most other countries pay parents a child benefit or child allowance. The U.S. could get there, however backwardly, through a set of changes to its complicated system of tax credits. (Already, the federal government cuts monthly Social Security checks to senior citizens.)",
            "The idea of a big new federal program with monthly benefits has been poison in American politics, with lawmakers often doing social policy through the tax code, but the bipartisan love of checks in recent months suggests that might not be true anymore.",
            "Matt Bruenig, founder of a left-wing think tank called the People’s Policy Project, has advocated transforming the various tax credits available to low-income workers into a monthly child benefit.",

            "A federal labor official cleared the way Friday for Amazon warehouse workers in Alabama to cast ballots in an election that could create the first union among the company’s U.S. workforce.",
            "Under the decision from the National Labor Relations Board, workers at Amazon’s facility in the Birmingham suburb of Bessemer will vote by mail over the course of several weeks in February and March, with ballots to be counted March 30. If a simple majority of those cast support unionizing, then the workers will be represented by the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU).",
            "Amazon negotiates with labor unions in Europe, but so far it has managed to remain union-free in the U.S. Labor groups hope that a successful campaign at the Bessemer facility could spur on organizing efforts elsewhere in Amazon’s sprawling logistics network.",
            "The Bessemer warehouse employs roughly 6,000 hourly workers, most of whom help pick, pack and ship Amazon items to customers. Though if the employees unionize they would form a large bargaining unit, they represent a tiny fraction of the more than one million Amazon workers at the company’s warehouses, delivery hubs and offices across the U.S.",
            "The RWDSU submitted a petition for the election in November, an indication the union believed it has majority support among the workers. The ruling issued Friday revolved around whether the election would be held in person or via mail during the coronavirus pandemic.",
            "The labor relations board has generally ordered elections to be held through the mail due to COVID-19. But Amazon tried to persuade the NLRB to hold the election onsite, perhaps believing that would give the company an advantage over the union. Amazon offered to cover the cost of implementing safety measures and even suggested it would foot the bill to house government officials nearby.",
            "But Lisa Y. Henderson, the board’s regional director based in Atlanta, shot down Amazon’s arguments, saying the pandemic posed too great a risk for casting in-person ballots. She noted that the area surrounding the warehouse has a 17% COVID-19 testing positivity rate, three times the rate the board would like to see before allowing in-person voting.",
            "Henderson also made the point that workers who tested positive for COVID-19 would be unable to vote in an in-person election.",
            "“The most important factors in my decision are the safety of all election participants and the enfranchisement of all voters,” she wrote. “Both of these factors weigh in favor of a mail ballot election.”",
            "Henderson said Amazon’s offer to financially support the election, while “laudable,” could create the impression of a conflict of interest.",
            "And she said Amazon’s offer to have its social-distancing team monitor the voting line “would give the impression of surveillance or tracking.”",
            "Ballots go out to workers by mail on Feb. 8."

            "Their lawyers have argued that the men have lung damage from COVID-19, which will make it more likely they will suffer pain from the government’s execution protocol — a lethal injection of pentobarbital ― violating constitutional protections against cruel and unusual punishment.",
            "On Tuesday, a district court sided with the men, enjoining the executions until March to allow their lungs to heal. The government appealed.",
            "By a 2-1 vote, a panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated the lower court’s injunction, allowing the executions to proceed on Jan. 14 and 15 as scheduled.",
            "Johnson and Higgs are the last two people scheduled to be killed as part of the Trump administration’s historically unprecedented execution spree. One execution ― that of Lisa Montgomery ― already took place this week. Since the Trump administration restarted federal executions last summer, 11 people have been killed. President-elect Joe Biden has said he will work to end the death penalty.",
            "Lawyers for the two men said they would ask the full court to step in to reinstate the stay.",
            "“The government must stop trying to execute Corey Johnson while he is still recovering from the COVID-19 infection he contracted as a result of the government’s own irresponsibility in carrying out executions during the pandemic,” said Donald Salzman, an attorney for Johnson, in a statement. “There is no principled reason not to wait until the injunction expires in March to assess whether Mr. Johnson’s lungs have healed sufficiently that he will not suffer excruciating pain during an execution.”",
            "Autopsy reports on people who have been executed with pentobarbital show that the drug can cause a condition called flash pulmonary edema, where fluid enters the lungs while the person is still conscious. This can induce a painful sensation similar to suffocating or drowning.",
            "Medical experts who testified in support of Johnson and Higgs surmise that this condition is likely to be more painful for individuals recovering from COVID-19 because the coronavirus causes damage to the lungs.",
            "“For prisoners experiencing COVID-19 lung damage at the time of their execution, flash pulmonary edema will occur even earlier in the execution process, and before brain levels of pentobarbital have peaked,” wrote Gail A. Van Norman, a medical expert consulted by the plaintiffs. “To a reasonable degree of medical certainty, these prisoners will experience sensations of drowning and suffocation sooner than a person without COVID-related lung damage and, therefore, their conscious experience of the symptoms of pulmonary edema will be prolonged.”",
            "Johnson is scheduled to be executed at 6 p.m. on Thursday at the federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana, where death row is located and the site of a COVID-19 outbreak.",
            "A long day of legal appeals is expected.",

            "Secret Service agents assigned to protect Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner were denied access to bathrooms in the couple’s house and had to rent a nearby basement for $3,000 a month simply to use the toilet, a surreal report by The Washington Post revealed on Thursday.",
            "Trump and Kushner’s six-bedroom, 5,000-square-foot home is located in Washington, D.C.’s Kalorama neighborhood — where the Obamas and other elite political figures reside — and contains six bathrooms that were off-limits to the Secret Service detail assigned to protect the pair.",
            "According to the report, which cited neighbors and local law enforcement officials, agents were forced to resort to unorthodox measures simply to relieve themselves. They frequented nearby businesses, drove to Vice President Mike Pence’s home at D.C.’s Naval Observatory and used a bathroom in the Obamas’ nearby garage that had been converted into a Secret Service command area.",
            "Eventually, after a member of the team protecting Trump and Ivanka left an “unpleasant mess” in the Obama bathroom, they were banned from the garage.",
            "A White House spokesperson told The Washington Post that it was the Secret Service’s decision — not Trump and Kushner’s — to keep agents out of the home. But, the outlet reported, “that account is disputed by a law enforcement official familiar with the situation, who said the agents were kept out at the family’s request.”",
            "In a statement sent to CNN and The Washington Post after the story was published, a Secret Service spokesperson also highlighted that the couple did not deny the agents access to a bathroom.",
            "“The Secret Service makes every effort, particularly at a residence, to conduct protective operations with minimum impact on a household. In accordance with this practice, Secret Service personnel do not request access to the facilities at private residences. Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner have not denied Secret Service personnel access to their home to include use of the restroom,” the spokesperson said.",
            "White House spokesman Judd Deere also told The Washington Post that “it was only after a decision by the [Secret Service] was made that their detail sought other accommodations.”",
            "These alternate accommodations were found after a port-a-potty set up for the agents drew protests from Kalorama residents in 2017. From Sept. 27, 2017, onwards, they rented an 820-square-foot basement with a “tidy bathroom” from Kay Kendall, chair of the DC Commission on the Arts and Humanities. At $3,000 a month in rent, the basement has cost $144,000 in taxpayer dollars thus far.",
            "A number of voices across social media chimed in on the remarkable nature of the Post’s story — with several citing the similarities to the plot of the 2009 novel and 2011 film “The Help,” where a maid in Jackson, Mississippi, is fired for using the bathroom of her employers.",

            "Steve DeMoss, a former safety director and foreman for Armstrong Coal, which owned and operated the Parkway mine, acknowledged in court that he helped submit misleadingly low coal dust readings to mine regulators. Miners can develop black lung disease by breathing too much coal dust in a mine’s atmosphere, leading to a debilitating ailment that sufferers compare to the sensation of drowning.",
            "The charge against DeMoss is part of a case that federal prosecutors have brought against nine former Armstrong officials following a 2014 HuffPost investigation detailing fraud at the company.",
            "DeMoss faces up to a year in prison and a fine of up to $100,000 for his role in the scheme. A lawyer for DeMoss declined to comment.",
            "Armstrong miners told HuffPost they had been directed to “cheat” on the coal dust readings submitted to the Mine Safety and Health Administration, by stowing their dust monitors in cleaner areas of the mine. Mines showing high levels of coal dust can be shut down by regulators until they come into compliance.",
            "Miners say dust-sampling fraud is widespread in the coal industry, but prosecutions for the crime appear to be relatively rare for its prevalence. When officials announced the first indictment in the case in 2019, U.S. Attorney Russell Coleman said they were trying to “hold accountable those who made calculated business decisions that placed our miners at grave risk.”",
            "Appalachia has seen a resurgence of black lung disease in recent years, a development experts attribute to poor regulation and prevention efforts, including dust sampling fraud.",
            "DeMoss is the third Armstrong official to plead guilty in the case so far. Former mine foremen Ron Ivy and Billy Hearld accepted plea deals in May 2019 and September 2020, respectively. A trial date has not yet been set for the others who have been charged.",
            "The case includes an indictment against Glendal “Buddy” Hardison, who managed all the western Kentucky mines for Armstrong Coal and was the highest-ranking official charged. Armstrong went bankrupt and its assets were acquired in 2018 by then-Murray Energy, now known as American Consolidated Natural Resources.",
            "In 2014, Armstrong miner and whistleblower Justin Greenwell told HuffPost that sending fraudulent dust readings to MSHA was common practice at the company’s Parkway mine. Greenwell, just 29 at the time, said he was already experiencing shortness of breath from his time working there.",
            "“It’s been going on since I started there,” he said of the fraud. “All these guys in management, they know it’s wrong. But they don’t care about our health.”",
            "Another miner, Mike “Flip” Wilson, had already developed black lung disease by then. He also became a whistleblower and outspoken critic of the fraud, telling HuffPost in 2014 that “there’s been cheating ever since I’ve been there.”"

            "WASHINGTON (AP) — His place in the history books rewritten, President Donald Trump endured his second impeachment largely alone and silent.",
            "For more than four years, Trump has dominated the national discourse like no one before him. Yet when his legacy was set in stone on Wednesday, he was stunningly left on the sidelines.",
            "Trump now stands with no equal, the only president to be charged twice with a high crime or misdemeanor, a new coda for a term defined by a deepening of the nation’s divides, his failures during the worst pandemic in a century and his refusal to accept defeat at the ballot box.",
            "Trump kept out of sight in a nearly empty White House as impeachment proceedings played out at the heavily fortified U.S. Capitol. There, the damage from last week’s riots provided a visible reminder of the insurrection that the president was accused of inciting.",
            "Abandoned by some in his own party, Trump could do nothing but watch history unfold on television. The suspension of his Twitter account deprived Trump of his most potent means to keep Republicans in line, giving a sense that Trump had been defanged and, for the first time, his hold on his adopted party was in question.",
            "He was finally heard from hours after the vote, in a subdued video that condemned the insurrection at the Capitol and warned his supporters from engaging in any further violence. It was a message that was largely missing one week earlier, when rioters marching in Trump’s name descended on the Capitol to try to prevent Congress from certifying Biden’s victory.",
            "“I want to be very clear: I unequivocally condemn the violence that we saw last week,” said Trump. He added that “no true supporter” of his “could ever endorse political violence.”",
            "But that message, partially motivated to warn off legal exposure for sparking the riot, ran contrary to what Trump has said throughout his term, including when he urged his supporters to “fight” for him last week. Trump said not a word about his impeachment in the video, though he complained about the ban on his social media.",
            "With only a week left in Trump’s term, there were no bellicose messages from the White House fighting the proceedings on the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue and no organized legal response. Some congressional Republicans did defend the president during House debate in impeachment, their words carrying across the same space violated by rioters one week earlier during a siege of the citadel of democracy that left five dead.",
            "In the end, 10 Republicans voted to impeach.",
            "It was a marked change from Trump’s first impeachment. That December 2019 vote in the House, which made Trump only the third president ever impeached, played out along partisan lines. The charges then were that he had used the powers of the office to pressure Ukraine to investigate a political foe, Joe Biden, now the president-elect.",
            "At that time, the White House was criticized for failing to create the kind of robust “war room” that President Bill Clinton mobilized during his own impeachment fight. Nonetheless, Trump allies did mount their own pushback campaign. There were lawyers, White House messaging meetings, and a media blitz run by allies on conservative television, radio and websites.",
            "Trump was acquitted in 2020 by the GOP-controlled Senate and his approval ratings were undamaged. But this time, as some members of his own party recoiled and accused him of committing impeachable offenses, Trump was isolated and quiet. A presidency centered on the bombastic declaration “I alone can fix it” seemed to be ending with a whimper.",
            "The third-ranking Republican in the House, Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, said there had “never been a greater betrayal” by a president. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told colleagues in a letter that he had not decided how he would vote in an impeachment trial.",
            "For the first time, Trump’s future seemed in doubt, and what was once unthinkable — that enough Republican senators would defy him and vote to remove him from office — seemed at least possible, if unlikely.",
            "But there was no effort from the White House to line up votes in the president’s defense.",
            "The team around Trump is hollowed out, with the White House counsel’s office not drawing up a legal defense plan and the legislative affairs team largely abandoned. Trump leaned on Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., to push Republican senators to oppose removal. Graham’s spokesman said the senator was making the calls of his own volition.",
            "Trump and his allies believed that the president’s sturdy popularity with the lawmakers’ GOP constituents would deter them from voting against him.",
            "The president was livid with perceived disloyalty from McConnell and Cheney and has been deeply frustrated that he could not hit back with his Twitter account, which has kept Republicans in line for years. Trump watched much of the day’s proceedings on TV from the White House residence and his private dining area off the Oval Office.",
            "A short time before he was impeached, Trump was in the White House East Room presenting the National Medal of Arts to singers Toby Keith and Ricky Skaggs as well as former Associated Press photographer Nick Ut.",
            "His paramount concern, beyond his legacy, was what a second impeachment could do to his immediate political and financial future, according to four White House officials and Republicans close to the West Wing. They were not authorized to speak discuss private conversations and spoke on condition of anonymity.",
            "The loss of his Twitter account and fundraising lists could complicate Trump’s efforts to remain a GOP kingmaker and potentially run again in 2024. Moreover, Trump seethed at the blows being dealt to his business, including the withdrawal of a PGA tournament from one of his golf courses and the decision by New York City to cease dealings with his company.",
            "There’s the possibility that if the Senate were to convict him, he also could be barred from seeking election again, dashing any hopes of another presidential campaign.",
            "A White House spokesman did not respond to questions about whether anyone in the building was trying to defend Trump, who was now the subject of half of the presidential impeachments in the nation’s history.",
            "One campaign adviser, Jason Miller, argued Democrats’ efforts will serve to galvanize the Republican base behind Trump and end up harming Biden. He blamed the Democrats’ swift pace for the silence, saying there wasn’t “time for mounting a traditional response operation.” But he pledged that “the real battle will be the Senate where there’ll be a more traditional pushback effort.”",
            "The reminders of the Capitol siege were everywhere as the House moved toward the impeachment roll call.",
            "Some of the Capitol’s doors were broken and windows were shattered. A barricade had gone up around outside the building and there were new checkpoints. Hundreds of members of the National Guard patrolled the hallways, even sleeping on the marble floors of the same rotunda that once housed Abraham Lincoln’s casket.",
            "And now the Capitol is the site of more history, adding to the chapter that features Clinton, impeached 21 years ago for lying under oath about sex with White House intern Monica Lewinsky, and Andrew Johnson, impeached 151 years ago for defying Congress on Reconstruction. Another entry is for Richard Nixon, who avoided impeachment by resigning during the Watergate investigation.",
            "But Trump, the only one impeached twice, will once more be alone.",

            "Pony up people, because this is one Harry hairy situation.",
            "Rob Lowe appeared on “The Late Late Show With James Corden” Monday night with a tale about his relatively new neighbor, Prince Harry, who lives in his Montecito community in Santa Barbara, California.",
            "“I just ran into your countryman, the English treasure Prince Harry, at the stoplight 10 minutes ago,” the actor told Corden during the show. “He lives about a mile from me. Um, he’s been very reclusive. Seeing him in the neighborhood is like seeing the Loch Ness Monster, and I finally saw him. I finally saw him driving his car.”",
            "The “Parks and Recreation” actor then added, “I may have a scoop” — and reported that the Duke of Sussex seemed to be sporting a new hairdo.",
            "“It was very, very quick — don’t totally quote me on it — but it looked like he’s wearing a ponytail,” Lowe told Corden. “I’m just saying. It looked to me ― as a casual observer ― that his hair had grown very long and was pulled back very tightly by what I can only assume was a ponytail.”",
            "Corden, who is good friends with the Sussexes and even performed at their royal wedding reception, kindly put Lowe in his place.\n\n“I’m certain that isn’t true,” the television host exclaimed with a smile and a laugh. “Do you know what I think’s happened? I think you didn’t see Prince Harry.”\n\nLowe continued to insist it was the duke.\n\n“Oh no, it was him. Because I have to say, I followed him to the house to see if the car went in,” he added with a smile.\n\nThe verdict? Most likely false.\n\nConsidering the duke was still sporting shorter hair during a Beverly Hills shopping trip on Dec. 20, we’re going to side with Corden on this one.",
            "An Archewell spokesperson did not have an on-the-record comment for HuffPost on Tuesday.\n\nLowe does seem to have a certain thing for commenting on British royal family members’ hair, though.\n\nBack in 2019, the actor made disparaging remarks about Prince William’s hair loss during an interview with The Telegraph. When the publication asked Lowe if he considered himself more or less vain than British men, he responded with a few choice words.\n\n“That’s a low bar. Can we talk about William?” he replied before launching into a discussion of what he called the prince’s “traumatic” hair loss. (Traumatic for Lowe, that is.)\n\n“I mean, the future king of your country let himself lose his hair! So when I say British men set a very low bar...” he trailed off. “Honestly, one of the great traumatic experiences of my life was watching Prince William lose his hair. He’s going to be the fucking king of England!”\n\nJust a few weeks later, Lowe walked back his comments during an appearance on the British TV show “Good Morning Britain.”",
            "“My point was, here’s a guy who is fully comfortable in his own skin, then on the other side of the coin, you have me,” Lowe said. “I can’t even watch another guy go bald without being even more narcissistic and wanting to plug in the Propecia into a drip into my own.”\n\nHe added that the comments were “literally me slagging my own insecurity and narcissism” and said of William: “He’s a stud, I love him. He’s awesome.”\n\nSubscribe to HuffPost’s Watching the Royals newsletter for all things Windsor (and beyond)."

        "articleContent": [
            "In the aftermath of Wednesday’s violent insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, top voices on the American right have issued a call for lawmakers to “move on” without resorting to an impeachment proceeding against President Donald Trump. National Republican Campaign Committee Chairman Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) has said the impeachment bid would “divide us” as a country, a call Fox News host Brian Kilmeade and other conservative personalities quickly echoed.",
            "That Trump bears responsibility for that assault on the Capitol is not in question. The president constantly broadcasted lies about the results of November’s presidential election from his bully pulpit and across social media, fomenting fury. On Wednesday he repeated those lies to a mob of thousands, telling them to “show strength,” “fight like hell,” and strike fear into the hearts of lawmakers who refused to overturn Joe Biden’s win in the election. He then dispatched them to the Capitol.",
            "When a great crime is committed, society can only move on when those responsible have been held accountable. This is a basic tenet not only of criminal law, but of truth and reconciliation commissions and other projects aimed at national healing. What exactly constitutes accountability and responsibility are, of course, dependent on the nature of the crime and the roles different figures played in its execution. But the principle is based on the idea that to be forgiven, one must first acknowledge responsibility and, in many cases, endure punishment. Without accountability, social wounds will not heal, but fester.",
            "Republican leaders are not, in fact, asking the country to move on from the insurrection in any meaningful way. They are asking everyone to politely pretend that nothing happened, so that the conservative movement and elected GOP officials can avoid unpleasant consequences for their actions and rhetoric. Kilmeade’s point that “people are ready to explode” is, in this light, better understood as a threat than a plea for calm.",
            "Let us be clear: Trump did not act alone. At the pre-riot rally on the National Mall, his lawyer, former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, urged the mob to pursue “trial by combat” to overturn the election results. Trump supporters who invaded the Capitol chanted “Hang Mike Pence!” for the vice president’s refusing to throw out the electoral votes that made Biden president-elect. One rioter was photographed wearing a “Camp Auschwitz” T-shirt; others brought zip-tie handcuffs for detaining hostages. Still others brought a gallows to the Capitol, scrawled “Murder the Media” on its walls and beat a Capitol police officer to death with a fire extinguisher.",
            "But the violence itself is only one dimension of Wednesday’s horror. What shocked the world was its political intent. This violence was committed as part of a concerted effort to overturn an election’s outcome at the direction of the losing candidate.",
            "The political nature of the Capitol attack demands that accountability take political form. While the judiciary should handle criminal charges against individual insurrectionists, those who empowered and encouraged an assault on the legislative branch of the U.S. government should face consequences in the legislative branch. For Trump, there is no alternative to impeachment by the House and a conviction by the Senate.",
            "The president is not the only bad actor here who must face punitive measures. Sens. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Ted Cruz (R-Texas) led the attempt in their chamber to overturn the election results, championing Trump’s conspiracy theories. Hawley gave a now-infamous fist-pump to the assembled mob shortly before they began rioting. Reps. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) and Madison Cawthorn (R-N.C.) both spoke at the Trump rally ahead of the attack and spread the lie that the election had been stolen from the president through mass fraud. All four men have decried the violence that ensued, but none have apologized for their role or even acknowledged any responsibility for the insurrection. If any of them respected their offices, they would resign. Since they will not, the House and Senate should expel them and let their constituents select replacements.",
            "Those are the easy cases. But from there accountability gets tricky. The list of elected Republicans who voted with the mob is frighteningly long: eight senators and 139 House members voted against certifying the election results. These votes were cast after the insurrection, when it was abundantly clear to the entire country exactly what kind of reaction those votes would encourage. On Monday night, Capitol Police briefed Democrats on three more conspiracies to overthrow the government ahead of Biden’s inauguration on Jan. 20, potentially involving tens of thousands of armed terrorists, including one plot aimed explicitly at murdering Democrats to give Republicans control of the government.",
            "The further down-ballot you go, the uglier the picture of the Republican Party gets. In Michigan alone, the GOP state party chair, statehouse legislators and local election officials went to extraordinary lengths to discredit Biden’s victory in the state and twist the legal system into overturning his win. The Rule of Law Defense Fund, a dark money organization Republican state attorneys general created in 2014, made robocalls encouraging people to attend the Wednesday rally and “stop the steal.” A Republican member of the West Virginia House of Delegates was even among those who stormed the Capitol (he has since resigned his seat).",
            "The inescapable conclusion is that the lunatic fringe of the Republican Party is no longer a fringe. It’s the party. For decades, members of the GOP elite have believed that leaders committed to tax cuts and deregulation could maintain control over their coalition by indulging its crank elements on what they saw as minor points and deceiving them on others. Trump’s election made clear, however, that the popular constituency for free trade and free markets in today’s America is vanishingly small. And so the party’s elite has become increasingly beholden to violent extremists, culminating ― so far ― in Wednesday’s outrage.",
            "Not all of these extremists, of course, think of themselves as murderous neo-Nazis. Early news reports were filled with stories and images of people who infiltrated the Capitol gawking at its opulence like tourists, or patiently explaining various conspiracy theories to reporters rather than assaulting them (though other members of the mob did attack journalists).",
            "But the attack on the Capitol made clear that once-disparate elements of the conservative coalition have fused into a common culture with a violent hostility to the American government at its core. The Proud Boys knelt in prayer before storming the barricades as Confederate flags intermingled with a Jesus 2020 banner. Militant fascists, devout white evangelicals, disaffected working people and ultrarich small business owners recited QAnon lies to each other.",
            "Each of these different factions initially rallied to Trump for different reasons, citing different grievances, some real and some imagined, some motivated by hate and some by frustration. Trump has cemented them as a political unit and persuaded them that American democracy itself is their enemy.",
            "Trump may well be right, in a sense. Wednesday’s naked violence will make it still more difficult for his coalition to reach anything like a national majority. Trump lost the popular vote by more than 3 million in 2016. In 2020 he lost by 7 million. It is not hard to imagine a near-future in which the Trump coalition won’t need to believe a demagogue’s lies to be motivated into action against democracy, but will instead reason their way to it out of political self-interest.",
            "In this they would be imitating Republican leaders, who got in bed with Trump back in 2016 knowing he was their best bet for achieving long-standing conservative economic and foreign policy goals.",
            "They got what they wanted, and American democracy is paying the price. If the political system cannot or will not hold the instigators of Wednesday’s horrors accountable, more leaders will make that calculation in the future, with a more violent movement behind them."

            "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic-led efforts to impeach U.S. President Donald Trump for a historic second time gained momentum over the weekend, although it looked far from certain whether enough Republicans would back the move with just days left in his term.",
            "Democratic members of the House of Representatives will introduce articles of impeachment on Monday after Trump encouraged his supporters to storm the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, Representative Ted Lieu said on Twitter.",
            "The California Democrat, who helped draft the charges, said the articles had drawn 190 co-sponsors by Saturday night. As of Saturday afternoon, no Republicans had signed on, Lieu’s spokeswoman said.",
            "“We have videos of the speech where (Trump) incites the mob. We have videos of the mob violently attacking the Capitol. This isn’t a close call,” Lieu tweeted Saturday night.",
            "Trump initially praised his supporters at the Capitol but later condemned their violence in a video. The decision to call for calm came at the urging of senior aides, some arguing he could face removal from office or legal liability, sources told Reuters. Since losing the Nov. 3 election, Trump has falsely claimed he was the victim of widespread fraud.",
            "Five people including a Capitol Police officer died as a result of Wednesday’s rioting and dozens of people have been charged following the storming of the Capitol.",
            "Authorities are investigating the security lapse, with some lawmakers questioning whether rioters had help from inside the building after images of some police officers opening barricades and posing for selfies with the rioters.",
            "While the vast majority of Capitol Police acted valiantly, U.S. Representative Mondaire Jones said on CNN on Sunday, “It’s just very clear that there was inside information that was shared with these individuals and there has to be an investigation of that.”",
            "Impeachment by the Democratic-led House, equivalent to an indictment, would trigger an unprecedented second trial in the Republican-controlled Senate, which cleared Trump during his first trial over allegations that he threatened U.S. national security.",
            "Two previous presidents were impeached but were also acquitted in the Senate. Richard Nixon resigned in 1974 over the Watergate scandal when it became clear he would be removed.",
            "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has also asked members to draft legislation aimed at invoking the Constitution’s 25th Amendment, which allows for stripping the powers from a president unable to fulfill the duties of the office.",
            "The intensifying effort to oust Trump has drawn scattered support from Republicans, whose party has been divided by the president’s actions. Democrats have pressed Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment, but he has opposed the idea, an adviser said.",
            "CNN reported late Saturday that the vice president had not ruled out invoking the 25th Amendment, citing a source close to him, but that some in Pence’s team worried any effort to remove Trump could provoke the president to more rash behavior.",
            "A Pence spokesman did not respond to a request for comment late on Saturday.",
            "Democratic President-elect Joe Biden has not taken a position on Trump’s impeachment, saying he will leave it to Congress to decide. Biden is due to be sworn into office on Jan. 20.",
            "SCATTERED REPUBLICAN SUPPORT FOR REMOVAL",
            "A small but growing number of Republican lawmakers have joined calls for Trump to step down, and several high-ranking administration officials have resigned in protest.",
            "Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said Friday that Trump should resign immediately and suggested she would consider leaving the party if Republicans cannot part from him.",
            "Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania told Fox News on Saturday that Trump had “committed impeachable offenses” but did not support removing him with less than two weeks left in his term.",
            "U.S. Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, a frequent Trump critic, told CBS News he would “definitely consider” impeachment.",
            "But other key Trump allies, including Senator Lindsey Graham and House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, have urged Democrats to shelve any impeachment effort.",
            "Mitch McConnell, the Republican Senate majority leader, has suggested any trial would likely occur after Trump’s term ends, when Democrats will take control of the Senate thanks to victories in two Georgia runoff elections last week.",
            "If found guilty after leaving office, Trump would lose benefits enjoyed by former presidents, such as security and pension, and the Senate could vote to bar him from running for a second term.",
            "But a Senate conviction requires a two-third majority, which would take at least 17 Republican votes.",

            "“The president spiraled down into a kind of madness that was different. I’m sorry if people don’t acknowledge that. I think what he did this past week is wildly different from the offensive tweets that were common during his presidency and I don’t think that those tweets clearly indicated that this was coming,” Toomey said.",

So I don’t think this unbelievable behavior of Wednesday, for instance, could have reasonably been expected.”"

The accumulated evidence includes a murderous Charlottesville, Virginia neo-Nazi riot in 2017 and a shoutout to a fascist street gang from a presidential debate stage last fall.",
            "Most Republicans, we know, are not torch-bearing fascists. GOP leaders have been especially keen to draw a distinction between respectable business-class conservatism and the MAGA mob. And yet they have bet their careers and the country on an alliance with Trump’s authoritarianism.",

            "Nor were the standard-bearers of the conservative movement ever confused about what they were doing. Explaining his decision to vote for Donald Trump in 2020, conservative debate-me icon Ben Shapiro ― once a Trump critic in the far-gone days of 2016 ― declared that he had been “wrong” to think Trump would stand in the way of right-wing policy priorities.",

            "The alliance between these cufflinkers and the catastrophists has proved overwhelmingly successful for the conservative elite. McConnell has reshaped the federal judiciary, with three Supreme Court Justices and well over 200 other lifetime appointments. Ryan was so satisfied with the Trump tax bill’s offerings for the rich that he retired in glory, his life’s work at last accomplished. Former Trump chief of staff Mick Mulvaney resigned as special envoy to Northern Ireland in ostensible protest Wednesday night, having taken advantage of his previous post to gut the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Cotton has been correctly denouncing Republicans who bought into Trump’s conspiracy theories about the 2020 election, but only after he got Trump to rip up President Barack Obama’s diplomatic detente with Iran and move the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a longstanding goal of both the ultranationalist right in Israel and the apocalyptic evangelical Christian fringe in the United States.",
            "Cruz even got Trump to stop mocking his wife in public. Which leads us, as all pathetic roads eventually do, to Rubio. After tweeting his frustration with “3rd world style anti-American anarchy,” Rubio gave a speech on the Senate floor Wednesday night comparing the events of the day to the activities of mid-century Marxist revolutionaries in Cuba.",
            "“My entire life I have lived with and next to people who came to America because their country was chaotic and their country was unsafe,” Rubio said. “What I saw today, what we have seen, looks more like those countries than the extraordinary nation that it is my privilege to call home … I think politics has made us crazy. Everybody in this country has lost their minds.”",
            "O Politics, what hath thou wrought ― be there no agency nor accountability to thine abstract malevolence!",
            "Of course there is. Rubio, like nearly all of his colleagues, got in bed with Trump because he recognized, correctly, that Trump was the best way to achieve his near-term political goals. Now that the alliance has blown up in his face, Rubio hopes to concoct some weird formula in which the whole thing is really the fault of the radical left ― Cuban Marxists and American anarchists.",
            "Wednesday’s MAGA riot was the work of the Republican Party, not of the left or “politics.” There have always been politics and there always will be, but not all of it leads to QAnon lunatics storming the Capitol at the behest of a Republican president hoping to overturn the result of an election that didn’t go in his favor. Most Americans are not, in fact, bloodthirsty authoritarians.",
            "The authoritarian strain in the Republican Party, however, is not merely a product of its unwashed fringe. Take, for example, Trump’s most aggressive attorney general, William Barr, who did not rise to power through Breitbart or Facebook paranoia. He has a long and illustrious career serving on corporate boards and as AG for George H.W. Bush in the long, long-ago days when Republicans were supposedly so much more refined and sensible. But as Tom Hamburger and others have detailed, Barr has long championed the “unitary executive” ― a fancy name for a theory of monarchical presidential power embraced by, among others, former Vice President Dick Cheney. Though its adherents embrace different definitions and engage in various micro-doctrinal disputes, the basic idea is, as Richard Nixon once put it, “When the president does it, that means it’s not illegal.”",
            "Nor is Barr the only ghost of Fancy Republicanism Past to make his way into the Trump administration. Trump’s Supreme Court nominees have all been members of the ultra-elite conservative Federalist Society. His labor secretary, Eugene Scalia, is the son of the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. His treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, is a Goldman Sachs alum. His former Securities and Exchange Commission chairman, Jay Clayton, was a Goldman lawyer. His commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, was a private equity kingpin. His CIA director turned secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, is a former businessman whose enterprise was backed by an investment from the Koch Brothers. His education secretary, Betsy DeVos, is the billionaire ex-chair of the Michigan Republican Party, and his vice president, Mike Pence, is a career conservative movement man who eventually became governor of Indiana before joining the Trump administration.",
            "Every one of these people knew what they were doing when they signed up to work with Trump.",
            "The Republican rot, in short, did not arise in January 2021 or even 2016. Party power brokers have been advocating various strains of authoritarianism for decades because they are the surest way to ensure that the unpopular policy agenda of the American elite remains politically viable.",
            "CORRECTION: This article previously mischaracterized Mick Mulvaney as Trump’s chief of staff, a role he left in March 2020, and Mike Pompeo as CIA director, a role he left in 2018.",

            "The editorial board of The Wall Street Journal on Thursday asked President Donald Trump to resign to save the nation from another impeachment fight after he sicced a mob of his supporters on the U.S. Capitol a day earlier in an effort to stop Congress from certifying President-elect Joe Biden’s election victory.",
            "“This was an assault on the constitutional process of transferring power after an election,” the conservative newspaper’s board wrote. “It was also an assault on the legislature from an executive sworn to uphold the laws of the United States. This goes beyond merely refusing to concede defeat. In our view it crosses a constitutional line that Mr. Trump hasn’t previously crossed. It is impeachable.”",
            "On Wednesday, Trump incited a crowd to march on the Capitol over his false claims the election was stolen from him. When it turned violent, and hundreds of rioters stormed and occupied the building and tore through its legislative chambers and offices, Trump did little to discourage it. He called for peace but then reiterated his stolen election narrative and said “we love you” to the rioters.",
            "The Journal argued that these actions were a “far greater dereliction of duty than his ham-handed Ukrainian interventions in 2019,” which led to his impeachment by the House but acquittal in the Senate.",
            "Democrats and some Republicans, as well as the editorial boards of several other newspapers, including The Washington Post and USA Today, have called for Trump to be removed from office by Vice President Mike Pence and a majority of his Cabinet by invoking the 25th Amendment to deem him unfit for his duties. If that doesn’t go forward, Democratic leaders in Congress said they would pursue impeachment.",
            "After Wednesday’s chaos, the subsequent resignations of a number of White House staffers and widespread condemnation, Trump shifted his tone and promised an orderly transfer of power.",
            "The Journal argued that invoking the 25th Amendment would give Trump “more cause to play the political victim” and suggested impeachment would be “more transparent and politically accountable.” It would send a message to future presidents that Congress would protect itself from such behavior, the board wrote.",
            "But doing so so late in Trump’s term ― he has just 13 days left in office ― would be difficult and could further stoke tensions in an already-divided nation, the Journal wrote.",
            "“If Mr. Trump wants to avoid a second impeachment, his best path would be to take personal responsibility and resign,” the board wrote.",
            "It concluded: “We know an act of grace by Mr. Trump isn’t likely. In any case this week has probably finished him as a serious political figure. He has cost Republicans the House, the White House, and now the Senate.",
            "“Worse, he has betrayed his loyal supporters by lying to them about the election and the ability of Congress and Mr. Pence to overturn it. He has refused to accept the basic bargain of democracy, which is to accept the result, win or lose.",

            "ATLANTA, Ga. (AP) — President-elect Joe Biden on Monday told Georgia Democrats they had the power to “chart the course” for a generation as President Donald Trump urged Republican voters to “swamp” the polls ahead of runoff elections that will determine control of the U.S. Senate.",
            "Trump made his final-hours pitch to voters at a nighttime rally in north Georgia, where Republicans were banking on strong voter turnout Tuesday to reelect Sen. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue and hold control of the chamber.",
            "Biden campaigned with Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock in Atlanta, hoping he could recreate the coalition that secured him a narrow victory in the presidential race in November.",
            "“Folks, this is it. This is it. It’s a new year, and tomorrow can be a new day for Atlanta, for Georgia and for America,” Biden said at a drive-in rally. “Unlike any time in my career, one state — one state — can chart the course, not just for the four years but for the next generation.”",
            "The stakes have drawn hundreds of millions of dollars in campaign spending to a once solidly Republican state that now finds itself as the nation’s premier battleground. Biden won Georgia’s 16 electoral votes by about 12,000 votes out of 5 million cast in November, though Trump continues pushing false assertions of widespread fraud that even his now-former attorney general and Georgia’s Republican secretary of state — along with a litany of state and federal judges — have said did not happen.",
            "The president’s trip came a day after disclosure of a remarkable telephone call he made to the Georgia secretary of state over the weekend. Trump pressured Republican Brad Raffensperger to “find” enough votes to overturn Georgia’s election results ahead of Wednesday’s joint session of Congress that will certify Biden’s Electoral College victory. The call highlighted how Trump has used the Georgia campaign to make clear his continued hold on Republican politics.",
            "Angry after the Raffensperger call, Trump floated the idea of pulling out of the rally but was persuaded to go ahead with it so he would have a chance to reiterate his claims of election fraud. Republicans were wary as to whether Trump would focus only on himself and fail to promote the two GOP candidates.",
            "A top Georgia election official said hours before Trump’s rally that he “wanted to scream” after hearing audio of the president’s call with Raffensperger.",
            "“Do not self-suppress your own vote,” said Gabriel Sterling, Georgia’s voting system implementation manager.",
            "But Trump, at the rally in Dalton, Georgia, spent much of his address on message, making an impassioned case that Loeffler’s and Perdue’s races were among the most important Georgia voters would ever face and made the case that “the fate of our country is at stake.”",
            "To be sure, he also spent a fair amount of time rehashing false claims that the November election was “rigged.” He fumed that Republican Gov. Brian Kemp was “incompetent” and replayed many of the same debunked claims that he raised days ago in his call with Raffensperger.",
            "“The Democrats are trying to steal the White House, you cannot let them,” Trump said. “You just can’t let them steal the U.S. Senate, you can’t let it happen.”",
            "Biden on Monday took aim at Trump’s scheme by declaring that “politicians cannot assert, take or seize power” by undermining legitimate elections.",
            "Biden said he needs a Senate majority to pass legislation to combat the coronavirus, and he blasted Perdue and Loeffler as obstructionist Trump loyalists. Loeffler says she will join other Republican lawmakers in objecting to the Electoral College certification of Biden’s victory by Congress on Wednesday.",
            "“You have two senators who think they’ve sworn an oath to Donald Trump, not the United States Constitution,” Biden said.",
            "Earlier Monday, Vice President Mike Pence told a crowd of conservative Christian voters at a campaign event in Milner, Georgia, to stop a Democratic takeover in Washington. “We’re going to keep Georgia, and we’re going to save America,” Pence said at Rock Springs Church in Milner.",
            "Perdue addressed the church crowd in Milner by telephone while quarantining over coronavirus exposure, claiming that “the very future of our republic is on the line” and declaring the duty to vote “a calling from God.”",
            "Trump amplified the sentiment, warning that Ossoff and Warnock wins would lead to a sharp leftward swing in American policy making.",
            "“These Senate seats are truly the last line of defense,” Trump said. He added, “It’s really fight for our country, not a fight for Trump.”",
            "Republicans need just one victory to maintain Senate control and force Biden to contend with divided government. Democrats need a sweep for a 50-50 split, giving the tiebreaking vote to Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, who will succeed Pence as the Senate’s presiding officer. That would give Democrats a Senate majority to go along with their control of the House and executive branch.",
            "Pence, who will preside over Wednesday’s congressional joint session, sidestepped Trump’s denials Monday until a man yelled out that he must “do the right thing on Jan. 6.” Pence promised that “we’ll have our day in Congress,” though he offered no details about what that might mean. Scores of Republicans in Congress have pledged to protest the Electoral College count, but Pence has no legal authority to override Biden’s win.",
            "Facing those passions from the Republican base, Perdue, whose first Senate term expired Sunday, and Loeffler, an appointed senator trying to win her first election, have run as unabashed Trump Republicans and spent the two-month runoff blitz warning of a “radical” and “dangerous” lurch to the left.",
            "Ossoff and Warnock have countered with warnings that a Republican Senate will stymie Biden’s administration, especially on pandemic relief.",
            "Warnock pushed back at the deluge of Loeffler television ads casting him as a socialist. “Have you noticed she hasn’t even bothered to make a case, Georgia, for why you should keep her in that seat?” Warnock said, speaking ahead of Biden. “That’s because she has no case to make.”",
            "A closely divided Senate — with the rules still requiring 60 votes to advance major bills — lessens the prospects of sweeping legislation regardless. But a Democratic Senate would at least assure Biden an easier path for top appointees, including judges, and legitimate consideration of his legislative agenda. A Senate led by McConnell would almost certainly deny even an up-or-down vote on Biden’s most ambitious plans.",
            "More than 3 million Georgians already have voted. Monday’s push focused on getting voters to the polls Tuesday. Democrats ran up a wide margin among 3.6 million early votes in the fall, but Republicans countered with an Election Day surge, especially in small towns and rural areas.",

            "No parabens, petrolatum or artificial fragrances. Only the best of nature’s ingredients. And hey, a recyclable bottle.",
            "By now, you’ve heard of clean beauty and all its potential benefits. But if you’ve ever compared the price tags on your go-to foundation, moisturizer or conditioner, you may have noticed the clean version is a little pricier. Or, in some cases, much pricier than a not-clean but otherwise comparable product.",
            "Browsing your favorite beauty retailer online can reveal some serious price disparities. Popular brands like Benefit sell highly rated foundations for $30, while a clean foundation from Tarte retails for $39.",
            "Skin care product pricing is similar. Consider this argan oil for $6.80 per ounce, compared with a clean version for about $28.80 per ounce. And hair care products aren’t exempt. A reparative hair mask costs $25 from Kiehl’s, versus $36 from clean brand Briogeo.",
            "So, why do these clean beauty products cost more than the traditional alternatives? We spoke to experts who explained.",
            "The confusion around clean",
            "For starters, there is no official or agreed upon definition of what clean beauty really is. Most clean beauty brands define their version of clean based on the ingredients they leave out of their products ― ones they say may be harmful for people or the environment. For example, Drunk Elephant keeps “the suspicious six” out of their skin care line, while hair care brand Briogeo rejects six other outlawed ingredients.",
            "Victoria Fu and Gloria Lu, cosmetic chemists and co-founders of Chemist Confessions, noted that clean beauty is defined differently by each brand. Because brands can set their own bar for “clean,” that means they can set their own price, too.",
            "“It’s about a lot of no-no lists of ingredients brands deem irritating or cancer-causing, and it has grown into a competition to see who has the longest no-no list,” Fu said. “For a lot of the ingredients flagged, there isn’t substantial evidence these ingredients are bad for you. That’s where we find a lot of confusion.”",
            "“There is no clear definition of what it means,” Lu said. “The trend we’re seeing people lump in with clean beauty is sustainability. It’s becoming this movement of putting together what consumers care about, and putting it all under the ‘clean’ umbrella.”",
            "What’s in a price?",
            "Since every brand defines “clean” for themselves, Lu said, it’s hard to say precisely what goes into pricing their products.",
            "Sourcing natural ingredients explains the majority of the difference in cost, according to Erica Douglas, founder of Sister Scientist and a cosmetic chemist with years of experience in developing clean beauty and textured hair care products.",
            "“I like to compare it to the organic food movement. When you say, ‘Hey, we need to remove this ingredient or anything labeled a carcinogen,’ in most cases it’s more expensive to make the replacement ingredient or it’s not available in abundance,” Douglas said. “That adds cost to the formula that gets passed down to the consumer. Until conventional brands put their volume behind it, it will be hard to find clean alternatives to those ingredients.”",
            "“A lot of things can contribute to the price,” Lu noted. “I can’t speak for all brands, but my educated guess is there are administrative costs. The reality is you want certain ingredients, and brands that do their due diligence want to find out about those ingredients’ processing, their residues, and making sure they align with their brand’s values. That contributes to cost.”",
            "The trend of combining all of a consumer’s interests can also drive up prices. Bottle your clean beauty product in environmentally friendly packaging — another important factor for many clean beauty shoppers — and it starts to add up.",
            "“Some brands lump in sustainability, and sustainable packaging is more expensive than traditional packaging,” Lu said.",
            "Will it always cost more to choose clean?",
            "Why can’t you walk into stores like Walmart and Target, or your neighborhood pharmacy, and see clean beauty products at drugstore prices? Lu explained that, kind of like the world of fashion, high-end and luxury brands (think: what you might see sold in Sephora) set the trends shoppers eventually will see at major retailers.",
            "“Part of it is marketing,” Lu said. “They feel like their customer segment is going to pick up on a new label first, like ‘clean.’ Trends trickle down to more mass brands a little later.”",
            "However, that trickle-down of the clean beauty trend means consumers will eventually have more affordable options to choose from.",
            "“It all comes down to the power of supply and demand,” Douglas said. “When the clean beauty movement started, the price point was high because there wasn’t high demand for it. You aren’t making vast amounts of product to serve a small population of people. As clean beauty became popular, now you have more people who are ingredient-label readers and are more concerned. With the masses on board, you can put out more. Volume drives pricing. When you’re making smaller batches, ingredients and using fewer toxic substitutes are more expensive.”",
            "How to spend wisely",
            "The chemists said that, just like buying conventional products, starting with a sample size of a clean beauty product can help you determine if it’s right for your skin type or hair type (and worth the additional cost).",
            "“You pay more to have a cleaner product, and they’re equating cleaner to safer, but we want to emphasize that’s not the case at all,” Fu said. “A lot of clean products use things that are more plant-based and that can be more problematic. Plants are complex and have allergens themselves, so if you’re not using a very refined version, this can invite in more potential for irritation.”",
            "“Being informed is what’s most important,” Douglas said. “There’s a lot of confusion in the marketplace, and ingredients get a bad reputation even though it hasn’t been proven by science that they’re horrible. But just the possibility they’re bad is enough for some people to say they don’t want them in their products. Other brands say, ‘If science hasn’t proven this, why should we take it out?’ I support the clean beauty industry and rationale behind it, but I’m also someone who values data and facts. Let the consumer decide if they want to operate at this standard or that one.”"

            "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump in a New Year’s Eve message reflected on his accomplishments in office, calling them “historic victories,” while his successor, President-elect Joe Biden, struck an upbeat tone in looking ahead to 2021.",
            "After weeks of vowing to win his fight to remain in office, Republican Trump said in a video posted on Twitter: “We have to be remembered for what’s been done.”",
            "Trump, who has yet to formally concede his November election defeat to his Democratic rival, returned to Washington early from his Florida resort amid a fight with Congress over a defense bill and coronavirus aid checks.",
            "Speaking from Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, Biden paid tribute to healthcare workers and encouraged people to get vaccinated in a brief appearance with his wife, Jill Biden, on the long-running ABC special “Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve with Ryan Seacrest 2021.”",
            "“I’m absolutely, positively confident - confident - we’re going to come back and we’re going to come back even stronger than before,” said Biden, who takes office on Jan. 20.",
            "He repeated his call for vaccines to be distributed more quickly.",
            "Trump, who had COVID-19 in October, frequently played down the severity of the pandemic and oversaw a response many health experts have criticized as disorganized, cavalier, and sometimes ignored the science behind virus transmission.",
            "But in his remarks, he noted that the United States has produced a COVID-19 vaccine in record time and he had correctly predicted it would come before the year ended.",
            "The United States has been one of the countries worst-hit by COVID-19 and leads the world in fatalities, with more than 340,000 deaths officially attributed to the virus.",
            "Trump was originally scheduled to attend a New Year’s Eve party at his Mar-a-Lago resort.",
            "The White House has given no reason for why he returned to Washington early, but it coincides with Trump’s fight with Congress over his veto of a major defense bill and his demand for increased COVID-19 stimulus checks, as well as a spike in tensions with Iran.",
            "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the top Republican in the chamber, dealt a likely death blow on Wednesday to Trump’s bid to boost coronavirus aid to Americans, declining to schedule a swift vote on a bill to raise relief checks to $2,000 from the $600 included in an $892 billion relief package passed by Congress earlier this month.",
            "TENSIONS WITH REPUBLICANS",
            "Trump’s fellow Republicans in Congress have largely stuck with him through four turbulent years, but he lashed out at them in recent days for not fully backing his unsupported claims of election fraud, rejecting his demand for bigger checks, and for moving toward the veto override.",
            "McConnell on Thursday again rejected a vote on a standalone bill that would increase the stimulus checks, calling it “socialism for rich people” and “a terrible way to get help to families who actually need it.” The bill was passed by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives on Monday.",
            "McConnell also said there should be nothing controversial about approving the $740 billion National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which Trump vetoed because it does not repeal certain legal protections for tech companies.",
            "“We’ve enacted an annual NDAA for 59 straight years and counting,” McConnell said. “In the next few days – the easy way or the hard way – we’re going to do our job once again. This body will fulfill our responsibility to the men and women who protect our country.”",
            "The House voted to overturn Trump’s veto on Monday. The Senate will convene again on Friday at Noon EST for a rare New Year’s Day session in which lawmakers are expected to cast the first of two procedural votes aimed at overriding the veto. If that succeeds, the Senate is expected to hold a second procedural vote on Saturday followed by a final vote on passage.",
            "Republican Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri has said he will object to Biden’s victory when Congress convenes to officially tally the Electoral College votes on Jan. 6, which could trigger a lengthy debate in the Senate but has no chance of overturning the results. CNN reported that some 140 Republicans in the House are expected to engage in similar tactics.",
            "Some Republican senators had supported Trump’s call for an increase in the stimulus payments, notably David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, who face runoff elections in Georgia on Jan. 5 that will determine which party controls the Senate under Biden.",
            "But Perdue’s campaign suffered a setback on Thursday, saying the senator was quarantining after coming into contact with someone who tested positive for the coronavirus.",
            "U.S.-Iran tensions, meanwhile, have again spiked.",
            "Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Thursday accused Washington of trying to fabricate a pretext for attacking his country and vowed Tehran would defend itself even though it does not seek war.",
            "Two U.S. B-52 bombers flew over the Middle East on Wednesday in what U.S. officials said was a message of deterrence to Iran ahead of the first anniversary of a U.S. drone strike that killed top Iranian general Qassem Soleimani on Jan. 3, 2020.",

            "Days after “Wonder Woman 1984” touched down (or crash-landed, depending on your opinion) on HBO Max and in select theaters, Warner Bros. has already fast-tracked a third film in the DC franchise.",
            "Director Patty Jenkins is set to write and direct the final film in the trilogy with Gal Gadot starring once again as the titular heroine, Variety announced on Sunday.",
            "Despite premiering in only 2,150 theaters across the country, “Wonder Woman 1984” lassoed the highest-grossing opening weekend to date amid the COVID-19 pandemic, raking in $16.7 million in domestic ticket sales and even more internationally. In its simultaneous debut on HBO Max, it shattered the traditional theatrical window and streaming records in the process.",
            "How and when Diana Prince will return is still mostly up in the air, as production on the third film is still early in development, but we do know a few things.",
            "Warner Bros. stressed in its statement that the final chapter of Wonder Woman’s story will indeed be released in theaters, seemingly confirming that the studio’s hybrid release model is a temporary, coronavirus-era strategy.",
            "“As fans around the world continue to embrace Diana Prince, driving the strong opening weekend performance of ‘Wonder Woman 1984,’ we are excited to be able to continue her story with our real-life Wonder Women — Gal and Patty — who will return to conclude the long-planned theatrical trilogy,” the statement read.",
            "As for when we’ll pick up with Diana in the new film, Jenkins has already made it clear that she’s not interested in “doing another period piece” after setting her first film in World War 1 and its sequel in the ’80s.",
            "“I’m not pining to put it in the past again, because where are you going to go? I think it would be weird,” she said in a Hollywood Reporter interview last year. “You have to go forward. It’s definitely a contemporary story. That’s all I can say. And so where we put it and how that gets figured out, I haven’t totally nailed down.”",
            "Jenkins previously revealed that she does already have a story idea for Diana’s next adventure, explaining on a podcast earlier this month that she and co-writer Geoff Johns have a script that they’re “super fired up about.”",
            "“I’ve never felt this way before as much as I do now. I don’t think I’m doing it next, and so I sort of have to wait and see where we are in the world,” she said on the Reelblend Podcast about the franchise’s future. “It’s interesting. What I wanted to talk about in (“Wonder Woman 1984”) was very prescient to what I was feeling, and what you were feeling, was coming. So now? I’m not sure. So much has changed in the world. I still love the story that we came up with. I’m sure that parts of it would come over to it. But I’m trying to say, ‘Don’t decide.’ Don’t fall in love with anything. See ‘What would Wonder Woman do now?’ What are you craving Wonder Woman to do in this world?”",
            "A modern-day setting likely doesn’t bode well for the return of Chris Pine, who reprised his role as Diana’s love interest Steve Trevor in the recently released sequel. Despite meeting his end in the first film, Trevor miraculously returns in “Wonder Woman 1984,” after (spoilers ahead!) Diana wishes her love back to life when she comes in possession of the powerful Dreamstone.",
            "But Steve’s resurrection comes at a cost for Diana, who begins to lose her powers. Ultimately, she decides to renounce her wish and lose him all over again, making Pine’s future appearance in the franchise highly unlikely.",
            "However, Kristen Wiig’s Barbara Minerva, who becomes the villainous Cheetah by the end of the current film, could pop up again in the third movie. Jenkins said she purposefully left the door open for the character’s potential return.",
            "“I have my reasons for making it ambiguous, and I think it’s not clear what her point of view [is] on everything that just happened,” Jenkins said in a recent interview with Den of Geek. “The truth is there may or may not be more to come [for Barbara].”",
            "But before Jenkins tackles the third “Wonder Woman” film, she is set to direct a new “Star Wars” movie titled “Rogue Squadron, scheduled to debut in theaters in December of 2023.",
            "The director and Gadot are also keeping busy with a new take on Cleopatra at Paramount, with a Deadline report claiming production is on an “accelerated timetable.”",
            "With no release date set in stone (dream or otherwise), don’t expect to see “Wonder Woman 3” anytime soon."

            "Dining in an igloo-like bubble on the sidewalks of New York City is probably not something anyone predicted doing in 2020. But that’s just one of the many ways businesses have had to pivot in this COVID-19 world. Restaurants have been hit hard by the pandemic ― according to the National Restaurant Association, it’s estimated that 100,000, or 1 in 6, restaurants in the U.S. closed six months into the global pandemic. The service industry is projected to lose $240 billion in 2020.",
            "Moving into 2021, there’s no doubt the industry will continue to change and adapt new measures to stay afloat. That can include increased prices, virtual experiences and even noticeable differences in the age of servers. HuffPost spoke to industry insiders, chefs and owners to find out what they’re predicting we’ll see in the new year and beyond.",
            "Beautified outdoor dining spaces",
            "Some restaurants have had the privilege and square footage to set up outdoor dining areas. But more establishments will have to work extra hard to set the proper atmosphere so diners don’t just feel like they’re having a meal on the sidewalk or a parking lot, said Dan Rowe, the CEO of Fransmart, a franchise development company behind the likes of Five Guys, The Halal Guys and more.",
            "It’s key to have “an outdoor area that looks and feels like inside,” he told HuffPost. He cited celebrity-favorite Brooklyn Chop House in New York as an example, as the restaurant was “able to convert several outdoor parking spaces into tented and heated seating that still very much feels clubby, hip, and on-brand.”",
            "Making the outside both look and feel like the inside will continue to be key for many restaurants — and it’s easier said than done. Even basics like canopies and heaters can eat up a chunk of money.",
            "“Business will be slower as fewer diners will want to brave the cold weather to have a meal,” said Shanny Covey, owner of Robin’s in Cambria, California, and Luna Red, which has been a San Luis Obispo staple for a decade. “Restaurants will have to do the math to figure out if it’ll be worth [it] to stay open for dine in.”",
            "A noticeable change in what staff looks like",
            "There’s no dining ― inside, outdoors or takeout ― without a dedicated staff. The restaurant industry has been friendly to younger employees who may be less experienced or in need of a flexible schedule, but Matt Greene, executive chef of Common House in Charlottesville and Richmond, Virginia, said this might change.",
            "“I think we’ll see fewer younger service professionals entering the industry,” he said. “The restaurant industry won’t hold the same appeal of easy money in a fun, fast-paced environment. Until we’re on the other end of the pandemic, the work will be characterized by greater output for a lower return.”",
            "But Carole MacDonal of La Cosecha Bar + Restaurant and Il Cortile Ristorante, both in Paso Robles, also sees the current industry being less than appealing for some older, more experienced pros.",
            "“I do find the ‘veterans’ are burning out at a faster rate than younger servers. We are experiencing a few older, experienced employees leaving the business altogether and going toward employment that does not have anything to do with customer service,” said MacDonal, whose restaurants have collectively been in business for almost two decades.",
            "Say goodbye to automatic surcharges, and hello to menu increases",
            "Earlier in the pandemic, there was talk about restaurants adding a COVID-19 surcharge to recoup expenses. These received mixed responses, and everyone we talked to agreed surcharges are probably something we’ll see less and less of.",
            "“Customers don’t like being talked at,” Rowe said about automatic charges that can discourage people from supporting a restaurant. MacDonal agreed: “I would love to add a small COVID-19 surcharge to every check to cover the cost of propane alone, but in places that have tried, it is not well-accepted.”",
            "But that doesn’t mean customers won’t see some prices going up in other ways.",
            "“I think the best way to help the additional costs is to raise prices a small amount to cover those costs,” MacDonal said. These increases allow restaurants to cover some expenses without drawing so much overt attention to forced charges.",
            "Menu items will reflect the climate, literally and figuratively",
            "Staff turnover and price increases might be pretty obvious, but some experts also see a change in what foods people gravitate toward.",
            "“Guests have consistently steered away from adventurous or unfamiliar foods,” Greene said. “The general dining public wants to be comfortable. They want to know what they are getting and they want it to feel good. No education or thinking required.”",
            "He also noted that restaurants, particularly those offering outdoor dining, will have to adapt menus so they offer foods that are well-suited to colder climates — things like stews and soups, but also grits, tamales, polenta, baked pasta and braised lamb shanks.",
            "“The menus will also need to offer food that holds temperature for longer as well as food that warms the body and soul,” Greene said. “Ideally you’re looking for a reasonably high water content and a high fat content. The fat plays a big part in holding the heat.”",
            "Takeout and delivery will cost restaurants more money",
            "Some cities have shut down indoor dining or limited occupancy, and some people just don’t feel comfortable dining inside. Takeout and delivery will continue to be important, but require extra costs and creativity.",
            "Establishments that may have previously focused on in-house dining will have no choice but to factor in the expense of to-go orders, Rowe said.",
            "“It’s a new line item in the [profit and loss] that needs to be taken seriously and highly focused on,” he said of the additional, but now necessary, costs of providing meals and packaging that still feels in line with the brand.",
            "“Takeout and ghost kitchens will continue to thrive and it will be a significant revenue stream for all restaurants, so it will be important to embrace this trend out of necessity,” Covey said.",
            "But she noted this will mean more waste and even more money.",
            "“I strongly believe that restaurants need to take the lead in using more sustainable options for takeout,” she said. “The conflict with this decision is that eco-friendly packaging is more expensive and restaurants are already having to shoulder the burden of much higher costs for [PPE] supplies.”",
            "In addition to restaurants crunching the numbers, she said, there might be a push for collaboration or education from local waste companies on proper ways to reduce, reuse and recycle.",
            "Virtual experiences that foster a connection",
            "And finally, for the people who want a dining experience in their own home, establishments may lean in to selling pre-packaged kits for virtual events.",
            "Common House has regular virtual events like cookie decorating classes and whisky tastings. Members of the social club pick up what they need for the event ahead of time.",
            "“Accessibility, comfort and perceived value are where the trends are headed,” Greene said.",
            "These virtual gatherings also allow customers to have contact, albeit virtual, with chefs and owners who may have typically remained behind the scenes. One of Greene’s favorite events was a pizza class he taught from his personal kitchen.",
            "“My wife, two kids and the dog were all there,” he said. “It felt like hosting a family pizza night, tantrums and burnt tongues included. The imperfections and real-life glimpses into everyone’s homes and lives made it incredibly authentic.”"

But while things are looking up— the COVID-19 vaccine is rolling out, the presidential election nightmare is over ― it’s important to know that when the clock strikes midnight on Dec. 31, the problems of 2020 will not just go poof.",
            "For many of us, 2021 will still come with questions riddled with strife: When can businesses safely reopen or how can people survive without having a job? How can we continue to address racial injustices? How can we give kids as much structure as possible? When can we stop being so isolated from each other?",
            "The answers, unfortunately, won’t materialize right away. Jagdish Khubchandani, a professor of public health at New Mexico State University, said that, in terms of the pandemic, there’s still a lot that needs to happen before things can go back to “normal.” Until then, we’re likely going to have to keep doing what we’re doing: wearing masks, practicing physical distancing, avoiding large gatherings ― you know the drill.",

            "“This mentality paints the world in black in white ― this year was either ‘all good’ or ‘all bad,’” she explained.",
            "By focusing on the negative from this year, Dowd said we negate or minimize any potential positives ― and set next year up on a pedestal it likely won’t be able to stand on for long. A more productive way to look at 2021 is to acknowledge that, like most things in life, the year will hold both positive and negative outcomes.",
            "“This mentality gives us space for the year to hold some good while increasing resiliency for the bad,” she explained. It can also help us manage expectations and ward off potential feelings of helplessness that may arise whenever 2021 inevitably brings challenges.",

            "“While it can be helpful to think about 2021 as a reset, that mindset is only relevant to what you have control over. The reset needs to be a mental one,” said Heather Z. Lyons, a therapist in Baltimore and co-founder of WithTherapy.com.",

Even taking a few minutes to connect with what’s going on inside your body and tuning in to what’s going on around in the moment can help. Notice your surroundings and mentally label everything you see, hear, feel as you come across it.",
            "“If we take short breaks to connect with what’s happening right now in the present, it makes us feel more anchored and grounded in dealing with what’s ahead,” Williams said.",
            "Another way to practice mindfulness is to hop into tasks that take your full engagement or put you in a “flow state,” Vannucci said.",
            "Try binge-watching shows you love, playing video games, reading, cooking or knitting. “Anything that engages you so that you don’t notice time passing is a flow activity,” she said.",

            "Maybe you tried your hand at making bread and it wasn’t for you. Perhaps you attempted to learn a new language and gave up after one lesson. If those activities weren’t for you, that’s fine. Just find something that immerses you ― even if that’s spending hours watching mindless reality TV and live-tweeting it. It’s not necessarily about being productive; it’s about finding joy.",
            "“This is a really important time to create meaning in order to ward off depression,” Lear said.",

            "“We’re hard-wired to be in physical contact with others, and that’s largely been taken away from us now. However, patience is required as we adjust to a new way of life that will likely be around for a while,” she said.",
            "Easier said than done, of course. Don’t feel bad if you haven’t been nailing this. Part of being patient overall is extending yourself some grace in moments when you’re not.",
            "“We need to forgive ourselves for being impatient at times,” Lyons said.",

            "What’s changed is that the pandemic has made that reality more salient, she said. Think of it this way: You’ve made it through 100% of the times in your past where you didn’t have control. You’re still here. Remind yourself of that fact, and accept that you will have to ― and can ― continue to deal with uncertainty in life.",
            "“We can continue to live with this unknown by introducing an attitude of acceptance, which serves as an antidote to a false sense of control, into our lives,” Artz said. “When we look forward to 2021 with acceptance, we’re not surrendering complete control, we’re just more realistically evaluating where we have actual control. Mask wearing? Yes. Social distancing? Yes.”",
            "Start preparing now.",
            "According to Fulton, the best way to limit stress going into 2021 is to start working on taking care of yourself today. She suggested practicing self-care by strengthening your relationships, moving your body in a way that feels good, setting boundaries, taking a hard look at your finances, or whatever else you need to do to feel like you’re ready to tackle a new year.",

And after the year we’ve all just had, thinking about any kind of self-improvement right now seems, well, absurd. Just doing what you need to do to get through the day is plenty in 2021. More than enough, really. A-plus.",
            "But if you like making New Year’s resolutions and feel committed to doing so this year, new research published in the journal PLOS One offers a surprisingly simple tweak that could help you reach your goals.",

            "That’s because it’s hard — if not nearly impossible — to “erase a behavior, but you can replace it with something else,” study author Per Carlbring said in a press release discussing his team’s recent findings.",
            "In 2017, the researchers recruited more than 1,000 people and encouraged them to make their own New Year’s resolutions. The participants were divided into three groups. One got no support at all, one got some support, and one had regular support throughout the year. Ultimately, the researchers found that it didn’t really matter much which group participants were sorted into.",
            "“What surprised us were the results on how to phrase your resolution,” Carlbring said.",
            "Nearly 60% of those who embraced what the researchers call an “approach goal” succeeded, compared to 47% of those who had “avoidance goals.”",
            "That’s not necessarily a huge difference, but the researchers say their study — which they believe to be the largest on New Year’s resolutions to date — provides a simple, actionable technique for anyone interested in making a change.",
            "“It doesn’t surprise me that framing resolutions more as working toward a positive outcome seems to be slightly more successful,” Lynn Bufka, the associate executive director for practice research and policy at the American Psychological Association, told HuffPost. (She did not work on the study.)",
            "Bufka said the findings are in line with what researchers understand about goal-setting from the clinical world: Positive framing is helpful, as is establishing really specific goals. She also offered an example from her own life. In an effort to cut down on sweets, she has committed to eating five servings of fruits and vegetables a day. She’s not necessarily eliminating anything from her diet, but she is finding ways to sneak in more nutrition.",
            "But all that said, experts really do warn against pushing yourself too hard as we head into 2021.",
            "“For those who are choosing to make resolutions this year, I’d really encourage them to be realistic and kind to themselves,” Bufka said. “Many people are already pretty depleted, and don’t have the energy and cognitive resources to tackle significant change.”",
            "So maybe this coming year, try something along the lines of: In 2021, I will start to be gentle with myself — whatever that means to you. Or, if the idea of a resolution is too much to even fathom, save this advice for another time and sit this one out. No one would blame you."

            "Trump administration officials were saying just a few weeks ago that 20 million Americans could be vaccinated against COVID-19 by year’s end. Now here we are, and only 2.1 million people have gotten shots, according to the latest figures from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
            "Even allowing for a lag in the reporting of data, the final numbers for 2020 will be well short of the administration’s goal, as Operation Warp Speed officials have acknowledged.",
            "The question going forward is what the failure represents. Is it nothing more than the predictable, ultimately temporary early difficulties that come with such a complex and massive undertaking — or a sign that vaccine distribution is about to become a major failure, just like testing and the distribution of personal protective equipment were earlier in the pandemic?",
            "Over the past week, HuffPost put that question to a group of experts, including some who have been working with federal, state and local officials throughout the COVID-19 crisis. And nobody seemed quite sure of the answer.",
            "Most said patience was important. Vaccine distribution was bound to be difficult in the United States because of our chronically underfunded public health infrastructure, our dispersed and diverse population, and the way we divide power between federal and state government. Not surprisingly, the country leading the world in per capita COVID-19 vaccinations is Israel, which has none of those problems.",
            "But the U.S. is also behind the United Kingdom, and now that vaccinations have started in the European Union as well, it’s likely other countries will overtake us. A big reason, experts agree, is that the overwhelming focus of Operation Warp Speed was on producing the vaccines and shipping them from factories, and not what comes after.",
            "The ‘Last Mile’ Of Distribution May Be The Toughest",
            "The Trump administration left most of the planning for the “last mile” of distribution almost entirely to state and local public health departments, which were already overwhelmed dealing with the pandemic. And although those agencies are about to get a funding boost, thanks to the COVID-19 relief package that Congress passed and Trump signed this week, the agencies needed that money months ago.",
            "“We’ve had a slow start on distribution in most of the U.S. ― a result of insufficient support and belated attention to the nitty-gritty of getting the vaccines from the freezers into people’s arms,” Joshua Michaud, associate director for global health policy at the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, told HuffPost.",
            "Jason Schwartz, a health policy professor at Yale specializing in vaccine policy, was even blunter. “It’s been striking to me, for months, that there hasn’t been every bit as much urgency and attention to how we actually get a vaccine to a few hundred million people … as there has been to the research and development of the vaccine itself,” he said.",
            "Some parts of the country are doing better than others, as a recent state-by-state survey from Bloomberg found.",
            "West Virginia, for example, has already delivered shots to its entire nursing home population, according to officials there. In Maine, a state whose vaccination rate is also among the nation’s best, the detailed, ready-to-go delivery plans included acquiring dry ice from seafood supply companies. In Florida, by contrast, seniors in one county are camping out overnight on lawn chairs because officials there decided to offer vaccines through mass clinics on a first-come, first-serve basis.",
            "States will learn best practices from each other, experts predicted, and they will work through some of the early kinks, especially when it comes to uncertainty over who should get the vaccine when. As soon as that happens, the pace of vaccination is likely to pick up.",
            "But there is more to be done, especially at the federal level, because in many ways, this initial phase of vaccine distribution is the easy part. Front-line medical workers and people living or working in long-term care facilities can be vaccinated with relatively minimal outreach and organization. Getting shots to the rest of the country is going to be a lot more difficult.",
            "“These problems are still correctable,” said Juliette Kayyem, a former federal and state homeland security official who is now a senior lecturer at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government. “It’s really important that we not rush to judgment about how this is going. It’s also really important we fix the problems as quickly as possible.”",
            "Vaccinating The American Public Is A Daunting Challenge",
            "Figuring out how to vaccinate the full U.S. population against COVID-19 begins with some arithmetic. There are more than 330 million people here, and establishing “herd immunity” requires reaching at least 75% of them, according to the prevailing consensus among scientists.",
            "That’s roughly 250 million people, and as long as the U.S. relies on vaccines that require two doses, 500 million shots. Reaching the entire population ― or at least getting close, which is the ultimate goal ― would require more like 660 million shots.",
            "Nobody knows for sure how many shots the U.S. can provide at this point, but Topher Spiro, vice president for health policy at the Center for American Progress, helped to put together the estimate that was circulating on Capitol Hill as Congress negotiated over the COVID-19 relief package.",
            "Based on available data from flu vaccines, peak capacity is around 70 million shots a month, Spiro said. That includes the shots delivered in pharmacies and private physician offices, as well as employer pop-up clinics, government-run vaccination centers, and other venues. Claire Hannan, executive director of the Association of Immunization Managers, told HuffPost the 70 million figure seems about right.",
            "At that pace, it would take six or seven months to reach herd immunity, potentially putting it within reach by summer, though it would depend on how long ramping up to that full capacity takes. It would take another few months after that to reach nearly the entire population.",
            "But those figures are based on a vaccine that is more straightforward to administer than the COVID-19 shots are. With the flu shot, there’s no need to make sure people are signed up for follow-up doses, for starters, and less need for counseling because people are familiar with it. There’s also no need for social distancing while flu shots are being given.",
            "And it’s not just the sheer number of people to vaccinate that represents a big challenge. It’s also the difficulty of reaching those in rural and low-income communities ― especially when it comes to the Pfizer vaccine, which requires ultra-cold storage typically unavailable outside of major health care facilities. Another issue with Pfizer’s vaccine is that it ships in boxes of 975 doses. Some rural areas won’t need that many and nobody wants to waste vaccine supply.",
            "When you take all of those factors into account, achieving herd immunity by summer starts to seem a lot more difficult ― unless, somehow, the United States can figure out a way to deliver vaccines a lot more quickly.",
            "States Made Plans But Needed More Federal Help",
            "Figuring out how to vaccinate the public has been a topic of conversation for months and, at the CDC’s direction, states and territories submitted formal distribution plans in October.",
            "Many of those plans use existing flu vaccination programs as the starting point. They rely primarily on existing private providers like doctors’ offices and pharmacies, then fill in the gaps with some combination of mass vaccination centers and drive-through clinics. They also call for increasing the number of people who can administer the vaccine, whether through training, tapping volunteers or calling up the National Guard ― an option that the Trump administration just made easier for governors by issuing some new regulatory guidance.",
            "Some vaccination plans mention using strategies that states have developed through biological disaster drills. Others talk about building on the infrastructure states have created for COVID-19 testing, and at least one state, Pennsylvania, has already tested drive-through vaccination clinics that would operate the same way its drive-through testing sites have.",
            "But the state plans are generally not specific, as researchers at ProPublica and the Kaiser Family Foundation found in a pair of investigations. The plans didn’t typically have figures on the number of free-standing clinics they would have to set up, for example, or how many new vaccinators they might have to train.",
            "Some of this was by necessity. In early fall, when officials were putting the plans together, they still didn’t know for sure which vaccines would be ready first or precisely which groups of people the federal government would recommend vaccinating first. State and local health departments were also inundated with other coronavirus-related tasks, like contact tracing, and they were desperate for money.",
            "That is precisely why the federal government should have taken more aggressive action, experts now say. Had the federal government been on top of things, these experts told HuffPost, it could have helped with tasks like setting up a nationwide online registry, both for the sake of documenting who got the vaccines and sending out reminders for second doses ― something that states are now doing on their own.",
            "“You see pictures of people holding up cards saying that I got vaccinated today and that’s great, but what year are we living in?” said Richard Serino, former deputy administrator at the Federal Emergency Management Agency and director of emergency services in Boston. “I’m not a techie, but something tells me that we can do better than giving people a card.”",
            "More importantly, perhaps, the federal government could have provided better guidance on how to construct clinics or mobile units ― specifying, for example, how many people it would take if you include counseling, data entry and actual administration of the shots. “It’s everything down to the floor plans,” said Serino. “This is how people can flow through in an hour, how many staff you need per 1,000 people, and so on.”",
            "Not all states would have used these plans, just as many states have modified federal guidance on who should get shots when. But with ready-to-go schematics ― and, ideally, money to start acquiring equipment and training extra personnel ― states could have been putting systems in place months ago so they were ready to go once the supply arrived.",
            "“In the same way that the CDC should have provided better guidance about school re-openings and masking, it could have provided guidance on administering the vaccine,” said Kayyem. “A functioning federal government provides a floor, for the minimum that has to be accomplished, and then it provides the resources to do it. That’s all the federal government had to do when it came to COVID, and it didn’t do that, so now we’re stuck.”",
            "The States And Feds Still Have Time",
            "An essential caveat is that, among developed countries, the U.S. is among the least well-equipped for mass vaccination delivery. The lack of a truly universal health care system means large portions of the population have tenuous or no connection to health care providers. A lack of spending on public health infrastructure has left local agencies without the staff they need to do their jobs in ordinary times, let alone in the middle of a crisis.",
            "“Given the circumstances, and given the funding over the last 10 years for public health, you could argue it’s amazing where we are,” Hannan said.",
            "And it’s not too late to make things better. It will be a few weeks before the vaccine supply really ramps up and becomes available to people outside the highest-priority groups. That’s enough time to find and train new vaccinators, or to make arrangements for paying existing vaccinators to do more. It’s also enough time to set up new facilities, acquire equipment and make arrangements for public clinics.",
            "On Tuesday, President-elect Joe Biden indicated that his team was already thinking about this. In a speech attacking the Trump administration for the slow vaccine distribution, Biden said his administration would “work to set up vaccination sites and send mobile units to hard-to-reach communities.”",
            "But Biden didn’t specify what, exactly, that will entail, and it will be three more weeks before he and his team take charge. Until then, it looks like the success of delivery will depend heavily on local and state officials’ ability to make adjustments on the fly and expand capacity now that federal funding is finally on the way.",
            "“States will learn as they go and the pace of distribution will surely accelerate,” Michaud said. But, he also noted, “we’ll be playing catch-up for a while.”",

            "Olivia Chaffin, a Girl Scout in rural Tennessee, was a top cookie seller in her troop when she first heard rainforests were being destroyed to make way for ever-expanding palm oil plantations. On one of those plantations a continent away, 10-year-old Ima helped harvest the fruit that makes its way into a dizzying array of products sold by leading Western food and cosmetics brands.",
            "Ima is among the estimated tens of thousands of children often working alongside their parents in Indonesia and Malaysia, which supply 85% of the world’s most consumed vegetable oil. An Associated Press investigation found most earn little or no pay and are routinely exposed to toxic chemicals and other hazardous conditions. Some never go to school or learn to read and write. Others are smuggled across borders and left vulnerable to trafficking or sexual abuse.",
            "The AP used U.S. Customs records and the most recently published data from producers, traders and buyers to trace the fruits of their labor from the processing mills where palm kernels were crushed to the supply chains of many popular kids’ cereals, candies and ice creams sold by Nestle, Unilever, Kellogg’s, PepsiCo and many other leading food companies, including Ferrero – one of the two makers of Girl Scout cookies.",
            "Olivia, who earned a badge for selling more than 600 boxes of cookies, had spotted palm oil as an ingredient on the back of one of her packages, but was relieved to see a green tree logo next to the words “certified sustainable.” She assumed that meant her Thin Mints and Tagalongs weren’t harming rainforests, orangutans or those harvesting the orange-red palm fruit.",
            "But later, the whip-smart 11-year-old saw the word “mixed” on the label and quickly learned it meant exactly what she feared: Sustainable palm oil had been blended with oil from unsustainable sources. To her, that meant the cookies she was peddling were tainted.",
            "Thousands of miles away in Indonesia, Ima led her class in math and dreamed of becoming a doctor. Then her father made her quit school to help meet his high company targets on the palm oil plantation where she was born. Instead of attending fourth grade, she squatted in the unrelenting heat, snatching up the loose kernels littering the ground.",
            "She sometimes worked 12 hours a day, wearing only flip flops and no gloves, crying when the fruit’s razor-sharp spikes bloodied her hands or scorpions stung her fingers. The loads she carried went to one of the very mills feeding into the supply chain of Olivia’s cookies.",

            "With little or no access to daycare, some young children in both countries follow their parents to the fields. In some cases, an entire family may earn less in a day than a $5 box of Girl Scout Do-si-dos.",
            "“For 100 years, families have been stuck in a cycle of poverty and they know nothing else than work on a palm oil plantation,” said researcher Kartika Manurung, who has published reports detailing labor issues on Indonesian plantations.",
            "The AP’s investigation into child labor is part of a broader in-depth look at the industry that also exposed rape, forced labor trafficking and slavery. Reporters crisscrossed Malaysia and Indonesia, speaking to more than 130 current and former workers ― some two dozen of them child laborers – at nearly 25 companies.",
            "Indonesian government officials said they do not know how many children work in the country’s massive palm oil industry. But the U.N.’s International Labor Organization has estimated 1.5 million children between 10 and 17 years old labor in its agricultural sector. Palm oil is one of the largest crops, employing some 16 million people.",
            "In much smaller neighboring Malaysia, a newly released government report estimated more than 33,000 children work in the industry there – nearly half of them between the ages of 5 and 11. That report did not directly address the tens of thousands of so-called “stateless” boys and girls living in the country with parents who came from bordering countries.",
            "An official from Malaysia’s Ministry of Plantation Industries and Commodities did not respond to repeated requests for comment, but Nageeb Wahab, head of the Malaysian Palm Oil Association, called allegations of child labor very serious and urged complaints to be reported to authorities.",
            "Soes Hindharno, an official from Indonesia’s Manpower Ministry, said he had not received any complaints about child labor occurring in his own country, but an official from the ministry that oversees women and children’s issues labeled it an area of growing concern.",
            "Many producers, Western buyers and banks belong to the 4,000-member Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, a global association that provides a green stamp of approval to those committed to dealing with palm oil that’s been certified as ethically sourced. The RSPO has a system in place to address grievances, including labor abuse allegations. But of the nearly 100 complaints listed on its case tracker in the last decade in the two Southeast Asian countries, only a handful have mentioned children.",
            "Dan Strechay, the RSPO’s global outreach and engagement director, said the association has started working with UNICEF and others to educate members about what constitutes child labor.",
            "Palm oil is contained in roughly half the products on supermarket shelves and in almost three out of every four cosmetic brands, and many kids are introduced to it the day they’re born – it’s a primary fat in infant formula. As they grow, it’s present in many of their favorite foods: It’s in their Pop-Tarts and Cap’n Crunch cereal, Oreo cookies, KitKat candy bars, Magnum ice cream, doughnuts and even bubble gum.",
            "Olivia is not the first Girl Scout to raise questions about the way palm oil makes its way into the cookies. More than a decade ago, two girls in a Michigan troop campaigned against its use, leading the Girl Scouts of the USA to join the RSPO and agree to start using sustainable palm oil, adding the green tree logo to its roughly 200 million boxes of cookies, which bring in nearly $800 million annually.",
            "The Girl Scouts did not respond to questions from the AP, directing reporters to the two bakers that make the cookies ― Little Brownie Bakers in Kentucky and ABC Bakers in Virginia. Those companies and their parent corporations, Ferrero and Weston Foods respectively, also did not comment on the findings. But both said they were committed to sourcing only certified sustainable palm oil.",
            "When contacted by the AP, other companies affirmed their support of human rights for all workers, with some noting they rely on their suppliers to meet industry standards and abide by local laws. If evidence of wrongdoing is found, some said they would immediately cut ties with producers.",
            "“We aim to prevent and address the issue of child labor wherever it occurs in our supply chain,” said Nestle, maker of KitKat candy bars. And Kellogg’s, the parent company of Pop-Tarts, said it was committed to working with suppliers to source “fully traceable palm oil.” There was no response from Mondelez, which owns Oreo cookies, or Cap’n Crunch parent company PepsiCo.",
            "Now 14, Olivia, who lives in Jonesborough, Tennessee, has started a petition to get palm oil removed from Girl Scout cookies. And she’s stopped selling them.",
            "“I thought Girl Scouts was supposed to be about making the world a better place,” she said. “But this isn’t at all making the world better.”"

            "In my home, there was a baby to keep us busy. It would be fair, I think, to say that my reading and other cultural consumption habits were obliterated by pandemic parenting. Every day I’d gaze wistfully at my to-read stacks, but when I’d snatch 15 minutes to open a long-anticipated novel, the words would swirl in front of my bleary eyes.

            "“Temporary” by Hilary Leichter",
            "Instead of a job, the young woman at the heart of “Temporary” has a perpetual stream of temp gigs: door opener, chairman of the board, pirate. Instead of a boyfriend, she has boyfriend fragments: a handy boyfriend, a culinary boyfriend, a tallest boyfriend. Instead of a life, she has the dream of one, the stable existence she knows would be hers if she ever became a permanent employee. Her mother coaches the young woman like a workplace mentor and disapproves of her special affection for one of her boyfriends: a temporary worker can’t afford any permanent distractions. The novel’s episodic form and deadpan blend of surrealism and corporate euphemism allow for a funny, tender exploration of how our job and employment status encroaches on other parts of our life and identities. Leichter plays lightly with language and metaphor, building a world that gives concrete form to the economic and social precarity that shapes so many people’s lives today.",
            "“Real Life” by Brandon Taylor",
            "Taylor’s debut is of a rare and vital sort: It examines the social relations that govern how we mostly interact with each other while also ripping off the polite filter to expose the seething emotions underneath. Wallace, a quiet biochemistry grad student at a Midwestern university, has recently lost his father, with whom he had a difficult relationship. At the lab, someone has sabotaged his latest batch of nematodes. With his mostly white friends, well-meaning but often careless, he’s guarded. As the novel unfolds, Wallace finds himself entangled in an unexpected romance with a straight friend while the situation at the lab, despite his determination not to make waves, spirals. Taylor’s grip on the subtle movements of the human heart and psyche is masterful, as is his prose; every word in “Real Life” feels intentional and every sentence perfectly calibrated.",
            "“The Unreality of Memory” by Elisa Gabbert",
            "Gabbert’s essay collection, a ramble through the scary, the uncanny and the unsettling, made an ideal companion reading to 2020. In essays about disaster and disaster movies, the fear of massive objects, the Trump presidency, the slipperiness of memory and the present moment, and more, the poet and critic opens up side doors, windows and trapdoors in the way we think about each topic. Reading her thoughts on slow disasters like climate change or eerily relevant ones like pandemics often left me shaken, but with a newly enriched understanding of how we, as humans, experience crisis and make sense of our fragile lives.",
            "“The Glass Hotel” by Emily St. John Mandel",
            "This year, I finally read Mandel’s breakout hit, “Station Eleven,” set in the aftermath of a devastating pandemic — and her new novel, which is no less dazzling. Vincent, a troubled girl from a tiny town on Vancouver Island, grows up to work in the opulent Hotel Caiette nearby, where she meets a wealthy investor. Years later, while working as a chef on a ship, she tumbles overboard. Her life in between is chameleonic, difficult to trace. Mandel’s characters, and the worlds they occupy, are cool and remote, demanding and rewarding close attention. Economic catastrophe is Mandel’s central subject in “The Glass Hotel,” which revolves around a Ponzi scheme and the financial crash of 2008, but the novel is a prismatic depiction of public crisis and private pain, moral luck and collective culpability, and the ripple effects of suffering.",
            "“Parakeet” by Marie-Helene Bertino",
            "Perhaps the least romantic novel about a bride I’ve ever read, “Parakeet” takes place in the week before the protagonist’s wedding. As she attempts, at her fiancé’s request, to get into a better mental state before the big day, she’s visited by her late grandmother in the form of a parakeet. Her parakeet grandmother has a request of her own: that she reconnect with her brother, a playwright currently staging a work based on the bride’s past traumas. The ghostly parakeet is just the first fantastical element in a dreamlike quest for familial connection and healing. By turns goofily funny and agonizingly raw, Bertino’s bewitchingly chaotic novel captures the senses of dislocation and fragmentation that can accompany profound suffering, and the urgent search for stability in the wake of trauma.",
            "“Death in Her Hands” by Ottessa Moshfegh",
            "Moshfegh’s latest lacks the smooth assuredness of her breakout works “Eileen” and “My Year of Rest and Relaxation.” But this sometimes wobbly, palpably anxious novel is one of the books that has stuck with me most since reading it this spring. Vesta Gul, an elderly widow, discovers a note in the woods near her house while walking her dog. “Her name was Magda,” it reads. “Nobody will ever know who killed her. It wasn’t me. Here is her dead body.” There’s no body (so, one would think, no crime), but Vesta quickly becomes convinced that the slaying is real ― and consumed by her hunt for the killer. A sort of meta murder mystery, “Death in Her Hands” evolves into a searching portrait of grief, loneliness and the comforts of storytelling.",
            "“Luster” by Raven Leilani",
            "Several of the best books I read this year were about young people eking out precarious or marginal lives for themselves, and of these, “Luster” is the most immersed in the demoralizing details of financial desperation and social isolation. Edie, who works as a managing editorial coordinator at a children’s imprint and harbors unfulfilled artistic aspirations, is young, frustrated and underpaid. She has flings at the office, which end up backfiring on her; she gets involved with an older, married white man in a fraught open relationship with his wife. Somehow she becomes deeply enmeshed in the couple’s life only to realize that the other woman wants her to help them parent their adopted adolescent daughter, who, like Edie, is Black. Though her voice is disaffected, even cynical, Edie’s sensitivity is acute. She turns to food delivery apps to make money after losing her job, accepts the offer of a guest room at her lover’s Jersey home and tries to keep her expectations low, but her yearning to be truly seen leaps off the page — a yearning that is continually met with the realization those around her, when they see her, see her mostly as a means to an end.",
            "“Leave the World Behind” by Rumaan Alam",
            "As wake-ups go, Alam’s apocalyptic vacation novel is akin to sitting bolt upright in the middle of the night, convinced that something is terribly awry. An upper-middle-class white family heads out to a rental mansion on Long Island for a getaway, where they watch TV and gorge on ice cream and hamburgers. The vacation has barely begun when an elderly Black couple shows up at the door, saying they’re the owners of the house and that they’ve fled from New York City after a mysterious event. The two families, isolated together in a summer idyll, receive more and more disturbing hints that a catastrophe has befallen the region, if not the world, but see no path forward but to continue relaxing by the pool and making indulgent meals. It’s a harrowing story of modern life, in which the consumerist excesses of the American elite are juxtaposed, to chilling effect, against the existential threats to human life as we know it.",
            "“Red Pill” by Hari Kunzru",
            "The narrator of “Red Pill,” a happily married writer working on a vaguely conceived book about lyric poetry, is having a midlife crisis. Unable to finish his new book, he applies to a residency at the Deuter Center, an institute near Berlin. Once there, he discovers a catch: The center turns out to be a panopticon, where all the visiting scholars have their keystrokes logged and work in glass offices so that their productivity can be tracked. Plagued by his own anxieties and paranoid of his surroundings, he spends his time watching a graphically violent cop show and beginning to decipher what he believes are hidden messages from the show’s writer. The boundaries between reality and his own troubled fantasies become blurred until he feels he must take action. Though the denouement feels a bit pat, Kunzru’s portrait of a man and a world in crisis thrums with tension, viscerally evoking the real and imagined horrors that can seep through the cracks to threaten the tidy lives we construct for ourselves.",
            "“The Office of Historical Corrections” by Danielle Evans",
            "Evans is a writer with a gift for the sudden knife in the ribs. Her stories start out calm, almost matter-of-fact. The women she writes about seem to examine the situations they find themselves in with some detachment, though with varying degrees of insight. The scenarios range from the slyly funny to the poignant: In one, a photojournalist at a male friend’s wedding tries to make nice with his suspicious bride; in another, a white college student becomes the focus of a firestorm on campus after a picture of her in a Confederate flag bikini is posted on social media; in a third, a young woman finds a toddler abandoned on a bus and begins to care for him like a mother. When I least expected it, Evans would deliver a brutal twist, a new revelation of the wounds people live with. There’s always something buried beneath the surface, something broken or sinister or simply embarrassing. I hurtled through these stories and ended each one gasping back tears."

Lombardy still accounts for around a third of the dead in Italy, which has the continent’s worst confirmed virus toll at nearly 72,000 dead.",
            "“Today is a beautiful, symbolic day: All the citizens of Europe together are starting to get their vaccinations, the first ray of light after a long night,” Arcuri told reporters.",

            "The vaccine developed by Germany’s BioNTech and American drugmaker Pfizer started arriving in super-cold containers at EU hospitals on Friday from a factory in Belgium. Each country was only getting a fraction of the doses needed — fewer than 10,000 in the first batches — with the bigger rollout expected in January when more vaccines become available. All those getting shots Sunday will need to come back for a second dose in three weeks.",

            "Altogether, the EU’s 27 nations have recorded at least 16 million coronavirus infections and more than 336,000 deaths — huge numbers that experts say still understate the true toll of the pandemic due to missed cases and limited testing.",

            "In France, where many question the safety of vaccines, the French government has been cautious in its messaging and keen to ensure that it is not seen as forcing vaccinations on the public. France’s first vaccination at a nursing home in a poor area outside of Paris on Sunday was not broadcast on live television as it was elsewhere in Europe and no government ministers attended.",
            "“We didn’t need to convince her. She said ‘yes, I’m ready for anything to avoid getting this disease,’” said Dr. Samir Tine, head of geriatric services for the Sevran nursing home where France’s first vaccine shot went to 78-year-old Mauricette.",

            "Donald Trump’s presidency is ending in a few weeks. But the more than 230 people he put into lifetime federal judgeships will be shaping the nation’s law for decades.",
            "Trump will leave office having confirmed at least three Supreme Court justices, 54 appeals court judges, 174 district court judges and three judges for the U.S. Court of International Trade. The Senate could still confirm more of his court picks before he’s gone. All of these judges are Article III judges, meaning they have their jobs for life.",
            "How does his record compare to other recent presidents?",
            "In terms of sheer numbers, Trump confirmed more lifetime federal judges than presidents Barack Obama (175), George W. Bush (206) and Bill Clinton (204) did in their first terms.",
            "He couldn’t have done it without Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). Not only did the GOP leader make it his top priority to confirm Trump’s court picks ― he was even pushing them through as emergency COVID-19 relief legislation was stalling out ― but he actively delayed or blocked Obama’s judicial nominees for years, in an effort to keep court seats vacant for a future Republican president to fill. Trump did just that.",
            "“What McConnell has wanted is courts that will be here for decades after voters have rejected Republicans, if that’s what happens. Courts that would themselves be extremely activist in blowing up the welfare state and the ability of the federal government to do much of anything,” said Norm Ornstein, a resident scholar at American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. “How successful they’ll be, I’m not sure. But for the most part, this Supreme Court has given Trump whatever he wanted with regard to use of executive power.”",
            "Trump is also leaving office having filled almost every vacancy on an appeals court. It’s a remarkable feat; no other president has confirmed as many appeals court judges in a single term. Put another way: Nearly one in every three appeals court judges is now a Trump pick.",
            "“What we’ve seen is not just Trump appointing a lot of judges, which everybody talks about, but his bulldozer-like occupation with filling courts of appeals,” said Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow in the Brookings Institution’s Governance Studies Program and president of the nonpartisan think tank The Governance Institute. “They’re filling vacancies on district courts now because they don’t have any appeals court seats left to fill.”",
            "This was the plan all along. Trump’s White House spent years focused on confirming judges to the nation’s 13 appeals courts. These courts, which are just one step below the Supreme Court, don’t get the kind of flashy news coverage the highest court gets. But they are incredibly powerful, and they are where most federal law is settled on major issues like capital punishment, abortion, same-sex marriage and immigration.",
            "For some perspective, appeals courts resolve roughly 50,000 cases a year. The Supreme Court resolves about 100.",
            "It doesn’t mean President-elect Joe Biden won’t have any appeals court seats to fill. A number of Democrat-appointed appeals court judges have likely been waiting for Biden to become president before announcing their retirement, said Carl Tobias, a University of Richmond law professor and expert on judicial nominations.",
            "“It’s not as bleak as it might look,” said Tobias. “And it’s worth noting that even though Trump filled so many appellate court vacancies, two-thirds of those replaced Republicans. So it’s not as dramatic as if more Democratic appointees were replaced.”",
            "Still, he said, many of Trump’s judges are incredibly young, in their 30s and 40s, which means “you’re going to have some of these people around forever.”",
            "Trump’s judges are also incredibly homogenous, particularly his picks for appeals courts. Think dozens of clones of Vice President Mike Pence: white, male, right-wing ideologues. Not a single one of his 54 appeals court judges is Black.",
            "Ten of his nominees to lifetime federal court seats were rated not qualified by the American Bar Association. His most recent, now-U.S. district judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle, earned the abysmal rating because of her lack of experience. At 33, she doesn’t meet the ABA’s requirement that a nominee to a lifetime federal judgeship have at least 12 years of experience practicing law. Mizelle has been practicing law only since 2012, and has never tried a case ― civil or criminal ― as lead attorney or co-counsel.",
            "Of course, Trump didn’t pick these nominees himself. They were largely fed to him by The Federalist Society, a conservative legal organization that has been hugely invested in putting its members onto appeals courts and the Supreme Court. All three of Trump’s Supreme Court picks are Federalist Society members. Virtually all of his appeals court picks are members. A number of his district court picks are also members. And their resumes often include clerkships with other powerful judges who are ― wait for it ― members of the Federalist Society.",
            "Federal judges who are members of the The Federalist Society have something else in common, too: They tend to have records of being hostile to abortion rights, LGBTQ rights, voting rights and the Affordable Care Act.",
            "Biden is signaling he wants a more progressive and diverse federal bench, and has already promised to nominate a Black woman to the Supreme Court. His advisers say he’ll have a list of potential nominees ready by Inauguration Day, including a short list for the Supreme Court, where the eldest justice, Clinton appointee Stephen Breyer, is 82 years old.",
            "“His approach to nominations across the board is ensuring folks in these positions reflect America, in terms of diversity and ideology,” said a spokesperson for Biden’s transition team, who spoke only generally about his thinking on judicial and executive picks.",
            "“With other nominations and appointments, Biden has set a tone of expecting to work with the Senate on highly qualified nominees at a moment when the country is in a moment of crisis,” said the spokesperson. “He has an expectation of a good faith engagement when he puts forward qualified, seasoned candidates.”",
            "But so much of Biden’s agenda, on judges and otherwise, hangs in the balance ahead of Georgia’s Senate runoff elections in January. The outcome of these elections will decide which party controls the Senate for the next two years.",
            "Even if just one of Georgia’s two Republican senators, David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, holds onto his or her seat, which is likely, McConnell will remain majority leader. That means Biden has to prepare for the kind of unwavering obstruction that Obama faced in getting his judicial picks confirmed.",
            "“I don’t think McConnell is likely to confirm many of Biden’s nominees at all,” said Wheeler. “Some people have said that maybe Joe and Mitch would get together, these old buddies, these members of the Senate club are going to work things out. I don’t think that’s going to happen.”",
            "McConnell has tossed out so many Senate rules and norms to benefit himself and his party, added Wheeler, that it wouldn’t surprise him if Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas retired in January and McConnell prevented Biden from filling that seat for his entire four years in office.",
            "“It is grim,” he said of his assessment. “But I’ve been studying this stuff going back to the Johnson administration. The Senate just had a different idea, that a president gets to nominate judges. Now it’s become dog-eat-dog and we’ll worry tomorrow if our dog got eaten up too much.”",
            "Ornstein agreed that Biden will have a rough road ahead, but not just because of McConnell. The fact that virtually all Senate Republicans routinely voted with McConnell to block Obama’s court picks means they don’t seem to care, either, about the idea that a president is entitled to a vote on his nominees.",
            "“I can talk all night about McConnell or Trump, but the stain here on the confirmation process ― on just the whole concept of what the judiciary is supposed to be ― is prevalent across the entire Republican Senate body,” said Ornstein. “Every single one of them.”",
            "If Republicans do hold the Senate, Biden may try to be more measured with the types of judicial nominees he puts forward in hopes of getting them through. They probably wouldn’t be as progressive, for example, as some in his party might want.",
            "He’ll likely have to work with GOP senators to pick nominees they can all support for court vacancies in their home states.",
            "He also may wind up cutting deals that allow for a package of Republican and Democratic nominees to go through together.",
            "“Biden will be forced to horse trade like Clinton had to; he had to put Republicans on the bench to get his Democrats through,” said Brian Fitzpatrick, a law professor at Vanderbilt University and formerly the special counsel for Supreme Court nominations to Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas). “I suspect McConnell will drive an even harder bargain and Biden will probably have to put even more Republicans on than Clinton did.”",
            "Regardless of which party controls the Senate, Biden will take office on Jan. 20, 2021, with roughly 43 district court vacancies and two appeals court vacancies to fill. And as a former longtime chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and a former vice president, Biden has it going for him that he knows the Senate confirmation process better than almost anyone.",
            "“I’m optimistic about Biden. He gets it. He’s got good people around him who are going to do this work,” said Tobias. “I think it will come down to a function of how much Biden is willing to compromise. He and McConnell could reach some kind of understanding.”",
            "“It might not be pretty,” he added, “but it might fill up the courts.”"

            "Tony Rice, the master bluegrass picker who drew fans worldwide for the chance to hear the quick, fluid sounds he conjured from his storied Martin D-28 guitar, has died at age 69.",
            "Rice died Friday at his home in Reidsville, North Carolina, according to International Bluegrass Music Association spokesperson Casey Campbell, who did not immediately provide additional details. Rice lived in Reidsville with his wife, Pamela Hodges Rice.",
            "Ricky Skaggs, one of the many musicians who revered Rice and performed and recorded with him, called him “the single most influential acoustic guitar player in the last 50 years.”",
            "“Sometime during Christmas morning while making his coffee, our dear friend and guitar hero Tony Rice passed from this life and made his swift journey to his heavenly home,” Skaggs wrote on Facebook this weekend.",
            "“Many if not all of the Bluegrass guitar players of today would say that they cut their teeth on Tony Rice’s music. He loved hearing the next generation players play his licks. I think that’s where he got most of his joy as a player.”",
            "Others paying tribute included Jason Isbell, Bela Fleck and actor-comedian Steve Martin, a longtime banjo player who tweeted, “Aw, Tony Rice. A name I’ve known my whole life. A great musician.”",
            "Tall and lean, and with an understated live presence that contrasted with the dynamism of his guitar, Rice had health problems over the past quarter-century. A muscle disorder around his vocal cords left him unable to sing onstage, and tennis elbow limited his playing. His last live guitar performance was in 2013, when he was inducted into the International Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame.",
            "“I am not going to go back out into the public eye until I can be the musician that I was, where I left off or better,” Rice told the Greensboro News & Record in 2015. “I have been blessed with a very devout audience all these years, and I am certainly not going to let anybody down.”",
            "Rice released dozens of albums, including several as a member of the David Grisman Quintet; “Skaggs & Rice” with Ricky Skaggs; “Manzanita” as leader of “The Tony Rice Unit”; and such solo efforts as “Tony Rice” and “Me & My Guitar.”",
            "He played with everyone from Jerry Garcia to Dolly Parton and received honors including a Grammy in 1993 for best country instrumental performance and citations from the International Bluegrass Music Association as guitarist of the year.",
            "Born David Anthony Rice in Danville, Virginia, Rice grew up in Los Angeles and soon — along with siblings Larry, Wyatt and Ronnie— absorbed his musician-father’s love for bluegrass. By age 20, Tony Rice was a member of banjo star J.D. Crowe’s band New South and by his mid-20s a co-founder of the Grismen quintet.",
            "A key early influence was guitarist Clarence White, a country and bluegrass star who crossed over into rock in the late 1960s as a member of the Byrds. White was just 29 when he was struck by a car in 1973, and among the possessions he left behind was a D-28 guitar that he had let Rice play when he was just 9.",
            "The D-28, made in 1935, had a life to rival any of its owners. White once shot it with a pellet gun and another time ran over it with his van. After White’s death, Rice learned that the D-28 had been sold to a friend of White’s in Kentucky and purchased it for $550, in cash, although he needed to buy a new set of strings.",
            "In the mid-1990s, he nearly lost the guitar during a tropical storm in Florida. He was also known to keep rattlesnakes in it, an old musical tradition.",
            "“It’s a beautiful instrument,” he told Fretboard Journal in 2016. “I never pick it up but that I don’t think that. It’s got to be the Holy Grail.”"

            "“Vaccines for everybody, especially for the most vulnerable and needy,” who should be first in line, Francis said in off-the-cuff remarks from his prepared text, calling the development of such vaccines “light of hope” for the world.",
            "“We can’t let closed nationalisms impede us from living as the true human family that we are,” the pope said.",
            "He called on the leaders of nations, businesses, and international organizations to “promote cooperation and not competition, and to search for a solution for all.”",
            "Amid a surge of coronavirus infections this fall in Italy, Francis broke with tradition for Christmas. Instead of delivering his “Urbi et Orbi” speech — Latin for “to the city and to the world” — from the central loggia of St. Peter’s Square, he read it from inside a cavernous hall at the Apostolic Palace, flanked by two Christmas trees with blinking lights.",
            "Normally, tens of thousands of people would have crowded into St. Peter’s Square to receive the pope’s Christmas blessing and speech. But Italian measures to try to rein in holiday infections allow people to leave their homes on Christmas for only urgent reasons like work, health, visits to nearby loved ones or exercise close to home.",

Amid a deadly pandemic and a massive economic downturn, he decided to mostly deploy that power in two ways: to challenge the foundations of U.S. democracy, and to boost himself, his political agenda and his personal allies in ways he can’t after Jan. 20.",
            "He is particularly focused on one tool: the presidential pardon. Before he leaves office, Trump can forgive anyone convicted of committing a federal crime, technically wiping their record clean. He can even issue prospective pardons for people who have yet to face any charges.",
            "Trump signaled his intentions with his first post-election pardon on Nov. 25, when he issued an extremely broad reprieve for his former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Trump both cleared Flynn of charges he had already received for lying to federal investigators and shielded him from accountability for any other crimes he committed that are connected to Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election.",
            "In the run-up to Christmas, as Trump upended congressional efforts to send aid to struggling Americans and ignored the thousands-strong daily death toll of the coronavirus, he issued 41 pardons on Dec. 22 and Dec. 23 to people ranging from his daughter’s father-in-law to war criminals responsible for a massacre in Iraq. He is expected to intervene in more cases in the days ahead.",

They killed at least 14 people, including multiple children.",

            "Trump’s decision horrified Iraqis, as well as other observers in the U.S. and abroad, and reflected how he celebrates brutality while claiming he wants to end wars and how little he thinks of the lives of most people, particularly foreigners.",
            "“I’m really shocked,” Hassan Salman, one of the Iraqis shot by the Blackwater employees, told NPR after the White House announced the pardons. “The American judiciary is fair and equitable. I had never imagined that Trump or any other politician would affect American justice.”",
            "The White House statement on the pardons praised the men for “a long history of service to the nation” ― echoing Trump’s narrative that extreme violence defying long-held American ideals is evidence of patriotism ― while making a passing reference to the “unfortunate deaths and injuries of Iraqi civilians.”",
            "Mueller Investigation Subjects",
            "Robert Mueller’s monthslong investigation of Russia’s meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election was an existential threat to the Trump presidency — fears of federal law enforcement attention into the matter were, by Trump’s own account, the reason he fired then-FBI Director James Comey in 2017. The subsequent controversy and Mueller’s appointment as special counsel put several top Trump officials and even the president in serious legal jeopardy.",
            "While Trump avoided criminal charges himself, others weren’t so lucky. Mueller’s team ultimately brought charges against 34 people, obtaining eight guilty pleas and one conviction. In many cases, people were convicted for obstruction or similar efforts to thwart Mueller’s probe. As an apparent reward for their help, Trump is now pardoning almost all of those people.",
            "Trump has so far pardoned Flynn, George Papadopoulos, Alex van der Zwaan, Roger Stone and Paul Manafort for crimes related to the Mueller probe. Papadopoulos, a foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign in 2016, pleaded guilty in 2017 to lying to the FBI about his contacts with people who claimed to be Russian officials. Van der Zwaan, the grandson of a Russian billionaire, pleaded guilty to lying to Mueller’s team about contacts with the Trump campaign. Flynn twice pleaded guilty to lying to Mueller’s team about conversations with the Russian ambassador to the U.S.",
            "Stone was convicted in 2019 of obstructing a congressional investigation into Russia’s role in the election, as well as threatening a witness. Trump had previously commuted his sentence, in July. In 2018, after Stone proclaimed he would never testify against Trump, the president tweeted “Nice to know that some people still have ‘guts!’”",
            "Manafort, Trump’s onetime campaign manager, was placed on home confinement for a raft of charges ranging from financial crimes to obstruction of justice and witness tampering. Manafort very clearly accepted a longer prison sentence of seven and a half years instead of cooperating against Trump. The president praised him during the investigation and trial for refusing “to break,” and according to some reports, Trump made it clear to Manafort that a pardon awaited if he didn’t give Mueller any help. That has now come to pass.",
            "Law Enforcement Officers",
            "Several of Trump’s pardons were for law enforcement officers accused of violence against people of color. Trump has long claimed that law enforcement ― immigration officers especially ―are wrongly limited in their ability to do their jobs.",
            "He pardoned Stephanie Mohr, a former police officer in Prince George’s County, Maryland, who was convicted of a federal civil rights violation after letting her dog attack a homeless Mexican immigrant in 1995, even though he was not resisting arrest. Prosecutors said she had a history of racist actions. During one police home search, she threatened a woman living there that she would release the dog to bite the woman’s “black ass,” according to a court filing at the time. (Mohr denies this.)",
            "Trump also pardoned Joseph Occhipinti, a former agent with the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, a precursor to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Occhipinti was convicted in 1991 for violating the civil rights of Hispanic store owners by conducting illegal searches and then lying to cover it up. President George H.W. Bush commuted Occhipinti’s sentence the following year after urging from a political ally. “Bush insulted the whole community,” Jose Liberato, one of the store owners who filed a complaint against Occhipinti, told The New York Times at the time. “He threw the law into the garbage.”",
            "Gary Brugman, a former Border Patrol agent, was pardoned after violating the civil rights of an immigrant by kicking and hitting him even though he was complying with officers’ orders. Brugman got some high-profile help to gain his pardon: conservative commentators Laura Ingraham, Glenn Beck and Lou Dobbs took up his cause, as did immigration hardliners including Reps. Steve King (R-Iowa) and Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) and Republican Sens. Ted Cruz and John Cornyn of Texas. In 2001, Brugman and other border agents chased down a group of people who crossed the border illegally. The men sat down when a Border Patrol agent ordered them to, but Brugman beat two of them anyway, pushing them to the ground and assaulting them even though they did not fight back or resist, according to court filings.",
            "Trump also pardoned former Border Patrol agents Ignacio Ramos and Jose Compean, who were found guilty of offenses including deprivation of rights, assault with a dangerous weapon and tampering with an official proceeding. In 2005, the men shot at a Mexican man who was smuggling drugs. Ramos hit and wounded the man, but the agents did not report the shooting; instead, they removed shell casings from the ground to cover up the crime scene, according to a 2009 report by the Department of Homeland Security inspector general’s office. President George W. Bush commuted their sentences in 2009, but conservative figures continued to push for a pardon.",
            "Well-Connected Fraudsters",
            "And, of course, there are gifts for people with deep personal ties to the president. Trump pardoned Charles Kushner, the father of his son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner. The elder Kushner pleaded guilty in 2004 ― prosecuted by then-U.S. attorney, former New Jersey governor and Trump ally Chris Christie ― for tax evasion, illegal campaign donations and a failed scheme against his sister’s husband.",
            "After he learned his brother-in-law was cooperating with federal authorities, Charles Kushner hired a prostitute to lure the man to a motel room, where a hidden camera would record their encounter. Kushner planned to send the tape to his sister. The goal, according to Christie, was to intimidate his sister from testifying against him before a grand jury. Christie described the matter as “one of the most loathsome, disgusting crimes that I prosecuted when I was U.S. attorney.”",
            "Trump also pardoned John Boultbee and Peter Atkinson, who were convicted of a fraud scheme in 2007. Their pardon was at the urging of Lord Conrad Black, a former media mogul and their co-defendant, whom Trump pardoned last year. Black is a longtime Trump toady: he wrote a piece in 2005 entitled “Trump is the good guy,” and a fawning 2018 book called ”Donald J. Trump: A President Like No Other.”",
            "Fellow Republicans",
            "Some of Trump’s notable pardons and commutations were for Republican political figures, including two of his first endorsers in Congress: then-Reps. Duncan Hunter and Chris Collins.",
            "Trump pardoned Hunter (R-Calif.) and his wife, Margaret Hunter, who pleaded guilty in 2019 to conspiracy to steal campaign funds. The two were involved in a scheme that involved using campaign money on personal expenses, including costs involved in the congressman’s extramarital affairs, according to prosecutors. They also spent campaign donors’ money on, among many other things, trips to Italy and Hawaii, home improvement, an NFL game package and flights for their pet bunny, according to an Office of Congressional Ethics report.",
            "Thanks to Trump’s pardon, Collins, a former congressman from upstate New York, served only 10 weeks of a prison term that was supposed to last 26 months. Collins pleaded guilty to two insider trading charges on Oct. 1, 2018 ― after being caught on camera giving his son a tip on a biotechnology company from the White House grounds during the 2017 edition of the annual Congressional Picnic. Soon after he was charged, Collins actually said a pardon from Trump would be “inappropriate.”",
            "John Tate and Jesse Benton, two former campaign staffers of former Texas Rep. Ron Paul whom Trump pardoned, indirectly made payments to an Iowa state senator to endorse Paul’s failed 2012 presidential campaign. Paul’s son, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and Lee Goodman, former chair of the Federal Election Commission, supported the pardon. Goodman argued that the “reporting law violated was unclear and not well established at the time.” Both men were convicted in 2017 of causing false records to be filed, causing false campaign expenditure reports, engaging in a false statements scheme and conspiring to commit the offenses. A federal appeals court upheld their convictions in 2018.",
            "Mary McCarty, who was elected five times as county commissioner in Palm Beach, Florida, was pardoned after pleading guilty in 2009 to a federal charge of honest services fraud. This followed her steering lucrative business deals to her husband and accepting free or discounted hotel rooms from a company that she supported in building a hotel. The White House, in explaining her pardon, argued that McCarty’s actions may not be criminally prosecuted today due to a more narrow interpretation of the law by the Supreme Court. Her pardon was supported by former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, who was a member of Trump’s legal team during his impeachment trial, and Christopher Ruddy, who is the CEO of the conservative website Newsmax Media.",
            "Former Texas Congressman Steve Stockman, who was convicted in 2018 of misusing $1.25 million charitable funds for personal expenses, had the remainder of his 10-year prison sentence commuted by Trump on Tuesday. The White House cited “humanitarian and compassionate grounds” for his release, reasoning that Stockman is 64 and “has underlying pre-existing health conditions that place his health at greater risk during the COVID epidemic,” though Stockman already contracted the virus behind bars, the announcement said. He will remain subject to a period of supervised release and will still be required to pay more than $1,000,000 in restitution.",
            "Other GOP figures who received pardons include Utah state Rep. Phil Lyman ― who was convicted in 2015 for organizing an illegal ATV ride on archaeologically sensitive land ― and former U.S. Rep. Mark Siljander (R-Mich.) ― who served time for undisclosed work with an Islamic nonprofit."

            "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump pardoned more than two dozen people, including former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Charles Kushner, the father of his son-in-law, in the latest wave of clemency to benefit longtime associates and supporters.",
            "The actions, in Trump’s waning time at the White House, bring to nearly 50 the number of people whom the president has granted clemency in the last week. The list from the last two days includes not only multiple people convicted in the investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia but also allies from Congress and other felons whose causes were championed by friends.",
            "Pardons are common in the final stretch of a president’s tenure, the recipients largely dependent on the individual whims of the nation’s chief executive. Trump throughout his administration has shucked aside the conventions of the Obama administration, when pardons were largely reserved for drug offenders not known to the general public, and instead bestowed clemency on high-profile contacts and associates who were key figures in an investigation that directly concerned him.",
            "Even members of the president’s own party raised eyebrows, with Republican Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska issuing a brief statement that said: “This is rotten to the core.”",
            "The pardons Wednesday of Manafort and Roger Stone, who months earlier had his sentence commuted by Trump, were particularly notable, underscoring the president’s desire to chip away at the results and legacy of special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation. He has now pardoned five people convicted in that investigation, four of them associates like former national security adviser Michael Flynn and campaign adviser George Papadopoulos, both of whom pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI.",
            "“The pardons from this President are what you would expect to get if you gave the pardon power to a mob boss,” tweeted Andrew Weissmann, a Mueller team member who helped prosecute Manafort.",
            "Manafort, who led Trump’s campaign during a pivotal period in 2016 before being ousted over his ties to Ukraine, was among the first people charged as part of Mueller’s investigation into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. He was later sentenced to more than seven years in prison for financial crimes related to his political consulting work in Ukraine but was released to home confinement last spring because of coronavirus concerns in the federal prison system.",
            "Though the charges against Manafort did not concern the central thrust of Mueller’s mandate — whether the Trump campaign and Russia colluded to tip the election — he was nonetheless a pivotal figure in the investigation.",
            "His close relationship to a man U.S. officials have linked to Russian intelligence, and with whom he shared internal campaign polling data, attracted particular scrutiny during the investigation, though Mueller never charged Manafort or any other Trump associate with conspiring with Russia.",
            "Manafort, in a series of tweets, thanked Trump and lavished praise on the outgoing president, declaring that history would show he had accomplished more than any of his predecessors.",
            "Trump did not pardon Manafort’s deputy, Rick Gates, who was sentenced last year to 45 days in prison after extensively cooperating with prosecutors, or former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, who pleaded guilty to campaign finance crimes related to his efforts to buy the silence of women who said they had sexual relationships with Trump. Both were also convicted in the Mueller probe.",
            "New York City prosecutors, meanwhile, have been seeking to have the state’s highest court revive state mortgage fraud charges against Manafort after a lower court dismissed them on double jeopardy grounds. A spokesman for District Attorney Cy Vance said the pardon “underscores the urgent need to hold Mr. Manafort accountable for his crimes against the People of New York.”",
            "Manafort and Stone are hardly conventional pardon recipients, in part because both were scolded by judges for effectively thumbing their nose at the criminal justice system as their cases were pending. Manafort was accused of witness tampering even after he was indicted and was accused by prosecutors of lying while trying to earn credit for cooperation.",
            "Stone, who was convicted of lying to Congress about his efforts to gain inside information about the release by WikiLeaks of Russia-hacked Democratic emails during the 2016 campaign, was similarly censured by a judge because of his social media posts.",
            "In a statement Wednesday, Stone thanked Trump and alleged that he had been subjected to a “Soviet-style show trial on politically-motivated charges”",
            "Kushner is the father of Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and a wealthy real estate executive who pleaded guilty years ago to tax evasion and making illegal campaign donations. Trump and the elder Kushner knew each other from real estate circles and their children were married in 2009.",
            "Prosecutors allege that after Kushner discovered that his brother-in-law was cooperating with authorities, he hatched a revenge and intimidation scheme. They say he hired a prostitute to lure his brother-in-law, then arranged to have a secret recording of the encounter in a New Jersey motel room sent to his own sister, the man’s wife.",
            "Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has called it “one of the most loathsome, disgusting crimes” he ever prosecuted as U.S. attorney.",
            "Trump’s legally troubled allies were not the only recipients of clemency. The list of 29 recipients included people whose pleas for forgiveness have been promoted by people supporting the president throughout his term in office, among them former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, Newsmax CEO Christopher Ruddy, and Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky.",
            "One recipient was Topeka Sam, whose case was promoted by Alice Johnson, a criminal justice advocate whom Trump pardoned and who appeared in a Super Bowl ad for him and at the Republican National Convention.",
            "“Ms. Sam’s life is a story of redemption,” the White House said in its release, praising her for helping other women in need.",
            "Others granted clemency included a former county commissioner in Florida who was convicted of taking gifts from people doing business with the county and a community leader in Kentucky who was convicted of federal drug offenses.",

Everyone gets the winter blues, and according to the National Institute of Mental Health, millions of people have seasonal affective disorder (SAD) with symptoms that include depression, sluggishness and changes in appetite.",
            "While there’s no cure for the winter blues or SAD, there are things you can do to help mitigate them (and you should definitely see a doctor if you’re concerned about your symptoms). Begin by getting some sunshine and exercise, even if it’s just a little bit each day.",

So any brain inflammation is going to interfere with production of hormones that help you feel better. And especially, again, in the winter months, when people are more prone to feeling a little bit down, prioritizing the omega-3 can be extra helpful,” Jones said.",
            "Colorful fruits and veggies",
            "It can be an effort to eat a variety of fruits and vegetables in the winter, but it’s important in order to get a range of antioxidants and vitamin C.",
            "“If you’re only eating apples and bananas for your fruit every day, and you’re eating leafy greens and focusing on all your green veggies but you’re missing out on red or orange or purple, then you’re only getting certain antioxidants,” Jones explained. “So the more different colors you get, the more antioxidants you have that can work together to lower inflammation.”",
            "Don’t worry about buying out-of-season fresh fruits and vegetables. Frozen and canned produce is perfectly acceptable, Jones said.",
            "“I recommend getting frozen berry blends, different frozen vegetable blends. Obviously, the greens are great, but maybe you’re getting peas and carrots too, to have a little bit more variety there,” she said. If you get canned fruit, make sure it doesn’t have added sugar.",
            "Legumes, nuts and seeds",
            "By now we’ve all likely heard of probiotics, microorganisms that can support gut health. But we also need prebiotics, which “feed” the bacteria in our lower digestive tracts, Jones said.",
            "You can find prebiotics in most whole plant foods, but legumes, nuts and seeds are especially good sources and they also serve as a protein option.",
            "“If our gut is not happy, then it’s very likely that people are going to deal with more stress and anxiety mentally. So it’s important to regularly eat those whole plant foods that support the bacteria so that your brain can feel better too,” Jones advised.",
            "Shellfish",
            "According to Lagano, increasing zinc intake is a must in the winter. It’s believed to help maintain the immune system while metabolizing nutrients and keeping up energy levels.",
            "One of the best sources of zinc is shellfish ― think shrimp, crab, lobster, mussels and oysters. They’re also relatively low in calories and high in protein. If shellfish isn’t your thing, ramp up the chickpeas and lentils.",
            "Dark chocolate",
            "Dark chocolate is another great source of zinc, Lagano said. “I’m not talking milk chocolate. I’m talking 85% cacao,” she added.",
            "Bitter greens",
            "Iceberg lettuce is tasty — who doesn’t love a wedge salad? — but it might not give you the immune-boosting benefits you need. When it comes to greens, try to go for the dark, bitter ones.",
            "“The more bitter the green, the better it’s going to be. Arugula, radicchio and dandelion ― those are going to be some of the top ones,” Lagano said.",
            "CBD",
            "Lagano is a proponent of cannabidiol (she even wrote a book titled “The CBD Oil Miracle”) and calls it “the ultimate anti-inflammatory.”",
            "“People love to say that CBD is non-psychoactive, but it is psychoactive and that is not a bad thing. ... Psychoactivity is what enables us not to be sad or depressed, in some cases,” she said.",
            "One way Lagano suggests using CBD is in mocktails, such as a blend of sparkling water, herbs-infused syrup, lemon juice and a few drops of a CBD tincture (she likes Elevate).",
            "What to scale back on",
            "Jones doesn’t like to tell people to cut out certain foods completely because it can lead to bingeing later, but something to scale back on is greasy, fatty food. As much as those cold, blustery winds push us toward the drive-thru window, the fats found in French fries can increase inflammation and make us feel worse, physically and mentally. Similarly, it’s best to reduce refined sugars.",
            "It’s also a good idea to cut back on alcohol, if not avoid it altogether, since it’s a central nervous system depressant.",
            "“No matter what study you may have seen that shows that moderate intake [of alcohol] may improve this or that, for the vast majority of people, even moderate intake can affect things like blood pressure and absolutely can affect your mood,” Jones said."

            "But even more outrageous was a tangent declaring that President Donald Trump followed science in responding to the coronavirus pandemic.",
            "Gingrich, now a right-wing media personality, wrote that the “elite liberal media ... blamed President Trump for the global pandemic even as he did literally everything top scientists instructed.”",
            "In reality, Trump and his administration falsely downplayed the threat of the virus as presented by scientists, even though the president knew early on it was lethal. He pushed unproven and dangerous treatments and attempted to discredit White House coronavirus task force member Dr. Anthony Fauci. He promoted a rapid reopening of the country, defying scientists’ pleas for caution. And he mocked research-based safety guidelines like social distancing and mask-wearing.",
            "He also attempted to stoke fear in his base by warning in October that his then-opponent Biden “will listen to the scientists.” As if this were dangerous.",
            "Since his election defeat, Trump has mostly ignored the pandemic’s mounting toll.",
            "While Biden has given the Trump administration some credit for fast-tracking the development of vaccines, U.S. deaths have now passed 323,000 as COVID-19 patients push hospitals to the brink. A full vaccine rollout remains perhaps months away.",
            "As for Biden’s decisive victory, Gingrich again took liberties with reality.",
            "“Nor do I have any interest in pretending that the current result is legitimate or honorable,” wrote Gingrich, whose article was retweeted by Trump. “It is simply the final stroke of a four-year establishment-media power grab. It has been perpetrated by people who have broken the law, cheated the country of information, and smeared those of us who believe in America over China, history over revisionism, and the liberal ideal of free expression over cancel culture.”",
            "He added: “I write this in genuine sorrow, because I think we are headed toward a serious, bitter struggle in America. This extraordinary, coordinated four-year power grab threatens the fabric of our country and the freedom of every American.”",

            "Johnson’s family shared the news of his release through the Florida men’s basketball Twitter account Tuesday afternoon. Later Tuesday, Johnson, 21, shared a selfie on his Instagram story. In their statement, Johnson’s family said they are “amazed by the pace of his recovery,” and they are asking for “patience as the medical professionals continue their work” to determine what caused his collapse.",
            "Johnson, a junior from Virginia, tested positive for the coronavirus in the summer, along with several teammates, leading some to assume his collapse was linked to COVID-19 and its potential for lingering effects. “We are committed to sharing not only updates on Keyontae but also any information we think could help others,” the family said. “When we have that, we will share it.”",
            "During a Dec. 13 game against Florida State, Johnson collapsed as he and his teammates emerged from a huddle during a timeout called nearly five minutes into the game. He’d thrown down an alley-oop in transition on the previous play. In frightening footage from the game, Johnson can be seen falling to his knees and hitting his head on the ground just as he and his teammates reach half-court. Immediately, Johnson’s teammates screamed and summoned medical help as he lay motionless. The game continued after he was wheeled off the court on a stretcher.",

            "Bruce Bartman, 70, was charged with two counts of perjury and one count of unlawful voting after allegedly registering both deceased women online to vote in the Nov. 3 election using either their driver’s license or social security number, prosecutors said Monday.",
            "“He registered both of his deceased relatives as Republicans and he has admitted to the detectives who questioned him that he did this to further the campaign of Donald Trump,” Delaware County District Attorney Jack Stollsteimer said at a press conference.",
            "Bartman’s ballot for his mother, who died in 2008, was for reasons unknown not caught by the election system and was successfully counted in the election. Bartman, a registered Republican, also successfully submitted a ballot in his own name, Stollsteimer said.",
            "Though Bartman successfully registered his mother-in-law to vote, despite her dying in 2019, he never requested a ballot for her, Stollsteimer said.",
            "During her voter registration, Stollsteimer said the system flagged her as likely being deceased. The state then sent a letter requesting her to confirm that she was indeed still alive. He said Bartman falsified this document and returned it but that he did not request an absentee ballot in her name.",
            "Bartman’s lawyer, Samuel Stretton, told The Philadelphia Inquirer that his client is taking responsibility for his actions and is cooperating with authorities.",
            "“In his political frustration, he chose to do something stupid,” Stretton said. “And for that he is very sorry.”",
            "The county’s top prosecutor stressed that Bartman’s ability to cast a vote on behalf of his deceased mother is not evidence of widespread voter fraud and that they are not prosecuting the case because of who Bartman voted for.",
            "“Let me just be very clear, for all the conspiracy theorists who may be out there watching, the case we are talking about today presents no evidence of widespread voter fraud. It in fact is only evidence that one individual here in Delaware County was able to vote for a deceased person,” Stollsteimer said. “If he had voted for Joe Biden or he had written in Donald Duck or Mickey Mouse, we would still be prosecuting this case because this is a violation of the integrity of the American electoral process.”",
            "Stollsteimer, in a later statement, highlighted the need for state lawmakers to evaluate the local government’s online voter registration, reasoning that the county’s voter registration commission “can only administer the system our Legislature puts in place.”",
            "Since losing the election to Joe Biden, Trump has continued to claim, without any supporting evidence, that the election was rigged and stolen from him. His campaign has filed roughly 50 lawsuits attempting to challenge the results but almost all of them have been dismissed or dropped due to a lack of evidence supporting his allegations.",
            "One petition filed on Sunday by the Trump campaign asked the U.S. Supreme Court to reverse three decisions by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court that involve signatures on mail-in and absentee ballots, as well as the campaign’s ability to observe vote counting.",
            "Even if Trump were successful in his quest to overturn Pennsylvania’s election results, which is unlikely, Biden would still remain president-elect due to his wide margin of victory in the Electoral College."

            "All the way back in June 2019, Netflix announced that “The Office” would leave the service in 2021. Between then and now, there have certainly been moments when I wondered if I’d even make it to 2021. But here I am, waving goodbye as the show sails off to Peacock on Dec. 31.",
            "“The Office” has been one of the most popular shows on Netflix for years. The series still regularly appears in the service’s daily public list of most popular shows on the service. Netflix recently ordered a second season of Steve Carell’s workplace comedy “Space Force,” but the new show is nowhere near as funny.",
            "So these are your last days with “The Office,” as well as a few other popular shows. I’m particularly sad to see “Gossip Girl” go, as that series helped me through the early days of the pandemic. I also was looking forward to watching an episode of “The West Wing” (which leaves even earlier with a Dec. 24 departure) in a post-Trump-as-president world. Aaron Sorkin’s optimistic work has felt too saccharine for four years and I was interested in experiencing it with a different mindset.",
            "A couple of other shows departing on Dec. 31 are the Emmy-winning “Nurse Jackie” and the British teen comedy “Inbetweeners.” Watch them while you can.",
            "Below, I’ve compiled the trailers for the five shows mentioned. Under that, you can see the full list of shows leaving the service by the end of December.",

            "Top lawmakers finally reached a deal for more than $900 billion in COVID-19 relief, including another round of stimulus checks for most Americans and an additional $300 per week for people receiving unemployment benefits.",
            "If all goes according to plan, the deal would end a half-year stalemate between congressional leaders and President Donald Trump’s administration over how to deliver financial relief to Americans on top of a $1.4 trillion omnibus spending bill that will serve as the vehicle for the coronavirus package.",
            "It took nearly five months for Congress to renew additional unemployment benefits after an extra $600 a week expired at the end of July. And the logjam broke only after a bipartisan group of moderate senators agreed on a stimulus package of their own in early December.",
            "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif) — along with minority leaders Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) — worked out the final deal using the bipartisan legislation as a framework late Sunday night.",
            "The deal came together after negotiators stumbled Friday over Republicans insistence that the Federal Reserve be disallowed from creating any lending programs “similar” to ones created under the CARES Act. They ultimately compromised on language that would disallow exact replacements of those programs, which had been backed with a whopping $454 billion but barely used.",
            "The $600-per-person check, according to two sources familiar with the talks, is roughly half the size of what was sent out over the summer, but will still be welcome news to most Americans.",
            "Trump tweeted in the middle of the night over the weekend that he thought Congress should increase the amount of the checks — something his own personal aides have reportedly been advising him against. Trump reportedly wanted direct payments of up to $2,000 per person but is OK with the final number. The final deal would phase out the checks for those making above $75,000.",
            "Democrats made concessions over unemployment benefits to secure the checks. While the original gang of moderate senators proposed reauthorizing federal programs for gig workers and the long-term jobless for four months, the new agreement would continue federal programs for unemployed Americans for just 11 weeks, a source familiar with the talks said, to offset the cost of another round of direct payments.",
            "The final deal would give $300 per week in federal unemployment insurance to laid-off workers on top of their state benefits for 11 weeks — half of the $600 benefit Congress passed last spring but still larger than any boost the program has seen in previous years.",
            "Democrats also won an extra 11 weeks of compensation for people who have been unemployed for so long they’ve run out of both state and federal benefits, as well as language easing repayment requirements for workers who were accidentally overpaid by a state workforce agency.",
            "But Republicans won a gradual phase-down of federal programs. Workers won’t be able to start a new federal claim after March 14, but will be allowed to continue receiving benefits until April 5 if they started a claim before then. A gradual end to federal benefits would mean there would be less of a “cliff,” where millions of people get cut off at once, pressuring Congress to act.",
            "Another key to the final bill was what wasn’t in it; namely, a liability shield for businesses or aid to state and local governments.",
            "The liability shield was one of the more poisonous proposals. McConnell had sought to ban personal injury lawsuits related to coronavirus exposure for years to come. Ultimately, McConnell agreed to drop his insistence on the liability provisions if Democrats dropped $160 billion in additional state and local aid — badly needed funds to help those governments make up for budget shortfalls caused by the pandemic-related recession.",
            "That decision allowed Democrats and Republicans to move forward with the bill, but it also may set up Democrats to secure another economic stimulus package once President-elect Joe Biden is sworn into office. With state governments facing layoffs, governors may go to their congressional delegations and push for funds, which could create bipartisan support for aid in yet another relief measure.",
            "“A stimulus that ignores cities and states is a stimulus that ignores the pain of the working class who depend, more than ever, on the services we provide,” New York Mayor Bill De Blasio’s spokesperson, Bill Neidhardt, told HuffPost in a statement last week.",
            "And for some Democrats in Congress, the package doesn’t do enough.",
            "For one, it lacks that state and local funding now. For another, the stimulus checks are far less than what Democrats were seeking. And the additional unemployment benefits are half of what out-of-work job seekers were getting from April to August.",
            "A number of members in the Congressional Progressive Caucus were very critical of negotiations last week. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) said she still wanted the bill to do more — perhaps $1,200 stimulus checks, or even $2,000 checks, as progressives have argued for — and she said she would vote with the CPC.",
            "Last week Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) said the same thing, adding that people needed more than $600 checks and that the time period for the additional $300 in unemployment benefits had been shrunk by a month in final negotiations. (The bipartisan deal would have provided an additional 16 weeks of benefits, but the legislation that Pelosi and McConnell agreed to would only do 12 weeks.)",
            "Khanna, who pushed for Pelosi to take the $1.8 trillion deal the White House offered just before the election, once again noted that this legislation was worse than the previous offer, and he refuted the argument that Pelosi never had a true offer because McConnell was still insisting on his liability shield.",
            "If McConnell refused to give up on the liability protections, even after Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin had reached an agreement, Khanna said, ”it would have clearly identified McConnell as the block... and then it would have depended on how much pressure Trump was willing to put on him.”",
            "Even Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who partnered with conservative Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) to lobby for the inclusion of stimulus checks in the final deal, said the compromise was insufficient.",
            "Some other Democrats were upset about the deal’s “arbitrary expirations” for certain programs that help struggling Americans.",
            "Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said McConnell is “already setting the table for economic sabotage by insisting on a short phase-out of unemployment benefits that removes the hard deadlines that pressure Congress to act.”",
            "Democrats did secure $25 billion to establish a new program to provide emergency rental assistance that Americans can use to pay past-due rent and other housing expenses. And Democrats got money to help schools, money for vaccine distribution and funds for struggling sectors of the economy, including transportation and the U.S. Postal Service.",
            "Republicans are also getting more than $300 billion to help small businesses, with $257 billion going to the Paycheck Protection Program, which loans money to businesses to prevent greater job losses.",
            "Still, the deal is likely to be too much for some Republicans. Some conservatives were already telling HuffPost — before the deal was finalized — that they’d very likely vote no.",
            "“My strong inclination is I’m going to be a no,” Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) said Wednesday night.",
            "The bill could still easily pass both chambers even with opposition from the far-left and far-right of both parties — as long as leaders can actually finish the deal.",
            "Lawmakers passed an emergency short term funding bill Friday to carry them over the weekend and avert a shut down in order to continue negotiations and are set to pass another short term spending bill Sunday night in order to vote on the final package Monday. The goal has been to pass some kind of relief package before the end of the year. federal programs for unemployed Americans expire at the end of the month, risking stranding 12 million job seekers.",

            "As President-elect Joe Biden prepares to take office in just over a month, police reform advocates say that he needs to look beyond prosecutors to fill open spots on the federal bench if there’s to be any hope of implementing changes to hold law enforcement officers accountable.",
            "Racial and gender diversity was already a critical issue for Biden’s judicial picks, especially following an administration whose choices for federal judges, as well as top federal prosecutors, were overwhelmingly white and male. But reformers say career diversity should also be a factor in Biden’s selections. They’d like to see more nominees with a professional background in areas like public defense and civil rights.",
            "Biden, like Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, brings a controversial record on criminal justice to the Oval Office. He may have started out as a public defender, but he is much more closely associated with the 1994 crime bill that helped build a ramp to mass incarceration in America. Harris has more recently labeled herself a “progressive prosecutor,” but her record on criminal justice in California was decidedly mixed and subtly shifted only after the 2014 Ferguson unrest, which laid the groundwork for a more general shift in American views on criminal justice.",
            "Judges often come from prosecutorial backgrounds, where they worked closely with police. A new report, from University of Texas law professor Jennifer Laurin and Justice Collaborative Institute research director Kyle Barry, argues that having the bench full of jurists “with narrow professional backgrounds [has] infused the law with a one-sided and often false view of policing, favoring police power over civil liberties.”",
            "“How can federal courts make better-informed decisions? Decisions that consider not just the interests of police, but the often brutal reality of the people subject to their control? One (albeit incomplete) solution is both straightforward and popular: Diversify the lived experiences of those sitting on the federal bench, including by appointing more public defenders and civil rights lawyers ― legal professionals who have made a career of challenging rather than defending the police perspective,” the report says.",
            "A poll from Data for Progress and the Justice Collaborative Institute found that 58% of voters support “appointing judges who have experience as criminal defense attorneys and civil rights lawyers, not just former prosecutors.” Nearly half of Republicans, 49%, favor the same broader professional diversity.",
            "Last month, civil rights and other groups called for Biden’s judicial nominees to include “public interest lawyers, civil rights lawyers, labor lawyers, plaintiffs’ lawyers, and public defenders.” Earlier this month, in Biden’s meeting with civil rights groups, one prominent civil rights leader pushed him to think about “background diversity” that would bring new perspectives to the federal judiciary and reminded the president-elect of his own background in public defense.",
            "“Our judiciary has essentially been taken over by former prosecutors,” Sherrilyn Ifill, the president of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said to reporters after the meeting. “We need balance in the appointments to the bench.”",
            "Alec Karakatsanis of Civil Rights Corps, which has filed lawsuits alleging unconstitutional systems of incarceration across the country, told HuffPost that for the last generation, judges have “presided over the largest and most racially disproportionate expansion of human caging in modern world history” and that the lack of racial and background diversity on the bench was a major contributor.",
            "“During this time, the U.S. judiciary has been disproportionately white, disproportionately male, and disproportionately wealthy. But it has also been full of prosecutors who, before they became judges, devoted their careers to working with police to build the punishment bureaucracy,” Karakatsanis said.",
            "“In every fiber of their being, these former prosecutors have become desensitized to the everyday brutality of putting metal chains on people’s bodies, separating families, and putting human beings in filthy cages,” Karakatsanis said. “Their hard work to put as many people as possible in jail with no evidence that it made anyone safer carried over to their work as judges for years.”",
            "Bill Nettles, who served as South Carolina’s U.S. attorney during the Obama administration, had a pretty unusual background for one of the nation’s top federal prosecutors: He was a public defender and criminal defense attorney. Nettles told HuffPost that a law enforcement or prosecution background shouldn’t hinder anyone from becoming a judge, but that a range of voices within the judiciary is important for purposes of judicial legitimacy. A basic premise of jurisprudence within a democracy, he said, is that the decisions of the judiciary only have the authority that the people give them over time.",
            "“The voice of the people has come very loud that they want some reform,” Nettles said. “If you have a judiciary that is primarily comprised of people with a prosecution background, then in a time where the community is calling for reform, the decisions will be given more authority by the people if the judiciary has among it people that come from a different point of view,” he said.",
            "Biden, as BuzzFeed News reported this week, will face an uphill battle to confirm judicial nominees. Over the past four years, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has focused on filling the bench with Trump’s judicial picks; before that, he regularly impeded President Barack Obama’s nominees. In 2021, Democrats will at best hold an extremely narrow majority in the Senate (depending on the outcome of the Georgia runoff elections next month). At worst for Biden’s picks, McConnell will remain in control. And nominees for legal jobs who have non-prosecutorial backgrounds have previously run into problems in the Senate confirmation process.",
            "Look no further than the experience of Debo Adegbile, Obama’s nominee to head the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, who was attacked over his involvement in a controversial death penalty case while at the Legal Defense Fund. The treatment of Adegbile in the Senate was especially stark: The Black nominee was pilloried for defending a death row inmate, even though the sitting chief justice of the Supreme Court, a Republican nominee, had himself represented a mass murderer.",
            "Jamal Brown, a spokesman for the Biden transition, said that the president-elect had “proudly championed the historic confirmations of Justices Ginsburg, Sotomayor, and Kagan, and reshaped the Senate Judiciary Committee to reflect the diversity and breadth of America. As president, he will nominate the first Black woman to the Supreme Court, and appoint judges who share his commitment to the rule of law, and upholding individual civil rights and civil liberties.”",
            "To uphold individual civil rights and liberties, the Justice Collaborative Institute’s report effectively argues, a wider range of professional backgrounds is needed. State-sponsored violence against Black Americans has been the product of a judiciary that has failed to hold police accountable, it says, and that is driven by a “false narrative” of policing that doesn’t value the lives of Black Americans.",
            "“The vision of American policing reflected in the Supreme Court’s criminal procedure jurisprudence — a vision of expert crime-fighters under siege and deserving of judicial deference — is neither empirically grounded nor inevitable. It is a construct,” the report states. “And it should come as no surprise that a bench whose professional life has been overwhelmingly dedicated to defending, rather than contesting, the judgments of police would create such a construct. Diversifying the federal bench with lawyers that have insight into the perspectives of those who are the targets of law enforcement action is an important, and politically viable, corrective.”"

            "Sung Kim is the founder and CEO of Chick-N-Bap, a Korean-inspired eatery with five locations across a variety of college campuses in upstate New York. Given that his company’s business model almost entirely relies on campus presence, Kim’s outlook on the effects of COVID-19 is a multifaceted one. Chick-N-Bap’s ability to stay open, after all, doesn’t solely rely on a state’s pandemic-related guidelines concerning restaurants but on the various schools’ modus operandi as well: If there aren’t any students on campus to purchase the food, it doesn’t matter much whether the government allows Kim’s locations to stay open. In this Voices in Food story, 27-year-old Kim tells Anna Rahmanan about having to play defense to stay open in 2020, how a Biden presidency may shift the future and how mom and pop restaurants might fare moving forward.",
            "On the moment COVID-19 hit his business",
            "I think it was March 12 when the director of dining at SUNY Cortland had to pull me aside in the middle of service and tell me all SUNY colleges were closing down, and therefore we had to halt the pop-up we were hosting immediately. Students had to get out of there, and so did we. At the time, I just remember the frustration that I felt. I hadn’t done anything to cause this and, from the looks of it, there was nothing I could do to improve the situation. So that was very hard for me to swallow. And that was only the second week of March. When I look back now, I clearly had no idea what was going to come after. It got a lot worse.",
            "On staying strong following shutdown news",
            "There are so many pros of this business model, but there are also cons. You lose a lot of control. I don’t have free rein on certain things and [having to close] was one of them. It was a mandate and everyone had to leave. The moment we found out, the dust settled a bit because we knew what it was going to be like until the fall reopening. We did a team meeting to address a couple of things. First, the most obvious but hardest thing was that we couldn’t pay the hourly employees when none of our locations were open. A lot of them were family households, employees that have to pay rent. So it was tough, but we had to furlough them. The salaried employees — meaning all the partners and myself — had to take a salary cut given our completely skewed forecast.",
            "I follow these entrepreneur startup pages and they all say the same thing: Companies that become successful are the ones that innovate and provide value during hard times. I remember telling my team that everybody is probably looking to play defense and just maintain and survive, but given how little we had, we needed to still get on the offense without spending all of our resources. So we thought: What could we do without spending so much money? One, we improved every back-end system that we built in place from day one, from how we do inventory to how we order and prep. We [also] ended up working on a 250-page manual over time to make sure that if the opportunity came for franchising, we would be ready and wouldn’t have to scramble for time. We also recreated all of our existing recipes, and the sole purpose of that was to make them better. I have to thank my partners for everything they’ve done to help us stay afloat.",
            "His thoughts on mom and pop shops’ ability to survive through the pandemic",
            "The moment COVID-19 hit, I realized everybody was talking about how they were going to survive. I live in Queens, around the Flushing area, and all these Korean mom and pop shops that I go to all of a sudden had no idea how to address this shift. When delivery opened up, they didn’t even speak English, so they had never used Grubhub or DoorDash or any of that. I even helped out a restaurant and I just realized how hard they were struggling to think of the numbers for rent, for food costs, for the labor.",
            "This industry is already a roller coaster as it is, and this has been the craziest [ride] I’ve been on. What I believe is that people will view this — especially restaurant owners — like a mini, more niche 2008 crisis. We’ll remember where we were when COVID-19 hit back in 2020 and what we did and how we managed to survive. If we can overcome this, I think it will be one of those stories to tell in the future.",
            "On how the government did and didn’t help",
            "I do think the government probably could have helped a little bit more, especially because I felt like the whole Paycheck Protection Program process was extremely frustrating. It wasn’t easy for the business to get the loans. I guess I can’t really talk about what [the colleges] could have done better because they were closed, but when I look back at this past semester, I realize that although we were operating for many days, all of a sudden, they would tell us they were going online and we had to pause operations. I think that stricter project management, with help from higher authorities, would help. These colleges are forced at this time to make really difficult decisions, but if there was a mandate [from the government] that was going to be enforced for the entire system, I think it would help the individual institutions make judgment calls. I think the government needs to take it upon themselves because that’s what the national government is supposed to do.",
            "As for [other restaurant owners], I think they’d [like] a bit more leniency. Don’t make it harder for them! I understand that the government has done a lot to help regulate COVID-19 and manage it, but what it isn’t doing, I think, is offering more support to help increase sales or decrease expenses. What they’ve done is add things like a relief percentage on each check for the customer, but the reality is that for a customer, that might be an unpleasant thing. It’s not a reflection on the government but on the brand, on the restaurant, on the owner. So what the government is doing is not helping the restaurant directly with it. I think it’s forcing the restaurant to seek customers’ help at the expense of their own image. And that’s not helping.",
            "On whether a Joe Biden presidency might help the situation",
            "I’m not entirely sure, but generally speaking, Biden is more for the people and Trump is more for the businesses. So speaking in that sense, maybe Trump’s policies would have been better [for restaurants]. But like my parents always told me, take care of your health first. The reason we are having a hard time right now in the industry isn’t because of the restrictions, but because of COVID-19. If we figure out how to control it better, I think there would have been a chance for us to go back to our businesses sooner, the way we know best, without all these adjustments. I believe we definitely could have done a better job as a country. Like I said, health comes before money, so is the new administration going to help the restaurant industry in the long run?",
            "On what customers can do to help",
            "For universities specifically, general consumers obviously [can’t help] because nobody goes into a university to just eat food. But for [other shops], I think the tip goes a long way. Everybody that is in the industry is needing a little bit of confirmation and validation that they’re doing a great job and helping in this really dark time."

            "By then, the state Senate had already passed the proposal, known as SB-33. At House hearings that lasted until early 2020, however, some 171 opponents testified against the effort they said risked chilling free speech and preventing the faithful from exercising their spiritual duties at a moment when scientists credibly argue that new fossil fuel projects doom humanity to hellish global warming. Just nine spoke in favor of the bill.",
            "For nearly a year, the bill sat dormant. But this week, on the state Legislature’s final day, House lawmakers quietly passed it. The measure is expected to reach Republican Gov. Mike DeWine’s desk on Monday.",
            "“They’re just cowards, plain and simple cowards,” Teresa Mills, executive director of the nonprofit Buckeye Environmental Network, said by phone Friday night. “Shame on them.”",
            "State Sen. Frank Hoagland, the Republican who sponsored the bill, did not return a call or email requesting comment on Friday.",
            "The proposal is part of a wave of anti-protest bills that began surfacing in state legislatures in 2017 but picked up steam as the COVID-19 pandemic reached its initial peak. The bills follow a model. They designate virtually any oil, gas, coal or plastics facilities as “critical infrastructure,” a status normally afforded to dams and nuclear reactors. Then they ramp up criminal penalties for commonplace protest tactics, such as blocking a roadway, tethering oneself to equipment, or even just holding a demonstration near a company’s property.",
            "Offenses that were once minor misdemeanors are reclassified as more severe crimes, in some cases felonies. Fines for the offenses can soar into the tens of thousands of dollars and convictions can sometimes carry jail sentences.",
            "Under Ohio’s legislation, anyone convicted of stepping foot on critical infrastructure property and “causing another person to believe that the offender will cause physical harm” would be guilty of a first-degree misdemeanor, a class of crime that includes domestic violence and drunk driving and is punishable with up to six months in jail and $1,000 in fines. Those who trespass “with purpose to destroy or tamper with the facility” face third-degree felony charges, which in Ohio can result in up to five years in jail and $10,000 in fines. (The bill itself does not set minimum penalties.)",
            "Any organizations that “knowingly direct, authorize, facilitate, or encourage a person to commit any of the following offenses or provide compensation to a person for committing any of the following offenses” can be “punished with a fine that is ten times the maximum fine that can be imposed on an individual.” Companies that operate critical infrastructure could then sue those same organizations in civil court, too.",
            "Such penalties could bankrupt congregations like those in the Unitarian Universalist Justice Ohio, a network of churches that opposed the bill.",
            "“The fact that this could have an impact on some tiny little church in the middle of Appalachia that’s trying to protect its people from pollution really pisses me off, which I realize is not very theological language,” said Rev. Joan VanBecelaere, the church network’s executive director. “But this is not just protest, it’s a public witness of who we are as faithful people.”",
            "Some 40 states have introduced parallel legislation over the past four years. If DeWine signs the bill, Ohio would be the 14th state to pass the measures into law. Roughly half a dozen have been enacted since March in states that include Mississippi, South Dakota and West Virginia.",
            "The bills’ similarities are no coincidence. In 2017, the American Legislative Exchange Council — the right-wing policy shop funded by big business and billionaires — began promoting a generic version of the bill in response to the protests to halt construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline under a water source Native Americans held sacred.",
            "Militarized police and private security forces brutalized environmentalists and Indigenous activists who camped out at the site of the proposed oil pipeline, injuring at least 300 unarmed protesters in one day, including one woman who nearly lost her arm. The heavily armed security forces reported no such injuries.",
            "The bill’s proponents, though, cited the risk of violence by protesters as a need for the legislation. In a December 2017 letter urging state legislators to champion the proposal, five energy trade groups and a big oil company listed six examples of threats environmentalists posed to so-called critical infrastructure.",
            "Only one example actually involved environmentalists. During the Dakota Access fight, activists clipped the locks on fenced-in portions of a connected oil pipeline in the Midwest and turned the valves closed, briefly stopping the flow of oil to refineries. The demonstrators were arrested and charged under existing laws. The other five examples had nothing to do with environmental concerns, and were instead loosely bound by mental illness or workplace grievance.",
            "Many of the same corporate actors that pressed for similar bills in other states lobbied on SB-33, disclosures show, though the records do not indicate the position companies and trade groups took.",
            "Between January 2019 and August 2020, companies including Duke Energy, Marathon Petroleum, Exxon Mobil Corp. and TransCanada, as well as trade groups including the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers and American Chemistry Council registered to lobby on SB-33, according to disclosures analyzed by Connor Gibson, a freelance researcher who tracks critical infrastructure legislation.",
            "Between 2018 and 2019, lobbyists whose clients included fossil fuel giant Koch Industries and Americans for Prosperity, the political group funded and controlled by Koch executives, met with Hoagland, according to emails the watchdog group Documented obtained via Ohio public records requests.",
            "Hoagland himself appears to have a stake in the bill. He owns two consultancies ― 360 Safe Solutions and Special Tactics And Rescue Training ― that provide private security services to fossil fuel companies and advertise a “particular expertise in threats to the oil and gas industry.” The potential benefit prompted calls for Hoagland to take “a basic, conflict-of-interest-avoidance pledge” to “never accept contracts to work a security detail at protests involving ‘critical infrastructure.’”",
            "It’s unclear whether Hoagland even considered such a pledge, particularly in the 11 months that passed without any movement on the bill.",
            "“It’s pretty cynical for these dirty-energy companies to let the bill idle for almost a year before handing out felonies for Christmas,” Gibson said.",
            "Mills said she and others opposing the bill only learned that legislators had taken it up again because a lawmaker who opposed the legislation called her hours before.",
            "“We didn’t even have 12 hours notice that they were going to vote on this bill,” she said. “And we can’t go to the statehouse because those jerks don’t wear masks. They’ve got two reps in the hospital now with the virus, so we can’t go and we can’t have our voices heard at the statehouse.”"

            "In his final movie performance, Chadwick Boseman plays a desperate man. Levee, a horn player in blues queen Ma Rainey’s band, is young, volatile, explosive and constantly striving to get more out of life than what’s been dealt to him. Over the course of an afternoon, as he and the band congregate in a music studio to work on Ma’s latest record, Levee’s outward bravado and inner pain eventually result in a tragic but not altogether surprising climax.",
            "Based on the August Wilson play and directed by veteran theater and film director George C. Wolfe, “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom” is not a definitively cinematic movie. That is, it’s very much a movie based on a play, and what it lacks in sweeping visual storytelling and movement it makes up for entirely with character. This is a movie about monologues. This is a movie about performance. And while in some ways this creates a kind of weakness in the film, it’s incredibly fitting as Boseman’s final on-screen role, because all you can think about anyway is the weight and meaning and finality of his performance.",
            "Every glance, every grimace, every boisterous laugh, every tear, every wisecrack that Levee makes takes on a new significance. Certain lines feel eerie and momentous simply because he is saying them, like when Levee, arguing with the other boys in the band, declares: “Death, death got some style. Death will kick your ass and make you wish you never been born. That’s how bad death is. But you can rule over life. Life ain’t nothing.”",
            "This is not a distraction. If anything, Boseman’s performance, playing off of Viola Davis, invigorates the film with an energy and an urgency that keeps us engaged. As an actor, that was perhaps one of Boseman’s greatest talents: Whether playing the lead role in films like “Black Panther” and “Get on Up” or as part of ensemble, as in one of his other final roles in “Da 5 Bloods,” he was always a grounding force, a star who shined while letting others shine, as well.",
            "Case in point: the opening scene of the film, where Ma Rainey and Levee jockey for dominance on stage at a music hall, with her powerful voice, him with his booming horn. Levee wants what Ma has: her fame, her money, her success, even her sultry girlfriend. And, more than anything, the respect that she demands and seems to get from the white folks who’ve commissioned her latest record. Onstage, as he brazenly takes a horn solo, the spotlight hovers on Levee for one brief, shining moment, but then rests firmly back on Ma as she bellows, “Hey daddy! Please come home to me!” Levee retreats into the darkness of the background. We’re dazzled and captivated by Ma Rainey. But we still look for him. The scene sets a tone — this is still very much Davis’ film, but Boseman provides all the tension, all the stakes.",
            "There seems to be this hope that talented actors end their careers with films that tie up their on-screen legacy neatly, and if they don’t, this is somehow a bad thing. But “Ma Rainey” isn’t a neat ending, and that makes it far more interesting. As years progress, Boseman’s performance as Black Panther will most likely be the role with which he is most strongly associated and celebrated. The “Black Panther” movie, after all, was and is a huge cultural phenomenon, symbolic of so much more than just a fictional Black superhero.",
            "But it’s Levee, perhaps, which will be the performance that encapsulates or rather immortalizes so much of the legend that was lost. It’s impossible to know, definitively, what was going through Boseman’s mind as he played this character. Unless one actually experiences it, I imagine it’s impossible to fully grasp what it truly means to be an artist, fighting to keep creating until you no longer can. But there’s a sense, as he blazes across each frame, that the performance is heavily imbued with the weight of what it is: a farewell, a conclusion to a brief yet inspiring body of work."

            "Set in Los Angeles during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, “Breaking Fast” follows Mohammad, or Mo (played by Haaz Sleiman), a Muslim doctor who is reeling from a recent heartbreak. One birthday party meet-cute later, he finds himself falling for Kal (Michael Cassidy), an aspiring actor.",
            "Unfortunately for Mo, the timing of the meeting presents numerous challenges, and he must navigate his feelings for Kal while honoring Ramadan, during which Muslims must abstain from eating, drinking and engaging in sexual activity from dawn to sunset.",

The movie debuted at California’s Cinequest Film & Creativity Festival in March and was subsequently screened digitally at Toronto’s Inside Out Film Festival and San Francisco’s Frameline, among other festivals.",

            "“I wanted to make a movie that would star Julia Roberts, if, in fact, she was a gay, Muslim, Arab man living in West Hollywood, California,” Mosallam said. In a separate interview, he added, “My intention is to tell a story that speaks to the nuances of daily life and treats identity ― religious, sexual, gender and otherwise ― as harmonious lenses by which individuals interact with the world.”",
            "Early reviews of “Breaking Fast” have been positive. One critic called the movie “an entirely pertinent tale in a world that still struggles with the idea that a man can be gay and Muslim without feeling torn between the two,” while another applauded Mosallam and Seth Hauer’s script for “pushing back against its generic confines.”",
            "Sleiman, whose credits include “Nurse Jackie” and “Jack Ryan,” was praised for turning in an “endearingly neurotic” performance.",

            "In the era of remote learning and social distancing, children are missing out on opportunities to develop important interpersonal skills. The decline in socialization in 2020 means they’ve been getting less practice with problem-solving, communication and other types of social-emotional learning.",
            "One particularly important skill that needs work: the art of disagreeing.",
            "“When kids learn to disagree without resorting to an explosion or a tantrum, they develop crucial skills for having friendships that don’t fall apart and for being part of a creative team with peers on any projects, sports, leadership committees, or clubs that they want to join,” said Leonard Felder, a licensed psychologist and author of “We See It So Differently.”",
            "“Knowing how to listen calmly with respect and then to brainstorm on solutions that include all the points of view is something that kids definitely can learn, but it takes practice and gentle guidance on how to cool down the fierce ‘I’m right and you’re wrong’ feelings that flare up in all of us,” he added.",
            "As we’ve seen clearly in recent years, disagreements are a part of everyday life. It’s important to learn how to discuss differing opinions and preferences (assuming they do not deny basic humanity and reason) without resorting to dismissiveness, name-calling or cruelty. Doing so promotes independent thinking, identity formation and understanding of others.",
            "But in the absence of a traditional classroom and playground interactions, how can kids learn to express opinions, communicate effectively, navigate disagreements and work together to problem-solve? Below, Felder and other experts share their advice for parents who want to teach their children how to disagree in a healthy way.",
            "Start early.",
            "Learning to disagree is a lifelong process that begins with basic foundational skills like empathy and communication. Don’t think of this as a single lecture but rather a series of conversations and experiences.",
            "“From an early age, we teach children to share, be polite, be a good sport,” noted Robin Goodman, a clinical psychologist and art therapist who works with children. “These are great building blocks for good communication and getting along with other people.”",
            "Talk about feelings.",
            "“Helping kids understand their feelings when conflict arises is extremely helpful,” Goodman explained. “For example, are they feeling hurt, left out, frustrated, not listened to, misunderstood, or embarrassed? Putting words to the feelings can help understand what is going on and the source of the issue rather than it just being about a disagreement.”",
            "Helping kids understand and express their emotions can empower them to handle conflict and disagreement. Make a daily habit of talking about feelings.",
            "“The feelings are important because you also need to help a child with what to do when they feel embarrassed or angry rather than just focusing on the actual words they disagree with,” Goodman said.",
            "Cultivate empathy.",
            "As kids learn to understand their own feelings, they can start to recognize those emotions in others and develop empathy. Empathy and emotional intelligence are skills you can cultivate every day, like exercising a muscle in the body with daily exercise.",
            "“Ask your child to put themselves in someone else’s shoes, challenge them to ask questions like, ‘Why did they say that? How would I feel if I was left out? How could I have said that differently? What do you think they were feeling and thinking?’” suggested psychologist, play therapist and “Mommy Burnout” author Sheryl Ziegler. “Gaining empathy is a great skill for effective communication, improving relationships and enduring difficult times.”",
            "In the context of a disagreement, empathy doesn’t mean you have to back down from your position, but it helps you manage the clash respectfully. It’s about understanding that people are different and hold different views for a variety of reasons.",
            "“It doesn’t mean the person is right ― just that you at least understand, or consider their perspective,” Goodman said. “This goes along with helping your child not assume what the other person was thinking or doing but rather finding out more. Teaching kids to disagree is also about learning from others. They may have ideas and knowledge that you don’t have, so listening and learning can actually be helpful.”",
            "Lead by example.",
            "“Watch out for how you disagree with partners and friends as your children are watching and learning in real time,” Goodman advised. “If you disagree with someone, you may find a time when you can then explain what you did, or ask your child what they noticed about how you handled it. Of course parents don’t have to do it every time, but look for those teachable moments and examples.”",
            "Parents can also model healthy disagreement in their interactions with their children and each other. They can do this by listening to the other person, considering their viewpoint, calmly expressing that they disagree and then either reaching a resolution or moving on.",
            "“If you or your family create a regular habit of making sure that in a discussion, each point of view gets heard and each member of the team is part of the brainstorm conversation to come up with a way to honor and include each point of view, then these peacemaking skills will become second-nature to your kids,” Felder said. “On the other hand, if your family has a tendency to turn everything into a power struggle or a one-upmanship where the most angry or disruptive person dominates each time, then your kids will learn that intimidation and bullying are the ticket.”",
            "Build listening skills.",
            "“A significant amount of conflict arises from miscommunication,” said Sara Potler LaHayne, founder and CEO of the social-emotional learning provider Move This World. “Remind your kids what being a good listener looks like, including looking directly at the speaker, repeating for understanding, and asking questions rather than quickly jumping in with advice or interrupting.”",
            "Podcasts and audiobooks offer another way for kids to develop listening skills.",
            "It’s also important for parents to model good listening behavior in conversations with their children by making eye contact, confirming what the child said, and asking them clarifying questions, rather than making assumptions or rushing to judgment.",
            "“It’s about understanding, not proving you’re right,” Goodman said. “Take time to understand and to listen to the answers. Help children with how to ask questions and learn more ― I think of it as helping children to be curious about what the other person is thinking and why. For young children, it may just be teaching them to take turns, that they don’t always have to go first, or that two people can both be right from their point of view.”",
            "Identify coping strategies.",
            "Disagreements evoke strong emotions, so it’s helpful to give kids a roadmap for handling those overwhelming feelings. Age-appropriate calming strategies include mindful breathing, journaling, drawing or other forms of creative expression.",
            "“You can model and practice with your kids, ’When I feel no one is listening to me or no one is taking my ideas seriously, I usually take a few breaths and cool down my fire so that I can still be part of the conversation and not explode. Then I ask calmly and say, ‘I need some help here. Can someone help me find a solution that combines what I’m hoping for and what others are hoping for also?’” Felder explained.",
            "Parents can also teach their kids problem-solving strategies like compromising, negotiating, and brainstorming and testing out different solutions. Children may practice these skills at home with their siblings as well.",
            "Practice respectfully disagreeing.",
            "When disagreements arise, parents can walk their children through the process and offer guidance. Encourage them to communicate their feelings and perspective by using “I” statements, like “I felt sad when I heard that” or “I believe this is what happened.”",
            "“Teach children how to listen to another person’s idea without putting down the other person’s ideas and beliefs,” suggested Reena B. Patel, licensed educational psychologist, board-certified behavior analyst and author of “Winnie & Her Worries.”",
            "“Teach them to not make or take disagreements personally,” she added. “Stay on topic and do not bring in another person’s character trait when making a point.”",
            "Rupa Mehta is the founder of Subject of Self, a free social-emotional learning curriculum for kids. She developed an exercise to teach little kids to disagree and debate, starting with small topics that get them comfortable reflecting on, expressing and listening to opinions.",
            "“Ask your kindergartner whether they prefer chocolate or vanilla,” she advised. “Take a poll of everyone in your family, so your child can see that some people may have different answers and disagree on which is the ‘better’ flavor. Now take a trip to the freezer and do an inventory of your ice cream ― I imagine they will see an assortment of flavors that represent the different favorites of the people in their household, illustrating that even with disagreement, there can be harmony!”",
            "Use media.",
            "“Reading with your child is a great opportunity to discuss conflict resolution through literature,” LaHayne explained. “As you read together, you can ask questions like ‘What do you think this character is feeling? Why do you think they are feeling that way?’ You can also help your child relate the story or characters to themselves, asking questions like ‘Have you ever felt that way, too? Have you been in a similar situation before? If you were this character, what would you do?’”",
            "She recommended “Rulers of the Playground” by Joseph Kuefler as a great picture book that emphasizes conflict resolution. With older children, you can talk about current events in the news ― different sides of the issue at hand, ways to find solutions and good or bad examples of disagreement.",
            "“When children watch television or hear adults have conversations, they observe disagreements in action,” Patel said. “They are able to hear various sides and might even be creating their own opinions through these observations. This also helps with their self-confidence.”",
            "Make it a family activity.",
            "You can practice respectfully disagreeing and resolving conflicts as a family in informal settings.",
            "“Make it into a fun game and say specifically, ‘Let’s see how we can come up with an activity or a schedule or a dinner plan or what to watch on TV that takes into account the wishes of each person here. It’s gotta be a solution that each person contributes to and feels good about. We can do this!’” Felder suggested.",
            "“Kids are good at putting a jigsaw puzzle together,” he added. “In a similar fashion, the team project of peacefully including all the diverse viewpoints in the room is like putting a puzzle together where each of us has only part of the puzzle and needs the other parts to make it whole and complete.”",
            "Be patient.",
            "Again, developing the skills to navigate disagreements is a lifelong process. Don’t fret over heated arguments or other lapses in progress.",
            "“If one of your kids ― or one of the adult members of the household ― has a lot of fire inside and needs extra patience and coaching to be able to cool that fire and be part of a cooperative team, that’s OK,” Felder stated. “Please encourage each small step of progress that this intense individual achieves and reassure this volatile person that some of the great minds and great creative forces also had to make small steps of gradual progress to learn to be heard, included and successful as part of a team.”"
