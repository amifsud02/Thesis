That fall, he went online to change the address on his driver’s license.","Woods had been registered to vote at his old Travis County address. When he was updating his driver’s license, he also checked a box indicating that he wanted to register to vote in Harris County.","Election Day arrived about two months later and Woods called Harris County election officials to find out where his new polling place was. Even though he had checked that box online, they told him he wasn’t registered in the county. He decided to vote anyway by casting a provisional ballot, which ultimately was not counted.","It turns out that when Woods checked the box online, he hadn’t actually registered to vote. Instead, the Texas website had directed him to go to a separate website with a voter registration form that he was supposed to complete, print out and mail in.","On Friday, a federal judge in San Antonio ruled that process violated the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA), a 1993 federal law requiring state motor vehicle agencies to offer people the opportunity both to register to vote and to use their driver’s license application or renewal form as their voter registration form.","The Texas Civil Rights Project, which brought the lawsuit on behalf of Woods and three other Texas voters, argued in court that the state’s process was needlessly duplicative and unjustified because officials got all of the information they needed for voter registration when someone updated their driver’s license online. The civil rights lawyers pointed out that, unlike the online process with its extra form, Texans who renew their licenses in person or by mail need only check one more box to register to vote.","The group asked Chief U.S. District Judge Orlando Garcia to compel Texas Secretary of State Rolando Pablos (R) to “take all appropriate measures necessary to remedy the harm” caused by the registration system. From 2013 until 2015, more than 1,800 people had complained to Texas officials that they were unable to register to vote using the online system. The state has over 15 million registered voters.","Texas officials argued in court documents that the case was moot because each of the plaintiffs had since successfully registered at their new address and was able to vote in the 2016 general election. They said that Texas state law requires a voter application to be signed and that anyone who renewed their license in person or by mail would have to submit a written signature. And they contended that the NVRA deals only with registration practices for federal elections and that Woods had not tried to vote in a federal election.","Garcia ruled in favor of the plaintiffs on Friday and said he would issue a full opinion soon. Sam Taylor, a spokesman for the secretary of state, declined to comment on the ruling in Stringer v. Pablos.","But Beth Stevens, voting rights director at the Texas Civil Rights Project, praised Garcia’s decision in a statement. “For too long,” she said, “the state of Texas has ignored federal voting rights laws intended to ensure that all eligible voters have an opportunity to register to vote.”","Stevens told HuffPost that the ruling would affect the more than 1 million Texans who update their driver’s license in any given year and that her group also planned to target other state agencies that are required by the NVRA to offer people the chance to register to vote.","“This is the first huge step towards getting the state of Texas into compliance with the National Voter Registration Act that has been a long time coming,” she said."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ac529211e00008e0b7b09b8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"BLACK VOICES","headline":"Martin Luther King Jr.'s Daughter Reveals Topic Of Scathing Sermon He Never Got To Give","authors":"Taryn Finley","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/martin-luther-king-jr-children-reveal-scathing-sermon_us_5ac4ae7de4b063ce2e578e84","short_description":"Bernice King said the speech her father had planned before he died was titled \"America May Go to Hell.\"","date":"2018-04-04"},"articleContent":["Two of Martin Luther King Jr. ’s surviving children gave powerful sermons Tuesday from the pulpit their father stood at when he gave his final speech on April 3, 1968.","During the I AM 2018 event on Tuesday, Bernice King informed the audience at Mason Temple Church of God in Christ in Memphis, Tennessee, that she was going to go a bit off-script as the holy spirit moved her to invite her brother, Martin Luther King III, to stand next to her as she spoke. She said their brother Dexter King, though not physically present, was standing with them as well.","The youngest King child then went on to reveal that on the day he was assassinated, her father told his mother the title of his next address: “America May Go to Hell.”","“If you would permit me, I think as I look at the landscape of our world today, America may still go to hell,” Bernice King warned. “So 50 years later, I’m here to declare and decree not only must America be born again but it’s time for America to repent.”","She said America has fumbled its responsibility to deal with the three evils her father warned about: racism, poverty and militarism.","“We have not, in 50 years, dealt with, as daddy challenged us to deal with, the last vestiges of racism,” she said. “We must repent because daddy challenged us to deal with a second evil: poverty, which we have refused to confront in this nation.”","She added that militarism “has robbed us of the necessary resources to address the social injustices and the social ills and the social discrepancies in our nation,” noting that her father said countries who spend more money on military than social advancement are “rapidly approaching a spiritual death.”","With a cadence in her voice similar to her father’s, Bernice King challenged America to break its “vicious cycles” and praised the Parkland, Florida, students for standing up against gun violence and “social decay.” She also noted that it wasn’t by chance that the granddaughter of the civil rights leader stood onstage during the recent March For Our Lives rally to call for a “gun-free world.”","“We will get to the Promised Land, but each one of us has to make an individual decision to repent of our ways, repent for being drawn into the divisive discourse in this nation,” she said.","After hugging his sister, Martin Luther King III took command of the pulpit, asking his daughter and wife to join him. He said he stands where his father stood the night before his killing with “mixed emotions.”","He reminisced about the day his father left their Atlanta home to go to Memphis.","“I remember saying, ‘Dad, don’t go,’” he said. “But I remember more important, him saying, ‘Don’t worry, I’ll be back.’ Obviously, he did not come back in the traditional physical sense.”","Though admittedly emotional, he said he was also excited by the potential of his father’s dream being realized. He praised the Black Lives Matter activists, the crusaders of the Me Too movement and those standing up with the Parkland students for continuing his father’s fight.","Martin Luther King III recalled his daughter’s words a week ago at the March For Our Lives rally. He said he didn’t tell 9-year-old Yolanda Renee King what to say, noting that she asked then-President Barack Obama two years ago, “What are we gonna do about these guns?”","“Dad taught us,” he said, “that it only takes a few good women and men to bring about change. So I want to rush to tell you, do not get anyways tired. Why? Because we’ve come much too far from where we started.

The examination of this guidance is part of DeVos’ work as leader of a new Federal Commission on School Safety, although she has reportedly been thinking for months about rescinding the guidance.","Wednesday’s meeting, which took place on the 50th anniversary of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., involved leaders in some of the country’s most prominent civil rights groups, including the NAACP’s Legal Defense Fund, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and the Lawyer’s Committee for Civil Rights Under Law ― all of which are strongly in favor of keeping the guidance. Other participants included leaders from the nation’s largest teachers union, the National Education Association, as well as teachers from the advocacy group Educators for Excellence and education researchers.","Later on Wednesday, DeVos also met with groups, parents and teachers who want to see the guidance repealed.","Liz King, senior policy analyst and director of education policy for the Leadership Conference, described the morning meeting as “frustrating and underwhelming.” King spoke directly to Education Department officials about how this administration’s actions are having a negative impact on school climate, especially for LGBTQ and immigrant students. She urged DeVos to maintain the existing guidance.","“Our children deserve better than this administration,” said King, who described DeVos as “very pleasant,” although “she didn’t say much.”","Evan Stone, co-CEO of Educators for Excellence, left the meeting with a more positive view, although he still suspects advocates of the guidance are fighting an “uphill battle.” He was heartened that DeVos opened the meeting by acknowledging the large racial disparities in how students are disciplined. DeVos said she was moved by the stories from educators in the room, according to Stone.","Stone’s group requested that DeVos come visit some of the communities that have had positive experiences with the Obama-era guidance.","“Hopefully the lived experience of teachers who are working to change things will have an impact,” he said.","In a country where students of color, students with disabilities and LGBTQ students are disproportionately subject to harsh disciplinary practices, like suspensions and expulsions, the guidance is seen as a tool to help reduce the flow of students who are pushed from school into the criminal justice system. The guidance warns schools that they could be found in violation of federal civil rights laws if they are disciplining some groups of students ― like students of color or students with disabilities ― at disproportionately high rates. It also encourages schools to adopt restorative justice practices as a way to deal with discipline issues, rather than punishments that push kids out of the classroom.","On the other side of the issue, critics say the guidance helps keep disruptive children in the classroom, putting teachers and students at risk. The guidance came under renewed scrutiny after the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, in February, when conservative leaders speculated that lax discipline policies allowed the accused shooter’s behavior to go unchecked. (The school’s responses to the suspect’s behavior appear entirely unrelated to the guidance. The Education Department had also started meeting with critics of the guidance months before the shooting.)","But even before Wednesday’s meetings began, DeVos faced critiques from the advocacy groups and civil rights organizations that had not been offered a seat at the table. Groups like the National Women’s Law Center sent DeVos a letter slamming what they called “the exclusive and non-transparent approach” of the summit. The letter was co-signed by groups like the Human Rights Campaign and the National Center for Transgender Equality. It expressed the groups’ support for the guidance.","A number of other groups asked to be included in Wednesday’s discussion but did not receive an invitation. A representative from the National Disability Rights Network told HuffPost they asked the Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights for an invitation last Friday, but the agency declined. The Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates, a group that represents children with disabilities, also asked both the Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights and its Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services for an invitation, but did not hear back.","King said it was “was glaringly apparent there was no one from the disability community, the LGBTQ community, the Native American community, the Latino community, or the immigrant community in the room.”","Additionally, only one of the country’s major teachers unions was invited, with the administration leaving out the American Federation of Teachers.","“I find it very offensive that they don’t want to hear our opinions,” AFT President Randi Weingarten told HuffPost.","DeVos’ meeting with critics of the guidance included groups like the Manhattan Institute, as well as parents and teachers who believe the guidance should be rescinded. (The Education Department did not respond to HuffPost’s request for information about who would be present at this meeting.)","Nicole Landers of Baltimore County is one such parent. She says the relaxed disciplinary practices at her kids’ schools have come at the expense of student safety. Landers’ daughter was sexually harassed last year by another student when she was a fifth-grader. Her older son was bullied to the point where he became suicidal. Their tormentors, though, remained in the classroom, and she believes the Obama-era guidance helped make this situation possible.","“Whatever intentions were set forth in the guidance, the response to the guidance has been kind of knee-jerk in nature that has ended up hurting all of the children,” Landers said. “It takes away the rights from the victimized students, as the offending students are left in the classroom to avoid suspensions.”","This is a developing story.

But there are ways to keep fake news from spreading after a shooting.","Don’t spread information overheard on the police scanner.","In the moments after a shooting, law enforcement officials and first responders are trying to figure out what’s happening and whether a situation is escalating. Police scanners allow anyone, anywhere to listen to their conversations unfiltered. Their questions about a crime scene, their speculation about what might be coming next, all the comments made in the midst of a chaotic situation are on display ― including things that turn out to be totally wrong.","During the YouTube shooting, a first responder was heard on the scanner saying 37 individuals would need “triaging,” or medical attention. In reality, four people were treated for injuries ― three who were shot, and one who injured an ankle while running from the shooter.","But it was easy to find tweets that said 37 people were injured. Even some journalists and news outlets, like Newsweek, shared the line. (They later deleted their tweet.)","Law enforcement officials and first responders aren’t journalists. Their conversations immediately after a shooting are rooted in speculation, not fact.","Be careful how you label a shooting.","A lot can sound like “shots fired.” Cars backfiring and fireworks are two things commonly misreported as shootings.","Even when shots have actually been fired, that doesn’t always mean there’s an active shooter, or someone with a gun continuing to go after others.","Even when there is an active shooter, it doesn’t always mean anyone has been shot.","Even if a person was shot, it doesn’t mean the suspect is carrying out a “mass shooting,” the definition of which is not clearly defined. (An incident is commonly called a mass shooting if three or more people in a similar location are shot, though law enforcement and media outlets often use different standards for the term.)","Don’t assume you know the shooter’s motive.","Several outlets, including the Associated Press and CNN, reported the YouTube shooter was involved in a domestic dispute, which wasn’t true. Sometimes a shooter’s motive remains unclear for months, as is the case with the Las Vegas massacre.","Wait for an official confirmation before sharing a suspect’s identity.","With almost every major shooting in America come false reports of the shooter’s identity. Sam Hyde, a comedian, is almost always brought up as a “shooting suspect,” his image being shared so often The New York Times called it “an identifiable meme.”","Adam Lanza, who killed students at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, was found with his brother Ryan’s ID, leading several media outlets to initially report he was the suspect.","After the YouTube shooting, BuzzFeed’s Jane Lytvynenko kept track of hoaxes, including a tweet that claimed she was the shooter.","Don’t spread information overheard on the police scanner.","Seriously, don’t.","Take eyewitness accounts with a grain of salt.","People in stressful situations don’t always know the full details of what’s going on around them. Many only see one area of a much larger crime scene.","It’s common for law enforcement to investigate leads on multiple shooters after a mass shooting situation that was carried out by one person, thanks to conflicting reports from people who were there. But there’s almost always just one shooter.","Be careful when talking about the number of victims.","Numbers included in official statements from law enforcement statements and hospitals are often updated to more accurately reflect who was treated. And there’s often confusion about the extent of injuries during a shooting ― just because someone was injured doesn’t mean they were shot; just because someone was shot doesn’t mean they were killed.","Be mindful of where the media is getting its information.","Anonymous sources and eyewitnesses are commonly cited by journalists after a mass shooting. While that information can often help paint a picture of what’s unfolding, it can also be very, very wrong.","News outlets will often cite other news outlets’ reporting after a shooting, and it’s good to know the original source of any information you’re reading. A “fact” about a shooting may be widely reported, but only supported by one source talking to one outlet.","Don’t believe everything you see on Twitter.","Is the person tweeting new to Twitter? Do they normally post from the area where the shooting occurred? A few seconds of digging can help add clarity to who a person is and if they’re legit.","Doctored photos are often shared after mass shootings. You can find an image’s origin by doing a reverse image search.","After the YouTube shooting, one victim’s Twitter account was hacked. An individual posed as a YouTube employee to try and trick a HuffPost reporter into sharing false information. Don’t trust that people in your Twitter timeline have accurate information or good intentions.","Don’t spread information overheard on the police scanner.","I actually cannot say this enough.","Be careful about what you share.","Doctored Facebook posts and tweets with bad information spread like wildfire after a shooting. Before hitting the share button, make sure the information you’re flagging for your friends is accurate by taking a few seconds to fact-check. And remember the internet is massive ― things you share will be shared and shared and shared again, going way beyond your friends."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ac52a00200000d30ceb3e57.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"QUEER VOICES","headline":"Nate Berkus And Jeremiah Brent Unveil First Photos Of Their Son","authors":"Curtis M.

Four more just chose to run.","date":"2018-04-04"},"articleContent":["Andrew Bailey had toyed with the idea of running for public office in Kentucky for years.","A teacher at Fairdale High School in Louisville, Bailey figured he’d start small: maybe a seat on the Board of Education for Jefferson County Public Schools, the state’s largest school district, or perhaps a spot on Louisville’s Metro Council.","But Bailey never took the next step.","Then, last Thursday, the Kentucky Legislature passed a controversial bill making sweeping changes to the public pension system that guarantees teachers’ retirement plans. After months of teacher opposition, Republicans tucked the changes ― which included the conversion of pensions into 401(k)-style plans for new hires ― into a bill that had previously dealt with wastewater issues and passed the legislation mere hours later.","The move sparked outrage among educators, who staged a quasi-strike that forced school closures in at least 25 districts across Kentucky last Friday. Thousands marched on the state Capitol in Frankfort on Monday morning.","And Andrew Bailey finally launched that political career he’d long considered.","On Monday, Bailey filed paperwork with Kentucky’s Secretary of State to run for the state Senate seat held by Sen. Dan Seum, a Republican who had voted for the pension overhaul on Thursday night.","The pension legislation “was the catalyst that made me take that jump,” Bailey told HuffPost. “I’d never thought about running at the state Senate level. But you gotta go big or go home. It’s a chance to let them know there are political consequences.”","Bailey wasn’t alone: Across the state, teachers are seeking public office in numbers unprecedented in modern Kentucky history, political observers say. By the end of January, as the battle over their pensions intensified, more than 25 teachers had filed to run for office, with most of them running as Democrats.","Controversy over how the pension changes were pushed through has only exacerbated that phenomenon. In the days after the Thursday vote, three other Kentucky teachers joined Bailey in declaring their intent to run for state House and Senate seats held by Republicans who supported the pension changes.","On Monday, Mona Hampton-Eldridge, a teacher at Northern Middle School in Somerset, announced her intention to run against Republican Rep. Tommy Turner.","Nicole Britton, a teacher in Washington County, filed to run for the seat held by Republican Sen. Max Wise.","And Lydia Coffey, of Liberty, said she would take on Republican Rep. Daniel Elliott. Coffey is a retired teacher who protested the pension changes at the Capitol.","The four candidates who filed to run for office on Monday missed the filing deadline for Kentucky’s May primaries, meaning they will have to run as write-in candidates. That could make it nearly impossible to knock off the established incumbents they’re facing. Three of the four incumbents were unopposed until this week.","But that the teachers jumped into electoral races at all is a sign that the educators who rallied at the Capitol on Monday weren’t making empty threats when they screamed “Enough is enough!” and promised to do everything they could to defeat the lawmakers who’d voted for the pension changes.","Like Bailey, Hampton-Eldridge saw the pension vote as the “breaking point” that convinced her to run for office.","“I had to do something,” said Hampton-Eldridge, who has worked for the Pulaski County school district since 2001 and taught middle school since 2008. “You can only sit and fuss about it for so long before you have to do something. No one else is going to stand up for it. We have to do it for ourselves.”","Britton, too, decided amid the pension loss to take the plunge into politics, although she said she felt guilty that it took such upheaval for her to finally get involved.","“I’m a little bit sad it took that to get me to take on some civic duty,” said Britton, who has been a teacher for 12 years in Washington County. “But we’re here now and we are united, and one thing about teachers is, we work together very well.”","At least 10 candidates with backgrounds as teachers, professors or education professionals are running for state Senate seats as Democrats, according to Brad Bowman, communications director for the Kentucky Democratic Party. At least 33 such candidates are pursuing state House seats, he told HuffPost. (All four of the candidates who declared on Monday are Democrats, they told HuffPost.)","That total includes some incumbents, Bowman said, but the majority are teachers or education professionals seeking to unseat Republicans in a state where the GOP regained the governor’s mansion in 2015 and took control of both houses of the state legislature the following year for the first time in more than a century.","Though the pension fight has dominated headlines, teachers in Kentucky have also opposed attempts by Gov. Matt Bevin (R) and the Republican legislature to bring charter schools to the state, as well as various proposals to cut school funding in ways that teachers and administrators alike have said could further undermine school programs and public education in an already-struggling state.","“Our legislators, it feels like they just keep trying to cut us off at the kneecaps,” said Matt Kaufmann, a teacher at Moore High School in Louisville who is seeking the Democratic nomination to run against Republican Sen. Ernie Harris.","Kaufmann, who entered the race in January, said he was recruited by Save Our Schools, a movement that opposes the introduction of charter schools in Kentucky.","“We’re fighting for education as an institution. We’re fighting for our students and teachers who deserve good schools,” he said. “That’s why I’m running, and I think that’s why a lot of educators are running. We don’t have a choice.”","Bailey chose to go into teaching after studying architecture because teaching gave him the chance to “make a difference every single day.” But, he said, he hasn’t received new textbooks since 2008, forcing him to conduct his business classes largely without them. Most of his students, meanwhile, are on free or reduced lunch programs.","That’s made it hard to watch the governor propose drastic cuts to many education- and school-related programs, and even harder to listen to Bevin refer to teachers who opposed his agenda as “selfish” and “ignorant” people acting with a “thug mentality.”","Coffey, who taught middle school in Casey County for 27 years, said she initially considered a run for office in January before deciding against it. Bevin’s attacks on teachers, though, inspired her to change her mind.","“To sit back and say that we haven’t been demoralized, to treat us like we are not intelligent individuals ... I don’t think there’s an understanding of what it’s like to work in our classrooms, to work with students with all kinds of needs,” she told HuffPost. “We’ve never been attacked by the governor of our state. Whether it was a Republican or a Democrat, no one has ever attacked the teaching profession.”","Although some Republican legislators bucked Bevin on school funding ― the compromise tax and budget package passed this week did not include many of the governor’s proposed education cuts ― that rhetoric has also left teachers like Bailey and Coffey wondering if lawmakers in Frankfort really care about public education.","“I don’t feel they have our backs right now,” said Bailey, who has served as treasurer of the Jefferson County Teachers Association ― the union that represents teachers in Louisville ― and said he has assisted school board and other local election campaigns.","While the pension controversy pushed many of the new candidates into their races, they all said education issues wouldn’t be their only focus. Kaufmann and Hampton-Eldridge see the teachers’ fight as emblematic of broader problems facing working Kentuckians, especially after Bevin and Republicans implemented a so-called “right to work” law and repealed the state’s prevailing-wage laws in 2017.","“I’m standing up for the working people of Pulaski County,” said Hampton-Eldridge, whose husband works in construction and was affected by the prevailing-wage repeal. “I’m for the working common person.”","Britton, meanwhile, sees herself as part of a national movement of women who are newly running for office.

Almost daily, she shares advice, inspiration, and selfies with her more than 2,000 followers. But Instagramming was practically unthinkable for her a year ago.","Wiercyski, who has social anxiety disorder, felt almost panicky when she first started using social media.","“I would get incredibly anxious about something as small as leaving a comment on a friend’s post,” she recalls. “My heart rate would increase and I’d break out in a sweat. It really felt like an extension of being in a room full of crowded people.”","Maybe, on some level, you can relate. After all, most of us get a little shy around new people, or simply don’t like the thought of being judged by others. But for the 15 million adults affected by social anxiety, those feelings of shyness or fear of judgment are much more acute ― even paralyzing.","“Social anxiety is a mental, physical and emotional state of intense discomfort and nervousness, and even trepidation, that occurs in a social context,” said Teodora Pavkovic, a New York City-based psychologist. People with social anxiety are fearful of being humiliated or doing something “wrong” in front of others, she explained.","Now, in an age when technology allows us to communicate more (if not mostly) via taps of our fingertips, it might seem like it’s easier for those with social anxiety to interact with others. In some ways, it is. But the internet ― and social media in particular ― can also lead to new stressors and a deeper sense of isolation, creating a double-edged sword for the socially anxious.","On the plus side, social media can provide a “safe place” for people with social anxiety to post about themselves in a way that makes them feel comfortable by removing them from the immediacy of in-person conversation, Pavkovic said.","“Social media helps me to express myself in ways that I wouldn’t normally do in person,” Philtrina Farquharson, a PR professional who has social anxiety, explained. “I can say or do whatever I want and be free without reaping immediate consequences, unlike being in social settings.”","Wiercyski, the life coach, had to work through her own discomfort on social media to discover its benefits. She started taking small steps such as liking posts from companies or well-known influencers. “Then I shifted to leaving comments, and started to really build a community,” she says. “I’ve built a whole new community of people I know, trust, support, and who support me.”","But because those with social anxiety can become preoccupied with how they come across to others, they tend to worry excessively about how they’ll be judged online, Pavkovic explained. As a result, people with social anxiety tend to be passive users of social media ― meaning they’ll observe rather than post.","“They’ll scroll through others’ profiles and photos without leaving comments or posting content of their own, and seem to prefer private communication through social media, such as through direct messages,” she said.","Pakovic explained that these online connections don’t replace the benefits of offline friendships, though.","“Even virtual connections still require some level of back-and-forth,” Pakovic explained, “and given what we know about social media usage by individuals with social anxiety, they may not provide enough of that in order to form strong enough virtual friendships.”","“Science leaves us with no doubt that human beings require direct, live, face-to-face connections with other human beings in order to grow and develop to our full potential,” she said.","Research suggests that high social media use might prevent people from pursuing face-to-face interaction. Thomas Rodebaugh, a researcher at Washington University in St. Louis who focuses on social anxiety disorder, explained, “Some of our data shows that people spend time online as a way of avoiding interactions they might have otherwise.” Pursuing those interactions, he said, is key to overcoming feelings of anxiety around social interaction.","Finally, social media can make people with social anxiety feel even more left out. While we all experience FOMO ― or “fear of missing out” ― those with social anxiety can feel it to an extreme.","Jenna Salerno, a content writer for a technology company who also has social anxiety, says that in the past she spent too much time on social media and became overly focused on comparing her life to others’.","“Looking at friends who are out on a Friday night while I’m in bed scrolling through my news feed alone didn’t make me feel like I was living,” she said.","She’s now using social media less and less. “I find spending time with people in my real life is more important than watching from the sidelines,” Salerno said.","Wiercyski’s advice for others dealing with social anxiety in a technology-centric world: “Like most things in life, the basic rule is, if it’s not making you feel better, or you find it’s all you can think about, it’s time to take a break,” she said.","If you realize you’re feeling worse after using social media, or you simply don’t like how much time you’re spending on it, those are red flags you might want to cut back, Rodebaugh said. But know that reducing your social media dependency (just like quitting sugar, alcohol, or cigarettes) is not an easy task, Pavkovic said.","First and foremost, focus on “reconnecting with humans and nature,” she suggests. “Start off by arranging to spend quality one-on-one time with a friend, even if it’s just one friend a time.”","Next, try out some science-backed “brain hacks” that may help reduce your device usage, Pavkovic said. Some examples: Turn off all notifications to avoid those distracting “pings,” change your phone screen to greyscale to reduce the visual stimulation, or keep the phone in an adjacent room so that it doesn’t lure away your attention (even when it’s off!).","Finally, Pavkovic highly recommends deleting all social media apps from our phones, which prevents you from mindlessly opening the apps whenever you need a “quick fix.”","Wiercyski said that a few times a month, she’ll notice an anxious feeling while scrolling through her Instagram feed and comparing what she sees to her own life. “At that point, I know it’s time to sign off,” she said, “even if only for the evening, and focus on something else, like hanging out with friends or reading.”","Where To Find Support And Help","The internet doesn’t only have to be a scary place for those with social anxiety. It’s also a place to find help. There are many online resources that provide information, resources and connections with others dealing with social anxiety.","If you have social anxiety or you’re interested in learning more about how to support those who do, check out the following organizations:","The Social Anxiety Institute: This Facebook group shares advice, tips and more information about social anxiety.

What’s going on here?”","You can test yourself here:","In another experiment, only 2 of 38 adults named “g” when they were asked to list letters with two lowercase forms, and only one could write both.","“We would say: ‘There’re two forms of g.

Respondents were asked to speak each word aloud, then researchers requested that they write the letter. Half wrote the opentail form anyway, and while the rest attempted the looptail g, only one wrote it correctly.","“Our findings give us an intriguing way of looking at questions about the importance of writing for reading,” McCloskey said. “Here is a naturally occurring situation where, unlike most letters, this is a letter we don’t write.

With books and decor lines, a physical mecca in Texas and near-constant paparazzi coverage of its stars, “Fixer Upper” was everywhere, so firmly lodged in the pop culture landscape that it was hardly just wall dressing.","This week, the cultural phenomenon that was “Fixer Upper” came to an end after five seasons on the network. Now, diehard viewers are left wondering: How did a show about remodeling captivate our attention for so long? And how will HGTV fill the farmhouse-shaped hole in its programming? HuffPost spoke to a few HGTV representatives and professionals in the world of home improvement entertainment to find out.","In a nutshell, Chip and Joanna Gaines represented exactly what Scripps Network (now under Discovery) was looking for at the time: compelling, character-driven content for a channel previously populated only by background noise. The story of charismatic, goofy Chip and his style-minded, shiplap-loving wife, Jo, wasn’t just meant to be viewed in bulk on the weekends, the low-volume hum of equipment dulling your tired senses. It was meant to be appointment television, wooing viewers eager to catch up with the Gaineses to a steady Tuesday night slot.","“We’ve moved beyond where I think the network was in terms of being wallpaper programming,” Allison Page, the general manager of programming at HGTV, told HuffPost. “I don’t say that submissively, because it was very successful to have the network be something that people just wanted on in the background, and I think it still works on that level, but I think now that we have true stars and real hits, those have become more appointment programming.”","So what are the markings of appointment programming in the home improvement realm?","“These programs are about redemption and hope,” Page said. “They’re about making something beautiful, they’re about fixing what is broken [and] honoring the history of something while making it work in the present day. They’re stories about pride in the work and essentially building communities and creating spaces where people can live their best lives.”","Between unexpected reno complications and subway tile selection, Chip and Joanna offered glimpses of their personalities, values and life at home with their “kiddos.” They became full-fledged characters on-screen, and their partnership proved irresistible for viewers.","The Gaineses harnessed the “redemption and hope” narrative better than most ― to their own advantage. “No one gets it more than Chip and Jo. That show did for them what everyone knows it’s done for them,” explained John Feld, senior vice president of HGTV programming. “They have this incredibly thriving business in Waco now, and that’s the benefit. ... We put them in a situation which was like, ‘Can you give us this amount of episodes and a few more next season?’ And they knew what the benefit of that would be and they worked twice as hard.”","Indeed, Chip and Jo’s combination of personality and design aesthetics ― Farmhouse sinks! Wood beams! Concrete countertops! Motivational wall art! ― captivated fans well beyond the HGTV platform. Viewers were first introduced to the Gaines family through their Magnolia renovation and design business. During their time on the network, the family would go on to launch the large Magnolia Market in Waco, home to their bakery, the Silos Baking Co., where people can shop or relax in a physical environment carefully curated by the Gaineses. The duo also released their own seasonal lifestyle magazine, Magnolia Journal, and just last month opened a breakfast joint, Magnolia Table, to rave reviews.","On top of that, they have a home decor line at Target, and their books The Magnolia Story, Capital Gaines and the upcoming Magnolia Table have (or likely will) all hit The New York Times bestseller list.","But it wasn’t Chip and Jo who approached HGTV with the idea of “Fixer Upper.” The idea to take on the worst house in the best neighborhood and make it a client’s dream home ― that was the network’s.","“We knew we wanted to make a show called ‘Fixer Upper’ that basically followed a real-life family-owned company where people were working with homeowners to find the worst house on the block and make it the most beautiful house on the block,” Page explained. “We gave the production company casting money, and then they hired scouts and used their own internal teams to set a really wide net.”","The team’s casting department eventually found a blog post featuring Joanna’s work and filmed a demo reel with her and her husband, who ended up booking the gig due to their requisite skill set, natural on-air chemistry and prime location.","“One of the values we thought would be compelling in a show like this would be being in a smaller town where there’s a very strong sense of community and where housing prices are reasonable. That’s part of the ethos of HGTV,” Page said. “While we do occasionally shoot in New York or LA, a larger percentage of our programming is somewhere in the middle.”","As a result, the Gaineses have provided not only themselves with an exorbitant amount of, well, wealth, but have made Waco a Disneyland-like destination for home and design obsessives. Over 30,000 people flock weekly to Magnolia Market. In its first week alone, Magnolia Table and its menu of tater tots, lemon-lavender doughnut holes and avocado toast drew crowds of hundreds. It’s no wonder that the couple decided now was an ideal time to hang up their on-screen tool belts.","“We’re just going to take a break, we’re going to enjoy our family, we’re going to step back, really focus on our businesses, and what God has blessed us with, and then we just can’t wait to see what the future holds. We really are extremely optimistic,” Chip told HuffPost last fall.","Of course, while Chip and Jo excelled beyond imagination in the world of lifestyle programming, HGTV amassed a healthy roster of ubiquity TV talent outside of “Fixer Upper” (like “Property Brothers” Jonathan and Drew Scott, who predate the Gaineses on the network’s roster).","″‘Fixer Upper’ took it to another level, but I think we built a foundation of a few hit shows,” Page said, recalling the first iteration of “Flip or Flop,” which also became optimal viewing thanks to its now-divorced hosts, Tarek and Christina El Moussa. (The show launched a franchise with six new iterations.)","“Beyond that, I think now we have ‘Home Town’ [with Ben and Erin Napier] and ‘Good Bones’ [with Karen E. Laine and Mina Starsiak] showing that same kind of intent of view, so we’re absolutely just trying to build on that, with all the other chapters of ‘Flip or Flop,’ knowing that we trained an audience to know there was going to be a premiere episode on Thursdays for 52 weeks a year rather than 20 weeks a year.”","In other words, HGTV is staying focused on talent-driven shows in the same vein as “Fixer Upper.” But professionals in the home-building and design worlds would like to see the network switch things up a bit, or try going back to the gimmick-free, wallpaper basics.","New York-based interior designer Rayman Boozer of Apartment 48 says he’d like to see a “Design 101” type of program where viewers can simply get the useful home improvement information they need.","“I’d love to see a reboot of ‘Dear Genevieve,’ or something similar,” he told HuffPost, referencing “Trading Spaces” alum Genevieve Gorder’s show, in which she helped lucky homeowners redesign a run-down space in their house. “I’d also like to see a show that goes back to basics: Show a real-life interior designer providing realistic ― cost-effective and available ― advice and sources. In each episode, the viewers could explore fabric showrooms, furniture and flooring shops, etc. No gimmicks.”","Amber Lewis, on the other hand, wants the network to feature higher-budget homes and convey the often-pricey truth about construction, real estate and design.","“In my opinion, the biggest problem with HGTV is that it’s completely unrealistic. The budgets are so under market value for what it actually costs to get work done,” the CEO and lead designer of California-based Amber Interiors told HuffPost. “It would be refreshing for them to update their price points and get with the times! No bathroom costs $5,000 to completely remodel, and not a single kitchen on earth can be remodeled in a couple weekends with a $10,000 budget! How about high-end, large-budget projects and a host that shows the back end of how that’s done, almost like a ‘Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous,’ just no Robin Leach, or caviar wishes and Champagne dreams!”","For Page and Feld, the most important thing is to give the audience what it wants: an escape.","“The viewers see us as this comfort food, especially in times of upheaval and turmoil and whatever else is going on in the world,” Feld said of the network. “Our goal is just to continue giving them those projects, and especially those people who they can feel are likable and who they trust to do the things that relax them every evening. There’s nothing tense or anxiety-causing in our programming.”","Page agreed.","“What’s so special is this is a channel that’s more than the sum of its parts,” she said. “It’s more about ‘I love HGTV,’ whereas you look across the cable landscape and you’ll see a hit here or a hit there. It’s less often ‘I love this entire meal.’”","Luckily, dessert is still on its way. Beyond the reruns that will inevitably follow the finale, Joanna is set to premiere a new 30-minute series, “Fixer Upper: Behind the Design,” in the coming weeks. Like any good ubiquity TV stars, the Gaineses aren’t really going anywhere."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ac4106a2000002d00eb3caf.jpeg?cache=DmQ2aXs0Rg&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Researchers Discover Common Thread Among Christians Who Voted For Trump","authors":"Carol Kuruvilla","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/researchers-discover-common-thread-between-evangelicals-who-voted-for-trump_us_5abbd15ae4b04a59a313c5ea","short_description":"This could explain why some evangelicals are willing to overlook that Trump is not a choir boy.","date":"2018-04-04"},"articleContent":["Social scientists have a number of theories on why President Donald Trump captured the votes of 80 percent of white evangelical Protestants in the 2016 election, much more than his support from any other religious group. And the president still enjoys the approval of 78 percent of white evangelicals, according to a recent Pew Research Center survey.","Some researchers have theorized that the economic anxiety of the working class may explain the Trump support, while others cite white Americans’ fears about “cultural displacement.”","In a recently published study, a team of sociologists claims there’s another common thread that could explain why some evangelicals are willing to overlook behavior they would typically condemn as immoral, including multiple allegations of sexual impropriety.","Andrew Whitehead, a sociologist at Clemson University, told HuffPost the key is Christian nationalism.","Christian nationalism is an ideology that fuses Christians’ love of God and country. It hinges on the narrative that the United States has a special covenant with the Christian God.","This ideology has emerged at various times in U.S. history, but a distinct, aggressive iteration seems to have materialized in the Trump era, according to a Think Progress report. This most recent version rejects secular society and seeks to restore America’s identity as a “Christian nation” by leveraging Christians’ influence in the public sphere. Some of Trump’s strongest evangelical supporters believe the president was divinely chosen by God to help them achieve the goal of a Christian nation.","Whitehead said his research indicates that Americans who believed in several key tenets of Christian nationalism had a strong likelihood of voting for Trump. This was true even when the research team controlled for other influences, like political ideology and party affiliation.","The findings suggest that Christian nationalism is a “unique and independent influence” that led to the Trump presidency.","“Christian nationalism provides a metanarrative for a religiously distinct national identity,” the researchers write in an article published in the journal Sociology of Religion in January. “And Americans who embrace this narrative and perceive threats to that identity overwhelmingly voted for Trump.”","Whitehead, working alongside sociologists Joseph O. Baker, of East Tennessee State University, and Samuel L. Perry, of the University of Oklahoma, used data from the latest Baylor Religion Survey. This wide-ranging, mailed survey was conducted months after the 2016 election, from Feb. 2 to March 24, 2017. It included a national, random sampling of 1,501 American adults.","The researchers used participants’ responses to six statements to measure affinity to Christian nationalism:","“The federal government should declare the United States a Christian nation.”\n\n“The federal government should advocate Christian values.”\n\n“The federal government should enforce strict separation of church and state.”\n\n“The federal government should allow the display of religious symbols in public spaces.”\n\n“The success of the United States is part of God’s plan.”\n\n“The federal government should allow prayer in public schools.”","The researchers included a few control variables, including responses to the Baylor survey that measured participants’ economic satisfaction, sexism, racism, attitudes toward undocumented immigrants and views of Muslims. To make sure that Christian nationalism isn’t acting as a proxy for political conservatism or religiosity, the team also included controls for things like party affiliation, conservative religious beliefs and religious practice.","What they found was that, even after controlling for these other influences, Americans who supported five of those statements and rejected the one on church-state separation were much more likely to have voted for Trump.","While political identity and race were the overall strongest predictors of Trump votes, the researchers found that Christian nationalism was the most significant religious predictor. The ideology also had an effect across party lines.","For example, a Democrat who held views consistent with Christian nationalism was three times more likely to vote for Trump than a Democrat who didn’t hold such views. On the other hand, Republicans who scored low on the Christian nationalism index were less likely to vote for Trump.","Whitehead told HuffPost that voting for Trump was an outlet for what Christian nationalists perceived as the religious backsliding of the country. It also allowed them access to the most powerful position in the world: the U.S. presidency.","Before the election, the Trump campaign put together an advisory board of some of the nation’s top evangelical leaders to provide feedback on issues that are important to evangelicals. After the election, the group has taken on a more informal role, but key leaders maintain close ties to the administration and are regularly asked to provide their opinions.","Access to this type of power leads Christian nationalists to “forgive and forget all sorts of moral shortcomings,” Whitehead told HuffPost.","That’s why he’s doubtful that Christian nationalists’ support for Trump will be shaken by allegations of infidelity, such as those brought forward by adult film star Stormy Daniels. (Daniels claims she had an affair with Trump in 2006, about a year after Trump and his wife, Melania, were married.)","“For Christian nationalists, the end goal is a society that favors Christianity in various aspects and at a number of institutional levels,” Whitehead told HuffPost. “How that project is achieved is of little consequence to them. They believe God can use anyone, ‘even a thrice married, non-pious, self-proclaimed public playboy,’ as we say in the paper.”","Robert Jones, CEO of The Public Religion Research Institute, told HuffPost that Whitehead’s study is consistent with his own research. In The End of White Christian America, Jones wrote that evangelicals have recently grown anxious about the declining dominance of white Christianity in America, both demographically and on such culture war issues as same-sex marriage.","It’s important to acknowledge that the nationalism Whitehead documents in the study is not just Christian, he said, but specifically white Protestant Christian.","“The idea of a Christian nation in American history has always been wrapped up with protecting the power of whiteness and Protestantism,” Jones said. “The KKK, for example, targeted not just African-Americans but also Catholics and Jews as threats to their ideal of American society. And this study presents one more important piece of empirical evidence that this idea is still with us.”","Penny Edgell, a sociologist of American religion at the University of Minnesota, also pointed out how the study illustrates the connections between race and religion in the U.S. Edgell, who reviewed Whitehead’s research for the Sociology of Religion, said the study shows why scholars and the media need to stop treating American evangelicalism as a unified whole.","“As social groups, White evangelicals, Latinx evangelicals, and African-American evangelicals largely go to different churches, belong to different non-church religious organizations and networks, vote differently, have different policy preferences, have different political ideologies, and understand contemporary social problems (like racism and economic inequality) very differently,” Edgell wrote in an email. “By implying more unity than actually exists, media and scholarly accounts that talk about ‘evangelicals’ as a group generally privilege the views and experiences of White evangelicals. And that’s a problem.”","Another strong predictor of a vote for Trump in Whitehead’s study was anti-Muslim sentiment. The researchers were able to measure the survey participants’ attitudes toward Muslims by analyzing their responses to the following statements:","“Refugees from the Middle East pose a terrorist threat to the United States.”\n\n“Muslims hold values that are morally inferior to the values of people like me.”\n\n“Muslims want to limit the personal freedoms of people like me.”\n\n“Muslims endanger the physical safety of people like me.”","Whitehead and the other sociologists involved in the study found that anti-Muslim sentiment was strongly correlated with Christian nationalism.","Paul Froese, director of the Baylor Religion Surveys, told HuffPost that Christian nationalism has long been used as a pillar of anti-immigration sentiment in American politics. In the 1950s, Christian nationalists used this ideology to help inspire anti-Communist sentiment, arguing that communism threatened to make the U.S. both socialist and atheist.","“With anti-Muslim sentiment in the U.S. at an all-time high, I expect that Christian nationalism will be used to justify fighting Islam around the world (perhaps as we tried to battle communism during the Cold War),” Froese told HuffPost.","Although white Christian America is in demographic decline, the researchers believe Christian nationalism is not reducible to or strictly defined by white Protestant Christianity. As a result, this ideology can influence narratives and actions beyond institutional religion.","Whitehead said this means that, even though the number of white Protestant Christians is decreasing in America, Christian nationalism will continue to play an important role in American politics.","″[Christian nationalism] is a religious cultural expression that is not beholden to any particular religious tradition,” Whitehead said. “Therefore, even as white Christian America continues to decline demographically, Christian nationalism will continue to be a force in social life and political life.”","Rev. Jim Wallis, a progressive evangelical activist, told HuffPost that Christian nationalism has done “tremendous damage” to the overarching mission of evangelical Christianity, which he believes is to bring “justice to the poor and oppressed.”","White evangelicals have a responsibility to make racial justice central to their faith, he said.","“Those of us who still identify as white evangelicals and don’t support white Christian nationalism need to lift up the voices of evangelicals of color and lift our own voices up to say that being a follower of Jesus means rejecting Christian nationalism and embracing care for the most vulnerable and the image of God in everyone,” Wallis said."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5abbf4e51e000008087b0034.jpeg?cache=QqYm3WOZ9E&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Kaley Cuoco Explains Why Her Ex-Husband 'Ruined' Marriage For Her","authors":"Carly Ledbetter","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kaley-cuoco-ryan-sweeting-cosmo_us_5ac4d242e4b093a1eb210ee1","short_description":"\"And that wasn’t my fault ― that was his.\"","date":"2018-04-04"},"articleContent":["Kaley Cuoco is calling out her ex-husband, former professional tennis player Ryan Sweeting, for nearly ruining marriage for her.","“I honestly thought I wouldn’t get married again,” the “Big Bang Theory” star says in the May issue of Cosmopolitan. “My ex ruined that word for me.

Under the agreement, more than 16,000 would resettle in other countries, largely in Europe. The rest would receive legal status in Israel.","By Monday night, however, Netanyahu had walked back the announcement, saying on Facebook that the deal would be put on hold until further review. On Tuesday, he announced the deal was dead.","“I have listened carefully to the many comments on the agreement. As a result, and after I again weighed the advantages and disadvantages, I decided to cancel the deal,” Netanyahu said, according to a statement.","The Israeli prime minister’s reversal came after a backlash from right-wing politicians and some residents of southern Tel Aviv, where many Eritreans and Sudanese have settled.","Most of the Eritrean and Sudanese people living in Israel have fled war and persecution in their countries of origin. The area of southern Tel Aviv, where many reside, is “economically challenged” with “unemployment and social tension,” UNHCR spokesperson William Spindler told HuffPost on Monday.","Spindler said that Eritrean and Sudanese people in Israel should be considered refugees, not migrants, as they left their homes to escape persecution and war. He also noted that Israel, as the receiving nation, has only in a very few cases processed and officially designated the migrants as refugees.","“It is with regret that UNHCR notes cancellation by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of the Israel-UNHCR Agreement,” the U.N. agency wrote in a statement on Tuesday. “We encourage the Government of Israel to consider the matter further, while standing ready to be of help.”","The deal between Israel and the UNHCR, which was to be carried out over the next five years, had rested on the agency’s ability to relocate some 16,000 of the refugees to “developed” countries where the agency has resettlement programs ― including in Europe, the U.S., Canada and Australia, Spindler told HuffPost.

Jewish leaders have repeatedly urged the White House to fill the post, and this week they renewed their push.","The Anti-Defamation League, a national human rights organization, sent a letter to Trump on Monday calling on him to name a new special envoy to monitor and combat anti-Semitism.","With such hatred escalating globally, ADL CEO Jonathan A. Greenblatt wrote that the U.S. needs its “voice on anti-Semitism around the world.”","“That voice has been silent for the past fifteen months,” Greenblatt wrote.","Established by the Global Anti-Semitism Review Act of 2004, the special envoy position was most recently filled by Ira Forman, former executive director of the National Jewish Democratic Council. Forman served from May 2013 until Jan. 20, 2017, when, like many other top State officials appointed by President Barack Obama, he was let go.","Past special envoys have provided input on anti-Semitism for State Department reports on human rights and religious freedom. The office also held trainings for individuals embarking on foreign postings so they would know how to identify anti-Semitism and what to report to the State Department.","“These are things that don’t happen unless someone is responsible in the State Department for making sure it happens,” Hannah Rosenthal, who served as the special envoy before Forman, told reporters last year.","Although the office still has a presence on the State Department website, its final two remaining employees were reportedly reassigned in July 2017.","“Mr. President, by nominating a respected and effective advocate, you will be reasserting America’s moral leadership against anti-Semitism and reassuring Jewish communities that America stands with them and their ability to live securely as Jews wherever they are,” Greenblatt wrote on Monday.\n\nThe ADL’s renewed call to fill the position comes at a time of heightened anti-Semitism around the globe. Last week, thousands of people took to the streets across France to decry the murder of an 85-year-old Holocaust survivor whose death authorities have linked to anti-Semitism.\n\nIn the U.K. last month, Jewish leaders said they would march to Parliament after Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn failed to assuage their concerns about his defense of an offensive anti-Jewish mural in 2012.\n\n“The data confirms the anger and concern of these communities,” Greenblatt’s letter stated. “Violent anti-Semitic assaults increased 34 percent in Britain according to the Community Security Trust in 2017, and according to the French Ministry of the Interior, increased 26 percent in France during the same period.”\n\nIncidents of anti-Semitic rhetoric and attacks have also hit Poland, Sweden, Tunisia and Iran in recent months.\n\nIn the U.S., trends that indicated an anti-Semitic spike around the time of the 2016 presidential election have persisted. A report published by the ADL in February showed that the number of anti-Semitic incidents rose nearly 60 percent in 2017, marking the largest single-year increase the organization has ever recorded.\n\nTrump’s administration has been fairly cavalier about the dangers of anti-Semitism, at times even peddling ugly stereotypes and conspiracy theories that promulgate bias. Then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said last summer that he believed a special envoy dedicated to fighting anti-Semitism would actually interfere with the government’s efforts to combat bias.\n\nA State Department official told HuffPost on Tuesday that although the envoy position remains vacant, “the Office of International Religious Freedom at the Department of State continues actively to support the mission of that office.”\n\n“Combating anti-Semitism internationally is a priority for this administration,” the official said. “President Trump and Vice President Pence have publicly expressed their deep concern about high levels of anti-Semitism globally.”\n\nThis story has been updated with the State Department’s response."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ac3cbd71e00008e0b7b07a2.jpeg?cache=WjJeKYQChe&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"A Third Woman Is Suing To Break A Trump-Related Nondisclosure Agreement","authors":"Alanna Vagianos","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jessica-denson-is-suing-to-break-a-trump-related-nda_us_5ac3873ae4b04646b6465f8a","short_description":"Jessica Denson says she experienced sexual harassment while working on Trump's 2016 campaign.","date":"2018-04-03"},"articleContent":["Jessica Denson, the former head of Hispanic outreach for President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign, is suing his campaign organization in an attempt to nullify a nondisclosure agreement she entered into while working for Trump.","Denson, 32, began working for Trump’s campaign in August 2016 and sued for $25 million in New York state court in November 2017, claiming that her campaign managers “defamed her, harassed her and discriminated against her,” Bloomberg reports.

Today it is a civil rights museum.","date":"2018-04-03"},"articleContent":["The Lorraine Motel was a piece of Tennessee history long before it was known for being the site of Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination in 1968, but the motel’s story couldn’t be separated from that tragic night.","The Memphis site originally was an all-white establishment known as the Windsor Hotel, founded in the mid-1920s. In 1945, the one-story hotel was bought by Walter and Loree Bailey and became a haven for African-American travelers. A business that blacks could once only be welcomed inside as domestic workers soon became a symbol of black entrepreneurship.","The Baileys’ motel was featured in The Negro Motorist Green Book, or the “Green Guide,” which aided black travelers looking for a place to stay when Jim Crow laws made it near impossible to find accommodations.","The Lorraine was a thriving black-owned business before King’s murder and before becoming the National Civil Rights Museum, museum President Terri Freeman told HuffPost.","“It was a fun place,” Freeman told HuffPost. “It was a place where [Stax Records] artists used to hang out because the black artists, you know, the Stax artists were an integrated group that couldn’t stay together at a lot of places. So they used to come to the Lorraine.”","Everything changed the night King went out onto the balcony by Room 306.","Loree Bailey, the motel’s namesake, suffered a stroke hours after King was shot and died five days later, when the world buried King. Walter spent the next 14 years trying to keep the Lorraine afloat, and never rented Rooms 306 or 307 again.","The motel couldn’t sustain itself after the tragedy. As the years went by, the Lorraine fell into disrepair and became a popular spot for prostitutes to rent rooms as the neighborhood declined. Walter Bailey filed for bankruptcy in 1982 and died six years later.","“But what was happening, apparently, was that even when the building was chained up and boarded up, people were coming and would put a wreath up on the balcony,” Freeman told HuffPost. “And people would come to the museum just to view from outside, where this great peacemaker was shot down. And so there were business people in this community that realized it was important to preserve this place because history had occurred.”","People organized and privately fundraised the money to keep the historic motel from the auction block in an effort to create what is now known as the National Civil Rights Museum.","The Lorraine Motel officially closed in 1988 to undergo renovations so that the site could be reopened as a museum three years later. In 2002, the foundation that owned the museum bought the boardinghouse across the street, where it was said James Earl Ray rented the room from which he assassinated King.","After a $27.5 million renovation four years ago, the National Civil Rights Museum now has 24 exhibits that tell different stories of the American civil rights movement. The Lorraine Motel is a gatekeeper of history, chronicling the journey of black Americans from the time their ancestors were taken from Africa to the day of King’s untimely murder.","The story of the Lorraine somewhat parallels the story of black Americans, Freeman says, from the days when blacks were banned, to the time it became a bastion of black success and then to fall to tragedy. And now today, it has become a phoenix risen from ashes.","“When I think of the 50 years that have passed since the murder of Dr. King, I think that, where we are in society today, it’s not happenstance that we’re seeing what we’re seeing today with the Me Too movement, the Black Lives Matter movement, the Never Again movement,” Freeman told HuffPost. “All this stuff happening 50 years after this very, very significant event, things are ordered in the universe.”","Taryn Finley contributed reporting this article."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ac1721d1e0000fb077b04bb.jpeg?cache=DtJ8hbIfxV&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"SPORTS","headline":"Villanova Dominates Michigan In NCAA Championship Game, Its Second Title In Three Years","authors":"","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/villanova-dominates-michigan-in-ncaa-championship-game_us_5ac2f88ee4b09712fec3a064","short_description":"Donte DiVincenzo came off the bench to pour in a game-high 31 points.","date":"2018-04-03"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Pizza, Pad Thai And Pot: Home Delivery Of Marijuana Is Legal In These States","authors":"Stateline, Editorial Partner","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/marijuana-home-delivery-legal_us_5ac38d8ce4b03e351a21219e","short_description":"Supporters say allowing home delivery of marijuana will reduce drugged driving and help put illegal sellers out of the market, but opponents say it could make it easier for kids to buy drugs.","date":"2018-04-03"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Oklahoma Teachers Continue Walkout, Shutting Down Schools For Second Day","authors":"Dave Jamieson","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/oklahoma-teachers-continue-walkout-shutting-down-schools-for-second-day_us_5ac3b1ace4b00fa46f86ff50","short_description":"They say they won't return to work until lawmakers meet their demands.","date":"2018-04-03"},"articleContent":["Thousands of Oklahoma teachers descended on the state Capitol in Oklahoma City for the second straight day Tuesday, demanding that legislators restore school funding after years of deep cuts and stagnating salaries.","Most school districts around the state remained closed for the day, while many went ahead and announced they would remain closed for at least the rest of the week. The momentum at the Capitol on Tuesday suggested teachers were game for a prolonged walkout until lawmakers passed a package they would accept.","The Oklahoma Education Association, the teachers union coordinating the strike, criticized the state House of Representatives for not moving on legislation Monday, when teachers first filled the Capitol to protest. The chamber went into a special session on Tuesday in an effort to resolve the dispute.","“This disrespect from lawmakers only drives the anger and frustration of teachers and education supporters, and it’s why Oklahomans from every corner of this state have no trust in this legislature,” the union’s president, Alicia Priest, said in a statement.","Oklahoma joins other red states where teachers are rebelling after years of austerity. Teachers in West Virginia went on a nearly two-week strike in late February and early March, eventually winning a 5 percent pay raise. Meanwhile, teachers in Kentucky shut down schools on Friday and Monday to protest proposed cuts to their pension plans. Arizona teachers are planning a statewide walkout as well.","The common thread in these stories is weak investment in public schools. Most states were forced to cut funding during the Great Recession, but some went on to cut taxes in the recovery that followed. That has led to severe budget crunches, leaving states without revenue to put into classrooms and teacher salaries.","Oklahoma is dealing with a severe teacher shortage, and many districts have moved to four-day school weeks in order to save money. The state’s teachers rank among the lowest-paid in the country.","It’s extraordinarily difficult for Oklahoma to bring in more revenue through tax increases, because any tax hike requires a three-fourths supermajority in both chambers of the Legislature. Republicans control both houses as well as the governor’s office.","Nonetheless, lawmakers managed to pass an education funding package last week that would bring teachers an average $6,100 raise. But teachers said the bill did not do enough to guarantee general school funding, and the state House undermined the package by quickly voting to repeal one of its main features, a tax on hotel and motel stays.","The Oklahoma Education Association has made some concrete demands in order to get teachers back on the job. The Legislature, the group said, must plug the funding holes in its package passed last week, and bring in more revenue by eliminating a capital gains tax break and allowing an expansion of gambling in the state.","“We have made clear and simple asks for additional funding for students,” Priest said. “Oklahoma is better than this, and educators will continue to walk out until we get a deal that our students deserve.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ac3b2391f00002d0016c3bb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Trump Says U.S. Will Use Military To Protect Border With Mexico","authors":"Steve Holland, Reuters","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-border-military_us_5ac3b24ae4b09712fec51bff","short_description":"The president said he discussed the idea with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.","date":"2018-04-03"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Taylor Swift Stalker Gets 10 Years' Probation","authors":"Ron Dicker","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/taylor-swift-stalker-gets-10-years-probation_us_5ac3528be4b09712fec41394","short_description":"Frank Andrew Hoover threatened to \"end all the Swifts.\"","date":"2018-04-03"},"articleContent":["A man who violated a restraining order and threatened to kill Taylor Swift was sentenced to 10 years’ probation on Monday, according to news reports.","Frank Andrew Hoover, who pleaded guilty to defying the lifetime protective order, will be monitored by GPS surveillance for at least a year, and must keep at least a mile away from the singer and her family, TMZ reported.

Many of those attending King’s memorial service and his funeral were, of course, nationally known ― activists, preachers, politicians, artists, athletes and others who had been by King’s side at countless marches and rallies through the years. But many, many more of the tens of thousands who lined Atlanta’s streets or walked behind the mule-drawn casket were “average” Americans: men, women, and children who came from around Atlanta and around the country to pay their final respects, in person, to a man who gave his life in the struggle for freedom, justice, and peace.","Here, in rarely seen pictures from the private service at King’s own Ebenezer Baptist Church and from the far larger public memorial afterward at his alma mater, Morehouse College, FOTO offers a portrait of that day ― a profile of a community in mourning, and yet unbowed.","In a tribute to women of the Civil Rights Movement, Joy Reid reminded FOTO that Coretta Scott King once \"had ordinary dreams of being a famous entertainer, and instead she became the mother of the movement.

He’s frequently switched political parties, won over some traditionally Democratic voters and attacked well-regarded members of the GOP. Many establishment Republicans disavowed him, while others hoped his heterodox views ― antithetical to many pro-business elites ― could reshape politics.","But as president, Trump has mostly governed as a traditional Republican leader. His rhetoric may sound different, but his biggest accomplishments and policy initiatives are, at the end of the day, almost completely in line with an orthodox GOP agenda ― with more of an emphasis on nationalist policies.","Trump didn’t execute some hostile takeover of the party; he was readily welcomed by many in the rank and file as its chief, and his administration has already fulfilled many items on its wishlist.","“President Trump has absolutely governed as a Republican,” said Boris Epshteyn, a former Trump aide who is now chief political analyst at Sinclair Broadcast Group. “The president has had success on a wide range of fronts which are key to the Republican and conservative agenda, including deregulation, tax reform, decimating ISIS, repealing [Obamacare’s] individual mandate, reforming immigration, etc.”","“It is also important to note how involved the president has been in supporting Republican candidates throughout the country and working to keep GOP majorities in the House and the Senate,” he added.","The most significant accomplishments under Trump have as much to do with Congress as they do with the president. Legislatively, Trump’s biggest win was the tax cut law that delivered a massive permanent reduction for corporations. While Trump aides helped craft the legislation, it was something that congressional Republicans like House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) have been preparing for years ― long before Trump ran for president.","Trump also nominated Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, ensuring that conservatives continue to hold the majority on the bench. But the reason Trump was able to choose a justice at all was thanks to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who refused to let the chamber vote on President Barack Obama’s nominee when Antonin Scalia’s death created a vacancy in early 2016.","And in filling the high court vacancy and others in lower federal courts, Trump has leaned heavily on recommendations from the Federalist Society, which has a deep network of conservative legal talent.","While Trump came in promising to “drain the swamp,” his lack of political experience has allowed the swamp to thrive. Lobbyists, special interest groups and even foreign nations have been able to find ways into the administration.","Trump initially appointed a number of outsiders to his cabinet and top staff. Recently, however, he has begun turning to Republican insiders and former GOP officials who are more ideologically aligned with the party establishment. Larry Kudlow, his new top economic adviser, is a long-time free trade and tax cut advocate. John Bolton, his new national security adviser, previously served as United Nations ambassador under President George W. Bush and is one of the most hawkish voices in American foreign policy who has fiercely defended the Iraq War.","A policy area where Trump has most radically broken with Republicans is on trade. Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum, as well as additional steep tariffs on China, has spooked markets and sparked fears of an impending trade war.","While congressional Republicans have warned about the negative effects of Trump’s tariffs, few have indicated they will support legislation to nullify them. China, meanwhile, retaliated against the U.S. on Monday by imposing tariffs on 120 types of commodities, which is expected to primarily affect American farmers.","“In many ways Trump is governing as a traditional Reaganite ― less government regulation, less taxes and a stronger military,” Trump confidante and Newsmax CEO Chris Ruddy said. “Even on trade, Reagan was a hawk and Trump tapped his key trade [representative], Bob Lightizer. Trump often stakes out positions more extreme than Reagan, but observers should see this as a negotiating tactic for him. With Trump, always look at results and the bottom line; they tend to be quite reasonable and good.”","Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) agreed with the Reagan comparison, but said Trump put more emphasis on “things that have changed.”","“I think he would approve of Trump’s nationalism about controlling immigration and focusing on merit based immigrants,” Gingrich said. “Reagan had defense, economic growth and the deficit in that order and the recent Trump signature of the spending bill followed the Reagan pattern. Trump’s aggressive trade policy would have been understandable to Reagan because the world has changed. When the director of national intelligence in 2015 said China had stolen $460 billion in intellectual property in one year you clearly have to rethink your trader policies.”","The George W. Bush wing of the party, in contrast, was “more globalist and more anti-deficit.”","Trump often gives members of his party heartburn when he praises Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin. But he recently listened to his staff and agreed to expel 60 Russian spies and diplomats, the largest such expulsion in U.S. history. The move drew rare praise from lawmakers of both parties.","“This fits the pattern of our policy toward Russia in the Trump administration,” John Herbst, a Russia scholar at the Atlantic Council, told The Washington Post. “If you just look at policy, this administration has taken steps the Obama administration was not willing to, such as supplying antitank missiles to Ukraine. The president’s heart doesn’t seem to be in it, but for whatever reason, he’s willing to go along with his advisers.”","Immigration is perhaps the top issue that animates Trump’s base ― and therefore himself ― but he’s hardly the first GOP politician to use it to appeal to voters. During his 2010 re-election bid, for example, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) starred in a memorable ad in which he walked along the U.S. border with Mexico and urged then-Sheriff Paul Babeu to “complete the danged fence.” In 2012, GOP presidential contender Mitt Romney urged undocumented immigrants to “self-deport.” And just last week, Romney said as a Senate candidate in Utah that undocumented immigrants who came into the country as children shouldn’t be allowed to obtain legal status at all.","Trump recently signed a $1.3 trillion government funding bill into law that will greatly increase the federal deficit by raising spending for domestic and military programs. During the Obama administration, Republicans railed against the federal deficit and called for cutting spending. But the fact that the omnibus sailed through was less a result of Trump being a new type of president then the reality that Republicans no longer need to make the deficit a political issue now that they have a GOP president.","On gun policy, Trump stunned lawmakers earlier this year when he publicly embraced several gun control measures and shot down GOP priorities like concealed carry reciprocity. He even, shockingly, said he would be fine taking away people’s guns without their permission, and told members of Congress that they should be willing to stand up to the National Rifle Association.","Shortly thereafter, however, order in Trump’s Washington was restored: The Republican president had realigned himself with conservative priorities and abandoned talk of pushing lawmakers to pass broader gun control proposals.","And on social policy, Trump has continued to restrict abortion access and block advancements for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, staying in the space where Republicans have traditionally fallen.","“On most of the issues, the policies of this administration have fallen under traditional Republican policy,” GOP strategist and former Republican National Committee spokesman Doug Heye said. “This is seen not only in the measures advanced by the administration ... but also in the personnel that the administration has brought on board.”","“That’s why many who [were] critical of Trump in the campaign are now backing him to the hilt,” Heye added. “It’s also why members of Congress, many of whom are privately critical of the administration, are putting their heads down and focusing on their committee or subcommittee. They know that this may be their best opportunity to fulfill long-held policy goals.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ac2847e1e0000fb077b05b9.jpeg?cache=AEDpULnP2z&ops=crop_18_162_4482_2804%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"COMEDY","headline":"'Spokespuppet' Kellyanne Conway Can't Stop Leaking On 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!'","authors":"Lee Moran","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kellyanne-conway-puppet-jimmy-kimmel_us_5ac33276e4b04646b645a672","short_description":"Eww.","date":"2018-04-03"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Americans Don’t Really Care About Trump’s ‘Great Wall’ ― But His Base Sure Does","authors":"S.V.

(Six percent said they believed it had already happened.) More Trump voters named the promise as a top three priority than anything else but his vow to “drain the swamp” in the nation’s capital.","It is precisely those loyal supporters whom Trump may be on the verge of alienating by failing to get funding for the wall in a $1.3 trillion spending bill he signed late last month.","“He lied to us. He lied to us all. He betrayed us,” said William Gheen, head of the hard-line group Americans for Legal Immigration. “He’s jumped into the D.C. swamp like it’s a Mar-a-Lago hot tub.”","Overall, only 30 percent of Americans think Trump will be able to build a wall and make Mexico pay for it, while 49 percent think he will fail. Only 13 percent of Americans generally rank the wall in the top three promises Trump made. Among Trump voters, the latter figure is nearly three times as high: 37 percent.","Mark Krikorian, of the similarly hard-line Center for Immigration Studies, said the lack of wall funding in the spending bill, which runs through Sept. 30, wouldn’t have been so bad had it not been for the large spending increases in other areas, including those favored by Democrats.","“If he was enjoying success more broadly, then the disappointing parts of this bill wouldn’t have that sting,” Krikorian said. “There’s no question that this is going to de-motivate a significant number of people. You can’t put up with betrayal forever.”","Trump appears to understand how poorly the spending bill has gone over with his base, which may be why he has spoken out so aggressively about the wall over the past week ― even, at one point, trying to get the military to pay for it out of its budget. (On Tuesday, he even suggested he might post troops along parts of the border until the wall gets built.)","“Embarrassingly stupid,” a Republican adviser close to the White House said on condition of anonymity. “Over a year in, just signed a $1 trillion spending bill and now whines about having the Army do it.”","Stan Collender, who for many years worked on Capitol Hill as a budget committee staffer, said he cannot see the Defense Department going along with a major reallocation of its funds. Nor can he see Congress going along with it, which it would need to do.","“He said Mexico was going to pay for the wall, and they turned him down,” Collender said. “Plan B was for Congress to pay for it, and they turned him down. Plan C is that he wants the Pentagon to pay for it, and they’re almost certainly going to turn him down.”","As the military option seemed to fizzle, Trump instead began claiming ― falsely ― that construction of his wall has already begun.","“We started building our wall. I’m so proud of it. We started. We started. We have $1.6 billion, and we’ve already started,” he said during a speech last week in Ohio. “And you saw those beautiful pictures, and the wall looks good. It’s properly designed.”","Those pictures he referred to were included in a message sent from Trump’s Twitter account the previous day: “Great briefing this afternoon on the start of our Southern Border WALL!”","The tweet included photos of a tall “bollard” fence under construction in Calexico, California. It is replacing a shorter existing fence, and the work has been planned for years. (It is unclear, however, whether Trump personally wrote or directed that tweet and added those photos. The president is not known to gather images or video from the internet on his own.)","Meanwhile, the newly passed spending bill contains only $641 million to build 33 miles of barrier along the border between Mexico and the United States in areas that are currently unsecured. That total includes 25 miles of “levee” fencing along the Rio Grande and eight miles of pedestrian fence. The remainder of the roughly $1.6 billion is to repair and replace existing fence or to upgrade other border security measures.","And completely absent from the discussion is the idea of Mexico paying for the project ― something that Trump promised hundreds of times on the campaign trail.","While most of his campaign positions were drafted weeks or months into his presidential run, Trump’s promise to build a structure along the southern border was a central point in his June 2015 announcement speech.","“I would build a great wall, and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me, and I’ll build them very inexpensively,” Trump boasted. “I will build a great, great wall on our southern border. And I will have Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words.”","That vow drew an enthusiastic response, and Trump began including it in his standard stump speech. Often it would be in a call-and-response format, with the candidate asking, “Who’s going to pay for the wall?” and the crowd shouting, “Mexico!”","The vow did not go over well with Mexican leaders, and that country’s president, Enrique Peña Nieto, reportedly canceled a recent planned visit to the White House over his adamant refusal to stop saying that Mexico had no intention of paying for Trump’s wall.","Whether the funding element of Trump’s wall promise matters to his political base is unclear. The HuffPost/YouGov poll did not separate wall construction generally from the idea of Mexico paying for it. According to a Quinnipiac University poll from last May, 52 percent of Republican voters believed Trump would eventually find a way to make Mexico pay for the wall, while 39 percent did not and 10 percent did not know.","Some top Republicans wonder how meaningful these figures really are, pointing out that Trump has already suggested that renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico should count toward his wall funding promise.","“Trump will likely argue that his great deal-making regarding NAFTA will prove that Mexico paid for the wall,” said one Republican National Committee member on condition of anonymity.","“Some of the polling I’ve seen indicates that voters don’t even care if it’s a bricks-and-mortar wall or a ‘virtual’ wall,” said GOP pollster Neil Newhouse. “They simply want our borders intact.”","But Gheen, of Americans for Legal Immigration, said Trump’s strongest and earliest supporters are quite clear about what they want.","“Millions of Americans were very serious about Donald Trump’s promises,” said Gheen, who noted he went to great effort to attend Trump’s inauguration because he was so enamored of the new president. “When they were chanting about building the wall, they weren’t joking around. It wasn’t some type of pep rally.”","Trump likely has only one chance left to make things right with his base before the November midterm elections. The new spending bill expires at the end of the federal budget year on Sept. 30. Congress will have to pass an extension or an entirely new spending plan prior to that deadline, and Trump last week appeared to signal that he intends to use that opportunity to demand his wall.","“On September 28th, we go further and we’re getting that sucker built,” he said. “And you think that’s easy? People said, ‘Oh, has he given up on the wall?’ No, I never give up.”","Whether Trump would be willing to shut down the government if Congress fails to give him his wall money remains to be seen. He wasn’t willing last month, and doing so at the end of September could reflect poorly on Republicans just five weeks before Election Day.","One former Trump aide, though, said he might not have a choice. If Trump fails yet again to get his wall, his most loyal supporters might just skip voting entirely, the aide said on condition of anonymity.","“Does he put his base to sleep for the midterms?” the former aide said. “Half of his base is pissed off because of the wall, and the other half is pissed because ‘Here we go again.’”","Use the widget below to further explore the results of the HuffPost/YouGov survey, utilizing the menu at the top to select survey questions and the buttons at the bottom to filter the data by subgroups:","The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted March 28-29 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.","HuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

Nelson, and two top counselors.","Nelson announced proposals to build seven new temples, which would bring the total number of planned temples to 189 worldwide.

But two agencies tasked with enforcing the nation’s immigration laws — U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) — have long attracted criticism for failing to release documents and data in a timely manner, if at all. That makes it hard for journalists, advocates, lawyers and the public to keep tabs on what the administration is doing.","Under the law, the government is supposed to grant or deny Freedom of Information Act requests (which any member of the public can file) within 20 working days, with some exceptions, and provide records unless the information is legally exempt from disclosure.","But if you file a FOIA request with ICE or CBP, you may find yourself in a bureaucratic morass: Fighting a faceless online portal (with CBP), watching your request ping-pong between agencies or sub-agencies, getting summarily rejected, struggling to talk to a human (ICE switched to an email-only system about two years ago), and waiting months — or more than a year — to get back a document that may be heavily redacted, according to HuffPost interviews with requesters. Some say they must resort to litigation to get any meaningful response.","Despite progress, “there are key FOIA program challenges that remain,” acknowledged Philip Kaplan, the chief FOIA officer at the Department of Homeland Security, (which encompasses CBP and ICE), in a report dated February 2018. He cited technological limitations, staffing and budget constraints, and a spike in litigation as some of the issues.","ICE’s response times are “terrible” and “unpredictable,” in the experience of Susan Long, co-director of the TRAC Research Center at Syracuse University, which provides comprehensive data about federal enforcement activities. CBP, she’s found, is “somewhat better” and “actually attempting to provide useful information.”","Starting in early January 2017, shortly before Trump’s inauguration, ICE “stopped providing a lot of the key indicators that would allow you to examine the agency’s performance,” she said — and the agency’s responses have “gone downhill from there.”","The co-directors of TRAC filed a lawsuit last year charging ICE with unlawfully withholding certain records.","Complaints about delays and secrecy at ICE and CBP — as well as other federal agencies — long predate Trump. But his administration set a new record last year for censoring, withholding or claiming not to find records across the federal government, according to the Associated Press.","And with immigration policies shifting quickly, FOIA is “more critical than ever as far as understanding ... what policies this administration is pushing and why,” said Mark Fleming, associate director of litigation at the National Immigrant Justice Center, which provides legal services to immigrants.","“Even if you disagree with them, as a democracy, we need to know why,” he added.","Under Trump, requesters say they have run into challenges using FOIA to get information about issues key to his immigration platform. For example:","Requests about communications related to Trump’s proposed wall on the U.S.-Mexico border have gone unfulfilled. Requests for records illuminating CBP’s local implementation of the “Muslim Ban” executive orders led to lawsuits; over a year later, requesters say they are are still awaiting a complete response from the agency.","Another requester said he wasn’t able to get information about the companies that responded to a call for providing a new detention center for undocumented immigrants — or the location of the proposed facility. Still another couldn’t get copies of more than a dozen “commonly used” immigration enforcement documents — and says he still hasn’t received them after winning an appeal.","Last month, TRAC received a response from ICE that withheld all requested records identifying the law enforcement agency that was sent an ICE detainer request, and another response that withheld the name of the DHS program responsible for taking the immigrant into custody, Long said.","Multiple requesters told HuffPost they believe ICE has short-circuited requests quickly of late.","The agency’s practices and policies are “in line with federal FOIA law,” an ICE spokeswoman told HuffPost. She also said ICE “works diligently to complete requests in a timely manner,” but acknowledged that “given the sheer volume of requests received coupled with their complexity, delays are inevitable.”","On average, the ICE FOIA office receives 1,400 to 1,500 requests per week, the spokeswoman said. The agency has contracted with a service to assist with the backlog of requests, with the goal of eliminating those cases before the end of the fiscal year (Sept. 30).","ICE has about 50 employees responsible for FOIA processes, and the agency granted at least partial information in the majority of cases during the 2017 fiscal year, according to the recent DHS report.","John Sandweg, who served as ICE’s acting director in the Obama administration, said he found the agency to be “pretty good” in responding to FOIA requests, in that sometimes the agency would disclose a lot of information ― sometimes more than he expected. In many cases when ICE didn’t provide data, it didn’t have the information, he added.","“Whether you’re pro-enforcement or you’re anti-enforcement, the public debate could be much better informed if ICE’s data collection and reporting operation was improved,” Sandweg told HuffPost.","A CBP spokeswoman said that “due to the large volume and increasing complexity” of requests the agency receives, “delays are inevitable.” She said that requests to CBP’s FOIA office increased roughly 88 percent from the 2014 fiscal year to fiscal 2017.","The office has about 55 employees and granted full or partial information in about 42 percent of its cases in fiscal 2017, according to the DHS report.","Many requesters don’t blame hard-working FOIA officers for the troubles with FOIA responses, but say that transparency needs to get the same focus that other parts of an agency do.","“Congress should be deeply concerned when an executive agency basically flouts federal law,” said Mitra Ebadolahi, a Border Litigation Project staff attorney with the ACLU. She said that, among other reforms, there needs to “potentially be more robust sanctions for delay and obstruction, and that would need to be legislated, so that there’s an enforceable remedy.”","Under FOIA, agencies are also supposed to put frequently requested information online. With certain documents related to issues like the travel ban or separating families at the border, “they should just post that on their websites, it shouldn’t even be a FOIA process because you know that’s what people want,” said Ron Nixon, The New York Times’ homeland security correspondent.","Melissa del Bosque, an investigative reporter who has covered the U.S.-Mexico border since 1998, said journalists face significant obstacles shedding light on Trump’s immigration policies, as more and more people are put in detention.","“We’re just going to see a lot more abuse, hunger strikes, people with much, much longer detention sentences probably, who haven’t had their cases heard yet ... and it’ll be harder and harder for us as journalists to find them, or to be able to document their stories,” del Bosque said.","“It’s pretty bleak,” she added.","Want to send an immigration-related tip that gets faster attention than a FOIA request? scoops@huffpost.com"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ac399c21e00008e0b7b073b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"17 States Sue Trump Administration Over Census Citizenship Question","authors":"Sam Levine","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/states-sue-citizenship-question_us_5ac3968be4b04646b6468483","short_description":"The proposed question raised concerns that minority communities would be discouraged from responding, leading to less congressional representation and federal funding.","date":"2018-04-03"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Donald Trump Mocked After He Can't Quite Describe The White House","authors":"Ed Mazza","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-white-house-tippy-top_us_5ac2ddeae4b04646b645698e","short_description":"\"There really is no name for it.\"","date":"2018-04-03"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"BLACK VOICES","headline":"Denmark’s First Public Monument To A Black Woman Pays Homage To Revolt","authors":"Jenna Amatulli","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/denmarks-first-public-monument-to-black-woman-pays-homage-to-revolt_us_5ac3899ce4b04646b64666c2","short_description":"The statue puts the country’s ugly colonial history on display.","date":"2018-04-03"},"articleContent":["Denmark just got its first public monument to a black woman, and it flips the script on the country’s dark colonial past.","The nearly 23-foot-tall statue titled “I Am Queen Mary” made its public debut in Copenhagen on Saturday.

A page appearing to be Aghdam’s personal website also listed her frustrations with YouTube, saying, “there is no free speech in real world & you will be suppressed for telling the truth that is not supported by the system.”","Aghdam’s family told reporters on Tuesday night that they feared she might try to target the company.","“She was always complaining that YouTube ruined her life,” her brother, Shahran Aghdam, told The Mercury News from the family’s home in Menifee, California.","The Aghdam family said they felt “shock” and “can’t make sense of what happened yesterday” in a statement provided Wednesday to Jason Martinez, a local ABC reporter, and Craig Fiegener, a reporter for local radio station KNX 1070.","“We are praying for speedy recovery of the injured and ask God to bestow patience upon all persons hurt in this horrific senseless act,” the statement read.","The shooter’s father, Ismail Aghdam, said he reported his daughter missing on Monday after family members were unable to contact her and that he told police he suspected she might be going to YouTube. Police in Mountain View ― about 30 miles from the YouTube campus ― said they had found Aghdam sleeping in her car around 2 a.m. Tuesday.","Aghdan went to a local gun range later that morning, police said Wednesday. They did not identify which range she went to. Hours later, police would discover Aghdam’s body inside the YouTube office following the shooting.","Graeme MacDonald, a 41-year-old product manager for Walmart eCommerce, watched the scene unfold from the fifth floor of his office building, roughly 1,000 feet away from YouTube HQ.","“I had come back from lunch and there were a couple people running in to get on the elevators,” MacDonald told HuffPost. “They were visibly shaken. They had heard gunshots.”","MacDonald said he saw an estimated 20 people evacuate YouTube with their hands over their heads around 1 p.m. local time.","“They looked scared,” he said. “There are helicopters are going by overhead. Evacuees were brought over behind our building. They’ve been telling us to stay away from the windows. ... It’s Silicon Valley. It’s a high-stress sort of area, but it still shocks me because there’s not a gun culture here at all.”","Law enforcement officials received numerous 911 calls around 12:45 p.m. local time reporting gunshots at the YouTube offices. Upon arrival, officers discovered a “very chaotic” scene as numerous employees fled the building.","“One person had a gunshot wound as we arrived,” Barberini said. “Several minutes later, while conducting a search of the premises, officers encountered a second individual with a gunshot wound that may have been self-inflicted. We are still working on confirming that. Two additional victims were located several minutes later at an adjacent business.”","The active shooter situation was resolved by 2:20 p.m. local time, San Bruno City Manager Connie Jackson told HuffPost. “The situation is safe, although the public has been asked to stay away.”","Vadim Lavrusik, a product manager for YouTube Live, and Dan Afergan, a software engineer for the company, both tweeted about the shooting on their campus.","Lavrusik said he heard shots and was barricaded inside of a room with his co-workers. Less than 20 minutes later, Lavrusik said he had been safely evacuated from the building.","Google, which owns YouTube, said it was working with authorities. There are about 1,700 people who work in the YouTube office, according to ABC 7 San Francisco.","Security at the Google office in Mountain View, California, 30 minutes south of YouTube’s headquarters, is typically strict. Employees who bring in guests are required to sign them in before entering the building.","At YouTube’s San Bruno office, people can freely enter the reception area, but need to be signed in before entering employee areas.","In a series of tweets, Todd Sherman, a product manager for YouTube, said he was in a meeting when he heard people running in the offices.","He said he first thought it was an earthquake, then he saw more people running.","“We headed towards the exit and then saw more people and someone said that there was a person with a gun,” Sherman wrote.","“At that point, every new person I saw was a potential shooter,” he added. “Someone else said that the person shot out the back doors and then shot themselves.”","While heading toward the building’s exit, Sherman said he saw “blood drips on the floor and stairs.”","Outside, he said, police officers had hopped out of their cruisers with rifles ready.","“I told them where the situation was as I headed down the street to meet up with a couple team members,” Sherman said.","YouTube CEO Susa Wojcicki thanked first responders and law enforcement for reacting quickly to the shooting in a tweet shared hours after the shooting.","“There are no words to describe how horrible it was to have an active shooter at YouTube today,” Wojcicki wrote. “Our hearts go out to all those injured and impacted today.

The stench is strong from the collapsed wall of the latrine he is shoring up, a dozen paces from his family’s makeshift home.","Wani, a 35-year-old father of three, fled from his small farm in South Sudan in 2016 when soldiers torched his village. He trekked with his family for four days on narrow forest paths to the Bidi Bidi refugee camp in neighboring Uganda.","More than a million refugees ― a population twice the size of Miami ― have arrived in Uganda since civil war broke out in South Sudan in 2013. Last year, the conflict spiraled into a man-made famine, and the United Nations warned that the situation was “fertile ground” for genocide.","The South Sudanese refugee crisis could soon be Africa’s biggest since the Rwandan genocide of 1994, and few of the displaced people hope to return home anytime soon. The Bidi Bidi camp, one of a series of refugee centers in northern Uganda, houses some 280,000 people. For several months in 2017, it was listed as the world’s largest refugee camp. No longer accepting new arrivals, it is transitioning into a settlement for long-term residents. But the flow of refugees continues into the surrounding area.","Around the world ― from regions as varied as the Middle East, Southeast Asia and Central Africa ― staggering numbers of people have fled their homes in recent years to escape war, persecution, or political instability. Over 2.6 million of them live in officially recognized refugee camps, according to the U.N.","Proper sanitation and health care are major challenges in these camps, and the diseases waiting there can be as deadly as the conflict the refugees left behind.","Tens of thousands have been killed in over four years of South Sudan’s war. But researchers who have studied conflict worldwide suggest that the number of indirect deaths could be 15 times higher than those who died in actual fighting, and disease and sickness are a core part of that. (There are no precise figures for the number of deaths in Bidi Bidi due to disease.)","At the same time, there is a pernicious misconception that when refugees flee, they bring diseases with them and sicken uninfected populations. The World Health Organization is clear that there is no systematic association between refugees and disease. Instead, the problems that refugees face are common to all who struggle in poverty.","The risk of disease increases when refugee populations are severely impoverished, like those coming from South Sudan. Many people arrived in Bidi Bidi, for example, with nothing but the clothes they had on.","“With a large number of displaced people living in close proximity, with poor water, sanitation and hygiene conditions, it leads to a risk of waterborne diseases,” said Lisa Nelson, the Uganda country director for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is supporting efforts to monitor health in the camps scattered across the forests and farmlands of northern Uganda.","For Wani’s family, like many recent refugees in Uganda, the top priority was building a shelter from fierce sun and hard rains. A family might dig out a latrine or construct a toilet much later. Many people in Bidi Bidi use communal latrines.","Aid agencies are trying to encourage households to maintain their own toilets and latrines. But it can take weeks to get new arrivals set up with a waste system that functions properly.","“We made a toilet last month, but it was destroyed in the rains,” Wani said, resting in between shoveling. “Then we dug another, but it just filled up with water. This one will be stronger, I hope.”","In this sprawling settlement, cholera, hepatitis and typhoid fever ― all associated with exposure to human fecal matter ― are big risks. With large numbers of children together, measles is also a worry. And about a third of the cases seen by camp doctors involve malaria, which is spread by mosquitoes who breed in standing water.","Wani’s 2-year-old son was sick with a fever when he spoke to HuffPost. “The doctors say it is malaria,” Wani said. “This place has so many mosquitoes about.”","The health care system in South Sudan was already in ruins from its decades-long war of independence from Sudan, but the new nation’s civil war has made things worse. Almost all of the major neglected tropical diseases recognized by the WHO are found in South Sudan. These frequently misunderstood illnesses tend to strike the poorest, most marginalized populations with the least access to health services. They include blinding trachoma, certain types of intestinal worms, and the ferocious visceral leishmaniasis fever. In recent weeks, South Sudan has declared an outbreak of Rift Valley fever, a viral disease that can cross from animals to humans, and reported suspected cases of meningitis.","Uganda, which has a far more robust health system, has been more successful in keeping these diseases at bay. But the risk grows with the limited care and paper-thin resources in refugee camps like Bidi Bidi. Communities already weakened by war and forced from their homes are more vulnerable to disease. All crowded camps face threats of infection, although the nature of the disease changes from place to place.","For example, refugees fleeing Syria last year struggled with an outbreak of cutaneous leishmaniasis, a parasitic disease spread by sandflies that causes boils and lesions.","“A refugee camp is a hotbed for disease,” said virologist Dr. Julius Lutwama, deputy head of the Uganda Virus Research Institute, a government-backed center that tracks disease. “Congregation is one of the biggest problems for transmission.”","Soon after the South Sudanese refugees arrived, the Ugandan government handed out plots of land to each family in Bidi Bidi and the surrounding camps. The scrubland was enough to build a small hut and carve out a patch to plant crops.","But there was a reason the land here was sparsely populated. When the rainy season comes, some areas turn into bogs.","Water and sanitation experts are trying to help the people who live in these settlements. Red Cross volunteers advise on the best way to construct latrines to withstand Uganda’s heavy rainy season and offer practical guides to installing handwashing stations and digging pits for trash. Yet overstretched doctors can barely cope with the flood of patients who come in every day.","Dr. Ogwal Daniel, working for the International Rescue Committee, runs the largest clinic in the Palabek camp, which unlike nearby Bidi Bidi is still expanding with new refugees. The one doctor and a team of nurses see over 100 patients each day.","“You have to make do with what you have,” Daniel said, waving at his clinic, a wooden frame with plastic sheeting for the roof and walls. On the other side of the flimsy structure, a baby with a malaria fever wails as a nurse slides a needle into his arm.","“Of course, we could always use more, but we adjust to the situation,” Daniel said.","This article is part of HuffPost’s Project Zero campaign, a series on neglected tropical diseases and efforts to fight them."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5abe53351f0000270616bf10.jpeg?cache=VSlVM4Y8fw&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"WEIRD NEWS","headline":"Man Seeks Mercy From Hotel That Banned Him After Seagulls Trashed His Room","authors":"David Moye","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hotel-room-seagulls-apology_us_5ac3d815e4b0ac473edad8ff","short_description":"It's a wild story that involves a suitcase full of pepperoni, large incontinent birds and a heartfelt apology.","date":"2018-04-03"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Jenna Fischer Wore A Towel On 'Jimmy Kimmel' After A Wardrobe Malfunction","authors":"Carly Ledbetter","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jenna-fischer-towel-jimmy-kimmel_us_5ac3c59ee4b09712fec54899","short_description":"\"Mentally, I’m a little freaking out that I’m on a talk show in a towel,\" she said.","date":"2018-04-03"},"articleContent":["Jenna Fischer didn’t mean to end up in a towel during her appearance on “Jimmy Kimmel Live” on Monday, but she certainly made the best of it.","At the start of her segment, the “Office” actress walked out to greet Kimmel in a white towel, jeans and heels.

Her mother, Coretta Scott King, headed to the airport the next day. When Coretta returned to Atlanta on April 5, 1968, Bernice and her siblings were taken to the airport to meet her and board a plane.","There would be no more dinners with Daddy. No more showering him with kisses when he came back from a trip. This was her introduction to death.","“My mother realized at that point she hadn’t prepared me,” Bernice told HuffPost during a recent phone interview. “And so, she had to explain to me that, ‘Your daddy’s dead, when you see him, he’s going to be laying in a casket. He won’t be able to speak to you, and his spirit has gone to live with God.’”\n\nOn April 9, the day of the funeral, Coretta played a portion of the sermon her husband had delivered just two months prior at Ebenezer Baptist Church, in which he prophetically gave his own eulogy.\n\n“And again, remember, she told me he couldn’t talk to me, but a child knows their dad’s voice,” Bernice said, recalling her mother’s lesson about what spirits were through a simple hug and “Mommy loves you.” “So I started looking around for him.”","Even days after his death, the civil rights leader managed to deliver a timely message at his own funeral. Previous assassination attempts, FBI surveillance and constant threats didn’t make it too impossible for King to foresee his own killing. But his teachings brought wisdom and foresight that carry on ― even 50 years later.\n\nThe question has been asked time and time again, quite possibly more recently than ever before: What would King say if he were alive to see the world today?\n\nAccording to his daughter, he’s already said it.\n\n“Dr. King, who fought against ... what he called the triple evils of poverty, racism and militarism, is very relevant to us now, and I think we need to heed some of the things that he was trying to instruct us on while he was with us,” Bernice said.\n\nThe minister fought many battles during his lifetime. He helped challenge racism in the South with boycotts, sit-ins and marches in the spirit of what’s known today as Kingian Nonviolence. For over a decade, King put his life on the line during these demonstrations and was instrumental in bringing forth the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts.","King was more than a dreamer. He gave about 450 speeches a year and wrote five books. Through his extensive log of works, especially in his final three years of life, King expressed radical thoughts about socialism, anti-militarism (during the Vietnam War) and a global revolution for civil rights.\n\nHe was also seen as a threat to those who didn’t want to relinquish power. Toward the end of his life, his influence had gotten too great to be contained. King’s family doesn’t believe that James Earl Ray killed their father, Bernice said. They believe his assassination was an organized effort (12 jurors later agreed with them, ruling his killing as a result of conspiracy in 1999).","Death was a new concept for young Bernice at the time of her father’s assassination, but it became a familiar theme. Her uncle, A.D. King, was found dead in a pool the following year. Her grandmother was shot in church a few years after.\n\nBernice admits she was not OK. She said her mother was the binding force that held her family together through tragedy and maintained a sense of normalcy. Coretta continued to carry the torch she held high during her husband’s life, fighting for equality each day, even as she mourned her personal trauma.\n\n“[My mother] was really a super woman; she raised four kids while helping to raise a nation and keep it from teetering on the edge of violent, just continual violent outbreaks. Yes, there were riots after my dad was assassinated, but really, I think her posture on April the 8th when she went to Memphis to lead that march he was scheduled to lead, and what she said was so critical to quelling some of the tension at the time,” she recalled, stating that her mother shaped the King legacy.","“For a man who was very hated, and one of the most hated, in fact, during the time of the assassination, and now one of the most loved in the world, and really that’s because of her work, her effort on the day-to-day basis,” Bernice added.","Despite the weight their name carried, Bernice said her mom never put added pressure on her. “You don’t have to be your father. You don’t have to be me, just be your best self,” Coretta would tell her.\n\nEven so, it was Bernice’s calling to continue her parents’ mission.","The youngest child of four, Bernice chose to walk in the path of ministry at a young age. As her father did, Bernice married her faith with activism throughout her life, becoming the second woman to be ordained at Ebenezer Baptist Church and the first woman to be elected president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, a position she turned down.","Today, as the CEO of the King Center (founded by her mother), Bernice still upholds her father’s message of nonviolence, making sure his legacy isn’t watered down and that her mother isn’t erased from the conversation. She uses that spirit Coretta taught her about at age five to speak out against today’s injustices, especially on social media. She’s applauded Black Lives Matter activists who are on the front lines ― and are similarly tracked by the FBI ― and, more recently, the Never Again movement.\n\nThe times may have changed, but the message still applies.\n\n“My father provided some very important guidance in how we deal with conflict and polarization. I think his teachings on nonviolence are critical in this hour, now more than ever before,” Bernice said. “Because the tension is very high, it’s heightened, and in order for us to move from this moment so that it doesn’t create further fragmentation and probably escalate to something none of us will want to see, we need to resort to some of those teachings. And realize that we[’re] a part of this global humanity.”\n\nJust like her father, Bernice is looking to love and light to clear out the hate and darkness of today. She hopes that spirit, along with some legislative action, resonates as the world tackles those same three evils her father fought against: poverty, racism, militarization.","“Always realize that even your strongest advocate and opponent is a part of the human family, albeit they may have small shortcomings, and even strength in them, they are part of that human family,” Bernice said. “And that whatever you do, to stand in truth and justice, you will refuse to even destroy them in the process, because your goal is to make sure that the sacredness of human life is always preserved. That’s Martin Luther King Jr. in a nutshell.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ac3dd801f0000270616c3fe.jpeg?cache=TtuW6bgSJe&ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Obama's Photographer Just Went On A Donald Trump-Trolling Spree","authors":"Lee Moran","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pete-souza-donald-trump-trolling-weekend_us_5ac32599e4b00fa46f85a6ac","short_description":"Pete Souza can't stop throwing shade at Trump on Instagram.","date":"2018-04-03"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"WORLD NEWS","headline":"Fighter.

In an outpouring of memory and grief, she was hailed as a co-liberator of South Africa and the mother of the nation, as he was the father of the nation.","At her home in Soweto, crowds gathered as quickly and spontaneously as they had gathered outside Nelson Mandela’s Johannesburg home when he died.","As with Nelson Mandela, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela’s death was announced with gravitas by the presidency. This time, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa hailed her role as a heroine of the struggle and said she had lived a rich and remarkable life.","Madikizela-Mandela died a political figure as resonant in South Africa today as Nelson Mandela is. Indeed, his politics of peace, reconciliation and non-racialism are regarded with skepticism by a new generation, whereas her radical focus on African nationalism, land reform and militance make her legacy a less contested one these days.","This is because South Africa’s movement toward greater equality, more muscular land transfers and harmonious race relations has often been a tortured journey. And so with her death, Madikizela-Mandela’s legacy is quickly being reassessed. Her path, many believe, may have delivered the fruits of freedom more quickly than Mandela’s path, which favored peace and reconciliation over the more militant road that Madikizela-Mandela often said the African National Congress should not have forsaken.","She was the archetypal good bad woman. Her ungovernable, take-no-prisoners style is well-loved in South Africa where heroines are often crafted from the tough streets of political and social struggle. The website South African History Online tells the first page of her story like this:","Once, while quarreling with her younger sister, Princess, Winnie fashioned a knuckleduster out of a nail and a baking powder tin and accidentally struck her sister across the face while aiming for her arm. It was one of many instances for which her mother administered a hefty beating.","She was politicized while very young. One tale is that she begged her father to attend a welcome home ceremony for soldiers after the Second World War, but at the city hall, they were not allowed in because it was “for whites only.”","It was one of the many instances of oppression and segregation that created the freedom fighter who would someday be chronicled in books and films. Madikizela-Mandela chose social work as her field because it allowed her to both care for her community and organize politically.","She was drawn into the circles of ANC politics when she shared digs with Adelaide Tsukudu, who was then courting the ANC Youth League leader Oliver Tambo, who was then a partner at law with Nelson Mandela. Their introduction led to a marriage that lasted some four decades and a love that, arguably, did not end until he died. Madikizela-Mandela was at his bedside when Mandela died and, along with his widow Graça Machel, mourned him as a husband in the long days of official memorials and funerals that followed.","The two Mandelas were absolute equals. “It is worth reiterating that Winnie was already politically interested and involved in activism long before she met her future husband. She was particularly affected by the research she had carried out in Alexandra Township as a social worker to establish the rate of infantile mortality, which stood at 10 deaths for every 1,000 births,” notes SA History Online.","In the 1980s, released from government banishment, Madikizela-Mandela took to heart Tambo’s injunction to make apartheid South Africa ungovernable. Ungovernability, arguably, became an indelible and attractive part of her persona, both personal and political. As SA History Online explains:","Whilst Nelson and his Robben Island coterie had become more academic and statesman-like during their years cut off from grassroots politics, Winnie, on the other hand, was forced to become a soldier on the ground. During her decades of police intimidation and harassment; her emotional brutalization (having had her family torn apart and her closest friends betray her); and her physical imprisonment and banishment, Winnie had developed combative defenses against a world that was unfailingly hostile. Since the latter stages of her exile, rumors had begun to circulate about Winnie’s increasingly erratic behavior; her recourse to drink and her occasional bouts of violent behavior. Once established in Soweto, these rumors refused to dissipate and her frequent public appearances in khaki uniform did little to quell speculation that her approach to liberation was becoming increasingly military driven and violent.","Having been targeted by repeated banning orders and left alone as a very young woman to care for her children while Nelson Mandela was on trial and then imprisoned, Madikizela-Mandela went through a winter of discontent in the ’80s, when a soccer club that she helped launch to get young people off the streets turned into a vicious vigilante group.","The Mandela United Football Club used its political protection to undertake a reign of terror in Soweto, and the lid was blown wide open when 14-year-old Stompie Seipei died after falling out with the rest of the crew. It was believed that Seipei had been kidnapped and tortured by the club, along with three other young people. At trial, Madikizela-Mandela herself was sentenced to five years imprisonment related to those events, a punishment that was later commuted to a lesser sentence.","It was the worst of times for Madikizela-Mandela, and yet it intersected with a moment of rare elation when Nelson Mandela was released in 1990 after nearly three decades in prison. One of the world’s most iconic images remains that of Mandela leaving prison firmly holding his wife’s hand, both of them with raised fists. That unity was not to last, as the couple divorced when Mandela was stung by his wife’s affair with Dali Mpofu, then her deputy in the ANC’s social welfare department.","Though divorced, however, the two were never alienated from each other. Madikizela-Mandela remained a constant in the statesman’s life, through his subsequent marriage to Graça Machel and through his long illness.","As a deputy minister and as an ANC member of parliament, Madikizela-Mandela was a total rebel against the strictures and protocol of formal political life. She was a serial truant in parliament and, truth be told, a very poor deputy minister. Far more powerful for her was the battlefield of street struggle and other arenas where she could sit on a people’s pulpit and criticize what she believed was the “compradorist” politics of the ANC.","Enormously popular in the ANC (she always ended up at the top of the party’s leaderboards for national executive positions), she remained a vote-puller to the very end, although many felt that her politics had increasingly become more suited to those of the radical Economic Freedom Fighters (she is a heroic figure to that young party). The EFF is a splinter party from the governing ANC. It practices a brand of politics that is a copycat of the Latin American revolutionary parties of Cuba and Venezuela’s Hugo Chavez. It won 6.5 percent of the vote in the last election, but its circle of influence is much wider.","Winnie Madikizela was a complicated figure. But as she breathed her last after a battle with complications arising from diabetes, her spot in the heroes’ acre was secured, and her legacy is not nearly as contested now as it had been in the days she entered the heart of darkness."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ac27baa1f0000270616c203.jpeg?cache=6nZ7ULLf73&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"WEIRD NEWS","headline":"This Annual Penis Festival In Japan Is About More Than Just Giant Schlongs","authors":"David Moye and Chris McGonigal","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/japan-penis-festival_us_5ac3aa44e4b09712fec4f118","short_description":"The annual event raises awareness about safe sex and money for HIV charities.","date":"2018-04-03"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"QUEER VOICES","headline":"4 People Facing 100 Lashes For Alleged Gay Sex In Indonesia","authors":"","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/indonesia-detained-4-gay-sex_us_5ac35ee9e4b00fa46f860eb8","short_description":"The punishment \"constitutes torture under human rights law,\" advocates say.","date":"2018-04-03"},"articleContent":["BANDA ACEH, Indonesia (Reuters) - Rights activists called on Tuesday for Indonesia’s Aceh province to release four people detained on suspicion of having homosexual sex, amid concerns over the persecution of the LGBT community in the world’s third-largest democracy.","Secular Indonesia is predominantly Muslim but ultra-conservative Aceh is the only province to follow sharia, or Islamic law, and criminalize gay sex.","Indonesia’s parliament is currently debating revisions to the national criminal code that could criminalize all sex outside marriage, including same-sex relations.

As co-founder and executive director of Republican Women for Progress, she believes “Democracy works better when it represents everyone,” and to her that means gender parity in both parties.","But while it’s her job to recruit, train and fundraise for female Republican candidates she finds herself telling many women to not run — at least not this year.","“It’s a Catch-22 for us,” she explains. “A lot of good moderate Republican women who want to run for office, our advice is ‘You’re a good candidate, you would probably win in any other year, let’s wait’”.","Female Republican candidates are having a harder time than usual in 2018. With all the talk of the surge in women seeking elected office this year, and of all the benefits of being a woman candidate in the Age of Trump, what is less often noted is that nearly all that energy and advantage seems to be on one side of the aisle.","“It’s a tough year to be a Republican woman,” agrees Anne Moses, who founded the non-partisan group Ignite eight years ago to educate high school and college women to become the next generation of political leaders. “It’s always been hard, but this year all the reasons it’s been tough make it even tougher.”","According to the Center for American Women in Politics, the number of Democratic women running for House seats this year increased 146 percent over 2016 (to 351), while the number of Republican women running for the House increased just 35 percent (to 99); on the other side of the Capitol there are only 14 Republican women running for Senate compared to 27 Democratic women.","The non-partisan group VoteRunLead has seen a three-fold increase in the number of women completing their candidate training program last year — from just over 3000 to just under 10,000 – but the proportion of Republicans has shrunk from 1 in 5 to 1 in 9, according to Erin Vilardi, the group’s founder and CEO.","In part this is because there have always been fewer Republican women in high office than Democratic women. Although Republicans are the majority in Congress, three quarters of the 104 women in the House are Democrats. This is the result of several factors, chief among them the historical tendency of women to identify as Democrats and the more robust recruitment pipeline for Democratic women, all of which are even more pronounced this year than previously. And the reason for that, candidates and strategists say, is the reason for so many other phenomena in politics at the moment – Donald Trump.","“You either run as pro-Trump or anti-Trump,” Vilardi says. “There’s no other dynamic now. Women are expected to have a stand on Trump, on #MeToo, and men aren’t even asked the question. Republican women have a harder time with that question and the consequences are greater for them whichever their answer.”","Kelly Dittmar, a scholar with the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers agrees. “The reason it’s particularly challenging for Republican women is there is an expectation put on all women that they will call out and reject some of the more misogynistic behavior and rhetoric that this president has put forth,” she says. “That leave less room for nuance, saying ‘I’m not with him on this, but I am with him on something else.’ Whether it’s fair or not, voters are not necessarily looking to men to specifically answer on those issues.”","Jenifer Sarver learned that first hand. She was one of 18 candidates for the Republican nomination in Texas’s 21 congressional district, a seat that opened when the incumbent retired. Texas has not sent a freshman woman to Congress in 22 years, “meaning an entire generation of young Texans has never seen a woman elected” to that job, so while her gender got her a bit of attention, not all of it was good.","She was regularly asked “who are you working for” at candidate gatherings, and when she answered ‘I’m the candidate’ “It was a surprise,” she says. The follow-up was often “Oh, what does your husband think of you running, what will you do with the kids if you go to Washington,” she recalls. “I would answer ‘I’m single, no kids,’ and they would say ‘oh, that’s good, this would be hard job to do with kids.’”","There were times when being a woman helped in the current climate, she says, such as the handful of doors she knocked to be told “Oh, you’re a female candidate, I’m only voting for females this year.” But there was at least one memorable and public moment when it hurt. During a candidate forum one of her male opponents asked if she had voted for Hillary Clinton and she said indeed she had. “When it came down to it, I couldn’t support candidate Trump,” she answered. “As a woman, I couldn’t do it.”","There were audible gasps in the room and, the Austin-American Statesman’s metro columnist wrote of the moment: “Just then, some of the dead animal heads on the walls turned toward Sarver with looks of shocked disbelief.” In the Texas primary a few weeks later she came in fifth with 5.6 percent of the vote.","Sarver is careful to say that she did not lose because she is a woman. But she also notes that she could not run as many Democratic candidates are doing, whether directly or obliquely – using the fact that they are women as a reason they should be elected.","The Republican Party, voters and candidates alike, has long been less accepting of what has become known as “identity politics.” “Democratic women are used to marrying their woman-ness to their reason for seeking office,” says Anne Moses, “in effect saying that there is an inherent good in electing more women, or women have first-hand understanding of certain issues, or lead differently than men, so ‘vote for me.’ Republicans reject that. It’s harder for a Republican woman to stand up and proclaim ’I am a Republican woman and there is merit in having more of us in office.”","The result, Dittmar says, can sometimes be “verbal gymnastics.” She cites Carly Fiorina’s message during her presidential primary campaign. “It became ‘don’t just vote for Hillary Clinton because she’s a woman, that’s playing the woman card’ but at the same time ‘I’m the best person to compete against Hillary Clinton because I’m a woman.’”","This become additionally complicated in an era when in fact many first-time candidates in both parties are in fact running because they are women. “That’s been the surprise gift of this administration,” says Milloy. “Trump winning has empowered so many women who wouldn’t have stepped up and gotten involved. The irony is that as his policies put women back several years, he is also inspiring women to run.”","Republican women and their advisers are handling these intersections, contradictions and complications in varying ways.","Some are simply aligning themselves with the president on policy while projecting a slightly eye-rolling air when it comes to his personal characteristics.","“What are Republican women doing about Donald Trump?” asked Missy Shorey, Executive Director of Maggie’s List, established in 2010 to fund conservative women who are running for federal office. “By recognizing that we now have the best tax policy since the 80s, that we see a booming economy where businesses that we either own or that are families work for are thriving thanks to deregulation, that the military is strengthened rather than gutted… That’s what they’re doing about Donald Trump.","“Do we wish we’ve seen some better behavior?” she continues. “Yes. Do many of us roll our eyes when we see the daily tweets? Absolutely. He is not a perfect candidate but he certainly beats the alternative and at the end of the day we are getting much of what we wanted.”","Others are shape shifting a bit, in a way candidates of both parties often do for the primaries. “We have a few women who are very moderate, very much against Trump,” says Milloy, “but in order to compete in their primaries they need to be a little more to the right than they actually are. If they win then the hope is they can express their views more freely in the general.”","A few are playing something that looks very much like identity politics, but with a Republican twist. Back in February, for instance, when Sen. Bob Corker briefly reconsidered his decision to leave politics, Rep. Marsha Blackburn fought back. Corker, a Republican from Tennessee, has been an outspoken critic of Trump, and told friends he might get back into the race because he feared his seat might flip to a Democrat. Blackburn, who proudly aligns herself with the president, is considered the front-runner for the GOP nomination in that race, and she sent her staff to call Corker out.","“Anyone who thinks Marsha Blackburn can’t win a general election is just a plain sexist pig,” Blackburn’s campaign spokeswoman Andrea Bozek told the Washington Post. “We aren’t worried about these ego-driven, tired old men. Marsha has spent her whole life fighting people who told her she wasn’t good enough, and she will do it again.”","Many others, though, are waiting. “I think this is a year of rebuilding for Republican women,” Vilardi says. Those who go through the VoteRunLead program traditionally craft a five-year plan toward an electoral run, but since 2016, she says, “Democratic women have shortened that timeline to the next election, with 60 percent saying they wanted to run by 2020. Republican women though have slowed down” their expected timeline, waiting to see if the landscape shifts.","“That doesn’t surprise me,” says Larissa Martinez, a co-founder of the Women Influencers Network, yet another of the many groups that are forming to train and fund conservative women candidates. “The enthusiasm and the energy now is very much on the left side. It makes for a very hostile election cycle. I’ve gone to a number of women panels and the women on the left see right leaning women as walking contradictions. It’s an unusual time to know how to navigate so I can understand some Republican women wanting to take a break.”","_____","Read more from Yahoo News:","Ken Starr: Justice Department should evaluate claims by Stormy Daniels\nAdvocates fear ICE is targeting immigrants who speak out\nTrump isn’t the first president to politicize the census\nWhile others march, these teens shoot.

He was 39 years old. He left behind a wife and three children and a nation still riven by the divisions he had devoted his life to healing. Yahoo News takes a look back at his life and his legacy in this special report. Jonathan Darman assesses King as a man not without flaws, but with a passion for justice and a conviction that grace can still be found here among us sinners on earth. Senior Editor Jerry Adler looks back on the fateful last year of King’s life, beginning with his electrifying, and controversial, Riverside Church address against the war in Vietnam. National Correspondent Holly Bailey goes back to Selma, Ala., whose poverty moved King to increasingly turn his focus to economic justice, and finds not much has changed in the years since. Reporter Michael Walsh looks at how King almost died in an attack a decade earlier, and how the knowledge of his mortality shaped his ministry and message.","A half-century ago, Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination by James Earl Ray, a virulent racist with a criminal past, robbed the civil rights movement of its brightest luminary. But another attempt on King’s life, had it been successful, would have stolen even more.","In September 1958, Izola Ware Curry, a deranged African-American woman from Georgia, stabbed King with a letter opener while he was signing copies of his book “Stride Toward Freedom” at Blumstein’s department store in Harlem. King later said that the tip struck his aorta, and that his entire chest had to be opened to extract it. If he had sneezed, doctors told him, his aorta could have ruptured, drowning him in his own blood. Fortunately, King did not sneeze.","If he had died then, America would have missed his presence for the eventful decade that followed, including the Freedom Rides, the “I Have a Dream” speech, the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Selma marches.","Stanford University historian Clayborne Carson, who was selected by Coretta Scott King to edit and publish her late husband’s papers, said King was well aware that his career would open him to threats against his life.","“He was always aware of his mortality, and that just brought it home,” Carson told Yahoo News.","“His home had been bombed before that. He’d been threatened on numerous occasions. He had that experience in Montgomery where he actually considered leaving the movement because of all the threats, not just against himself, but his family.”","King had said, before that occasion, that God gave him the courage to continue at a time when he considered stepping down as leader of the movement. In January 1957, he told his congregation at Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Ala., that a voice spoke to him on a sleepless morning one year earlier — compelling him to preach the Gospel and stand for truth and righteousness.","“Since that morning I can stand up without fear. So, I’m not afraid of anybody this morning,” King said. “Tell Montgomery they can keep shooting and I’m going to stand up to them. Tell Montgomery they can keep bombing and I’m going to stand up to them.”","So why did a black woman from the American South, a person for whom King put his life on the line, want him dead?","Curry, who grew up outside Adrian, Ga., harbored paranoid delusions about the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). She reportedly wrote unhinged letters to the Federal Bureau of Investigation claiming it was a Communist front that was actively trailing her. She blamed the NAACP — rather than her deteriorating mental state and unsettling behavior — for sabotaging her attempts to find steady employment. Her paranoia shifted to King as he rose to prominence during the Montgomery bus boycott of 1955 and 1956.","“First of all, she was crazy. She spent the rest of her life in a mental institution,” Carson explained. “But to the extent that there was any rationale, she heard black nationalist harangues against King, that he was a Communist. All the combinations of things that might appeal to someone who was mentally unbalanced to begin with.”","A grand jury indicted Curry for attempted murder, but a psychiatrist determined that she suffered from paranoid schizophrenia and had an extremely low I.Q. She was committed to a mental hospital for the criminally insane and spent the rest of her life in psychiatric hospitals and nursing homes.","Nowadays, the Curry incident is mostly remembered for its retelling in King’s final speech: “I Have Been to the Mountaintop,” delivered in Memphis, Tenn., on April 3, 1968 — a day before his murder. He explained how a “demented black woman,” not referring to Curry by name, attacked him, and he described the outpouring of supportive letters he received in the hospital. He didn’t remember what President Eisenhower or New York Gov. Averill Harriman had written, he said, but he would never forgot the letter from a ninth-grade student at White Plains High School in Westchester County, N.Y.","“While it should not matter, I would like to mention that I’m a white girl. I read in the paper of your misfortune and of your suffering,” she wrote. “And I read that if you had sneezed, you would have died. And I’m simply writing you to say that I’m so happy that you didn’t sneeze.”","“And I want to say tonight,” King went on, “I want to say tonight that I, too, am happy that I didn’t sneeze.” This little girl’s letter provided the “if I had sneezed” refrain that King used to revisit the many accomplishments of the movement, before predicting that he may soon die but that “the Promised Land” was in sight.","“I just want to do God’s will. And He’s allowed me to go up to the mountain. And I’ve looked over, and I’ve seen the Promised Land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight, that we, as a people, will get to the Promised Land!”","In the decade between Curry’s assassination attempt and that speech, King persevered through cross burnings, bomb scares and a shotgun blast into his home. One day after that speech, King was shot dead on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel. Fifty years later, his message is still relevant, but his mission isn’t complete.","According to Carson, King mentioned his mortality on numerous occasions, but this reference is remembered because it was included in a great speech, which starts off with King revisiting the meaning of his life, a more common theme in his late speeches. Carson said the importance of King not reaching the Promised Land has less to do with the possibility of an early death than that he might never see his dreams fulfilled — whether or not he reached old age.","“Even if he lived he wouldn’t get there, because his goals were much broader than just civil rights reform. I think it’s very significant that in a 1952 letter to Coretta he pledges that his ministry will be about a warless world, a better distribution of wealth and a brotherhood that transcends race or color,” Carson said. “When you think about those three goals, those haven’t been achieved. He certainly hadn’t ended war or poverty or brought about the kind of broad community that he had talked about all his life.”","On March 3, 1968, a month before his death, King delivered the lesser-known “Unfulfilled Dreams” speech at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, Ga. He mused about why he had fallen short of reaching some of his aspirations and compared himself to the Biblical King David, who never got to see the Temple he started to construct. King described life as a “continual story of shattered dreams” but praised God for giving humans meaningful objectives into which they can pour their hearts.","“And so often as you set out to build the temple of peace you are left lonesome. You are left discouraged. You are left bewildered,” King said. “Well, that is the story of life. And the thing that makes me happy is that I can hear a voice crying through the vista of time, saying, ‘It may not come today or it may not come tomorrow, but it is well that it is within thine heart. It’s well that you are trying.’ You may not see it. The dream may not be fulfilled, but it’s just good that you have a desire to bring it into reality. It’s well that it’s in thine heart.”","And as King focused on being a virtuous man, powerful people were plotting to destroy him. FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover harbored a deep hatred for King and thought he was influenced by Communists. In late 1964, the FBI anonymously sent a package to King that included a tape that allegedly contained audio from one of his trysts and a letter threatening to defame King by publicizing his infidelities if he didn’t do “the only thing left for you to do.” King understood this as encouraging him to commit suicide.","Jonathan Rieder, a professor of sociology at Barnard College, Columbia University, is the author of “Gospel of Freedom: Martin Luther King, Jr.’s Letter from Birmingham Jail and the Struggle That Changed a Nation” and “The Word of the Lord Is Upon Me: The Righteous Performance of Martin Luther King, Jr.” He said King had to come to terms with the possibility of his own death early on and helped others in the movement do the same thing. King conceived of this “sacrificial burden” as part of the price of making the U.S. a truly democratic nation.","“This was a sacrificial endeavor that he was engaged in, and he would often therefore identify with Jesus,” Rieder told Yahoo News. “His decision to go to jail in Birmingham in 1963 was, in a sense, an awareness that like his savior some would have to die and go to jail so that others could live. It’s a central theme of the Christian part of the civil rights movement.”","Living so closely with death, Rieder continued, King developed a wide repertoire of talks on the subject — ranging from hilarious and jokey to morbid and despondent. When King decided to lead demonstrations in Birmingham, Ala., where Bull Connor harshly enforced segregation, King met with a small group of his colleagues to warn them that they may be killed, according to Rieder.","“And then he would joke about it. He would say, ‘Now y’all think the Klan is going to get me? You will jump in front of the camera and they will get you,” Rieder said. “But I will preach the best funeral you ever had.’ Then he would go around and pick on some little foible or problem with each of his colleagues and do a hilarious funeral about them.”","Andrew Young, a close friend of King’s and the executive director of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, once told Rieder that this mixture of solemnity and lightheartedness was King’s way of teaching them to accept the possibility of their death.","America would have been the worse for it, but King would have had a much easier life had he not dedicated his life to the civil rights movement. After assuming the mantle of the fight for racial integration, King was vilified by white racists, ridiculed by black nationalists, monitored by the FBI, arrested, threatened, attacked and ultimately murdered — all without, from his perspective, having his dreams come to fruition.","But in “Unfulfilled Dreams,” King concluded that God judges individuals on the “total bent of our lives” rather than “separate mistakes” because he knows his children are weak. Therefore, he said, it’s imperative to get your heart right and keep building your metaphorical temple — regardless of whether it will be finished.","“Salvation is being on the right road, not having reached a destination.”","This post was originally published on Yahoo News."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ac26c301e0000fb077b058b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"BLACK VOICES","headline":"The View From The Mountaintop: Martin Luther King's Turbulent, Tragic Last Year","authors":"Jerry Adler, Yahoo News","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-view-from-the-mountaintop-martin-luther-kings-turbulent-tragic-last-year_us_5ac26e3be4b09712fec34232","short_description":"On March 3 he returned to Ebenezer to preach on “Unfulfilled Dreams,” about world-historical figures who never achieved their","date":"2018-04-02"},"articleContent":["Fifty years ago, on April 4, 1968, Martin Luther King Jr., who preached nonviolent resistance to oppression and war, was shot to death in Memphis.

Reporter Michael Walsh looks at how King almost died in an attack a decade earlier, and how the knowledge of his mortality shaped his ministry and message.","On April 4, 1967, a Tuesday, Martin Luther King Jr. took the pulpit at New York’s Riverside Church, the great Gothic cathedral conceived by John D. Rockefeller Jr., to deliver a speech entitled “Beyond Vietnam: A Time to Break Silence.” It announced a decisive shift in King’s message and ministry, from desegregation to a broader engagement with pacifism and social and economic justice. And it marked the beginning of the final year of his life. Exactly one year later, the concerns he spoke to that day would lead him to support a strike by sanitation workers in Memphis, Tenn., where he was shot and killed.","“I come to this great magnificent house of worship tonight because my conscience leaves me no other choice,” he said at the beginning of his talk, before a crowd of more than 3,000 that filled the immense church. “A time comes when silence is betrayal. That time has come for us in relation to Vietnam.” He went on to describe how Great Society antipoverty programs, “the real promise of hope for the poor, both black and white,” had been left “broken and eviscerated” by the costs and the social divisions imposed by the war. “We [are] taking the black young men who had been crippled by our society and sending them eight thousand miles away to guarantee liberties in Southeast Asia which they had not found in southwest Georgia and East Harlem. … We have been repeatedly faced with the cruel irony of watching Negro and white boys on TV screens as they kill and die together for a nation that has been unable to seat them together in the same schools.” He invoked his ministry, “in obedience to the one who loved his enemies so fully that he died for them.” And in his summation, he quoted from one of his favorite hymns, written more than 120 years before by the abolitionist James Russell Lowell:","Opposition to the war was not a new position for King, although it may have been news to some of his followers. Two years before, he had expressed his view that military action in Vietnam was “accomplishing nothing,” but that came in a question-and-answer session after a speech, and it attracted little attention. As the war escalated through 1965, the board of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference authorized him to pursue his own peace initiatives, drawing a warning from an assistant secretary of labor, George Weaver, described by the New York Times as “one of the highest-ranking Negroes in the Johnson administration,” that he risked provoking a “miscalculation” by the North Vietnamese or their patrons in the Soviet Union or China.","So he understood the risk he was taking. He would be breaking decisively with Lyndon Johnson, the president who had done more than any other since Lincoln to advance civil rights. He was being challenged on the left by a new generation of Black Power advocates and harassed by J. Edgar Hoover, whose covert efforts to discredit and destroy King would get new ammunition from his association with the people derisively called “peaceniks.” Peace activists were often labeled “Commies” in those years, and it was King’s long association with the left-wing activist Stanley Levison, whom Hoover suspected of being a Soviet agent, that brought King under FBI surveillance in the first place. Ironically, as the historian Taylor Branch points out, Levison was actually opposed to King’s involvement in antiwar causes and tried to talk him out of giving his Vietnam speech. (“I lost,” Levison told associates, in a wiretapped phone call, “and we’ll just have to live with the consequences.”)","But King was being pushed in the other direction by another influential aide, James Bevel, a fiery preacher from Mississippi, who saw the Vietnam War as an extension of America’s oppression of nonwhites. (Ironically, after King’s death, Bevel would become a supporter of Ronald Reagan and later drift to the fringes of politics as the running mate of perennial presidential candidate Lyndon LaRouche.) And King was pushed, more than anything else, by the logic of his own commitment to nonviolence. How, he wondered, could he demand that his own people brave police clubs and dogs without striking back, and not denounce the bombs the United States was dropping on children on the other side of the world? “It has been my consistent belief and position that non-violence is the only true solution to the social problems of the world and of this country,” King wrote a supporter just before the Riverside speech. “The principle of love which has motivated so many to strike out against the evils of racism here in America must motivate us to protest the brutal destruction of the Vietnamese People.”","In the spring of 1967, King, notwithstanding his 1964 Nobel Prize, was not quite the towering figure we look back on today. The great victories he had helped win — the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 — were receding into the (recent) past. The SCLC was in disarray and debt. King’s effort to tackle racial segregation in the North was foundering on the discovery that housing was a much more complicated and nuanced issue than whites-only lunch counters. King’s antiwar activism, while popular among the antiwar left, wasn’t winning many converts even among his allies in the civil rights movement, some of whom supported the war on principle, while others worried it would dilute his message about race. Within days of King’s speech the leading mainline civil rights group, the NAACP, disassociated itself from his stance, with a declaration that “we are not a peace organization nor a foreign policy association. We are a civil rights organization.” An editorial in the New York Times on April 7 (“Dr. King’s Error”) chastised King, in measured Times-speak, for making “too facile a connection between the speeding up of the war in Vietnam and the slowing down of the war against poverty.”","King’s life was already hectic and was about to get more so. He spent his last year crisscrossing the country in a whirl of speeches, sermons, meetings, rallies and marches. David Halberstam, who profiled him in the summer of 1967 for Harper’s magazine, noted that “most of King’s life is spent going to airports, and it is the only time to talk to him.” The period has been chronicled in a number of places, notably including the final volume of Branch’s magisterial trilogy on King’s life, “At Canaan’s Edge,” and a new HBO documentary, “King in the Wilderness.” Local newspapers reported on his visits whenever he touched down, in articles that make for arresting reading 50 years later, with their casual references to “Reds” and “Negroes,” which is the word King himself used. (It would be another year before the Amsterdam News, Harlem’s leading publication, totally banished the term in favor of “blacks.”) A partial list of the places King visited during that year includes, besides New York and his home in Atlanta: Boston; Los Angeles; San Francisco; Chicago; Cleveland; Philadelphia; Washington, D.C.; Miami; Grinnell, Iowa; Clarksdale, Marks and nearby towns in Mississippi; Geneva, Switzerland (for a world peace conference); Newcastle upon Tyne, England (to receive an honorary degree); Acapulco (for a two-day vacation); and, of course, Memphis. Along the way he rebuffed appeals to run for president as a peace candidate, served a five-day sentence in the Birmingham, Ala., jail, was accused by Hoover, in a secret report to Johnson, of plotting to blow up the Chicago Loop, and was bequeathed the entire estate — amounting to less than $10,000 — of the New Yorker writer Dorothy Parker, who admired him although they had never met.","A few days after the Riverside speech, King flew to California for a series of speeches. He held a press conference in part to deal with the repercussions of the address, at which he clarified, apparently for the benefit of donors to the SCLC, that he was not seeking to merge the civil rights and peace movements — meaning their contributions wouldn’t go to support his antiwar activism. By April 15 he was back in New York for a large and unruly march and rally for peace at the United Nations, alongside the antiwar activists Harry Belafonte and Benjamin Spock. “Many Draft Cards Burned — Eggs Tossed at Parade” was part of the headline in the next day’s Times. Citing some of the banners, signs and chants, the story introduced readers of the Times to a new slogan: “No Vietnamese ever called me nigger.”","Over the next few months King made repeated trips to Cleveland, one of four cities he had designated as a focus of his campaign to improve housing and job opportunities for blacks. He denounced the city’s crackdown in response to the previous summer’s riots, telling reporters, “a get-tough policy should mean getting tough against poverty, inferior education and rat-infested slums.” Meeting with local ministers and civil rights leaders, he involved himself in the details of local organizing: rent strikes, voter registration drives and “Operation Breadbasket,” targeted boycotts meant to force businesses to hire more black workers. “We’re not begging for freedom any more,” he told a press conference in May. Among a handful of reports on King’s local activities published by the Plain Dealer that summer and fall was a front-page picture of him relaxing on the lawn of a local activist, dressed, as he almost invariably was in photographs from those years, in a dark suit, white shirt and necktie. He was tossing a football to a couple of youngsters, including his sons, Martin III and Dexter, who were along for the trip.","On June 12, the Supreme Court upheld the conviction of eight black African-American ministers, including King and his brother, for contempt of court, stemming from a demonstration in Birmingham four years earlier. Bull Connor, Birmingham’s commissioner of public safety, had denied the group a permit to march, but they did anyway, invoking the doctrine of civil disobedience to illegitimate authority. In a 5-4 decision, with Chief Justice Earl Warren among the dissenters, the Court overruled that defense and ordered the men to serve their sentences and pay a $50 fine. Even if forbidding the march was unconstitutional, the decision held, the proper remedy was to appeal the denial to the courts. A few months later, one of the justices in the majority, Tom Clark, was replaced by Thurgood Marshall. Marshall, a civil rights hero in his own right, became the first African-American on the court, and, it’s safe to say, would have tipped the balance to the other side.","King was in and out of Cleveland and Chicago at least a half-dozen times that summer. In August he returned to Atlanta for the SCLC convention, where he announced plans to “dislocate” Northern cities with a campaign of “mass civil disobedience.” In a long speech titled “Where Do We Go From Here?” he enumerated achievements in Chicago and Cleveland, including the hiring of more black contractors by major department stores and taking out advertisements in Negro newspapers. The speech was well received, and the audience broke into applause and affirmation as King moved into his peroration with one of his signature aphorisms: “Let us realize that the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.” But reading it today one is struck by the realization that just a few years earlier King had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work to overturn a century of injustice and oppression and had stood in the Oval Office as Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act into law. A gap had opened between King’s soaring rhetoric and the grindingly slow process of bringing concrete improvements to the lives of millions of people in big-city ghettoes and the ramshackle towns of the Old South. The arc of the moral universe would have to be very long indeed if its course were to be measured by the hiring of more “Negro insect and rodent exterminators, as well as janitorial services” by chain stores in Chicago’s South Side.","At the end of October, King and three others, including his brother, the Rev. A.D. King, surrendered in Birmingham to serve their sentences. “As we leave for a Birmingham jail today,” King said, “we call out to America: Take heed. Do not allow the Bill of Rights to become a prisoner of war.” He did not follow up on plans to write a sequel to his famous “Letter From Birmingham Jail” of 1963, although he did compose an essay, “A Bill of Rights for the Disadvantaged,” that was later published in the New York Times. The men were released after four days; King’s close aide Rev. Ralph Abernathy joked that since the lawyers had failed to keep the pastors out of jail, he was going back on his promise to keep them out of Hell. On being released, King announced plans to visit the Soviet Union. This was a trip he never made.","Now things began speeding up. On Dec. 4 King announced plans for a “poor peoples’ campaign for jobs or income,” which would take the form of a march on Washington the following spring. “In a news conference here,” the Times reported from Atlanta, “the winner of the Nobel Prize for Peace acknowledged that the ugly mood of many Negroes in the nation’s slums made the campaign ‘risky,’ but he asserted that ‘not to act represents moral irresponsibility.’” The reporter observed that “the Negro leader’s mood seemed deeply pessimistic.” A whirlwind of fundraising and planning for the march ensued, interrupted by more speeches and rallies. In January, he visited Joan Baez in jail in Oakland, Calif., where she was serving a sentence for staging a sit-in to protest the draft. On the men’s wing, he visited another peace activist, Ira Sandperl. Sandperl was struck, Branch writes, by the “contrast between the well-tailored figure in starched cuffs and the face of weary depression. King asked a favor. ‘When I’m in jail in Washington,’ he said, ‘come visit me there.’”","On Feb. 4, King was back in Atlanta in the pulpit of his home church, Ebenezer Baptist, where he preached what has become known as the “Drum Major” sermon, musing on the all-too-human desire for recognition. The text is from the 10th chapter of Mark, in which the apostles James and John request the honor of sitting alongside Jesus. This impulse is the root of the social evil of racism, King said, “a need some people have … to feel that their white skin ordained them to be first,” and also of the personal vices of jealousy, arrogance and pride. That thought in turn led him to consider his own place in history and how he would want to be remembered and eulogized. “I don’t want a long funeral,” he said. “Tell them not to talk too long. Tell them not to mention that I have a Nobel Peace Prize — that isn’t important.” He wanted to be remembered, he said, as someone who served others, who tried to feed the hungry and serve humanity and who “tried to be right on the war question.” “Yes, Jesus,” he concluded, “I want to be on your right or your left side, not for any selfish reason. … I just want to be there in love and in justice and in truth and in commitment to others, so that we can make of this old world a new world.”","It was also in February that King appeared as a guest on The Tonight Show, where Belafonte, a close friend, was filling in as host. King mentioned he had flown up from Washington on a plane that had been delayed by “mechanical difficulties,” and he was glad to land safely. “I don’t want you to think that as a Baptist preacher, I don’t have confidence in God in the air,” he said. “It’s just that I’ve had more experience with him on the ground.”","“Do you fear for your life?” Belafonte asked.","“Not really,” King replied. “Ultimately it isn’t important how long you live — it’s how well you live.” He was 39.","On March 3 he returned to Ebenezer to preach on “Unfulfilled Dreams,” about world-historical figures who never achieved their greatest goals — like Gandhi, who lived just long enough to see his dream of a united India shattered by religious war and partition, or King David, who died before he could build a temple to the Lord. Each of us is building our own temple, King told the worshippers. We are all traveling to a destination, and what matters isn’t whether we reach our destination, but that we are on the right road.","He was hurtling toward his own destiny, and perhaps he sensed it. Certainly those around him did. His aides worried he was pushing himself too hard, in danger of burning out, or of losing control of the civil rights movement as more militant figures rose to prominence, mocking his lifelong commitment to nonviolence. He spoke in Detroit in mid-March, then flew to Los Angeles for speeches and meetings where, Branch writes, he let himself be talked into committing to visit “Indian reservations and migrant labor camps from California to Appalachia and Massachusetts” in the run-up to the Poor People’s March, whose start was barely more than a month away. Then he took a call from James Lawson, a preacher and organizer in Memphis, urging him to speak at a rally in support of a strike by the overwhelmingly black sanitation workers’ union. So he flew into Memphis by way of New Orleans on March 18, arriving to a packed auditorium at the Mason Temple to deliver a rousing address.","“We are tired of being at the bottom! We are tired of our men being emasculated so that our wives and daughters have to go out and work in the white lady’s kitchen,” he thundered. As the cheers filled the packed hall, he promised that he would be back.","From Memphis, King descended into the Delta, visiting towns in some of the poorest counties in the United States, speaking in what the Times called “a shabby firetrap of a building whose interior walls are covered with funeral-parlor calendars” showing a suffering — white-skinned — Jesus on the cross. “I am very deeply touched,” King told mothers who couldn’t afford shoes for their children. “God does not want you to live like you are living.”","Then he got back on an airplane to meet with supporters in New York, visiting a Harlem tenement where a local activist, Mrs. Bennie Fowler, cooked him lunch and served it beneath a clothesline strung across her dining room. He apologized for canceling some appearances, explaining “I’ve been getting two hours’ sleep a night for the last 10 days.”","Then he returned to Memphis for a march that started late and quickly turned ugly, with looting, cops injured and shooting back and hundreds arrested. King back in his hotel room was overcome with remorse (according to FBI transcripts of his wiretapped phone conversations), blaming himself for being unable to rein in the anger he had always hoped to keep from spilling over into violence.","“Maybe we just have to admit that the day of violence is here,” he said in despair to his aides. “And maybe we have to give up and let violence take its course.” Then he flew home to Atlanta.","Newspapers around the country denounced King as an agitator and troublemaker, following, in some cases, scripts that had been surreptitiously provided by Hoover’s agents. King flew to Washington to preach a Sunday service at the National Cathedral, describing the poverty and misery he had seen the week before in Mississippi. That day, Sunday, March 31, ended with Johnson’s speech announcing he would not run for another term as president in November.","And then King returned to Memphis for a third time. His aide Xernona Clayton had picked him up at his home, where, she recounts in “King in the Wilderness,” his two sons had uncharacteristically tried to keep him from leaving. “He said, what in the world happened to these kids. They must be trying to tell me they’re missing me more, and when I come back I’ve got to change my habits.”","His flight out of Atlanta was delayed because of bomb threats, and he arrived at the Mason Temple amid a Biblical-magnitude thunderstorm. He spoke about the strike and Operation Breadbasket, and he repeated his warnings about violence: “We don’t have to argue with anybody. We don’t have to curse and go around acting bad with our words. We don’t need any bricks and bottles; we don’t need any Molotov cocktails.” He recalled the time he had been stabbed at a book signing in New York, an attempted assassination that came very close to succeeding. Doctors told him just a sneeze could have ruptured his aorta, and then “I wouldn’t have had a chance later that year, in August, to try to tell America about a dream that I had had,” and “I wouldn’t have been down in Selma, Alabama, to see the great movement there.”","“And then I got into Memphis,” King continued. “And some began to say the threats, or talk about the threats that were out, or what would happen to me from some of our sick white brothers.","“Well, I don’t know what will happen now; we’ve got some difficult days ahead. But it really doesn’t matter with me now, because I’ve been to the mountaintop. Like anybody, I would like to live a long life — longevity has its place. But I’m not concerned about that now. I just want to do God’s will. And He’s allowed me to go up to the mountain. And I’ve looked over, and I’ve seen the Promised Land.","“I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight that we, as a people, will get to the Promised Land. And so I’m happy tonight; I’m not worried about anything; I’m not fearing any man.”","And he ended with a line from the great Civil War anthem, the Battle Hymn of the Republic:","“Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord!”","That was the night of April 3, 1968.","This post was originally published on Yahoo News."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ac26ecd1e00003b137b058f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"WORLD NEWS","headline":"Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, Anti-Apartheid Campaigner, Is Dead At 81","authors":"Nina Golgowski","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/winnie-madikizela-mandela-dead_us_5ac23e54e4b0a47437ac9543","short_description":"The South African activist spent decades standing up against racial segregation and discrimination.","date":"2018-04-02"},"articleContent":["Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, the anti-apartheid campaigner and controversial wife of former South African President Nelson Mandela while he was imprisoned on Robben Island, died on Monday.

She turned down a scholarship to the United States and reportedly became the first black woman in South Africa to serve as a social worker.","She was in her early 20s in 1958 when she married Nelson Mandela, who would go on to become the country’s first black president.","After Mandela was sentenced to life behind bars for treason in 1964, Madikizela-Mandela became known for carrying on his activism. Her work, which earned her the nickname “Mother of the Nation,” led to her own years-long detention, arrest, torture, and banishment by white authorities.","She later wrote, according to The New York Times, that that experience was “what changed me, what brutalized me so much that I knew what it is to hate.”","After her husband’s release from prison in 1990, the couple took increasingly divergent approaches to their political work.","Madikizela-Mandela came to be seen as a polarizing figure and faced various criminal convictions, including in a case that involved the 1988 kidnapping of four youths as part of a plot to discredit a local minister. Madikizela-Mandela maintained that she was unaware the young men had been assaulted at her home, but a judge concluded the abductions must have been carried out with her approval.","She was sentenced in 1991 to six years in jail for her role in the case, which involved the murder of a 14-year-old boy. Upon appeal, her sentence was reduced to a fine.","In 1993, she separated from Nelson Mandela, who was elected president of South Africa the following year. She was fired from his Cabinet following allegations of corruption not long after. They divorced in 1996.","In later years, Madikizela-Mandela both defended and apologized for her actions. “I am not sorry. I will never be sorry,” she told the London Evening Standard in 2010. “I would do everything I did again if I had to. Everything.”","The Nelson Mandela Foundation mourned her death Monday in a statement that recognized her as a leader and a survivor of “the most brutal period of state terror in apartheid South Africa.”","“All South Africans are indebted to Mama Winnie, whether they acknowledge it or not,” Professor Njabulo Ndebele, the foundation’s chairman, said. “From the witness of her life, we knew we could stand tall; we knew also we could falter and stumble.

Several news outlets reported last week that Esty kept Baker on her payroll for three months after she learned he had harassed a female staffer and threatened to kill her.","“[I] have determined that it is in the best interest of my constituents and my family to end my time in Congress at the end of this year and not seek re-election,” Esty, a vocal advocate of the Me Too movement, wrote in an announcement on Facebook.","“Too many women have been harmed by harassment in the workplace,” she added. “In the terrible situation in my office, I could have and should have done better.”","In addition to facing criticism for the length of time she took to fire Baker, Esty was condemned for giving him a $5,000 severance payment and letter of recommendation. She also reportedly signed a nondisclosure agreement preventing her from speaking ill of him or discussing why he left. The congresswoman has since said she’ll repay the severance to the U.S. Treasury.","Esty was aware of Baker’s behavior within a week of his accuser taking action against him, according to emails and recordings The Washington Post obtained. In May 2016, former Esty staffer Anna Kain, who had previously dated Baker, alerted police about a threatening voicemail she had received from him.","“You better fucking reply to me or I will fucking kill you,” Baker told her in the message, according to the recording obtained by the Post.

Just like the olden days.","date":"2018-04-02"},"articleContent":["Amateurism is beaten and bloodied. Still it stands.","Andy Schwarz and Ricky Volante want to deliver the coup de grâce.","Michigan and Villanova are playing tonight for the NCAA’s men’s college basketball championship. A lot of people will make money off this game, and none of them will be anyone who played in it. The NCAA, the television networks, the universities, the coaches and corporate sponsors — they’ll all get some piece of the millions of dollars raked in annually by the tournament. The actual attraction, the players on the court, won’t receive a dime.","Over the last five years, the NCAA “amateurism” model that keeps players from truly sharing in the massive amount of money they create has faced significant challenges. Former UCLA basketball player Ed O’Bannon sued the NCAA in 2009 over the use of college athletes’ names, images and likenesses in video games and won a victory in federal court. Members of Northwestern University’s football squad fought for and won the right to form the first players’ union in college sports history.","But each time, the celebrations that accompanied those victories proved premature: A key provision of the O’Bannon ruling that would’ve lifted the NCAA’s ban on compensation was tossed out on appeal; the National Labor Relations Board ruled that Northwestern’s players couldn’t, in fact, form a union.","In 2017, Schwarz, an economist and frequent critic of the NCAA, and Volante, a lawyer, announced the creation of the Historical Basketball League, an alternative to the NCAA that would pay the players on teams at historically black colleges and universities, or HBCUs.","The HBL hasn’t launched yet, but the proposal arrives at an important juncture in the war on the NCAA. Last fall, word came down of an FBI investigation into how major college basketball programs managed to pay their best players, a dubious and destructive exercise in federalizing the NCAA rulebook. The likely immediate outcome will be an entrenchment of the NCAA’s power to police its amateurism ideal, what with the G-Men now working in concert with the governing body’s rent-a-cops.","But other effects likely will be less friendly to the NCAA. For one thing, the possibility of federal criminal charges will surely change the risk calculus for people connected to the bootleg economy of big-time college sports — the assistant coaches, the sneaker company reps, the bagmen. At some point, you figure, they’re going to start looking for alternatives to the current model.","Into this uncertain moment comes the HBL. The proposal is an extension of the argument against the NCAA being heard in the courts and from certain corners of the media. The HBL wants to test the notion, frequently offered by NCAA dead-enders, that people will stop caring about college sports if the athletes are compensated in something other than company scrip. And the league’s focus on black colleges is a reminder that the NCAA’s ruinous attachment to the amateurism ideal creates racist outcomes in which revenue generated by black athletes is redistributed among predominantly white coaches, white administrators, white executives.","But Schwarz and Volante want to do more than just mount an argument; they’re trying to build a real basketball league. Last week, HuffPost sat down with them to talk about their proposal, how it would work and who has expressed interest thus far.","The following is a transcript of the discussion, edited for length and clarity.","HuffPost: What exactly is the HBL?","Schwarz: The HBL, it stands for Historical Basketball League, and the “H” is doing double-duty. One is because we’re going to be partnering with historically black colleges and universities. The other thing is, in the formative years of college sports, there were no NCAA rules against pay, and many of those athletes were paid.","So we’re returning college basketball to the historic roots of college sports played by college students, but by paid college students. We are a professional college sports league. All of our athletes will be full-time students at HBCUs. Our season is in the summer to make sure it minimizes the conflict between athletics and academics.","The idea here is to essentially put on a great college basketball program, played at great colleges with deep history, with three future NBA or European basketball stars on the court playing each other. The only thing that’s going to be different from what people are used to is that the athletes will be sharing. It’ll be like fair trade basketball ― the workers will be getting a fair share of the revenue that we’re generating.","HuffPost: How did the idea come about?","Schwarz: So, the two precipitating events were our success ― and I say our because I worked on the case ― in the O’Bannon case, where a judge found that what the NCAA does when it sets a maximum scholarship is price-fixing, and the success of the unionization effort at Northwestern, where a local administrator acknowledged that the duties of a college football player met the definition of an employee under federal labor law. And then the consequent rollback by appeals courts of both of those decisions.","It felt like years of effort to get real change and succeeding and convincing two finders of fact and law were gone in a heartbeat because of older, less-informed people one step up the chain. It was frustrating.","So, if you can’t unionize and you can’t sue them, the other way to beat a cartel is to out-compete them. And the idea here is that by depressing the salary of college athletes, you create an opportunity for entry. Sort of like how by being a horrible taxi company, you create the ability for Lyft or Uber to start grabbing customers. It’s the same thing here, and what we want to do is effectively force the industry to recognize the value of the talent by paying them more. Either they will compete with us, or they won’t.","Volante: Our mission has three different prongs: First and foremost, to create a sports economy that the athletes actually get to participate in. Number two is empowering these schools that historically have considerable significance, especially in the South. And number three is disrupting the concept of amateurism and proving that the concept of amateurism isn’t necessary for college sports to be successful, and furthermore, that amateurism is not necessary for people to tune in and watch, as the NCAA repeatedly claims.","HuffPost: Is this a real plan with a chance to come to fruition, or is it an effort to say, “This is possible for the NCAA to do”?","Volante: This is definitely a real plan. We already have several investors from Silicon Valley. We have an investor from the New York tech community. They certainly see the value from a monetization standpoint.","For me, this is a full-time job. We have a team. We have at least 30 people across the country that contribute in some way, shape or form. We have Keith Sparks, who is our chief development officer and was formerly an associate athletic director at Stanford University. And he was able to bring us our CMO, Ralph Greene, who used to head Nike Football and also started Nike Basketball’s international pipeline. This is absolutely a real thing.","HuffPost: Why HBCUs? What makes, say, Howard or Grambling the right place to do this?","Schwarz: The schools within the NCAA cartel who are getting the short end of the deal are the HBCUs. A Division I HBCU gets less than a million dollars from the NCAA and its conference combined. A [Southeastern Conference] school can get over $40 million. That’s a huge disparity. So what they are getting for the exploitation of black labor is a small amount. And they are, of the people receiving some of these profits, the ones that most recognize that a system in which black labor was more valued would be mission-consistent with their raison d’etre, in a way that some other small schools might think about but not care about. That’s my theory.","Volante: Beyond the economic piece of it, historically, these universities have been involved in a number of selfless efforts to offer educational opportunities and further the economic opportunities for African Americans as a whole. A lot of these schools started right after the Civil War during the Reconstruction Era, so there’s the opportunity there that taking these brands which are very strong within the HBCU community and the African-American community and breathing new life into them and showing to the rest of the U.S. how great of institutions they truly are, and how well they prepare individuals for life after college, whether they’re an athlete or not.","We think there’s significant upside for the schools to get involved, but also significant upside for these players to go onto campuses where they will be welcomed with open arms and there will be a holistic approach to preparing for life after basketball, or getting all the tools they need to go to the NBA.","HuffPost: Do you worry about the perception of white guys creating a business model that’s, for lack of a better word, experimenting on HBCUs and black athletes?","Schwarz: I know people are wary about it because that’s almost always the first question that Ricky and I get when we go in and talk to university presidents. There’s a suspicion of a carpetbagger coming in here and feeding us a line. The good news is, if you go to our website and look at the seven or so people who are really leading the charge here, it’s not a majority white organization at this point. It was my idea, Ricky wrote the original business plan, but we have expanded so that some of that problem has gone away. And when we go to these meetings, generally we’re a mixed group.","I think it’s a perfectly valid question to ask: “Why do I care about HBCUs? Isn’t this just me trying to prove a point?” But I hope that anybody who goes to our website thinks about who’s investing in us ― we have an important executive in Silicon Valley who is black and is involved with programs connecting the tech community with HBCUs, we have people who’ve done their Ph.D.’s on the experience of black athletes at predominately white institutions.","HuffPost: Time for the classic question: Where does the money come from to pay these guys, and how much would they make?","Volante: We are not asking for a single dime from any school that’s participating in this. The way the plan’s been structured ... it’s club teams on these campuses. That’s done with the sole purpose in mind of protecting the universities. It’s not a fork in the road. It’s not, I turn right and stay with the NCAA, I turn left and go with HBL. This is very much a parallel path that we are going to be operating this club team on the campuses of these HBCUs and the varsity teams will continue to exist. They’ll still get their distributions from the NCAA for March Madness every year. This is complementary revenue, not replacement revenue.","The salaries and all the costs of the league are going to be covered initially by private investors. It will shift at a point, hopefully within the first season or two, that our revenues will cover any and all costs and there will be excess left over to not only provide additional payments and grow the salaries of our players, but also ensure that the financial incentive is there for the schools to want to continue to participate.","As to determining who gets paid what, much like in professional basketball, it will be driven by talent. Right now, the salaries will range from $50,000 to $100,000 per season. But that’s just a piece of what they get. If you’re Zion Williamson you’re going to get the maximum amount because you’re an elite talent. If you’re a guy who’s a very good basketball player but doesn’t have NBA potential, in that first season he might get $50,000 with the opportunity to grow his salary. The salary is determined year to year.","Schwarz: But to be clear, the scholarship piece is completely unconditional on quality of play. You get a five-year scholarship even if you go to the NBA after one season — you can come back and use that scholarship.","HuffPost: So you’re guaranteeing a full scholarship plus at least $50,000 a year?","Volante: The thing that gets the headlines is the compensation. Number two is the five-year guaranteed scholarship. Number three is where we start to get into the fringe benefits that any other employee at any place has: having a 401(k) set up, having an appropriate insurance plan, so these guys are going to be protected for injury. We’re going to help them monetize their social media accounts. So a player might walk out of college with a degree ― a real degree ― and also with savings that might be $300,000 to $500,000 or more.","HuffPost: Who are you targeting on the recruiting trail? The one-and-dones superstars of the world, or more of the mid-tier college basketball player whose NBA hopes are a little less real?","Volante: The shortest answer is both. We want all of them.","Schwarz: It’s not just a one-and-done. For that very next tier of folks who are really the bread and butter of what makes March Madness exciting to people ― we want to get that player. And we think, there, [that] the contrast in earnings is the greatest, between what that guy will earn maybe playing in the G-League for a couple years, or playing in Australia or wherever, and losing out on not just the best four years of his earnings but maybe the best six years of his earnings. We think our package is really superior in that spot.","HuffPost: What’s been the level of interest from the HBCUs?","Volante: We’ve spoken with between 12 and 15, including some of the biggest ones out there. We have a couple of schools that have told us that they would like to be involved, they would like to participate, however they do not want to be the first school to say yes. So finding that first-mover has definitely proven challenging for us.","HuffPost: There are 102 HBCUs across the United States. Are you trying to get all of them to join?","Volante: No. There’s a reason why, at least in the U.S., every sports league ends up hovering between 20 and 35 or so teams. Once you go beyond that, the overall cost of a single-entity operation becomes a net-negative as opposed to finding that optimal place. We’re hoping to reach that within five seasons. But the actual profile of the schools we’re trying to get falls into three buckets. Bucket one is an HBCU that you generally know, even the average person, so a Howard or a Hampton. [Number two is] schools that once upon a time, pre-desegregation, were athletic powerhouses, so examples there would be like Florida A&M or Texas Southern. And number three would be smaller institutions that unless you’re in that niche community you probably wouldn’t know, but the school is situated in a major metropolitan area. An example might be Xavier in New Orleans or Fisk in Nashville.","In year one, we want 12 or 16. Once we hit 12, the green light goes, we start recruiting players rapidly, and ramping things up.","Schwarz: I think the audience is ready for it. People your age, people Ricky’s age, are ready for it sooner than it feels like legislators would be ready for it. This is a situation where maybe democracy is lagging behind capitalism, in some sense. We don’t need every person in America to tune into our product to be successful. We just need a solid fan base that can cover the cost of a solid league, and we can grow from there. The idea that if some college programs paid their athletes, college sports will die is so silly. And we, among other things, are going to prove that.","HuffPost: Has the FBI investigation into college basketball changed your calculus? It seems to me that, say, an Adidas executive or an AAU coach might look around and say, “Why participate in a system that could get me thrown in jail, if there’s another league where all this is legal?”","Volante: That’s part of the pitch, at least to certain audiences.","Apparel company conversations have started. Adidas and some of the other bigger ones are going to be forced to change their business model soon if this DOJ investigation really does result in people going to prison. Because otherwise every time you send a representative out, you risk them being arrested. Those companies, sooner rather than later, are going to have to realize that either they continue going down the path they’re on with the NCAA, and don’t change the model and risk people and their lives ― or they align themselves with a model that doesn’t care, that realizes what they’re doing are everyday business practices in every other industry. So Adidas and Nike are primary targets of ours, but they’re certainly not the only ones out there.","Schwarz: One of the things we’re offering our athletes is that they can make their own shoe deal.","Volante: What has been the end goal of Adidas’ business model? It’s to eventually have those elite players who have gone to Louisville and other schools, that once they go to the NBA, they’re wearing Adidas shoes. Here you don’t have to have all those intermediate steps. Adidas or Nike can sign those players while they’re in the HBL, and they already have their shoe deal, and those companies can start building their brand around these guys. There’s a lot of potential value here, to Adidas or Nike or whatever company, to the players, and the schools will be getting the benefit the entire time. If the next Zion Williamson is playing for Grambling or Hampton or Howard, that school is going to constantly be in the forefront of peoples’ minds when they’re watching college basketball. You’re not going to think about Duke or Kentucky. You’re going to think about them.","HuffPost: So when’s the first game?","Volante: There are a ton of chicken-and-egg things going on. Every group of stakeholders is looking at each other and saying, “Are you in? Are you in? Are you in?” However, we are starting to break through those. We’ve been most successful on the investment front, and when you have more money, you’re able to do more things. So I think we’ll be able to ramp up our school recruitment effort significantly in the next couple months. And I would say realistically, the HBL’s inaugural season will tip off on Juneteenth 2020."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ac248d71e000008087b0563.jpeg?cache=8GoorydOcq&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"SPORTS","headline":"Students Singing National Anthem Kneel At MLB Game","authors":"Ron Dicker","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/two-students-singing-national-anthem-kneel-at-seattle-mariners-game_us_5ac2462ae4b0a47437aca459","short_description":"Colin Kaepernick retweeted a picture of the apparent protest.","date":"2018-04-02"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"How Chicago’s Leading Latino Progressive Bested The Democratic Party Machine","authors":"Daniel Marans","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chuy-garcia-chicago-congress_us_5abe9a84e4b055e50acd9d74","short_description":"“The southwest side was ripe for change,” said Jesús “Chuy” García.","date":"2018-04-02"},"articleContent":["Jesús “Chuy” García, a Cook County commissioner and veteran progressive leader, easily won the March 20 Democratic primary race to succeed Rep. Luis Gutiérrez, who is retiring this year from Illinois’ 4th Congressional District.","Given the Democratic leanings of the majority-Latino Chicago-area district ― Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump there by 69 percentage points ― García is virtually assured victory in the general election.","But the implications of García’s primary win stretch far beyond the safe Democratic congressional seat. García’s coattails have elevated a new generation of mostly Latino, millennial progressive officials who ran as critics of Chicago’s reigning Democratic Party “machine.”","When García delivered his victory speech, he brandished a broom to celebrate the proverbial “sweep” of the entire slate of progressive candidates he endorsed: Aaron Ortiz and Delia Ramirez, Democratic nominees for state House; Alma Anaya, a García aide set to replace him on the Cook County board of commissioners; and Beatriz Fausto-Sandoval, the Democratic nominee for 14th Subcircuit judge.","HuffPost interviewed García about the success of the slate, the future of progressive politics in Chicago and what he plans to prioritize in Congress. The transcript below has been edited and condensed for clarity.","One of the lesser-known stories of last Tuesday’s primaries is that your slate of progressive down-ballot candidates swept their races. How did you do it?","We had a sense that the southwest side of Chicago has been disenfranchised more than any part of the metro region, and certainly in Cook County, primarily because it is a Mexican-American community, an immigrant community and thus a young community. Historically it has had a smaller voting population than other parts of the city where there are Latinos.","We knew that things had changed over the past 20 years, where more younger voters have turned 18. They probably did not have a very strong connection to politics or the electoral process.","But the terrain has continued to shift and the southwest side was ripe for change. We felt that that had changed because of the experiences of the past four years in particular, the 2015 mayoral election when I ran against Rahm Emanuel, and forced the city’s first runoff election.","And then the following year, in 2016, Bernie Sanders’ run in the primary against Hillary Clinton raised political awareness and got people engaged in elections and politics to a significant degree.","Then the third component was that the aspirations of the Mexican community for greater political empowerment would be an important ingredient in this election cycle with my run for Congress. One, I am an immigrant. Two, I am of Mexican-American heritage. My name recognition and high favorables would be an important strength for the slate.","We also calculated that older voters, those who have sort of been in my base for several decades, voters who are today between 45 and 70, would respond positively to the candidacies of young people like our progressive slate. Because the progressive slate represents the aspirations of our community, it represents their children and grandchildren coming of age and ready to take the reins of leadership.","We are also very happy that we could finally field a slate that was 50 percent female and 50 percent male. We thought that that would appeal to everyone across the board because of the fairness of it all.","The election proved that those assumptions were spot-on. And, of course, there isn’t a happier guy than me in Chicagoland right now.","How did you decide who would be on your slate? Did you vet their progressive credentials?","The vetting that took place wasn’t done by the 22nd Ward political organization members. It was a larger grouping of people on the southwest side, and we consulted with our allies. It wasn’t a perfect process by any stretch. It was very challenging to attempt to come up with these candidates.","We consulted with labor, with women. Of course, they had to be pro-labor, they had to be pro-choice, they had to be anti-machine, they had to be pro-environment. There were critical issues that in order for them to be aligned with progressive values they have to sort of express a knowledge of and to share in those values.","Is this the beginning of the end of Chicago’s Democratic machine?","It was a very good night for progressives. The most disenfranchised part of the city and the suburbs were successful. Millennials, Latinas and Latinos, progressive-oriented politics and individuals, and individuals with strong roots in their communities had a very good night.","It’s not an insignificant thing that the Cook County assessor’s race resulted in the defeat of the person who heads the local Democratic Party. There’s a lot of change in the air at the national level and at the state and local level with the decision that the national party, the DNC, has to make about whether it will accept the reform commission’s recommendations. It will be telling about whether the party will be more open and embracing of other parts of the party.","How does this position Chicago progressives to take on Mayor Rahm Emanuel in 2019?","It’s a bit early yet to say. We’re savoring the moment and trying to come up with a better analysis of all the lessons that need to be incorporated. We haven’t seen, for example, an analysis of all those people who voted and what might have been the effects of our 2015 campaign on them. Right now we can only speculate. A little more data will provide a more concrete argument for making policy recommendations about the direction of the party","But are you ― not you as a candidate ― eager to try for more progressive leadership at city hall?","Absolutely. There is a desire to see voices who represent progressive values and neighborhood empowerment and an equity agenda in local government in Chicago and the city council.","What do you say to people who argue that Democrats taking on other Democrats is misguided?","That’s what democracy is all about. Having a forum where issues can be debated, where ideas are free and flowing, is a good thing. Democracy might be a messy undertaking, but it’s the best form of government that can prevail anywhere in the world. That’s what will attract new voters to participate and to engage and to stand up as progressives and as leaders, including as candidates and as representatives.","If there aren’t demands made of political leaders and parties and government then power will never be distributed in an equitable manner. For people who care about equity and justice, having a lively debate and process is a must. That’s what I think is going on in Chicago and Illinois at the present time ― as well as the country.","One of the missing ingredients in Bernie Sanders’ 2016 bid and frankly, in your 2015 mayoral bid, was the support of black voters. Why do you think some progressive candidates have struggled to make inroads in the black community and what needs to be done about that?","For one, you always have to examine context. If you examine the 2015 context, you’ll see that it was an 11th-hour candidacy, so we didn’t have time to solidify with a coalition in a less pressurized environment. Two, don’t forget that I was running while Obama, who hails from Chicago and is highly revered by many African-American voters, endorsed the incumbent mayor and cut ads to that effect just as we were going to the final leg of the campaign.","Those were big factors. And when you overlay that with the amount of money that was injected into the campaign and that was used to define me in a negative light, there’s a pretty good lens to understand why the results of that election ― the fact that I did receive 43 percent of the African-American vote doesn’t exactly spell out a failure.","It’s a very different comparison from the Bernie Sanders phenomenon in 2016. We did achieve a runoff and no one in Chicago has done that before ― black, white or Latino.","Still, speaking about the progressive movement more broadly, what do you see as the challenges and the keys to success in the black community?","Candidates who are seeking to represent the community need to be rooted in their communities and they need to voice the issues and policy solutions that can improve the lives of those communities. They also need to articulate how they will work in coalition with other progressives across the city and the region to bring about the changes that are needed, as well as how transforming the grim realities of disinvested communities can be addressed by a federal government that is different from what we have in place today.","What will your priorities be as a member of Congress?","For one, given the number of immigrants in the district, upwards of 230,000 alone, the number of mixed-status families in terms of immigration, obviously addressing DACA, addressing the plight of DACA families, as well as the larger plight of 10 million-plus undocumented people, remains a priority for the district. I plan to be an engaged proponent of immigration reform.","I also remain very passionate about access to college and vocational education and training ― and their affordability. I’m a big proponent of making public colleges and universities free. I will be chiming in hard on that issue.","The third area, and it’s connected to the workforce piece, is creating good-paying jobs and jobs in growth industries, especially in green industries that will enable people to provide for the families. I support a strong and robust infrastructure bill that can rebuild infrastructure across the country. For Chicago, that means a greater investment in transit and transportation and of course keeping us the crossroads of the country because of our highways and railways and our two international airports.","Your predecessor, Luis Gutiérrez, of course, was a point person on immigration reform. But during the brief government shutdown, he was at one point willing to trade a border wall for protected status for the DACA recipients during negotiations with the president. Would you have done that? What are your deal-breakers for a DACA fix?","With respect to the border wall, I remain staunchly opposed to a wall. We never knew what a border wall exactly meant when that conversation took place. I heard different figures in terms of billions of dollars that that might have entailed at that time. The more the American people learn about the cost and the futility and how backward that idea is, it will lose some of the appeal that the Trump rhetoric created in the ’16 election and he has sought to maintain that.","On immigration, I will be an active proponent of commonsense reform that will look at the entire situation and that will seek to protect family reunification-based immigration that has been the staple of our immigration policy for 100 years.","So you won’t rule out the wall categorically as a deal-breaker in DACA negotiations?","I find the wall to be extremely insulting and just outrageous for our time. So I would not be open to speculating further on that.","Is withholding government funding a tool in the toolkit in the fight for a DACA fix?","It is a tool in the toolkit. To engage in mere speculation at this point in time doesn’t seem that fruitful to me.","Do you fault leadership for not fighting harder for the DACA recipients at any juncture?","It doesn’t do a lot of good to criticize that at this point in time. The Supreme Court’s refusal to intervene in two district court cases has essentially given the Congress leeway to potentially not have to address the DACA issue this year. I’m hoping I’m wrong about that and advocates will prevail upon Congress.","There’s plenty of blame to go around but I’m looking forward at what will be in front of me when I get to Congress.","Will you vote for Nancy Pelosi as House Speaker?","I don’t know at this point. I don’t know if she’ll be running for leader of the House. I haven’t had an opportunity to speak with her yet, or to meet her. So I would like that opportunity."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5abe9b881e00003b137b0379.jpeg?cache=SbUc1uR1VV&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"BLACK VOICES","headline":"Dorian Harris Stole Beer From A Corner Store, So The Clerk Shot Him Dead: Police","authors":"Hayley Miller","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dorian-harris-shooting-tennessee_us_5ac27212e4b00fa46f85328f","short_description":"Anwar Ghazali has been charged with first-degree murder of the black teen.","date":"2018-04-02"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"More Cities Are Banishing Highways Underground — And Building Parks On Top","authors":"Stateline, Editorial Partner","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/more-cities-are-banishing-highways-underground-and_us_5ac2392be4b06d87de5a54ea","short_description":"Capping a highway to create a park also can reconnect urban neighborhoods sliced apart by the expressway building boom of the 1960s and ’70s.","date":"2018-04-02"},"articleContent":["By Martha T. Moore","The most popular place to put a city park is, increasingly, on a highway.","Cities looking to boost their downtowns, or to improve downtrodden neighborhoods, are creating “highway cap parks” on decks constructed over freeways that cut through the urban center. Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Denver and Dallas have deck parks underway. Atlanta, Houston, Minneapolis and Santa Monica, California, are among the cities considering similar projects.","In crowded cities, highway deck parks are a way to create new acreage and provide green space that can spur downtown development. Capping a highway to create a park also can reconnect urban neighborhoods sliced apart by the expressway building boom of the 1960s and ’70s.","“There’s been a sort of a sea change in the way people think about roads and real estate in general,” said Ed McMahon, a senior fellow at the Urban Land Institute, a Washington, D.C., nonprofit that focuses on land use. “If you design a city around cars, you’re going to get more cars. If you design a city around people, you’re going to get more people and places and better real estate value.”","Dallas broke ground in February on the highway project that will undergird its second deck park, to be built over Interstate 35 in the Oak Cliff neighborhood. In 2012, the city opened the 5-acre, $110 million Klyde Warren Park above a freeway that separates the downtown Dallas Arts District from the Uptown residential and retail neighborhood.","“Everyone knows the future of cities is a good quality of life and attracting folks and telling them you don’t have to live in a concrete jungle,” said Bobby Abtahi, president of the Dallas Park and Recreation Board.","Dallas began building deck parks when local officials realized that its paucity of green space was hurting the city’s competitiveness with businesses, Abtahi said. Klyde Warren Park, now run by a foundation, includes a performance space, a children’s park, a restaurant and a dog run.","Property values around the park have shot up, bringing higher property tax revenue for the city. Office rents in nearby towers have risen by a third since the park opened. New development brought 7,000 more workers to downtown and 1,500 new apartments.","Klyde Warren Park, which draws a million visitors a year, “has kind of turned into our public square,” Abtahi said. “It’s really turned into a place where you see anyone and everyone.”","But skeptics argue that highways topped by parks are still highways, and that cities would be better off investing in mass transit.","Angie Schmitt, editor of Streetsblog USA, a news site that promotes alternatives to car transportation, said deck parks are too often used to “greenwash” highway expansion projects.","“The problem with having a park over a highway is that highways aren’t a very nice place to be,” Schmitt said. “There’s a lot of pollution and a lot of noise. Capping a highway is a very expensive way to create land. You could end up with a very expensive park that’s not a great park.”","Attractive Urban Cores","Some deck parks have been around for decades: Seattle opened Freeway Park over I-5 in 1976 and Phoenix has had a park over I-10 since 1990. The current surge is being spurred by strong demand for development in the urban core, where there’s not much space for new parks.","“If you had plenty of other well-located urban land, you don’t need to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to make this location better,” said Jennifer Ball, vice president for planning and economic development of Central Atlanta Progress, a business coalition. “This urban land is at a premium now.”","To respond to the demand, Central Atlanta Progress has designed and is studying the feasibility of the Stitch, a $300 million proposed project to cover portions of the I-75/I-85 “connector” that creates a 14-lane gash through Atlanta’s downtown. The Stitch would include parks, a rebuilt transit station, and land for new development.","“It really is an economic development strategy,” Ball said. “It has a park, but if you dig closely into all the pretty renderings, we also see it as real estate development projects and the development of air rights. You’re creating land.”","Deck parks are expensive: Chicago’s Millennium Park, built over railroad tracks, cost $490 million and opened in 2004, four years after the millennium it was intended to celebrate. The Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Greenway, created during Boston’s “Big Dig” to bury its Central Artery, cost $40 million, a fraction of the entire project’s $15 billion price tag but still a sizeable investment. Almost half of the $110 million cost of building Klyde Warren Park came from corporate and private donors.","Aging Expressways","The urgent need to repair or upgrade many half-century-old urban expressways also is fueling the construction of so-called cap parks. Highway reconstruction projects offer an opportunity — and possibly funding — for freeway caps.","In Denver, a $1.3 billion highway project will tear down an elevated portion of I-70 that runs through a low-income neighborhood, sink the rebuilt roadway and build a 5-acre deck park on top. (The project is being challenged in court on environmental grounds.) In Dallas, the Oak Cliff park deck will be built as part of a $666 million highway reconstruction project that will widen I-35 from eight lanes to 10.","The Oak Cliff park will reconnect a residential neighborhood divided by the highway’s construction in the ’50s. Oak Cliff residents objected to the current planned highway widening and proposed a cap park to offset the impact.","“The sentiment was, ‘Why should North Dallas and Klyde Warren get all the nice things?”’ Abtahi said. “That was never a discussion that was had before this highway was built.”","Highways built during the interstate highway boom are nearing the end of their useful life, so some kind of reconstruction is inevitable, said Michael Morris, director of transportation for the North Central Texas Council of Governments. The council is funding the bulk of the nearly $40 million cost for the Oak Cliff park.","“If you’re going to do it, you might as well have adult conversations with the people along the corridor about what’s in the best interests of their communities,” he said. For one thing, unhappy residents can drastically slow down the approval process for a highway project. “If you want to be in the freeway business in urban regions, you’ve got to be in the context-sensitive design business or you’re going to be there for a long time.”","Similarly, in Pittsburgh, a $26 million cap park over I-579 will rejoin the Hill District, a primarily African-American part of the city that was cut off by the highway construction, to downtown.","And in Minnesota, the state transportation department is considering three expressway lids as part of a two-year planning project for overhauling I-94, one of the city’s main arteries. One of the decks would reconnect Rondo, an African-American neighborhood in St. Paul split in two by the highway. The destruction of that neighborhood was so great — 900 homes and businesses were demolished — that in 2015 the state transportation commissioner Charles Zelle and Mayor Chris Coleman formally apologized to residents.","The Obama administration also gave deck parks a push, offering a $19 million grant for the Pittsburgh park. Then-Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx in 2016 said that urban highways had exacerbated economic inequality by devastating African-American neighborhoods for the benefit of suburban drivers.","“We have entire areas in this country where the infrastructure that is supposed to connect people is constraining them,” Foxx said in a speech at the Center for American Progress, a progressive think tank. “Achieving a middle-class life is made harder because of past transportation decisions.” He urged transportation planners to work on “connecting people to opportunity.”","Morris, the Texas transportation engineer, said Foxx “correctly reminded people … you have a responsibility to be sensitive to these issues.” The Oak Cliff park “speaks very directly to this particular policy.”","Stateline home page","Sign up for exclusive state policy reporting and research"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ac2395e2000008106eb39ee.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"MEDIA","headline":"Political Cartoonist Lampoons Evangelical Support For Trump In Easter Takedown","authors":"Ed Mazza","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-evangelical-cartoon_us_5ac19c9ae4b0f112dc9d47a2","short_description":"\"So devout!\"","date":"2018-04-02"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"BLACK VOICES","headline":"Houston Teen Awarded Full-Ride Scholarships To 20 Top Colleges","authors":"David Moye","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/houston-teen-awarded-20-full-ride-scholarships-to-top-colleges_us_5ac24f33e4b055e50acf5d43","short_description":"“For me, it’s important to highlight that I’m not the only student of color who is achieving,” 17-year-old Micheal Brown said.","date":"2018-04-02"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Why Trump's Census Change Could Hit Asian-Americans Especially Hard","authors":"Kimberly Yam","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-citizenship-question-asian-americans_us_5abe613de4b0f112dc9bdac6","short_description":"One in five Asian-Americans live in hard-to-count census areas due to high rates of poverty, unemployment and educational attainment, among other factors.","date":"2018-04-02"},"articleContent":["The Trump administration’s decision to add a question about citizenship to the census does not bode well for Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders, civil rights groups fear.","Research has already shown that the minority group is significantly undercounted in the survey, with one-fifth of Asian-Americans and one-third of Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders living in hard-to-count census areas. This is partly due to the fact that some Asian-American and Pacific Islander, or AAPI, subgroups have relatively high rates of poverty, unemployment and educational attainment, among other factors.","Experts say the question about citizenship will significantly reduce participation in the census, and Asian-American civil rights organizations are worried about how the question could affect the growing minority group.","“Given the high number of Asian immigrants, any question regarding citizenship is likely to scare the Asian community. We are very concerned that the addition of citizenship question will disproportionately cause an undercount in the Asian community,” John C. Yang, president and executive director of the civil rights group Asian Americans Advancing Justice | AAJC, told HuffPost by email.","“The community already is fearful of the anti-immigrant rhetoric and immigration policies advanced by this administration,” Yang added. “At a minimum, the addition of this question will make it even more challenging to ensure that the community has sufficient trust in the census such that they will respond.”","Treating AAPIs as a monolith ignores how poverty and other factors contribute to undercounting in particular AAPI subgroups, according to a joint fact sheet by the Leadership Conference Education Fund and Georgetown Law’s Center On Poverty and Inequality. While it’s often assumed that AAPIs are financially well-off, reports show that Cambodian-, Hmong- and Laotian-Americans, who predominantly came to the U.S. as refugees, experience higher than average rates of poverty and lower levels of income. More than one-third of Nepalese-Americans also live in poverty.","Communities with lower educational attainment are more difficult to count, too. And Southeast Asian-Americans have some of the highest dropout rates in the country, with about 34.3 percent of Laotian-American adults lacking high school diplomas, as well as 40 percent of Hmong-American and nearly the same percentage of Cambodian-American adults. Yet about 90 percent of the general U.S. adult population finishes high school or gets a GED certificate.","Lower rates of English proficiency contribute to undercounting in the census as well. More than one-third of AAPIs have limited English proficiency, defined as a limited ability to read, speak, write or understand English. And the majority of AAPIs speak a language other than English.","What’s more, much of the AAPI community in the U.S. is made up of immigrants. In fact, almost 60 percent of AAPIs were born in another country, and an estimated 1.7 million undocumented AAPI immigrants live in U.S. The concept of a census is completely foreign for many new immigrants, Yang said, which, along with the citizenship question, would further discourage many AAPIs from participating.","Increased undercounting of AAPIs could have notable repercussions, Yang noted. A report from the GW Institute of Public Policy shows that more than $800 billion of federal funding in fiscal year 2016 relied on census data. And with census data meant to determine political representation, lower participation in the survey could mean AAPI concerns go ignored while resources for hospitals, disaster relief services, health care services and more are misallocated, Yang said.","“Undercount of the Asian American Pacific Islander community will leave the community underrepresented, under-resourced, and under-protected,” he explained. “An undercount will mean that congressional districts will be allocated and drawn without an accurate understanding [of] the Asian American community.”","Already, several AAPI organizations have spoken out against the citizenship question. The Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus (CAPAC) chair, Rep. Judy Chu (D-Calif.), issued a statement condemning the new measure and expressing her commitment to using the legislative process to stop its implementation.","“The census is essential for ensuring fair and accurate representation and distribution of government resources,” Chu wrote. “But by including a question on citizenship, which is not required by the Constitution, the Trump Administration is exploiting the fear of immigrant communities who are already reticent to divulge personal information to the federal government.”","Social services nonprofit Asian American Federation, along with 35 partners, sent letters to both the CAPAC and the New York Congressional Delegation to advocate against the question. Citing the cost of hiring additional staff for follow-up on unanswered census questions, the question’s lack of testing, and the concerns of immigrant communities, the federation’s executive director, Jo-Ann Yoo, called on legislators to speak out.","Yang is now encouraging members of the public to fight back and make their views known once the U.S. Census Bureau seeks public comment on the questions. He also urges people to call members of Congress to show them how important the issue is to them."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ac2861b1f0000280616c216.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"COMEDY","headline":"John Oliver Shreds The Feds For Forcing Kids To Appear In Court Without Lawyers","authors":"Ed Mazza","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-oliver-immigration-court_us_5ac1c6c7e4b0f112dc9d6582","short_description":"\"Last Week Tonight\" host calls out a broken system.","date":"2018-04-02"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"QUEER VOICES","headline":"The Next Census Will Ask About Same-Sex Couples","authors":"David Lohr","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/2020-census-same-sex-couples_us_5ac259dee4b04646b644fd5e","short_description":"\"It really normalizes our experience,\" one woman said.","date":"2018-04-02"},"articleContent":["The 2020 census will ask couples residing in U.S. households to define their relationship in a new way: “same-sex” or “opposite-sex.”","The question ― the first serious attempt by the Census Bureau to identify the number of LGBTQ couples in America ― was noted in a Thursday report to Congress by the bureau.

He was 74.\n\nBochco had been battling a rare form of leukemia for several years. He had a transplant in late 2014 that was credited with prolonging his life. Details of his death were unclear Sunday.","Working with different collaborators, Bochco co-created some of TV’s most popular series for more than 20 years while helping to create the template for modern hours featuring large ensemble casts, serialized storylines and edgy content.\n\nThe recipient of numerous industry awards, including the Humanitas Prize and Peabody honors, Bochco was nominated for an Emmy 30 times in his capacities as producer and writer, winning 10.\n\nOn “NYPD Blue,” he consciously set out to expand the parameters of what was acceptable on broadcast television, and he recalled sitting with then-ABC Entertainment chief Robert Iger ― who went on to become CEO of the Walt Disney Co. ― drawing naked figures, determining exactly how much of the body could be shown.","More recently Bochco co-created mystery crime-drama “Murder in the First,” which began its run on TNT in 2014.\n\nBochco launched such series as “Hill Street Blues” ― a ground-breaking, Emmy-winning cop show ― and “L.A. Law” for NBC before entering into a landmark 10-series deal with ABC in the late 1980s. The relationship produced some clear hits (“NYPD Blue,” “Doogie Howser, M.D.”) and notable failures, including the musical police drama “Cop Rock” and the serialized courtroom drama “Murder One,” which followed a single murder trial over an entire season. As virtual proof the latter was ahead of its time, Bochco essentially revived it in 2014, under the title “Murder in the First,” for TNT.\n\nAsked how he could risk gambling on a musical like “Cop Rock” given the richness of his ABC pact, Bochco once joked, “With my deal, how could I not?”\n\nMaintaining a high profile, Bochco wasn’t above engaging in public spats and power struggles, from complaining about his treatment by network executives to tussling with recalcitrant stars. In one of the highest-profile tiffs, his rift with David Caruso during the first season of “NYPD Blue” led to the actor’s exit, a considerable gamble for a series in its first season. Bochco replaced him with former “L.A. Law” co-star Jimmy Smits, and the program went on to run 11 years.\n\nAlthough Bochco often consciously pressed against boundaries and seemed to delight in testing censors, he recalled that the breakthrough storytelling style of “Hill Street” was born more out of necessity than design.\n\n“We had so many characters that we realized we couldn’t service 10 or 11 characters within the confines of a single episode, so the only way that we could really do justice to the size of the world was by creating storylines that spilled over the margins,” he told the New York Times.\n\nThe producer also had a way of celebrating even his failures. When “Cop Rock” came to an end after a mere 11 episodes, what turned out to be the final episode incorporated a musical sequence where a fat lady literally sang, signaling its cancellation.\n\nBochco also appeared to relish nettling his critics, saying that the pressure campaign waged against “NYPD Blue” - which helped prompt dozens of stations not to air the show when it premiered - ultimately helped promote the series and turning it into a hit.","Steven Ronald Bochco was born in New York, the son of a violin virtuoso (which inspired his production company’s onscreen logo). He attended NYU and subsequently Carnegie Institute of Technology, receiving a degree in theater.\n\nHe started his writing career in the 1960s. Credits included “Columbo,” with an episode directed by Steven Spielberg, who also came up through the ranks at Universal Television.\n\nBochco wrote such features as “The Movie Maker” and “Silent Running” before he began to steadfastly focus on television and create his own shows, including “Delvecchio,” a drama starring Judd Hirsch. Later came “Bay City Blues,” about a baseball team, which didn’t last.\n\nWith “Hill Street Blues,” Bochco and co-creator Michael Kozoll broke the dramatic mold, featuring a huge ensemble cast and gritty narrative while juggling various subplots. NBC was in the ratings cellar at the time, but its patience with prestige programs like “Hill Street” and “Cheers” was rewarded after “The Cosby Show” premiered in 1984, turning its Thursday lineup into a ratings juggernaut.\n\nBeyond his own career, Bochco helped shepherd along those of several other prominent writers, hiring David Milch on “Hill Street” and enlisting David E. Kelley ― then a Boston lawyer ― to work on “L.A. Law.”","When the Producers Guild of America honored Bochco with its David Susskind lifetime achievement award in 1999, his track record of quality programs was cited as “the standard all television producers strive for.”\n\nFor all his success with police dramas and legal shows, Bochco produced a wide variety of series, from the animated satire “Capitol Critters” to “Public Morals,” an edgy comedy on which he collaborated with Jay Tarses that also ran into standards-and-practices problems.\n\nAlthough major successes eluded him in his later years, Bochco remained active and in demand, taking over as showrunner of “Commander in Chief” ― an ABC drama that featured Geena Davis as the first female U.S. president ― and co-creating “Over There,” an FX series that focused on soldiers in Iraq and their families back home. The latter, introduced while the war was ongoing in 2005, engendered controversy because of the timing and subject matter.","The producer also tried his hand at novels, writing “Death by Hollywood,” a darkly comic satire with a struggling screenwriter as its protagonist.\n\nBochco was loyal to his friends ― certain actors appeared in his shows time and again ― but could also nurse a grudge. He also became disenchanted with what he saw as creative interference from the networks, hewing more toward cable.\n\nBochco’s association with the business extended to his family. His second wife, Barbara Bosson, co-starred in “Hill Street Blues,” and his sister, Joanna Frank, had a recurring role on “L.A. Law” as the wife of firm partner Douglas Brackman, played by her real-life husband (and thus Bochco’s brother-in-law), Alan Rachins. The producer later married Dayna Kalins, a TV executive. His son, Jesse, became a prominent director, working on many of his father’s shows.\n\nBochco was thrice married, the first time to Gabrielle Levin, the second to Bosson.\n\nHe is survived by his third wife, TV producer Dayna Kalins, whom he married in 2000, as well as daughter Melissa and sons Jeffrey and Jesse.\n\nColleagues and friends took to Twitter on Sunday to pay tribute to Bochco:","CORRECTION: An earlier photo caption misidentified “L.A.

Many protesters seemed to have their sights set on this year’s midterm elections, as they carried signs alluding to their voting power and arguing that politicians backed by the National Rifle Association needed to be voted out of office.","But anti-gun violence advocacy groups say there is one more test: whether the momentum that led students to organize the March For Our Lives in the nation’s capital can continue until Election Day in November.","“The issue is, are kids going to show up to vote?” said Kris Brown, co-president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. “Because that’s the banner of success for us.”","Voter turnout is traditionally lower for young people and during midterm election years.","“We need to make sure when voters vote in November, that this is something they’re voting on,” said Shannon Watts, co-founder of Moms Demand Action.","Both Watts and Brown pointed to last year’s gubernatorial election in Virginia as a promising blueprint for electoral success. Exit polls showed that guns were the second most important issue for voters, behind only health care. Now-Gov. Ralph Northam (D), as well as Democratic candidates on the local level, used gun control as an issue to their advantage; Democrats and gun safety advocacy groups successfully made the NRA’s support for Northam’s opponent, Ed Gillespie, a political liability.","Stoneman Douglas students from Parkland, Florida, and the people they’ve inspired seem intent on keeping the issue of gun violence front and center in the coming weeks: Marches and rallies have continued, and there are plans for a nationwide school walkout on April 20, the 19th anniversary of the Columbine High School massacre.","Victoria Kaplan, organizing director for MoveOn.org, said she considers those steps “really strong indicators” that political engagement will continue through November — and perhaps far beyond.","Many of these advocacy groups are now collaborating with the students on further political engagement, such as making it easier for them to attend lawmakers’ town halls — while bearing in mind that “they’re the ones with agency here,” said Peter Ambler, executive director of Giffords, the group co-founded by gun violence survivor and former Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.).","“Given the failure of adults to protect kids, the kids are understandably suspicious of the adults, so it’s really important that you approach young people as partners,” Ambler said, noting that students planned the March For Our Lives without being asked.","Several of the gun control advocates emphasized that the student activists have already started to build a sustainable, long-term political movement. The urgency and personal nature of the issue, they said, is likely to continue to motivate young people.","“This active shooter generation, they’re coming of age — and they’re pissed,” Ambler said.","Brown said frequent lockdown and mass shooter drills at schools around the country have shown kids what needs to change.","“For many kids, this is how they grew up, and it’s a reminder, every time they go through it, of how little has been done to truly protect them,” Brown said. “The answer that the adults have put into place, they know, really, is not going to stop it from happening again.”","“I don’t see them just walking away from this,” she added. “This is something that’s deeply personal, like, ‘You’ve told me this is the way our government is supposed to work. I see that this is — pardon my French — a bastardization of it. Fix it, and if you’re not going to fix it, then get out of the way.’”","A major motivator is students’ visceral anger at “the corruption of our political system,” as Ambler characterized it.","“The NRA is a really good bad guy for folks, and kids naturally understand that money in politics has had insidious effects on the direction that our country takes politically,” he said. “It just seems obvious [to them].”","Kaplan noted that the Parkland students have tried to make their movement inclusive and show just how many people are regularly affected by gun violence: They have put attention on shootings in urban areas where people of color predominantly live, and have spoken out about their own experiences in mostly white suburban areas.","The students’ “complete frustration and almost righteous indignation” with the government, as Brown put it, has a recent historical parallel: activism against the Iraq War, which reshaped the Democratic Party and catalyzed a generation of progressive leaders.","It is too early to say whether students motivated by gun violence now will go on to run for office, but Ambler said he sees the seeds being planted.","“You’ve got a generation of Americans that is engaging politically for the very first time in their lives.

For a long time, Stoner said, she wasn’t sure why she felt such a strong connection.","“The question of whether she was a cool new friend or more kept me awake in wonderment and dread,” Stoner wrote in the essay, published Friday. “Our bond didn’t feel quite sisterly or platonic. Flashes of her smile progressed to flashes of her wavy hair followed by the curve of her hips through her straight-leg pants. I realized I had never fantasized about a guy this way, nor really ever felt comfortable dating guys.”","Over time, the relationship became intimate, and Stoner said she fell deeply in love. Her faith, however, made it hard to accept that she could be attracted to women.","“My faith at that time played a large role in every aspect of my life, and my worldview neither supported nor accepted same-sex relationships. I prayed in turmoil nightly, begging to be healed from these desires,” Stoner wrote.","Stoner said she tried conversion therapy and physical relationships with men. Nothing worked, she wrote, and she feared she’d lose her career success.","“Some people in the industry warned me that I’d ruin my career, miss out on possible jobs and potentially put my life in danger if I ever came out,” she wrote. “My dream and all I’d worked tirelessly for since the age of 6 was suddenly at risk by my being ... true to myself.”","In a moment of awakening, Stoner wrote that she finally accepted herself for who she was: “I felt a transformation, an ascension, an approach to life rooted in real love.”","“I, Alyson, am attracted to men, women, and people who identify in other ways. I can love people of every gender identity and expression,” she wrote. “It is the soul that captivates me. It is the love we can build and the goodness we can contribute to the world by supporting each other’s best journeys.”","Stoner concluded her essay by reaching out to others who may be struggling with their identity.","“If you’re questioning or struggling with your sexuality, gender identity, or anything else, know that I and so many who’ve gone before us are with you,” Stoner wrote. “Whatever your identity, you are lovable and wonderful and enough.”\n\nHead over to Teen Vogue to read Stoner’s full essay."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ac23ae51f00002d0016c1a4.jpeg?cache=eCqJul5Wat&ops=crop_6_17_2994_1823%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"EDUCATION","headline":"Teachers Swarm Kentucky Capitol To Protest Pension Changes, School Budget Cuts","authors":"Travis Waldron","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kentucky-teacher-protests_us_5ac29c76e4b04646b6454b03","short_description":"“We feel demoralized, we feel assaulted, and we feel like we’ve been marginalized. We’re angry.”","date":"2018-04-02"},"articleContent":["FRANKFORT, Ky. ― Thousands of teachers and public workers from across Kentucky flocked to the state Capitol on Monday morning to protest potential budget cuts to public education and the passage, last week, of a controversial package of changes to the state’s public pension system that teachers had opposed.","The rally began before 9 a.m. outside the Kentucky Education Association building just blocks from the Capitol complex. Teachers, most of them clad in red (as part of the grassroots Wear Red for Ed campaign), later marched to the Capitol itself, filling up the rotunda outside legislative chambers and spilling out the front doors and down the steps.","“Enough is enough,” they chanted, many of them carrying signs telling lawmakers to fully fund their pensions and their schools and threatening that if the legislators failed to do so, the teachers would do everything in their power to remove them from office in elections this November.","“We feel demoralized, we feel assaulted and we feel like we’ve been marginalized,” said Chris Wilder, a teacher at Anderson County High School in Lawrenceburg. “We’re angry.”","Teachers have filled the Capitol complex off and on for more than a month in an effort to derail pension changes and education budget cuts proposed by Republican Gov. Matt Bevin and Republican majority leaders in both chambers of the legislature.","But their anger boiled over Thursday night when GOP lawmakers attached a slate of pension changes to a previously unrelated bill meant to address public sewage issues. Hours later, both the state House and state Senate approved the measures on party-line votes.","“The way they introduced this bill was the linchpin, the insulting part,” Wilder said. “We’re basically equivalent to excrement. It’s like, ‘This is what we think of you and your contribution to our state. Nothing. You don’t matter.’ But we matter, and our kids matter.”","The pension bill, which Bevin is expected to sign before the legislative session ends next week, did not contain some provisions teachers had been most angry about, including a cap on annual cost-of-living adjustments. The bill dropped many of the previously proposed changes to current teachers’ benefits. But it maintained a provision that places a cap on the number of a current teacher’s accumulated sick days that can count toward pension benefits ― a move Attorney General Andy Beshear, who said he would sue if the bill becomes law, has said is unconstitutional.","It also switches new hires to a “hybrid” 401(k)-style plan and ends some contractual protections that currently prohibit lawmakers from altering pension benefits for public workers, teachers included.","Those changes, teachers said, would make it hard for the state to recruit new educators in Kentucky, which already has a struggling public education system.","Even before Monday’s rally, teachers forced public schools to close in at least 25 Kentucky counties on Friday when they called in sick en masse to protest the pension plan. In Lexington, the state’s second-largest school district, more than one-third of school employees stayed out Friday. In Louisville, the absences forced the closure of Kentucky’s largest school district.","Most public school districts were already closed Monday for spring break, but the threat of another round of sick-outs caused more than a dozen school districts that were supposed to be open to close instead. The result was that public school districts were shuttered in each of Kentucky’s 120 counties on Monday, accomplishing a goal organizers had set when they announced plans for the protest.","The educators came to Frankfort from cities across the state. In Louisville, a group of Jefferson County Public School teachers met at a local Teamsters union hall and took a 45-minute bus ride to the capital. In Frankfort, groups of teachers gathered under banners bearing names of school districts spread from Pike County in eastern Kentucky to Marshall County in the west.","The initial crowd for the bus ride from Louisville disappointed some organizers. They had planned for four full busloads but sent three half-full buses instead. But upon arriving in Frankfort, it was clear that the crowd had exceeded expectations.","Organizers estimated that more than 5,000 people gathered inside and outside the Capitol, though no official estimate was available.","“This is spring break,” said Mike Kral, a retired teacher from Hardin County. “If it’d been a regular school day, it’d have been 10 times this.”","Still, it was a show of force against a state legislature that, teachers said, has failed to prioritize teachers or Kentucky’s public education system for years and, by passing the pension package so quickly Thursday, had broken a promise to its educators.","“When we signed on the dotted line to become a teacher, we knew we weren’t going to make a lot of money,” said Lynn Luking, a retired teacher from Louisville. “But we were promised a full pension and full health care. And every year they’ve taken more and more of that away.”","The protests weren’t aimed only at last week’s pension overhaul. With the end of Kentucky’s legislative session looming, lawmakers returned to the capital Monday to consider new tax legislation and a budget bill that held the potential for further cuts to public education spending.","Bevin, in January, had proposed cuts to several school-related programs in ways that some administrators said threatened the solvency of some poorer, rural districts. Many of the teachers also opposed potential new funding for charter schools that Bevin had pushed in his proposed budget.","“It seems like these folks want to privatize everything,” said Mike Haile, a retired teacher from Henderson County, in western Kentucky. “They privatized prisons and they privatized schools. It’s take the money and run.”","With the budget vote looming, a crowd of protesters gathered around a side entrance to the Capitol and chanted “Shame! Shame!” at Republican lawmakers as they entered.","Republicans ultimately introduced a bill that did not include many of Bevin’s preferred cuts or new funding for charter schools, according to the Louisville Courier-Journal, though many protesters and legislative Democrats still criticized it for cutting taxes on the rich and falling short of previous K-12 education funding levels.","The protests and school closures were reminiscent of similar movements in states including West Virginia, where teachers went on strike to protest years of tax cuts that had left the state unable to fully fund schools, and Oklahoma, where teachers were set to go on strike Monday. Teachers in Arizona could soon join them in walking out.","In Kentucky, the educators said the pension changes and budget cuts were a breaking point in their relationship with state government. They vowed that the protests and organized opposition would continue. And they promised that they would be a political force come November.","“I will walk and knock on every door,” Luking said, “to see that every one of these guys are defeated.”","Clarification: This piece has been updated to clarify that the pension legislation included a change to the way sick days are calculated into retirement plans for current teachers."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ac2a0e62000001311eb3aa6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"QUEER VOICES","headline":"Dustin Lance Black Has Great Reply After Being Told Two Men Shouldn't Raise Kids","authors":"Curtis M.

Three other children were missing and believed dead.","The speedometer indicated the vehicle was traveling at 90 mph when it crashed, and there were no skid marks, Mendocino County Sheriff Tom Allman said at a news conference last week. No one was wearing a seatbelt.","Greg Baarts, acting assistant chief for the northern division of the California Highway Patrol, cautioned that the speedometer could have been affected by the crash, and the speed of the car hasn’t been conclusively determined.","“We do have reason to believe, however, that the crash was intentional,” Baarts told local NBC affiliate KGW8-TV Saturday. He did not elaborate. “This is all based on preliminary information,” he added.","A preliminary investigation indicates the crash was an “intentional act,” a CHP representative told Portland’s KOIN6-TV. Evidence shows the car came to a halt before the cliff, then sped for the edge, the station reported.","Police searched the Hart home in Woodland, Washington, on Thursday. The application for the search warrant said a felony had been committed, and Baarts confirmed to KGW8: “It is safe to report that a felony may have been committed in this case.” He offered no details.","Baarts said computers, bank records and credit card statements were removed from the family home. Chickens and a cat were also collected.","Allman said there was “every indication” all six of the couple’s children were in the car.

In March, Jones and his program were hit with a suit by plaintiff Brennan Gilmore, who recorded the vehicular attack that left a counter-protester dead during the violent far-right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, last year. Jones labeled Gilmore a “deep state shill” and “CIA asset” who helped organize the car attack (he’s not, and he didn’t).","Bankston said his client feels confident that a jury in Travis County ― where Jones started his career and where he recently lost a custody battle with his ex-wife ― will rule fairly.","“The jury system itself is more representative of the best that our country has to offer and it’s representative of that community getting to have a voice in what’s being said,” Bankston said. “While [my client] has suffered tremendous injury from this, he knows this is more than just about him. What has happened to him is a matter of public importance.

Lawmakers nearly averted the move when they cobbled together a teacher pay raise package last week. But that bill, which became law, was quickly revealed to have funding holes. Teachers in districts around the state agreed to stay out of school until better legislation passed.","It is not clear how many districts will remain closed beyond Monday, or for how long. Tulsa Public Schools, one of the largest districts in the state, announced Monday afternoon that it would remain closed on Tuesday, with other districts likely to do the same.","The Oklahoma Education Association teachers union is coordinating the walkout. Its president, Alicia Priest, laid out a number of demands in a Facebook video posted Sunday night.","Priest called last week’s funding bill a “down payment.” Legislators need to plug a $50 million hole opened up by the repeal of a tax on hotel and motel stays that was initially part of the tax package, she said. She also called on legislators to repeal a state tax deduction on capital gains, and to pass a bill that would bring in more tax revenue through gambling.","Those moves, Priest argued, could restore education funding after years of post-recession cuts.","“Why are we walking?” Priest asked. “There are 700,000 reasons why: our students. And they deserve better. … They see broken chairs in class, outdated textbooks that are duct-taped together, and class sizes that have ballooned.”","On Monday, the state House of Representatives adjourned without passing any bills for the day. Lawmakers are expected to return Tuesday morning in a special session to address school funding. The union accused legislators of stalling on the capital gains bill for “political reasons,” and urged teachers to return to the Capitol on Tuesday.","Oklahoma is one of several Republican-led states that now find themselves in a budget jam after years of cutting taxes. The lack of revenue has meant many teachers have gone years without meaningful raises or adequate resources for their classrooms.","As HuffPost previously reported, Oklahoma had to slash education funding in the wake of the Great Recession like many states. But then it went on to reduce its top income tax rate, as well as the gross production tax on oil and gas firms. Revenue dropped further as energy prices fell.","Over the past decade, Oklahoma has led the nation in cuts to its education formula funding, the primary way that local school districts get state money.","As one teacher put it to HuffPost, “We feel our state Legislature has chosen the oil and gas industry over our kids.”","A similar story of tax cuts and budget squeezes has unfolded in West Virginia, where a teacher strike lasted for nine school days.

Last June, it launched a transformation plan to cut costs and is working to monetize the value of its substantial real estate holdings.","Hudson’s Bay disclosed the incident after New York-based cyber security firm Gemini Advisory reported on its blog that Saks and Lord & Taylor had been hacked by a well-known criminal group known as JokerStash.","JokerStash, which sells stolen data on the criminal underground, on Wednesday said that it planned to release more than 5 million stolen credit cards, according to Gemini Chief Technology Officer Dmitry Chorine.","The hacking group has so far released about 125,000 payment cards, about 75 percent of which appear to have been taken from the Hudson’s Bay units, Chorine told Reuters by telephone.","The bulk of the 5 million card numbers that JokerStash said it plans to release are likely from Saks and Lord & Taylor, but it is too early to say for sure, Chorine said.","“It’s hard to assess at the moment, primarily because hackers have not released the entire cards in one batch,” he told Reuters.","Alex Holden, chief information security officer with cyber security firm Hold Security, confirmed that the 125,000 cards had been released by JokerStash but said it was too soon to estimate how many had been taken from Hudson’s Bay.","If in fact millions of records were stolen, the breach would be one of the largest involving payment cards in the past year, but it would still be far smaller than any of the biggest thefts on record, which occurred a decade ago.","Hackers stole more than 130 million credit cards from credit-card processor Heartland Payment Systems, convenience store operator 7-Eleven Inc and grocer Hannaford Brothers Co, from 2006 to 2008, according to U.S. federal investigators.","Cyber criminals stole some 40 million payment cards in a 2013 hack on Target Corp and 56 million from Home Depot Inc in 2014.","Hudson’s Bay said there is no indication its recent breach involved online sales at Saks and Lord& Taylor outlets or its Hudson’s Bay, Home Outfitters and HBC Europe units.","The company said that customers will not be liable for fraudulent charges resulting from the breach.","(Reporting by Jim Finkle in Toronto and David Henry in New York; Editing by Bill Rigby and Steve Orlofsky)"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ac131a81f00002d0016c0db.jpeg?cache=Cjdntkv3nx&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"John Krasinski Just Wants To Be Honest","authors":"Matthew Jacobs","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-krasinski-a-quiet-place_us_5ab963dee4b008c9e5fa63ca","short_description":"The director, co-writer and star of the new thriller \"A Quiet Place\" discusses his underperforming movies, becoming a reluctant horror fan and being remembered as Jim from \"The Office.\"","date":"2018-04-01"},"articleContent":["John Krasinski has a confession, or eight. That’s the number of times he said “if I’m being really honest” or “to be honest” or “honestly” or some other harbinger of sincerity during our half-hour conversation last week.","In each instance, this tic threatened to produce a profound revelation, and sometimes it did. It’s an interviewer’s dream: Yes, please, do tell me your secrets. Show me that toothy grin, the one that won hearts on “The Office” and in “It’s Complicated,” while divulging that which would otherwise remain undisclosed.","Among the topics John Krasinski talked about honestly: Paramount Pictures working to turn his latest movie, a gripping thriller about a family that remains silent to evade monsters roaming an unpopulated post-apocalyptic countryside, into a giant hit. “A Quiet Place” premiered to glowing reviews at South by Southwest in March, and on April 6 it opens in theaters across the United States, marking Krasinski’s fourth directorial effort (and his first collaboration with wife and co-star Emily Blunt, who asked if he’d cast her after reading the rewrite Krasinski did on Scott Beck and Bryan Woods’ original script).","The other two films Krasinski has helmed ― the David Foster Wallace adaptation “Brief Interviews with Hideous Men” (2009) and the Sundance dramedy “The Hollars” (2016) ― didn’t triumph at the box office, and the 38-year-old multi-hyphenate was honest about that, too. But “A Quiet Place” is handily his best work yet, meaning Krasinski might, at last, be thought of as a bona fide director come opening weekend. We discussed that evolution, his permanent notability as Dunder Mifflin prankster Jim Halpert, how fatherhood has (and hasn’t) influenced him creatively, and the horror movies that inspired this project.","Horror is having a moment right now. Did the “It” and “Get Out” phenomena intervene in this movie’s expectations at all?","We were shooting when “It” came out, so we were already into the movie, which is nice because, to be honest, I don’t know if I would have been strong enough to not let that influence me on the set. Also, I’m glad the studio didn’t see what “It” did and come and say, “OK, so we need a balloon.”","I wasn’t a big horror guy, but for the last year, leading up to directing this, I watched as much as I could. And the first thing I realized was how freaking ignorant I was to stay away from movies because I thought I’d be scared. It was a decision I made a long time ago, when I was a kid. And now here I am watching all these movies for, yes, research, but realizing “Get Out,” “The Witch,” “The Babadook,” “Let the Right One In” — all these movies are some of the best movies you’re going to see. The best directing, the best stories, the best cinematography. And all of them have a more underlying theme; there’s something much deeper there.","Not to say that a movie that just scares the hell out of you isn’t great, too. But I think there was probably a moment — again, being new to the horror party, I won’t speak on everyone’s behalf — where horror fans were frustrated because they were seen as B-movies. I would imagine, now that these movies are getting attention on a much bigger scale, it’s probably very reassuring. I’m late to the party, but I want to stay for a long time. This is really fun.","Your four directorial endeavors, including “The Office,” are worlds apart in style and tone. How different of a director are you now than when you first started?","Oh my god, a million percent different. The truth of the matter is: I forget who said it — someone much smarter than me — but Someone said, “When you think you get directing, it’s time to retire because that’s ridiculous. You’re always learning.” So I always knew I was learning. I always knew I could get better. But this movie was like jumping into the deep end of the deep end of the deep end. This is as different as you can get from anything I’ve done, certainly “The Hollars” and “Brief Interviews.” This is a much bigger budget, a much bigger idea, there’s visual effects, there’s designing a creature. It wasn’t one new thing — it was a whole slew of new things, and the only way I could get through it is because I connected so powerfully to the core of the script, which is the family.","And if that family thing wasn’t there, I certainly wasn’t your guy to direct this movie, because I couldn’t do just the scares or just the no-sound thing. It all had to come from the same place. So once I understood that, this could be an amazing allegory for parenthood, which is exactly what I saw it as. My [script rewrite] just drilled down on that; it drilled down on more details to fill out the world in order to bring it back to the family. Everything came back to the family. And then I realized, oh my god, that’s why it’s playing so scary for the audience, because they care about this family.","Did you look at creature movies? I guess you could consider “The Babadook” a creature movie, but this aligns more with “Alien” and “Signs.”","Yeah, I watched everything. As far as the structure of the movie, I watched exactly those movies. To me, there’s a throwback element to this that I wanted to capture. As much as I love all these modern horrors, there was something about “Jaws” and “Alien” and “Rosemary’s Baby” — Hitchcock-y stuff — that I really wanted to tap into. I wanted this to feel slightly nostalgic. I wanted it to feel like an anytime, anyplace type of movie.","But as far as the creatures, if I’m really honest with you, I wanted to do my homework. I looked into every single creature design out there, from “Jeepers Creepers” to “Pumpkinhead” to “Resident Evil.” It was so fascinating, because immediately you realize there’s nothing I can take from all of these, but I love the idea of what people responded to and why they responded to them. Of course, “Jeepers Creepers” — I didn’t have an eyeball or a face or a mouth like [the villain in that movie], but I could see elements of him that are super scary. It was just really fun.","It’s interesting to hear you apply a throwback sensibility to “A Quiet Place.” You said the same thing about “The Hollars,” that it invoked older family dramas like “Terms of Endearment.”","That’s true. Maybe I’m just trapped in a time capsule.","Well, it yields at least one obvious question: Are you dissatisfied with studio movies right now, or the moviemaking machine in general?","That’s an interesting question. I enjoy so many movies. I went to “Black Panther” last weekend and loved it. I’m a great audience member, because I always want to love the movies that I go to see. So I love the Marvel stuff, I love the “Star Wars” stuff. But I do think there’s a bigger budget, a bigger spectacle that’s happening there.","The things I’ve always connected to the most had an intimacy, had a heart connection, a soul connection, a head connection that was more than just a great experience and a great ride. It was more about seeing things in moments that changed me completely, forever — and I mean that. It wasn’t just horror movies that I drew on for this. I remember watching “In the Bedroom” for this. And that Tom Wilkinson moment where he touches his pillow where his son’s head used to be. I’ll never forget how hard I cried in that moment. I’m tearing up now. And so the power of movies for me is about what you can connect to.","Entertainment’s awesome, and it’s super exciting. When Emily and I went to “Black Panther,” we put our kids down. They were sick for, like, three weeks, and we were just like, “Let’s get a huge movie on board.” And then last week we tried to see “Phantom Thread.” We were in the moment for that, and it was sold out at the Alamo Drafthouse.","That’s nice to know, considering the movie came out in December.","I know, right? That’s kinda cool. Paul Thomas Anderson should know that.","So yeah, I think there is something about those classic movies, probably because they didn’t have the budgets and they didn’t have the technology to go huge. Even the original “Star Wars,” or “Jaws” — that was the first big blockbuster, and it feels like it has some indie flavor to it.","Compared to blockbusters today, “Jaws” is glacial. It’s really slow — not that much happens, but it’s thrilling.","It’s true. And yet it’s some of the most perfect storytelling I’ve seen. It’s so efficient and tightly done. It’s great.","You showed a cut of “The Hollars” to Rian Johnson for feedback. Did you show this movie to any filmmakers or anyone else of note?","The truth of the matter is, I was dying to. We didn’t have the schedule. I don’t know if this is bad to say — if the studio is like, “No, we were always prepared!” — but we wrapped on Nov. 1. We’ll come out on April 6. So that is five months almost to the day. That’s an insanely tight post-production process for any movie, but when you have visual effects and are super sound-heavy, it’s a tight schedule. If I’m honest, we were literally picture-cutting and sound-editing 18 or 24 hours before [the South by Southwest premiere in March].","So it was as fresh as you could possibly get. And not to say that I was happy about that. That was the most terrifying moment of my career, because you do want to have your friends see it before you show it to 1,200 people. That was intense. And yet there was part of me that was like, “You know what? Screw it. We’ve been working so hard. Maybe this is what needs to happen.” And I did understand that maybe the most respectful thing to do with the genre crowd is to let them see it first — don’t filter it; let them know what you really feel about the movie. And that was awesome.","Neither “Brief Interviews” nor “The Hollars” ended up being a big box-office draw. “Brief Interviews” made less than $100,000, and “The Hollars” less than $2 million. Did that trouble you? How did you debrief and gear up to make another movie anyway?","It’s tough. It’s not the most fun, that’s for sure. But I think there’s also an understanding of the product you’re putting out. I think you know when you’re opening small — “Brief Interviews” got to less than 100 screens; “The Hollars” reached 400 or 500 screens ― it’s not going to make that much money. I’ve always been a realist. Not to say that it’s not painful or hard or whatever, but it didn’t bum me. Because I was a realist, I knew what was happening. The studios both were very honest with me. [“Hollars” distributor Sony Pictures Classics] especially was so honest and open. They loved the movie and told me what was going to happen, and I think they were really betting more on the after-life of the movie, which has been good, which is cool.","This movie, in particular, is the same thing: It’s a low-enough budget where I just wanted the studio to make their money back. I don’t think anyone saw the reaction from South by Southwest coming. I don’t think anyone saw the reviews coming. I’ll be honest with you. There are boats that I am on, and there are boats that I’m not on, and I can tell that the studio is trying to make this as big a hit as it can. And I so hope they do, but at some point that becomes a business decision. It’s not why I made the movie, and yet if it goes on to that, fantastic.","I did this movie “Away We Go.”","Such an underappreciated movie.","Thank you so much! I love it, too. But if I’m really honest — I don’t know if I’ve talked about this before — I remember very vividly, because Emily said, “It’s really weird how you deal with bad news. How do you deal with that?” I remember when I didn’t get Captain America, I was like, “All right, let’s go to dinner,” and she was like, “Do you want to sit here and cry?” I was like, “No, it’s fine.” Even with “The Hollars,” she was like, “Are you OK that it didn’t do well?” I said, “Yeah, it’s just life — you’ve got to take it as it comes.”","But the only reason why I had that perspective, to be honest, is because my brain broke on “Away We Go.” I was early in my career, and just about a week before it came out, I remember there was this swell of enthusiasm. All of a sudden, I started getting calls from my agents and people all around saying, “Holy shit, you’re going to be in an Oscar-nominated film. This is as good as it gets.” And I was young enough to go, “Oh my god, here we go!”","I went with the wave, and that wave crashed real hard on the shore. I remember in my head something almost physically snapped, and I was like, “Probably shouldn’t do that again. As a survival thing, don’t let yourself fly that high. If it happens, awesome. If it doesn’t, don’t be crushed. Try to stay in the middle as best you can.” And it’s work, but that moment changed my life. I believed in that movie. It wasn’t just like, “Hey, man, you’re in a terrible movie that’s gonna do great.” No, I felt so personal to that movie — Maya Rudolph and I’s relationship, Sam Mendes did such a great job, it was such a special movie. So when that one had its neck broken, I was really bummed. I just promised I wouldn’t let it hit me like that anymore.","Let’s talk about “Brief Interviews” for a minute. That’s an 80-minute movie largely made up of men monologuing their feelings about women. A couple of the men sympathize with rapists. As it stands, do you think you could make that movie today, given how much we’ve reconsidered gender power dynamics?","No, I don’t think the movie could be made today, but not just for that reason. The other thing is, movies now have become a lot more of a business. It’s harder to get any movie made. I’m sure “Black Panther” took a little longer to get through. Years ago, people just let it fly a little more, or something. It felt like movies were getting made more often.","But to your point about the movement that’s happening right now, there’s two sides of that, one of which is, I think the book and the movie ― but certainly the book ― did a really good job of identifying those guys as flawed.","It is in the title.","Right, yeah! Exactly. But I think there may be part of that movie that’s like, maybe this is the best time to be watching it. That book changed my life, and I’ll tell you why. I was at Brown University. I totally started acting just to make friends and just to be in a group of people. I was doing mostly sketch comedy, I was making people laugh, and it was really fun. I was having a great time. And then Chris Hayes from MSNBC, who was a director at the time, said, “I’m going to direct this adaptation of a book. We’re just going to read the book out loud onstage.” I was like, “All right, cool.” He asked me to do it, and I thought, honestly, that I was part of the cool kids, because he was asking really cool actors to do it, and I hadn’t been part of the cool-kids acting group.","I went in and I did it, and I remember it was 99 seats or 100 seats, and we turned away like 200 people that night. I was not expecting that. I thought it was going to be 10 people in the audience. People showed up. There were people who stood up and left, there were people who were crying. We only did it one or two nights, and the next day, walking through campus, I remember, truly within 10 minutes, one teacher came to me and said, “That’s the best thing I’ve ever seen a student theater do,” and then another teacher came up and said, “You know, you’ve gotta be careful what you do, because that was very offensive.”","Not that I’m Andy Kaufman or anything, but there was something about that dramatically different response where, to be honest, what it did for me was define what responsibility you have as an actor or storyteller. It’s not just to entertain. You can say big things. So, for me, I thought that book started a conversation that was very interesting, very necessary.","Back then, it was that idea of being honest, whether you’re male or female, and identifying yourself as something. And if you identified yourself as something, maybe you could defend it. Of course, those guys can’t defend it.","I remember it was one of the first things I showed Emily when we started dating. I was like, “I just directed this thing; I’m about to turn it in.” She was like, “I don’t know about this, dude. This is really intense stuff.” It was just one of those things. I directed it because it really changed my life in showing me what was possible.","It’s tricky. You have a bunch of men discussing women, but it’s ultimately meant to be framed from the perspective of this female graduate student, who is doing feminist research. You could call it “What Men Want.” Or “What Men Shouldn’t Want.”","What I was interested in, as someone who was brought up to own up to something you did wrong, was that there was something about those men that was highly defensive. It was so not me. And the ones who are really interesting to me are the guys who, halfway through their monologue, realized they were sounding really bad, so instead of saying, “Sorry, that’s probably not what I want,” they lash out at her. They started directing all their anger to her, and that seemed like such a horrible, flawed decision, and yet how pathetic those guys were that that’s the tack they took.","Moving on, you and Aaron Sorkin were once developing a miniseries about the Chateau Marmont, which sounds delicious. Whatever happened with that?","Wow, you’re doing a deep dive. I love it. It was one of those things where HBO put it in development for a long time. HBO is amazing, but they also sometimes lock things into development.","They’re famous for that.","Not to mention Aaron went on to do a lot of stuff. He was really busy, and I think at some point it took so long that [Chateau Marmont owner André Balazs] just took the rights back.","But I gotta say, very secretly, I have a deal with Paramount TV right now, and we just got the rights to the new Chateau book that the author of Paul Newman’s biography is writing. We’re waiting for that book to come out, I think in September.","Are you working with Sorkin again?","No, it’s going to be all on our own now. I’m so excited that you know about that because to me, there’s kind of no cooler thing. I don’t ever want to see somebody play a famous person — it’s all about the upstairs/downstairs. I want it to be like “Gosford Park.”","Exactly. That’s the perfect reference point. And very different from the movies you’ve directed. After “The Hollars” and “A Quiet Place,” and having two kids of your own, I’d have assumed you’re pretty fixated on stories about the family structure.","In one respect, it’s all I’m thinking about ― raising two little human beings that you hope are not only self-sufficient but also courageous in whatever they decide to do. This movie hit me three weeks after having our second daughter. That was big, because I was already wide open. To me, it’s not necessarily all I think about, but I’m very aware of the huge pool of talent of directors. I’d probably rather watch them do most movies that come my way, so in order for me to step up and do it, it’s got to be personal.","That said, you nailed the fact that, other than “Brief Interviews,” the movies I’ve done really are about family. When I did “The Hollars,” we had just had our first daughter, now that I think about it. So basically every time I have a kid, I’m going to do a movie [Laughs]. That’s what we’re getting at. Or every time I do a movie, we have to have a kid; otherwise the narrative doesn’t track. But it probably is where my mind is occupied sometimes.","But I’d be willing to do a political thriller, or something like that. It’s just got to be the right one. Like you said about genre — and this isn’t a fully fleshed-out hypothesis, so I might be wrong — there are things that have their moments, and there are things that, no matter how good they are, this isn’t the time to do it. And that’s really sad for me. My favorite movie of all time is “The Verdict.” I don’t think “The Verdict” gets made today. Dare I say, I don’t think “Argo” gets made today. So it is weird to see how quickly the business is deteriorating at that level of movies, because those are the movies I really like. I think they’re all going to come back, right? It’s got to be cyclical. But it’s one of those things where I could write a movie like “Sideways” and then people are like, “We’re not making that.” It’s more about what’s going to be a waste of time at this moment.","You mention “Sideways,” an Alexander Payne movie. No matter the landscape today, Alexander Payne can essentially make anything he wants. Having made a name for yourself outside of the directing world, do you see yourself inching toward that same privilege? Surely being “Jim from ‘The Office’” wasn’t a detractor in the marketing potential for “The Hollars.”","Right, and yet I don’t know if being Jim Halpert was necessarily helpful in this movie, because I don’t think they were like, “Oh, Jim Halpert, horror movie, let’s go.” But yeah, there’s definitely a level of success, or I should say a level of recognizability, from the studios where, yes, the fact that they know me and we’ve been in rooms together helps. But I also think it’s a hindrance because they label you — which is fine with me. I’m totally cool if, at the end of my career, the thing I’m most known for is Jim from “The Office.” Can’t get better than that.","To your point of whether I would be given the keys to make anything that’s in my head right now, my wife said something interesting just yesterday: “I wonder, if they gave you $250 million to make a movie, would it be the same level of passion? Would you be as connected to it? You’re someone who works so well under the gun, and maybe having the freedoms would be a very different experience.” And I think she’s right. For me, getting to do this again, period, would be awesome, but it’s also one of those things where I also think what you do next is really important. Not that you need to strategize, but I just do what I connect to because of “The Office.” With all due respect, financially that show put me in a place where I could wait and just do “The Hollars.” Some people can’t do that. I really appreciate the opportunity that show gave me in every single way.","That said, I gotta say there’s something really cool, in my opinion, with what Jordan Peele did. He developed stuff that he really cares about, that’s outside the box of what people thought would be next, like directing “Get Out 2” or the next Marvel movie. He said, “No, I’m going to go do these cool things I’ve wanted to do for a while.” That’s awesome. I just want to find something that I connect to like that.","Before we wrap up, since “A Quiet Place” is technically a monster movie, how many creature designs did you consider?","[“Lost” and “Cloverfield” writer Drew Goddard] told me after he’d read the script, “The one advice I’ll give you is start creating that guy now.” He goes, “You’re lucky if it’s the third or fourth one. It’ll most likely be the 12th.” I think it was our eighth, maybe. But the crazy thing is, we had a monster designed the entire shoot, and I changed it in post, in the middle of the edit.","Wow, so the actors were responding to a monster they thought looked entirely different?","Yep.","How different are the two?","They’re pretty different, but their properties and why they are the way they are are the exact same. The way they look is different. So, acting-wise, it didn’t change much because it was all about sound. I remember somebody telling me, “When you do a lot of visual-effects movies, you can see your creatures in the shot.” And truly six weeks into the edit, I was like, “This guy’s not going to look as good as the other guy.” I went back and we redesigned it.

Of the three, a condo co-owned by the wife of a prominent energy lobbyist is where he’s spent the most time, news outlets learned Thursday.","That alone is enough to warrant serious inquiry. Yet the story grew more mysterious (if only tangentially so) on Friday, when ABC revealed that Pruitt’s security detail had to break down the door of the condo last March, believing he was unresponsive and needed to be rescued.","Pruitt was found in a “groggy” state, sources told ABC, but details about the incident are otherwise sparse. The EPA had to pay for the damage to the condo’s glass-paneled doors, though it’s unclear how much it cost.","Here’s everything else you should know about Pruitt’s condo:","Who owns the condo?","The condo is co-owned by Vicki Hart, a health care lobbyist. Her husband, J. Steven Hart, is the CEO of Williams & Jensen, a prominent energy lobbying firm.","Among other clients, Williams & Jensen represents a company called Cheniere Energy Inc., a liquefied natural gas company that Pruitt just happened to name-drop during a trip to Morocco last December. (The four-day, $40,000 trip itself was already controversial, as Pruitt clearly doesn’t work for the Department of Energy, yet for some reason was there to promote trade in natural gas.)","In a statement to The Associated Press, Steven Hart described Pruitt as a casual friend.","How much did Pruitt pay to stay there?","Around $50 for every night he slept in the condo. Per Bloomberg, which reviewed records of Pruitt’s payments, the EPA head paid $6,100 to stay there for a period of six months, which adds up to a rate of just over $1,000 a month. This probably goes without saying, but that’s well below the going rate for a comparable one-bedroom condo located about a block from the U.S. Capitol.","For the sake of comparison, Pruitt recently moved to a luxury apartment complex in the same area, notes The Washington Post, where rents for a one-bedroom unit run from $3,100 to $4,500 a month.","Steven Hart defended the arrangement in a statement via his lobbying firm. “Pruitt signed a market based, short-term lease for a condo owned partially by my wife,” he said. “Pruitt paid all rent owed as agreed to in the lease. My wife does not, and has not ever lobbied the EPA on any matters.”","Is that the extent of Pruitt’s relationship with the energy industry?","Not by a long shot. Pruitt has extensive ties to the oil and gas industry stretching back to his time running for office in Oklahoma. In 2014, for instance, more than three dozen executives for the electricity company OGE Energy Corp. contributed thousands of dollars to his campaign for state attorney general, even though he was running unopposed.","Just to bring this full circle, OGE Energy Corp. paid Williams & Jensen (Steven Hart’s lobbying firm) $400,000 in 2017 to lobby the EPA on greenhouse gas emissions from its power plants, reports the AP.","Why is this a problem?","In a word: ethics. Government officials should avoid putting themselves in any situation that might seem untoward. At best, having the head of the EPA enter into an improbably favorable rental arrangement with the spouse of a major energy lobbying firm’s CEO is highly suspect. Norm Eisen, former White House special counsel for ethics and government reform, tweeted that the case “may have just crossed into criminal territory.”","“I don’t conclude that this is a prohibited gift at all,” Justina Fugh, the EPA’s senior ethics counsel, said in a statement on Friday, pushing back on talk of criminality. “It was a routine business transaction and permissible even if from a personal friend.”","Pruitt is already under investigation by the EPA’s inspector general for his extensive ― and extravagantly expensive ― travel arrangements. That’s in addition to a separate investigation into his spending on a pricey security detail. At a bare minimum, a third investigation wouldn’t help Pruitt’s case in any of them.","Anything else I should know about Pruitt?","In addition to his love of first-class air travel and the unprecedented size of his security detail, he’s had no qualms about spending taxpayer dollars elsewhere. He spent $43,000 on a soundproof phone booth last year, $2,075 to refinish a desk, and $2,963 for a “captain’s desk.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5abeb6c0200000d30ceb37ef.jpeg?ops=crop_924_628_2076_1371%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"WOMEN","headline":"President Who Bragged Of Groping Women Declares Sexual Assault Awareness Month","authors":"Carla Herreria","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-sexual-awareness-month_us_5abeaa0ae4b0a47437aaff29","short_description":"\"Offenders too often evade accountability,\" Trump said in his proclamation.","date":"2018-03-31"},"articleContent":["You’d think that a man whom several women have accused of sexual harassment or assault ― a man who openly bragged about sexually assaulting women ― would steer clear of any conversation about preventing such behavior.

He has yet to be charged and refuses to resign as president, despite lawsuits against him and his own comments about women.","In the wake of the powerful Women’s March and amid the momentum of the Me Too movement, any effort to address sexual assault prevention is crucial.","But while some of the most powerful men in the country have been knocked from their positions while facing accusations ― including disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein, TV host Matt Lauer and former Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) ― Trump has remained noticeably untouched.","Throughout his career as a real estate mogul and reality TV star, Trump has faced several sexual assault lawsuits.","Summer Zervos, a former contestant on “The Apprentice,” claims that Trump aggressively kissed her and placed his hand on her breast after she asked him about potential job opportunities in 2007. She filed a defamation lawsuit against Trump after he called her allegations a “hoax.”","In 1997, Jill Harth filed a lawsuit claiming that Trump had made unwanted advances toward her, harassed her and repeatedly groped her under a table during dinner. Harth eventually dropped the lawsuit but continues to stand by her story.","Many other women have come forward with their accusations against Trump, with incidents ranging from sexually explicit comments to nonconsensual kisses and groping.","Trump himself has even admitted to making sexual advances on women without their permission in a shocking audio recording from 2005.","“When you’re a star, they let you do it,” Trump told “Access Hollywood” host Billy Bush in the recording. “You can do anything.”","“Grab them by the pussy,” he added. “You can do anything.”\n\nAlthough Trump’s lawyers and the White House has denied all of the sexual harassment claims against the president, the administration declared in Friday’s proclamation that it is committed to “empowering victims to identify perpetrators so that they can be held accountable.”\n\n“We must respond to sexual assault by identifying and holding perpetrators accountable,” the statement read.\n\n“Too often, however, the victims of assault remain silent. They may fear retribution from their offender, lack faith in the justice system, or have difficulty confronting the pain associated with the traumatic experience.”","In December, a group of Trump’s accusers held a press conference to urge Congress to investigate their claims.","The women shared their accounts of Trump’s actions and explained how it felt to watch a man who had allegedly violated them be elected president after they came forward with their claims.","“It was heartbreaking last year when we all — we’re private citizens — for us to put ourselves out there to try to show America who this man is and especially how he views women and for them to say, ‘Meh, we don’t care,’” one of the accusers, Samantha Holvey, said. “It hurt.”","After Trump’s National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month proclamation was announced Friday, people turned to their Twitter feeds to point out the obvious."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5abeee911e000008087b0393.jpeg?cache=GXfwagh0IY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"EXCLUSIVE: These Are The Transgender Students Whom The Education Department Abandoned","authors":"Rebecca Klein","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/transgender-bathrooms_us_5abe4f28e4b0f112dc9bbe8d","short_description":"These transgender students hoped the Department of Education would help them. Instead, they were rejected.","date":"2018-03-31"},"articleContent":["At least three school districts around the country are continuing to enforce potentially hostile restroom policies for transgender students after the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights refused to investigate student complaints, HuffPost has learned.","One of those students, 18-year-old Preston Curts, a transgender male senior at a high school in Florida, originally filed a discrimination claim back in 2016, under the Obama administration. He filed a complaint with the U.S. Education Department challenging Marion County Schools’ rule that banned transgender students from using the bathroom that aligned with their gender identity. He hoped things would change, at least before he graduated.","In December, Curts’ complaint was abruptly dismissed by the Trump administration, quashing any possibility that he will get to spend his last few months of school in an environment where he’s allowed to be himself.","In January, HuffPost broke the news that the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights was refusing to investigate these types of complaints. A month later, the Trump administration publicly discussed the protocol shift.","HuffPost has learned exclusive details about the students who are being left behind in the wake of this policy change.","There are at least four bathroom-related cases throughout the country, including Curts’, that have been dismissed by the Trump administration amid this policy change. In response to these claims ― which deal with school districts in Hawaii, Michigan, Texas and Florida ― the Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) specifically told the complainant that the agency was no longer obligated to investigate instances of bathroom discrimination involving transgender students. The Trump administration contends that the federal education law dealing with sex discrimination does not cover gender identity.","In at least three of these districts, there continues to be either an explicit policy banning transgender students from specific facilities or a vague procedure that doesn’t necessarily give transgender students’ access to the restroom that aligns with their gender identity.","Now that the Trump administration has abandoned this issue, some students are stuck in hostile schools with little hope for change.","“It’s almost like effort going to nothing,” Curts told HuffPost of his previous legal action.","Curts’ complaint ― which was filed on his behalf by the Florida branch of the ACLU ― was submitted in May 2016, in the same week that the Obama administration released guidance calling on schools to give students access to facilities based on their gender identity. For Curts, who is being identified publicly for the first time, it seemed like progress was on the horizon.","Then, a few months later, Trump happened.","Curts had already been using male restrooms in school since he was 13, before a local parent found out about it in 2016 and pushed the school administration to take action. The issue turned into an acrimonious public debate. Curts would slip into Marion County School Board meetings and listen to the adults in the room discuss his private restroom habits, speculating how violating it would be for students to potentially face him in such an intimate space. Curts “passed” for male, and many didn’t know at the time that the so-called threat they were discussing was sitting among them.","The whole scenario was almost funny, in an excruciating sort of way, Curts recalled. “This huge thing unraveled before me,” Curts said, of the school board’s decision to adopt an anti-transgender resolution on the issue.","Curts made his best attempts to ignore the opposition. He continued using the male restrooms, even with the new Marion County resolution. But doing this led to multiple suspensions. His sophomore year, he was suspended twice, the second time for three days. His junior year, he faced another three-day suspension. After watching his grades suffer, he knew he had to figure something else out.","“They basically put you in a position where they force you to give up,” he said.","Curts eventually worked out a deal with his high school administration allowing him to use the men’s faculty restroom. Teachers will still reprimand him for being a kid in the teacher’s room if they haven’t been made aware of his situation. It’s not ideal, but for now, it seems like the best option to “survive at school.”","Public Relations officer for Marion County schools Kevin Christian confirmed that school board policy says students must use the restroom that corresponds with the sex on their birth certificate, but that alternative arrangements can be made with school principals. When asked about Curts’ suspensions, Christian said that while he would not discuss disciplinary action taken against any students, “there are consequences to breaking the rules.”","HuffPost also reached out to members of the Marion County School Board for clarification on the reasoning behind the rule. Only one member responded over email.","“I have no interest in remounting an old retired horse. I have students who can’t read in this district and which bathroom they use has zero to do with their test scores,” wrote school board member Nancy Stacy.","At the time the resolution was passed, arguments in favor of it centered around student safety and student privacy.","HuffPost reached out to the other school districts that previously had complaints filed against them on this issue, to learn more about their current policies.","In Texas, athletic director of Prosper Independent School District Valerie Little told HuffPost that while all the district’s students currently use the facilities consistent with their birth sex, the district would “possibly” allow a student to work out an alternative arrangement after meeting with the child and figuring out a plan “for what is best for all students.”","In Michigan, a representative for Bedford Public Schools told HuffPost that the complaint against them had been voluntarily rescinded by parents involved, although information obtained by HuffPost contradicts this claim. The representative, communications specialist Sandy Kraine, told HuffPost over email that Bedford students “can use the traditional single sex restrooms that correspond with their biological gender or any of the gender neutral locations in the building.”","The principal of the last school, Wilfred Murakami of Kealakehe High School in Hawaii, said that since the initial complaint was filed, the school has changed its policies and has “been able to resolve without conflict the requests of students who identify as transgender.” A representative of the Hawaii Department of Education also pointed to district guidelines calling on schools to give students access to facilities consistent with their gender identities.","HuffPost also reached out to a district in Tennessee, where the ACLU previously filed a bathroom-related complaint on behalf of a student. Months into the Trump administration, the ACLU voluntarily withdrew this complaint amid suspicions that it would not be treated fairly. The district did not get back to HuffPost with details of their current policy.","HuffPost has also learned of at least one other complaint on this issue in Florida that is still open.","The Obama administration interpreted Title IX ― the federal education law dealing with sex discrimination ― to include discrimination based on gender identity. The Trump administration, on the other hand, says the law does not extend this far, although two influential federal appeals courts have disputed this. Just a few months into the Trump presidency, the U.S. Department of Education and U.S. Department of Justice rescinded the Obama-era guidance on this issue. For almost a year, though, it was unclear how the administration would deal with specific instances of alleged discrimination.","In February, Education Department spokesperson Liz Hill told BuzzFeed that “in the case of bathrooms, however, long-standing regulations provide that separating facilities on the basis of sex is not a form of discrimination prohibited by Title IX.”","When questioned at a House Appropriations subcommittee hearing earlier this month about this narrower view of Title IX, department Secretary Betsy DeVos responded, “This department is not going to make law; we are going to continue to enforce laws.”","Advocates vehemently disagree with this interpretation of the law, and say that the Education Department is failing to protect an already vulnerable student population. Denying students access to the correct bathrooms can negatively impact their grades and make them feel unsafe at school, says Laura Wernick, a Fordham professor who has studied the issue.","“The literature is really clear that when gender non-conforming and trans youth don’t feel safe using restrooms, it has a huge effect not only on them physically but also on their whole sense of self on issues of depression and well-being,” Wernick told HuffPost.","In Curts’ case, the complaint he filed was not just about him. He’s not the only trans student in his high school, and not the only student having this issue.","A younger student at the same Marion County school, who is using the pseudonym of Jake to protect his identity, is facing similar issues. Jake’s entire day is colored by gender-related obstacles.","On the school bus, boys and girls are made to sit separately by gender, a policy which had obvious complications for Jake. Jake started getting bullied, and as result, is now driven to school by family.","Jake also participates in his school’s JROTC for physical education credit. To avoid having to change in a locker room, he shows up to school in his gym clothing. After class, he walks across campus to change in the nurse’s office. Having to change separately from other students also outs Jakes to peers who wouldn’t otherwise know he is transgender.","Jake normally uses the nurse’s office bathroom, single-stall bathrooms attached to a few classrooms or faculty restrooms. But once, when he was in a rush, he used a regular male restroom. He thought no one was around to see him enter it. He was wrong, and ended up with a detention.","Now Jake is doing his best to stay out of trouble. He says he “loves” the academic part of school and he hopes to eventually attend medical school. He once considered joining the military after high school, but has decided against it. He says that while he “loves America,” he doesn’t “suspect he would thrive in the military” and he is more passionate about medicine. Indeed, President Trump recently announced limits on allowing transgender people to serve in the military.","Like Curts, Jake isn’t optimistic that anything will change at Marion. He’s just doing his best to make it through.","“You have a handful of people who care about you, and a pot full of people who could care less what happened to you,” Jake said."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab845c01e00003b137afb25.jpeg?cache=IJcdZORRYQ&ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Foe Of Endangered Species Act Lands Gig Overseeing — You Guessed It — Wildlife","authors":"Chris D'Angelo","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/susan-combs-fish-wildlife-parks-appointment_us_5abea206e4b0f112dc9c47dc","short_description":"It's like “appointing an arsonist as the town fire marshal,\" said one conservationist.","date":"2018-03-31"},"articleContent":["WASHINGTON — Former Texas Comptroller Susan Combs, who has a long history of sparring with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service over species listings, has been appointed to a key Trump administration post overseeing policy for the wildlife agency and national parks.","The Austin American-Statesman first reported the news on Thursday. Combs, also a former state representative and Texas’s first female agriculture commissioner, once likened proposed Endangered Species Act listings to “incoming Scud missiles” headed for her state’s oil and gas-rich economy.","President Donald Trump tapped Combs in July to serve as his assistant secretary of the Interior Department’s Office of Policy, Management and Budget, where she would have influence over the agency’s decisions on finance, policy, management and environmental affairs. But her nomination has remained stalled in the Senate.","Perhaps frustrated with the delay, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has reportedly named Combs to temporarily serve as acting assistant secretary for fish, wildlife and parks. In that role she will guide policy decisions at both the Fish and Wildlife Service, one of two federal agencies that administer the Endangered Species Act, and the National Park Service.","Signed in 1973, the ESA is among America’s bedrock conservation laws, intended to safeguard threatened species and the habitats critical to their survival.","The Interior Department did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment Saturday.","However, Interior spokeswoman Heather Swift told E&E News on Friday that “Combs is highly qualified, and we are more than confident that she will be an effective manager at Fish and Wildlife and Parks while she patiently awaits her Senate confirmation.”","As a member of the Texas House of Representatives in the 1990s, Combs championed legislation prohibits state wildlife officials from gathering endangered species data from private lands without permission, according to the Austin Chronicle. It also sought to restrict the state from sharing endangered species data with the Fish and Wildlife Service.","In 2011, as Texas comptroller, she fought against the federal government’s proposal to list the dune sagebrush lizard, a species found in West Texas and southeastern New Mexico. She ultimately proved successful in protecting Texas landowners, namely fossil fuel interests, negotiating a voluntary conservation plan that ultimately kept the species off the endangered species list.","After retiring from public office in 2015, Combs led three groups in petitioning to have federal protections removed for the golden-cheeked warbler, an endangered songbird native to central Texas. She argued that studies show the agency was “wrong in its original conclusion that the warbler species is rare” and that the songbird should not have been listed as endangered in 1990. The Fish and Wildlife Service ultimately rejected Combs’ petition.","Following her nomination in July, some 70 conservation groups sent a letter to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee urging members to reject her confirmation.

Luka Ladan, a spokesman for the Center for Union Facts, called it a sign that “union officials have realized it’s a fight they cannot win.”","But SEIU says those cuts were offset by new investments elsewhere in the campaign not reflected in government filings. The union has wound down its city committees and created a national fast-food local union that it says it poured $1.5 million into last year. It also moved organizers who were employed through the committees onto union staff, and increased its spending on fast-food campaigns in Europe and Brazil.","“The idea that we’re cutting funding for the Fight for $15 isn’t true ― we’ve just shifted gears,” a union spokesperson said. “We’ve brought a lot of stuff in-house, and that doesn’t show up in the [disclosure forms]. We’re not taking our foot off the gas on McDonald’s.”","SEIU implemented steep budget cuts in the wake of President Donald Trump’s 2016 election win, which signaled an inhospitable regulatory atmosphere for unions. Close watchers of the Fight for $15 suspected the high-profile campaign could be subjected to belt-tightening as labor law became less friendly to organized labor than it was under former President Barack Obama.","By organizing walkouts and protests by fast-food workers, the Fight for $15 raised worker pay by spurring minimum-wage hikes in cities and states around the country, and made a $15 wage floor a plank of the Democratic Party. In some regards, it has been the most successful labor organizing campaign in years, bringing unprecedented public attention to the plight of low-wage workers.","But for all its successes, the movement in fast food has not translated into more union members for SEIU, raising the question of how long the union could continue to robustly fund it.","“While the SEIU’s Fight for $15 has scored some legislative victories, it has failed to secure new dues-paying members in quick-service restaurants,” Ladan said.","Rather than file for small union elections at individual restaurants, most of which are run by franchisees, SEIU had hoped regulatory changes would compel big companies like McDonald’s to come to the bargaining table with workers. But Trump’s influence on labor policy has made that increasingly unlikely, with his nominees to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) making it more difficult for workers to unionize.","The organizing of fast-food workers created a public relations nightmare for McDonald’s and other big chains, which were pilloried for their low pay. Many workers claimed they were illegally fired or punished for taking part in strikes aimed at improving their working conditions.","The general counsel for the NLRB eventually put McDonald’s on trial, accusing it of being a “joint employer” alongside its franchisees. A finding against McDonald’s could potentially put it on the hook for labor law violations inside its franchised stores.","But McDonald’s has much less to worry about under the Trump administration. New leadership at the NLRB has already reversed the Obama-era definition of joint employer, bringing applause from business groups. As Bloomberg reported, the board is apparently moving quickly to settle the McDonald’s case to avoid a union-friendly precedent.","This post has been updated with comment from SEIU, and the headline has been changed to reflect the source of the claim that SEIU reduced its funding."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5abfeb211e00008e0b7b041e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Jimmy Carter Zings Donald Trump: Apparently, America Wants A Jerk For President","authors":"Lee Moran","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jimmy-carter-donald-trump-stephen-colbert_us_5abf34a6e4b055e50acdcc2d","short_description":"\"I never knew it before.\"","date":"2018-03-31"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"BUSINESS","headline":"International Health Group Drops Partnership With Heineken Over 'Beer Girls'","authors":"Mary Papenfuss","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/global-fund-heineken-beer-girls_us_5abed42de4b055e50acdb239","short_description":"Heineken needs to \"take appropriate action,\" said the group's director.","date":"2018-03-31"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"BLACK VOICES","headline":"The Trump White House's Intern Program Is Once Again Very, Very White","authors":"Lee Moran","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/white-house-donald-trump-interns-white_us_5abf6b02e4b0f112dc9c8867","short_description":"\"The White House intern photo is like a 'Where’s Waldo' for a non-white person.\"","date":"2018-03-31"},"articleContent":["The White House is yet again facing fierce criticism over the lack of diversity of the participants in its intern program.","A photograph released Friday shows President Donald Trump posing with the spring intake, who are overwhelmingly white:","“The White House intern photo is like a Where’s Waldo for a non-white person — in a country that is about 40% non-white,” tweeted political scientist and Washington Post columnist Brian Klaas.","“Diversity this ain’t,” added France 24 correspondent Philip Crowther.","Other tweeters shared similarly biting comments:","Other commenters compared the current intake to those from former President Barack Obama’s time in office:","Trump’s White House faced similar accusations over the program last summer when people noticed how photographs of Vice President Mike Pence posing with interns featured very few people of color.","House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) came under fire in July 2016 over this selfie with Capitol Hill interns, who were also almost exclusively white:"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5abf6bee200000d30ceb3851.jpeg?cache=E4GYMkozpm&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"6 Months After The Vegas Shooting, We Still Don’t Know What Motivated The Killer","authors":"Matt Ferner","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/las-vegas-mass-shooting-investigation-motivation_us_5abd7a8be4b0a47437a9bdc5","short_description":"An arsenal of firearms. More than 1,100 rounds. Fifty-eight dead and more than 800 wounded. Why?","date":"2018-03-31"},"articleContent":["On a warm Sunday night exactly six months ago, Stephen Paddock barricaded himself in the Mandalay Bay hotel, assembled a makeshift video surveillance system, smashed two windows of his suite on the 32nd floor, loaded his rifles and opened fire on 22,000 concertgoers who had assembled on the Las Vegas Strip below. It is the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history, but what inspired it?","Paddock, a 64-year-old gambler, retired accountant and real estate investor, fired more than 1,100 rounds rounds into the crowd at the Route 91 Harvest music festival, killing 58 people and injuring more than 800 others in just 10 minutes. About an hour after he fired his last shot, police found Paddock in his suite, dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. He didn’t leave a suicide note.","The investigation into the shooting began just hours after the massacre. In the months that followed, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department and the FBI reviewed more than 21,000 hours of video and 200,000 images, and conducted interviews with at least 43 people. “Every facet of Paddock’s life was explored,” investigators said in a January preliminary report, the only one to have been released on their findings so far.","Agents determined that Paddock had meticulously planned the shooting spree. He amassed an arsenal of firearms and thousands of rounds of ammunition. He searched the web for “summer concerts 2017” and “biggest open air concert venues in USA.” They searched for clues about what may have motivated him to kill that night: Was it a longstanding gambling habit? A relationship with his girlfriend that was growing increasingly estranged? An act of terrorism inspired by the Islamic State? A sudden change in his behavior?","A Self-Funded Gambling Habit And A Puzzling Claim","FBI investigators tend to look at a crime from four key perspectives to try to determine a criminal’s motives, explained Andrew Bringuel, a former member of the FBI’s behavioral analysis unit who is not involved in the Paddock investigation. When assailants have political or social motives, they often want their viewpoints known to the world. They may leave a manifesto or a statement outlining their reasoning or beliefs. When personal or economic motives are at play, the trail of evidence may be less overt, but investigators can find clues in financial statements or family histories. Criminals can also be driven by several motives at the same time.","Paddock did not leave a political statement or manifesto ― not at the scene, not in his home, not amid his personal belongings. But mere hours after the attack, the self-described Islamic State claimed responsibility for the shooting in a statement on Amaq, its propaganda news agency. The claim has puzzled the investigators and extremism experts alike.","Investigators found no evidence that Paddock had been in contact with other individuals or groups about the attack. They found no proof that he had become radicalized, supported or followed terrorist organizations, or even adhered to a particular ideology. Nothing indicates that Paddock ever converted to Islam, and ISIS has never released any proof of its involvement.","“None of the indicators in other ISIS cases in the U.S. apply to this guy as far as we know,” said Amarnath Amarasingam, a senior research fellow at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue who closely followed the group’s actions related to the attack.","But ISIS maintains up until this day that the shooting was carried out by one of its own. And the group has historically been reliable when it comes to claiming attacks because its credibility depends on these claims, explained Rita Katz of the SITE Intelligence Group.","“So, was ISIS’ situation so dire that it decided to capitalize on a major external event ― one that reaped massive casualties ― it didn’t actually commit? Very possible,” Katz continued. “If so, did the group just get lucky enough to claim an attack that would leave investigators notably unable to find his actual motive? Again, possible, but it seems a lot less likely.”","Paddock’s finances also raised questions. Paddock had a well-documented gambling habit. He played at numerous casinos, gambled tens of thousands of dollars at a time and was often given complimentary rooms and meals at the casinos because of the large amounts of money he spent. But investigators determined that Paddock funded his gambling habit through winnings and past real estate transactions. He was indebted to no one and had paid off all gambling debts prior to the shooting.","But Paddock had lost a “significant amount of wealth” since 2015, according to Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo, and had suffered “bouts of depression” because of the loss.","Paddock’s Brain","Absent political, social and economic clues clearly pointing at a motive, attention naturally focused on Paddock’s state of mind. Paddock’s brother, Eric, shocked and dumbfounded by his brother’s sudden and extreme violence, speculated in the days after the shooting that perhaps his brother had developed some kind of brain disease that drove him to violence.","The relationship between mental health and violence is a complex one. Just as most people in the world are not violent, most people with some form of mental illness too are not violent. In fact, generally, mental illness puts you at greater risk of being a victim of violence than a perpetrator.","Distinct from mental illness, disease or damage to certain regions of the brain can alter a person’s ability to regulate aggression, decision making and impulse ― all factors that can contribute to committing an act of violence.","There were some signs that Paddock may have been struggling leading up to the attack. Paddock had told friends and family numerous times that he “felt ill, in pain or fatigued,” according to the preliminary report. Marilou Danley, Paddock’s girlfriend, told authorities that he’d been acting strangely in the weeks before the murders. Paddock had become “distant” in the year before the shooting, she claimed, and their relationship was “no longer intimate.”","Investigators turned to Paddock’s physician. The doctor described Paddock as “odd” and as a man who showed “little emotion.” He believed that Paddock may have had bipolar disorder but told police that his patient had refused to discuss the issue further. Paddock didn’t appear to be abusing any medications, the doctor noted. In fact, he seemed fearful of medication in general. While he had been treated for anxiety, Paddock had refused antidepressant medication.","In December, Dr. Hannes Vogel, a neuropathologist at Stanford University, performed an autopsy of Paddock’s brain. While the brain was not in pristine condition ― it had been damaged by the gunshot wound and had been dissected before ― Vogel was still able to learn a lot.","Vogel found evidence of common age-related changes, including atheroscleorosis, a narrowing of the arteries that can reduce blood flow and result in vessel damage in the brain, but he doesn’t think those changes might help explain the shooting.","He did discover an “eye-catching” dense presence of corpora amylacea ― an abnormal structure on the surface of the brain found with greater density in people who suffer from disorders like Alzheimer’s and epilepsy or who have suffered a stroke. However, the structures can also appear normally as the brain ages.","The location of the structures is intriguing, Vogel said. They had formed on various areas, including the base, the frontal lobes (involved in behavior and personality), as well as the hippocampus (involved in learning, memory and emotion).","But while Paddock’s brain showed a striking frequency of the structures, Vogel didn’t find any traces of the diseases that are linked to them. “In terms of an actual disease association with these corpora amylacea, it was zip,” Vogel said.","The results of Vogel’s autopsy has captured the interest of several researchers who study the brain in various fields of science. While some of them believe there's no relationship between the structures and Paddock's violence, others have argued that they could have played a role.","“Not claiming that I know more about the perpetrator’s motives... [but] the potential causal connection between Mr. Paddock’s abnormal medial temporal lobe lesion and his outrageously abnormal aggressive behavior is the only promising explanation to date,” said Dr. Jeff Victoroff, a professor of neurology and psychiatry at the University of Southern California who is an expert on trauma, human aggression and terrorism.","“[A]ny type of brain pathology near the hippocampus or amygdala and surrounding structures can contribute to violent behavior,” echoed Dr. Bernhard Bogerts, a professor of psychiatry and psychotherapy at the University of Magdeburg in Germany whose research involves brain alterations and their connection to violence. “It is unimportant whether this is an infection, a tumor, vascular damage, neuronal degeneration, hypoplasia, or, as in this case, unusually high concentrations of corpora amylacea indicating that there was something wrong.”","Bogerts noted, though, that in most cases of violent behavior, abnormal brain anatomy is only one component of multiple causes, including genetics, early childhood trauma and current social stress.","“Anyone is free to speculate ― but I can assure you, from the neuropathologic standpoint, I went the absolute distance,” Vogel said in response to the interest in the structures and the questions surrounding them. “There’s nothing else that I could have done as a pathologist to reveal a cause for his aggression.”","Vogel also quoted a portion of “Histology for Pathologists,” a textbook: “In some individuals, corpora amylacea are strikingly numerous although no pathological significance has yet been attributed to this abundance.”","“So you can read that a couple of different ways,” Vogel explained, “but it certainly doesn’t deny the possibility that some unknown pathological process is there, but thus far, we don’t know what it means.”","“He Had A Reason.”","Determining the motive behind a traumatic event can help bring a sense of closure for survivors, relatives and the public. It can inform public policy around the incident in order to try to prevent future attacks. It can also satisfy a natural human curiosity to simply want to know why a person committed a horrific act.","“There exists a powerful and valuable urge, in human social groups, to understand potentially dangerous behaviors of others,” said Victoroff.","“I have found that people feel more comfortable when they know why something happens. In terms of terrible events, an identified cause can make people feel as though there is an isolated explanation for the problem, and it is unlikely to occur for a random reason,” said Dr. Franklin Brown, assistant professor of neurology and chief of the neuropsychology division at the Yale School of Medicine. “It gives people a sense of control.”","The investigation into the Las Vegas mass shooting continues, and Paddock’s victims and their families are still waiting for that answer.","According to Bringuel, the former FBI behavioral analyst, there is still hope it may one day become clear.","“Just because we don’t know the motive doesn’t mean there’s a lack of one. Stephen Paddock knew why he was doing what he was doing,” Bringuel said. “I would go out on a professional limb and say you cannot commit the act that Stephen Paddock committed without having a reason to do it. He had a reason.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5abe67461f0000270616bf2d.jpeg?cache=Vjv9oXT6BS&ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"WORLD NEWS","headline":"6.9 Magnitude Earthquake Strikes Near Papua New Guinea","authors":"Carla Herreria","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/papua-new-guinea-earthquake_us_5abd742fe4b0f112dc9b064d","short_description":"The country is still recovering from a pair of earlier earthquakes that killed at least 85 people.","date":"2018-03-30"},"articleContent":["A strong earthquake struck off the southern coast of Papua New Guinea’s New Britain Island on Thursday, initially prompting tsunami warnings in the area.","The earthquake had a magnitude of 6.9, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.","The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center initially issued a tsunami warning for the coasts of Papua New Guinea, though the threat had passed without incident nearly two hours later.","It is unclear if the earthquake caused any damage to the island.","Papua New Guinea, north of Australia, is still recovering from a pair of deadly earthquakes that hit the country in recent weeks.","A magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit the country’s highland region on Feb. 26, triggering powerful aftershocks, according to CNN.

At least.”","Jorgensen, who teaches 7th- and 8th-grade math, leads her students in ditties, chants and dance moves to help them remember basic formulas in algebra and geometry. A lesson on monomial exponent rules becomes:","“You thought we were done","Having fun,","But if your exponent is zero,","Your base simplifies to one.”","Jorgensen said that weaving music into math lessons has boosted her students’ test scores, enhanced their understanding of the larger concepts, improved the classroom climate and accomplished something few would think possible of middle-school math: Made it fun.","Many studies, including one in the journal Memory and Cognition, have shown that information set to music is easier to remember. It’s how epics like “The Iliad” and “The Odyssey” were passed down through the centuries, and how toddlers learn their ABCs and 123s. People with Alzheimer’s disease might not be able to remember their spouse, but can often recite songs from their youth.","A 2009 study by a UC Davis psychology researcher, published in the journal Cerebral Cortex, found that the region of the brain that stores memories is the same region that processes music and emotion. In short, music, memory and emotion are closely linked.","“Song and dance serve well to help us remember lyrics, or in this case math formulas,” said Patricia Swanson, a math education professor at San Jose State University. “And, indeed, there are strong conceptual connections between math and music. Perhaps the most obvious one at the elementary level is rhythm and the value of the musical note — 4/4 time, quarter notes, eighth notes, sixteenth notes … ”","Jorgensen observes this daily in her classes at Martin Luther King Jr. Middle School, where 75 percent of the students come from low-income families and 72 percent speak English as a second language.","On and off throughout their lessons, students sing math formulas and do math-related dance moves. Some of the songs are pop tunes in which Jorgensen swapped out “lyrics about Bacardi and ice” and replaced them with lines about “n” factors and variables.","Others are songs that she and students make up. With an associate’s degree in musical theater, Jorgensen has a natural affinity for singing and dancing and knows firsthand how they can aid in memorization and elevate one’s spirits.","Such musical activities lead students to enjoy math, which in turn leads them to learn more, Jorgensen said. And during tests, remembering math songs helps them relax and feel good, so they’re less likely to panic, she said.","Seventh-grader Mia Espiritu, one of Jorgensen’s students, said she never enjoyed math until this year. She and most of her classmates in fourth period had scored below grade level on previous standardized tests, but Mia said she’s finally understanding the concepts.","“Ms. J.J. teaches us new things every day, so it’s not boring,” she said. “And if I get stuck, I always have a song in my mind that helps me remember. I used to not get math. Now I do get it.”","Her classmate Guadalupe Gonzalez agreed. Math was always a struggle, but now she enjoys it.","“The songs help explain it better,” she said.","Memorizing basic formulas can make it easier for students to grasp larger, more abstract mathematical concepts because students’ minds aren’t mired in the minutiae, Jorgensen said. For example, it’s easier to understand the square root of 36 if you already know the answer to 6 multiplied by 6.","Jorgensen’s method has yielded results. In her 8th-grade geometry class from last year, 23 of her 40 students had perfect scores on the Smarter Balanced exam, and in the 7th-grade algebra class, every student exceeded the standards, she said. Seven of those students had perfect scores.","“It makes me excited about the students’ futures,” she said. “It opens doors for them and shows what they can achieve if they put in the effort.”","Mark Ellis, a math education professor at California State University, Fullerton, said he observed elementary teachers in Japan using songs and chants to successfully teach math to their students and he has used music to help low-performing middle-school students learn their multiplication tables.","Music in a classroom can relax students, take some pressure off and help teachers forge a cultural connection to their students, he said. He cited a 2014 article in the journal Educational Studies in Mathematics about teachers who were highly successful using songs, chants and music to motivate students in underserved communities.","But it’s not the end of the story, he said.","“Music itself cannot teach kids to understand mathematics,” he said. “Music can help students improve dramatically, but ultimately math is not about memorization. It’s about reasoning, seeing patterns, making conjectures. It’s about meaning.”","Memorizing formulas will only be effective in the long run if students understand the concepts underlying the formulas, he said. Ideally, students should be able to come up with formulas on their own, with guidance from the teacher. In some cases, it’s not even necessary to memorize formulas because so many students have calculators on their phones, he said.","But either way, students with self-confidence and a solid math education in middle school are well positioned to thrive in the more challenging and abstract math classes they’ll encounter in high school and college, he said. Middle school math is the critical juncture where students transition from arithmetic to more complex concepts about proportions, ratios and multiplication, which are the basis of advanced level math courses.","Eighth-grader Jennifer Silva, a student of Jorgensen’s who also helps her teach younger students, said she’s enjoyed math so much she wants to pursue it in college.","“Doing the chants helps me remember what we learned,” she said. “When you’re in a test and you feel stressed, you just think of a chant and it’s like, ‘Oh yeah, I remember that.’ And then it’s kind of fun.”","This story originally appeared on EdSource.org"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5abe871a2000003500eb37c1.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"WORLD NEWS","headline":"Israeli Forces Kill At Least 16 Palestinian Protesters Along Gaza Border: Officials","authors":"Nidal al-Mughrabi, Reuters","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/israeli-forces-kill-palestinian-protesters-gaza_us_5abe629ce4b0a47437aa939c","short_description":"Gaza officials said at least 400 people were wounded by gunfire, while others were struck by rubber bullets or tear gas.","date":"2018-03-30"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Friday's Morning Email: Leaked Facebook Memo Defends The Company's Growth...At Any Cost","authors":"Ariel Edwards-Levy","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fridays-morning-email-leaked-facebook-memo-defends-the-companys-growthat-any-cost_us_5abe195ee4b055e50acceac2","short_description":"\"We connect people.

It’s so painful. What could cause that pain?”","I examined her tender foot and launched into my well-practiced explanation of the problem: plantar fascitis, an inflammation of the tissues connecting the heel and toes, which is very common and in some cases very painful. I swiveled back from the computer with a handout and was stunned to see Linda weeping in relief. “I just, I really thought it was a tumor in my bone,” she sighed, and folded the tissue I offered into a tiny square.","I am accustomed to seeing patients for routine complaints like this. So it is easy for me to forget how scary it is to wonder about mysterious symptoms and imagine the worst.","This is why I’m so concerned when I hear about additional restrictions placed on Medicaid coverage. Access to health care provides us dignity in our vulnerable moments when we are well and sustains us in the rare circumstances when the worst we imagine comes true. And the worst can happen to any of us. I have seen how quickly disease or injury can punish the body, and how completely an addiction can take hold and alter the course of a life. And I have seen how patients like Linda struggle not only to make ends meet, but to get the medical care they need.","Work requirements threaten medical safety net","Most of my patients, including Linda, are on Medicaid. Medicaid is health insurance provided by the government for the most vulnerable among us – the poor, disabled, and elderly. The coverage is not generous, but it is comprehensive. It provides a safety net. Across the country, policymakers are fraying that safety net by imposing work requirementson Medicaid beneficiaries for the first time. Many of these individuals only recently gained health insurance through the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion. I fear these policy changes will deny the dignity of access to health care to millions of poor adults.","Linda does work, like the majority of able-bodied adults on Medicaid, and she developed the pain in her heel after many long days on her feet. Her employer does not offer health insurance, so she relies instead on Medicaid. Almost 1 in 5 able-bodied adult Medicaid beneficiaries are unable to work outside the home because they are primary caregivers for family members or are attending school. A small portion of the remaining able-bodied Medicaid beneficiaries do not work - and in the majority of cases research shows that they simply cannot find a job.","Precisely how officials will distinguish between these groups – those deemed “deserving” of health care and those deemed “undeserving” – is not clear. Medicaid experts fear that the vague guidance provided by The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will result in vulnerable Americans such as those living in economically depressed communities, those suffering from substance use disorders, and those remaining at home to care for young children or aging parents being deprived of Medicaid coverage because of burdensome documentation requirements and bureaucratic hurdles.","Kentucky, one of the first states to apply for permission from the federal government to erect such barriers to Medicaid, is projecting that construction of the bureaucratic apparatus necessary to process and enforce work requirements will cost US$187 million. Kentucky officials also calculate that the program changes would ultimately lead to savings of $2.4 billion over the ensuing five years, due to individuals dropping off of the Medicaid rolls because they cannot keep up with newly required documentation or simply no longer qualifying for the program.","Legal scholars question whether policies that so nakedly aim to reduce access to benefits are even legal, given that the Medicaid Act calls for all eligible beneficiaries be offered necessary “medical assistance.”","It is clear to me that the primary goal of these work requirements is to further unravel the safety net for the poor and drive eligible individuals off of Medicaid, regardless of the effect on their welfare. The work requirement policies offer no job training to facilitate unemployed individuals a reasonable path to work; and no other state aside from Massachusetts have enacted policies requiring private companies to offer health insurance to their lower income employees, who like Linda, rely on Medicaid. More than anything, for me, it is a return to the pointless and repugnant distinction we Americans continually parse: distinguishing between the deserving and the undeserving poor.","Why Medicaid is crucial","For readers who have private insurance and a steady job, ready access to Medicaid for able-bodied adults may not seem important. But I argue that it is crucial for us all. We are all deserving of health care. Access to Medicaid is crucial for anyone with aging or infirm parents who may decide to stay home and care for them at the end of their lives. Medicaid is crucial for anyone with a friend or loved one swept up in the wave of opiate addiction, which has engulfed more than two million Americans in the last year. Medicaid is crucial for anyone suddenly without income, without savings and in crisis.","As Linda put her shoe back on and tucked her purse up on her shoulder, she sighed: “I am so glad I came in. I was so worried, because, you never know.”","Linda is right: One doesn’t know. We are all one job loss or one devastating accident away from needing a safety net. What if the worst you can imagine came true for you? What if you were in free fall, ravaged by addiction, broken beyond recognition in an accident, or devastated by a ferocious illness? Wouldn’t you hope that a safety net were hanging there in the depths, ready to catch you? Without Medicaid, there may not be. You may fall through those frayed strings and into the void.","Dr. Audrey M Provenzano is an internist at Mass General Hospital, Chelsea Healthcare center and an Instructor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School.","This article was originally published on The Conversation.

What do you call a woman who sleeps with a man for $10 million? Maybe I’m being crude, but she’s called a prostitute.”","More than 80 women, including actresses Ashley Judd, Rose McGowan and Cara Delevingne, have accused Weinstein of sexual harassment, assault or rape. In the wake of the Weinstein accusations and the subsequent Me Too movement, dozens of high-profile men have faced sexual harassment and assault accusations.","Peskov made his remarks about Weinstein in response to a question about recent accusations of sexual harassment against Leonid Slutsky, a senior member of the Russian parliament. Five Russian journalists have accused Slutsky of sexual harassment and assault, including groping and kissing them without their consent.","“If Slutsky attacked a poor journalist, where was she, why did she put up with it?” Peskov said, according to Agence France-Presse. “They got felt up in his office. Girls probably see better, but he can probably be seen as a not very pleasant man. If he felt you up, if he harassed you, why were you silent?”","On March 21, the Russian parliament’s Ethics Commission ruled that Slutsky had not committed any violations. Russia has no law defining sexual harassment. Earlier this month, the head of the State Duma’s committee on family, women and children said that legislation outlawing sexual harassment would be “absolutely excessive.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5abe2edc200000d30ceb374a.jpeg?cache=L5lC9FhBQH&ops=crop_0_40_2115_1273%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"ESPN Analyst Says At One Point He Wasn't Sure If Kanye West Was Male Or Female","authors":"Ron Dicker","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tim-kurkjian-kanye-west_us_5abdfef6e4b0a47437aa24ba","short_description":"Tim Kurkjian offered a hilarious on-air confession of his musical ignorance.","date":"2018-03-30"},"articleContent":["ESPN baseball analyst Tim Kurkjian should never cover the Grammy Awards.","During the Opening Day broadcast of the Chicago Cubs-Miami Marlins game in Miami Thursday, the 61-year-old announcer hilariously confessed to striking out when it comes to music knowledge.","“I need to get out of the house a little bit more, I think that’s fairly obvious,” he told fellow commentators Eduardo Perez and Karl Ravech. “I thought Lynyrd Skynyrd was a guy ― I thought his name was Len, I didn’t know it was a band.

There are the brusque, larger-than-life personalities; the shady real estate developers; the Godzilla vs. Megalon-level slugfests between entrenched interest groups; the random agencies whose existence you only learned about after indictments were unsealed (we’re looking at you, Passaic Valley Sewerage Commission); more shady real estate developers; and enough windbreaker-clad federal agents hauling boxes out of offices in cheerless strip malls to fill MetLife Stadium.","And for most of the past decade, there’s been Gov. Chris Christie (R), whose two terms in office ended Jan. 16: he of the combative town hall meetings, the burn-it-all-down political agenda and the vexing vehicular congestion in Fort Lee.","Into this goat rodeo comes Christie’s successor, Gov. Phil Murphy (D), who is rather boring. This isn’t a knock against the guy. He’s also likable, accomplished and in command of the issues — all fine qualities in a state executive. He has a difficult time relaxing his face into anything other than a 10,000-watt smile and speaks with a deep and inviting New England brogue, the result of his Boston childhood.","As center-left resumes go, Murphy’s reads like a Brookings Institution dream: 23 years at Goldman Sachs, a stint as finance chair of the Democratic National Committee under then party chief Howard Dean, ambassador to Germany under President Barack Obama, and founder of several progressive groups in New Jersey that set him up to run for governor.","And, perhaps most boringly, Murphy doesn’t yell at people during public appearances. Instead, he makes bland comments about the burdens endured by New Jersey taxpayers. Murphy doesn’t scowl or stare anyone down when he isn’t speaking. Instead, he assumes the international position of attentive politician: hands folded demurely over the crotch while solemnly nodding.","This is all very dull. Put another way, “Agreeable, wealthy Irish guy with magnetic smile and deep ties to Democratic party machine finds success in Northeastern politics” hasn’t exactly been a remarkable headline these last 100 years.","Yet excitement over Murphy has reached such levels that an outsider would be forgiven for assuming that somewhere on the Jersey Turnpike, a chauffeured black Suburban was ferrying Gov. Bruce Springsteen to a ribbon cutting at a women’s health clinic. National Democratic officials and observers are already speculating about Murphy and a possible run for national office.","One reason for all this excitement: Murphy’s relentlessly progressive agenda, realized in his first weeks in office through a slew of executive orders, including ones mandating equal pay policies in state agencies, prioritizing the development of wind energy, and establishing a commission to aid hurricane recovery efforts in Puerto Rico (a nod to the large number of state residents with island ties). On Feb. 21, he signed his first bill into law, restoring $7.5 million in funding for Planned Parenthood and other health care providers that had been deep-sixed by the Christie administration. Shortly thereafter, he signed another bill extending contraception access to Medicaid recipients.","Another source of all the goodwill directed at Murphy: the near-palpable relief among many of the state’s liberal and moderate power brokers that he’s nothing like Christie.","“It was a welcome change and experience,” said Marie Blistan, president of the powerful New Jersey Education Association and a member of Murphy’s transition team, speaking of her interactions with the new governor. “His platform is the same now as it was when he was running for office.”","Tom Bracken, president and CEO of the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce, said he’s pleased to see a New Jersey governor focusing on the state. Asked if he would care to explain his thoughts on the previous administration, Bracken, whose organization often aligns with Republicans, diplomatically declined, saying with a chuckle that Murphy’s actions have been “very well received.”","Christie-bashing is a very rich vein to tap in Trenton (he departed the state capital with the lowest approval ratings of any governor in the nation). It’s appropriate, then, that Christie is one of the few topics Murphy actually gets emotive about.","“Our soul has sort of been ripped out of us the last few years,” he told HuffPost. “We’re digging out from eight years of a really difficult reality in the state.”","Many New Jerseyans are just glad to have a state executive who is not (at least not yet) plotting a run for president.","“The biggest change I’ve seen is we finally have a governor who is more interested in sound policy decisions than getting good quotes published in the press,” said Ed Potosnak, executive director of the New Jersey League of Conservation Voters.","A state-level focus will serve Murphy well in the coming weeks and months as he and New Jersey’s solidly Democratic legislature hammer out a budget and work on his top priorities, which include legalizing marijuana, raising the minimum wage and adapting the state’s tax code to the overhaul of the U.S. tax code signed by President Donald Trump last year ― legislation that increases the burdens on residents of progressive states like New Jersey with higher local tax rates.","But this is still Jersey politics, where being frenemies is the platonic ideal of a working relationship.","Murphy’s run for governor thwarted the gubernatorial ambitions of state Senate President Stephen Sweeney (D). Murphy’s money and Sweeney’s ongoing tensions with the New Jersey Education Association, which opposed his bid for Senate re-election in 2017, proved too much for Sweeney to overcome.","Reports of tensions between the two camps persist, even as both sides contend that all is well.","Senate Majority Leader Loretta Weinberg (D), a Sweeney ally and a no-nonsense veteran of the upper house — visitors to her office are greeted by a poster reading, “Some call it bitching, I call it motivational speaking” — is happy to have an ally in the governor’s mansion. However, to call her feelings toward Murphy anything north of lukewarm would be a stretch.","She told HuffPost that while she is impressed with the new governor, his “extremely diverse” Cabinet and his diplomatic style (“He’s great on texting ― I got a happy birthday text from him”), reservations remain.","“I think legislative leadership needs a little bit more face time with him, not just electronic,” Weinberg said. She pointedly added that most of Murphy’s staffers lack any meaningful experience in the governor’s mansion.","It’s this kind of criticism, made freely by Trenton Democrats, that gives the impression sometimes that New Jersey doesn’t have single-party rule so much as it has a coalition government.","The governor, naturally, takes issue with characterizations of his relationship with the legislature as strained.","“The relationship is outstanding. We are literally talking to leadership on both sides of the aisle,” Murphy said. He and Democratic leaders are in lockstep, he said, in counteracting the “ridiculous” tax law passed by congressional Republicans.","But officials close to Democratic leadership say that Murphy’s plans for marijuana and the minimum wage may meet resistance, with some influential members of the legislature’s Black Caucus raising concerns over legalization and other centrist members balking at a minimum wage hike. Though dominated by Democrats, the legislature is by no means a bastion of progressive politics.","Weinberg insists that marijuana legalization doesn’t have the votes yet. “It doesn’t mean we’re not going to get [the votes] at some point,” she added, “but I think people have questions and I think those questions deserve good answers based upon whatever science we can find out.”","Intra-Democratic tension in Trenton isn’t new. In 2006, the state government shut down because another Goldman Sachs exec-turned-Democratic governor, Jon Corzine, came to an impasse with Democrats in the legislature over raising the state sales tax. Corzine insisted that an increase was needed to cover a $4.5 billion budget deficit, while his counterparts in Trenton opposed the hike.","Murphy’s first budget, which he unveiled on March 13, highlighted similar divisions. Officials on all sides insist that the current tensions pale in comparison to previous intra-party squabbles. But like Corzine, Murphy is proposing a sales tax hike, and his plan to increase taxes on millionaires has met some opposition from Senate President Sweeney and Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin (D).","Here, Murphy’s boringness might also serve him well. Although Democratic operatives describe him as an unapologetic liberal, they still see him as much less hardheaded than Corzine. And Murphy has put his diplomatic skills to good use, making strong connections with many of the state’s most powerful interest groups (see: New Jersey Education Association), which could prove useful in rallying support for his agenda.","Hetty Rosenstein, the director of the Communications Workers of America’s Trenton operations, said that the governor’s outreach during his campaign and transition was “impressive,” and that many liberal organizations felt engaged by him.","Indeed, it’s hard to envision a legislative session that doesn’t tick through a sizable laundry list of progressive to-dos. But the leadership tension will continue to be a source of intrigue. More than a few people close to the parties involved speculated that Sweeney could launch a primary challenge against Murphy in 2021 if their relationship or Murphy’s public standing deteriorates.","A lot of national Democratic hopes will be pinned on Murphy and the New Jersey legislature over the coming months and years, if only because there aren’t many other places to pin said hopes. Only eight states have both a Democratic governor and a Democratic-controlled legislature, compared with 26 capitals that are fully under Republican rule. With just under three years of the decidedly conservative and decidedly unboring Trump administration to go, anyone looking for a progressive and unfussy alternative to the commander-in-chief can look across the Hudson from Trump Tower.","“We’re not consciously trying to be an alternative template,” Murphy said of the national attention his new administration has garnered. “But we can’t help but react to what’s coming at us.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aa992871e000057107aeb54.jpeg?cache=PgfJ8rEAUI&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Republicans Are Seeing Weak Returns On The Tax Law","authors":"Ariel Edwards-Levy and Arthur Delaney","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republican-tax-law-weak-returns_us_5abe8315e4b0a47437aaceac","short_description":"It was supposed to be an asset come November.

Republicans had hoped the law would boost their chances in November.","In a new HuffPost/YouGov survey, 34 percent of Americans favor the law and 36 percent oppose it, for a net -2 rating.","As before, opinions remain strongly politicized: Just 7 percent of voters who backed Hillary Clinton in last year’s election favor the tax bill, while only 6 percent of President Donald Trump’s voters oppose it.","About one-quarter of Americans say they’ve seen an increase in their paycheck as a result of the law, but just 4 percent that they consider the increase to be a substantial one. Experts have said a far greater share would benefit from the new law’s lower income tax rates, though the amounts may be so small that they’re obscured by changes in pay or health insurance costs. By now, most people should have seen the changes reflected in their paychecks.","Nearly two-thirds of households will directly benefit from the individual income tax cuts this year, according to a new analysis the independent Tax Policy Center released this week. Only 27 percent of households in the bottom fifth of the income distribution will see an increase in after-tax income, while nearly all the taxpayers in the 95th to 99th percentiles will get a cut, reaping a larger benefit from the law than other income groups.","Republicans have portrayed the law as a windfall for working people, citing announcements from hundreds of companies that as many as 4 million workers would receive bonuses as a result of the law. (That’s about 2.4 percent of the U.S. labor force.)","The law’s core provision cut corporate taxes, which Republicans said would eventually boost wages by allowing firms to make capital investments that would increase worker productivity. In addition to worker bonuses, firms have also announced a wave of stock buybacks, which inflate share prices and tend to benefit executives.","Several other surveys released in the latter half of March also suggest that the law’s popularity has either dipped or stagnated. Economist/YouGov polling, which put net support for the law as high as +4 percent in February, last pegged it at -6. Quinnipiac’s surveys, which have put the bill’s backing between -8 and -14 since February, currently show it at a -9. And a recent CNBC poll also found that relatively few workers were reporting a positive effect on their paychecks.","Americans, regardless of their opinions of the plan, remain more likely to say they are influenced by the law’s consequences for the country, rather than its effects on them personally, according to the HuffPost/YouGov survey. Of those who favor the law, 77 percent credit their support to a belief that its passage will benefit the country, while just one-quarter cite its benefit to them (respondents could choose both or neither options). Of those who oppose the law, 83 percent say it’s because of its effect on the country, and just 29 percent that it’s because of the law’s effect on them.","The share of Americans who report having recently seen stories about other workers receiving benefits ― 51 percent ― remains similar to the 55 percent who said that last month. But after a flurry of announcements at the beginning of the year, news about bonuses has seemingly dissipated. A news database search for stories in major newspapers that mentioned “tax reform” and “bonuses” turned up 169 articles in January, 82 in February and just 29 so far in March.","In a Pennsylvania special election earlier this month, Republicans all but abandoned the tax law in their talking points, apparently because it wasn’t helping.

In one recording played for the court Thursday, they can all be heard mapping out Muslim targets on Google Earth, dropping “pins” on a map of Garden City, each pin labeled “cockroaches.”","“The fucking cockroaches in this country have to go, period,” Stein said in one recording. “They are the fucking problem in this country right now. They are the threat in this country right now.”","“When we go on operations, there’s no leaving anyone behind, even if it’s a 1-year-old. I’m serious,” Stein said in another. “I guarantee if I go on a mission, those little fuckers are going bye-bye.”","In another recording, the men discussed killing a Garden City landlord who owned a building occupied by Muslims and then raping the landlord’s wife and daughter. All to scare off other landlords from renting to Muslims.","Whenever they ended up bombing Muslims in Garden City, one of the men said in another recording, it would mark the beginning of “the Crusades 2.0.” They eagerly discussed publishing a “manifesto” after the bombing — just like “Unabomber” Ted Kaczynski did — and sending it to newspapers and radio stations across Kansas.","Dan Day, the FBI informant who secretly recorded the militia, said the men wanted to time the bombing of the Garden City mosque during prayer hours. “They figured that would be the time they could get the most Muslims at one time,” he said.","The manifesto, Day explained, was meant to “inspire” others across the country “to take up action and do what these guys were doing, blowing up different Muslim targets.”","The three men’s defense attorneys have argued that all this talk of slaughtering Muslims was just a few dudes venting their frustration. “Locker room talk,” as one attorney put it. But if there are experts on when talk of mass murdering Muslims has become more than just bigoted bluster, those experts are other bigots.","Brody Benson was a member of the Kansas Security Forces, an anti-government extremist militia group to which Stein, Allen and Wright all belonged. On June 12, 2016 —the same day as the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, Florida, when a Muslim man killed 49 people — Benson wrote this on Facebook: “Fucking Islam. I’m done. Kill them all.”","“I was never shy as far as talking about Islam,” Benson explained to the court on Wednesday.","On June 14, 2016, two days after the Pulse nightclub shooting, Stein and Allen went to Benson’s shooting range in the countryside near Partridge, Kansas. Day, the FBI informant, was there too, secretly recording the meeting.","Benson talked of hunting local imams and of fomenting a war between local Shiite and Sunni Muslims. These proposals, Benson testified in court this week, really were just “blowing smoke and venting.”","But when Stein talked about using explosives to target Somali Muslims in Garden City, Benson said he got very concerned. “I actually thought it was not just talk — it was more of an actual action, action.”","“I had a gut feeling that what was just banter back and forth, ranting and everything else, was turning into something more serious and concrete,” he said.","Benson said the meeting prompted him a few days later to tender his resignation with the Kansas Security Forces. “After that meeting I was done,” he said. “I was out.” Prosecutors displayed for the court a letter of resignation he wrote to KSF members.","Prosecutors Thursday played recordings of other KSF meetings Day had recorded, these held at the home of KSF member Trish Burch. Day explained to the court that Stein organized the meetings at Burch’s home to determine “who was in and who was out” in a plan to bomb Somali Muslims.","“It got tense in the room,” Day said. Burch was “totally against” it. She appeared “scared” of Stein, someone with whom she normally had a good relationship.","“I’m not saying [Muslims are] good people,” Burch said in one of the recordings played for the court. “I’m saying I’m not going to be the one to go in and start shooting.... If they start coming at me, my family, then I’m right there. I’m more of a defensive person.”","Day testified that Stein and Allen had trouble recruiting Burch and the other militia members at these meetings to join their terrorist plot. The other militia members, he said, thought the plot was going to get everyone “thrown in jail and give militias a bad name.”","Day, whom the FBI recruited as an informant after he unwittingly attended a militia barbecue, was on the stand all day Thursday.","He was at his most emotional in recounting one of the times he and Stein conducted surveillance of Somali immigrants in Garden City. They were driving along when they spotted a little girl they presumed was Muslim, Day said.","“[Stein] seen the baby,” Day told the court, “and he was like, ‘There’s another little baby cockroach fucker. I wish I could take her out, too.’ He made a gun with his finger and said, ‘Kill the fucking cockroach.’”","“I don’t see how he could kill an innocent little baby,” he said choking back tears once again, “just because they were a different race or religion.”","Day testified that he lived in constant fear while infiltrating the militia group. He feared the men would act out on their murderous feelings toward Muslims. And he feared they’d find out he was an FBI informant and kill him. But, he said, he decided to press on.","“I prayed about it, and it felt like God had put me in that place at that time,” Day said, adding that he wanted to “stop hundreds of people from getting murdered.”","He’ll take the stand again Monday when the trial resumes.

Bobby Scott (D-Va.) and House Democrats. The forum took place just hours after a student gunman was killed at Great Mills High School in Maryland after shooting and wounding two students there, one fatally.","In the wake of the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, a wide variety of groups – from students to lawmakers – have been searching for ways to make U.S. schools and communities safer and prevent further shootings.","One of the best ways to make schools safer is to use threat assessments – a tool developed by law enforcement to protect public figures. In my opinion as one who has studied youth violence for 34 years – and as a forensic psychologist who has worked with many violent youth, including several who have committed shootings at school – I believe the time has come to use threat assessments to protect the nation’s schools.","Schools still relatively safe","The first thing to recognize is that violence in schools is just a small part of the larger problem of gun violence in American society. It would be a mistake, in my view, to focus only on schools and miss the bigger picture.","Children are exposed to violence in many other settings in their communities. Over the past 20 years, the United States has experienced an average of 22 students murdered at school each year. However, outside of schools, an average of 1,480 students are murdered annually. In other words, students are 67 times more likely to be murdered outside of school than at school.","There is understandable public alarm that there have been approximately 300 school shootings since the Sandy Hook shooting in 2012. However, according to CDC reports, there have been over 500,000 shootings outside of schools in those five years, or about 275 shootings every day, resulting in approximately 92 deaths and 183 injuries.","From this perspective, U.S. schools are much safer than the surrounding community. The nation does not have a school violence problem but a gun violence problem. What I would point out here is that there is a credible body of scientific research that we can reduce gun violence with reasonable gun laws.","Security expensive, ineffective","The nation’s response to gun violence is often an emotional reaction of increasing security and preparing for the next shooting, rather than supporting efforts to prevent gun violence. It has been reported that schools spent US $5 billion in security measures after the Sandy Hook shooting. Even if schools spend $5 billion more and could somehow make every school impregnable, that would stop only a small fraction of the shootings. For every shooting in a school, there are more than 1,600 shootings outside of school. Why would it make sense to spend billions to stop one-tenth of 1 percent and ignore the 99.9 percent of gun violence?","Prevention must start long before there is a gunman in the parking lot, and it requires, in my view, a three-tiered public health approach. The first tier is universal programs for everyone, such as improving school climate so that all children can succeed in school. Many of the mass shootings in schools and communities are committed by individuals who developed anger and resentment because of the bullying, harassment and discrimination they experienced at school. Schools should routinely measure and improve their school climate.","On the second tier, prevention means helping troubled young people who are at risk before they start down the pathway toward violence. Put an armed guard in a school and you might prevent one shooting in one building. Put a counselor or psychologist in a school and you have the potential to prevent shootings in any building anywhere in your community.","The third tier is to identify and intervene with students who are moving down a pathway toward violence, which brings me to threat assessment and how it works.","What makes threat assessment work","Threat assessment is a safe and effective way to help students who have themselves threatened violence. It is a systematic process of evaluation and intervention for persons who have made verbal or behavioral threats of violence against others.","Threat assessment was originally developed by law enforcement to protect public figures, such as the president of the United States and foreign leaders. It then expanded to business and is widely used by corporations to prevent workplace violence.","Twenty years ago, the FBI and Secret Service recommended that threat assessment be used in schools. After participating in the FBI study of school shootings in 1999, I became intrigued by this idea. My colleagues and I worked with a group of educators to develop a threat assessment model for schools.","Not assassins and terrorists","Over the past 17 years we have refined our model, published a detailed manual, disseminated it to thousands of schools and conducted 11 studies of its effects. One of our key lessons learned is that threat assessment is a good prevention strategy, but that the particular situation of each school needs to be taken into account.","The traditional law enforcement approach to threat assessment is focused on assassins and terrorists, but when it comes to schools, the focus is primarily on kids, who make threats frequently when they are angry, upset or just trying to gain some attention. In our first study, for example, we found that the age group that makes the most threats to kill are elementary school students.","In almost all cases, students need counseling and discipline, not criminal charges. In school threat assessment, you must be careful not to overreact to student threats. The process must be calibrated to deal with kids, not adults.","Evaluating the evidence","In four studies, we have found that fewer than 1 percent of students seen for a threat assessment carry out their threats. There have been fights, but none of the hundreds of threats to kill, shoot or seriously injure someone was carried out. Furthermore, three controlled studies found that schools using threat assessment had less student aggression, such as bullying and fighting, than schools that did not use threat assessment.","My conclusion is that the rush to increase security measures should not overshadow measures that have been proven to prevent violence.","In order to reduce gun violence in American communities and schools, policymakers and school leaders should adopt a threat assessment approach. This is a tool that, if properly adapted to the school setting, will not stigmatize or punish minor misbehavior but will allow schools to identify those students who are in need of mental health services and other support.

A poll worker helped her fill out a provisional ballot, of the sort given to people who aren’t on the rolls, and she cast it.","Five years earlier, Mason had pleaded guilty to tax fraud and was ordered to pay $4.2 million in restitution. She was also sentenced to five years in prison, as well as three years of supervised release. Though Mason says she didn’t realize it at the time, by casting that provisional ballot in November 2016, she had committed another felony. Texas prohibits anyone convicted of a felony from voting, and only allows them to vote once they have entirely finished their sentence, including any probation, parole and supervised release. In Texas, it is a second-degree felony to vote in an election in which you know you are not eligible.","On Wednesday, state District Judge Ruben Gonzalez sentenced Mason to five years in prison for illegally voting, according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. Mason says she had no idea she was ineligible, but Gonzalez pointed out that an affidavit at the top of the provisional ballot notes that people on supervised release can’t vote.","J. Warren St. John, Mason’s attorney, told HuffPost that no one at the federal court, the prison, the halfway house or the probation house had ever told Mason she was ineligible to vote because she was a convicted felon. Mason has worked to restart her life after getting released from prison, St. John said, getting a job with the Texas Department of Transportation, then getting a degree from beauty school and becoming self-employed.","In court, Mason rhetorically asked why she would intentionally jeopardize her new life to vote.","“I inflated returns,” Mason said, according to the Star-Telegram. “I was trying to get more money back for my clients. I admitted that. I owned up to that. I took accountability for that. I would never do that again. I was happy enough to come home and see my daughter graduate. My son is about to graduate. Why would I jeopardize that? Not to vote... I didn’t even want to go vote.”","St. John said he plans to file an appeal and that Mason, who was taken into custody on Wednesday, is currently out of jail on a $20,000 bond.","St. John said it’s ridiculous to think his client intentionally defrauded the state of Texas to vote. He noted that Mason went to the same polling place where she’d always voted, and used a legitimate driver’s license and address. There’s no evidence, St. John said, that Mason even read the language on the provisional ballot telling her that people on supervised release are ineligible to vote.","In 2016, there were more than 6 million people in the United States who were disenfranchised because of a felony conviction, according to The Sentencing Project. States differ in how voting rights are restored. In four states, felons are permanently disenfranchised and can only have their voting rights restored at the discretion of the governor. Some states allow people to vote once they are released from prison, while others, like Texas, force them to complete all aspects of their sentences before they can vote again.","Voter fraud is exceedingly rare in the U.S., but Mason’s case and others illustrate how ineligible people sometimes end up casting ballots out of confusion. In 2017, a Texas mother of four who legally immigrated to the United States was sentenced to eight years in jail for unknowingly illegally voting in multiple elections. She now faces likely deportation. In North Carolina, the district attorney in Alamance County is pursuing criminal charges against several felons who voted while they were on probation. At least a few of them say they didn’t know they couldn’t vote.","“Why would she vote illegally?” St. John said of his client. “What benefit does she receive by doing that? Nothing she did changed the outcome of any election. It didn’t count anyway because she was kicked out.”","Sharen Wilson, the Tarrant County district attorney, said in a statement Friday that Mason had chosen to break the law.","“Our society is built on personal responsibility,” Wilson said. “There were multiple safeguards in place to keep Crystal Mason from breaking the law, but she still made that choice.”","“She signed and affirmed a document which clearly stated that (1) she was prohibited from voting due to her status as a convicted felon still serving her term of supervision, and (2) she would be committing a second degree felony if she lied about her status,” Wilson went on. “The judge found her guilty of illegal voting beyond a reasonable doubt. The judge set her sentence after hearing all the facts of the case.”","Rep. Cedric Richmond (D-La.), the chair of the congressional black caucus, said he was “heartbroken” over Mason’s case.","“The punishment does not fit the crime in this instance. This woman now faces the prospect of more time away from her family just because she was transitioning away from a prison setting,” he said in a statement. “Americans should be ashamed of this prison sentence.”","This post has been updated with comment from Wilson and Richmond."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5abe5cfe1f0000270616bf1a.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"MEDIA","headline":"George W.

Marriage equality will actually be a very positive thing for straight marriage, because hopefully people will learn that there are far worse ways to betray somebody than by having sex with someone else.

Shulkin, a physician and former hospital administrator, wrote in a Wednesday op-ed in the New York Times that VA privatization proponents in the Trump administration orchestrated his ouster because they viewed him “as an obstacle to privatization.”","There is ample evidence to support Shulkin’s version of events. An anonymous White House official told The Washington Post in February that the White House planned to fire Shulkin’s deputy secretary Thomas Bowman as a “warning shot” to Shulkin over his opposition to conservative congressional legislation that would dramatically increase private care options available to veterans.","Shulkin, like many veterans advocates, believes that the private sector wouldn’t be able to accommodate the unique care needs of veterans. Privatization proponents argue that, given higher demand for VA coverage and the rising wait times, veterans should be free to seek care wherever they please.","Darrin Selnick, a former staffer at Concerned Veterans of America, a pro-privatization group funded by the conservative billionaire Koch brothers, also left the Department of Veterans Affairs to become the White House veterans affairs adviser after disagreements with Shulkin on private care options. On Monday, just two days before the official announcement of Shulkin’s departure, Selnick returned to the VA, fueling speculation that his return was linked to Shulkin’s ouster.","The White House denies that it wants to privatize the VA health care system. “This Administration has taken several unprecedented steps to transform and modernize the VA, and there are no discussions about privatizing it,” said Raj Shah, deputy principal White House press secretary.","And veterans groups emphasize that Trump’s proposed replacement for Shulkin, the presidential physician, Adm. Ronny Jackson, is an unknown quantity.","“Who’s to say whether he’ll back privatization? We know nothing about him,” said Will Fischer, an Iraq War veteran in charge of government relations for VoteVets, a liberal group.","However, veterans advocates worry that Jackson’s complete lack of experience in health care administration and policy will put privatization hard-liners like Selnick in the driver’s seat.","And they fear that the expansion of a once-temporary private “choice” program, created to let veterans stranded on VA waitlists get care from private doctors, is a Trojan horse for full-scale privatization that it is already taking up resources that could go toward the established VA system.","“This program they want to expand recklessly is already such a money and resources suck,” AMVETS’ Hoellwarth said.","Depriving the VA of the money it needs to improve could then further sour the public on the system and soften it up still more to privatization efforts, advocates like Hoellwarth warn.","The Trump administration has used similar tactics to undermine the Affordable Care Act’s individual insurance marketplaces. For example, he has severely cut back on advertising for the marketplaces, prompting a decline in enrollment that has discouraged insurers from offering plans in the marketplaces.","In a speech in Ohio on Thursday, Trump suggested that Shulkin’s removal was directly related to his resistance to an expansion of the private care program: “We made changes because we want them taken care of, we want them to have choice so that they can run to a private doctor and take care of it, and it’s going to get done.”","The Veterans Health Administration, as the VA health care system is officially known, is a network of 1,240 medical facilities that serves over 9 million military veterans across the country.","Unlike Medicare and Medicaid, in which the federal government provides insurance to pay for health care delivered mostly by private doctors and hospitals, the VHA offers in-house comprehensive medical care to the veterans it treats.","Veterans organizations have long touted the benefits of a federally run system. They argue that the VA has developed singular expertise on the medical needs of veterans. For example, due to the department’s experience treating disabled limbs, the VA has become a world leader in the development of prosthetic devices, according to Hoellwarth.","“Anybody can give you a flu shot, but not just anybody can deliver specialized care that veterans need,” Hoellwarth said.","The VA’s current foray into private care began in 2014, when the agency was embroiled in controversy over long wait times that several VA administrators were caught trying to cover up.","In August of that year, a bipartisan reform effort brokered by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and then-Rep. Jeff Miller (R-Fla.), created a path for veterans to seek private care under select circumstances, among other changes.","Trump’s selection of Shulkin, who then-President Barack Obama appointed to turn around the VA’s health care system, was a relief to veterans groups that had been concerned that conservative groups hoping to rapidly expand the private care options created by the 2014 law had the president’s ear. Trump had reportedly been considering nominating Pete Hegseth, a former head of Concerned Veterans of America who is now a contributor on Fox News.","Trump’s decision to dump Shulkin, who veterans organizations say presided over the shortening of wait times and updates to aging medical technology, has at best baffled these organizations.","“Nobody has really explained to us the decision for why Secretary Shulkin was removed. He was a good partner to the American Legion,” said American Legion spokesman Joe Plenzler.","Asked whether the Legion was more concerned about privatization, Plenzler replied, “Our antenna is up, yes. We are looking at what lies ahead for the future of the VA.”","Shulkin’s ouster is not the first point of contention between Trump and the so-called “Big 6” veterans organizations: the American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, AMVETS, Vietnam Veterans of America, Disabled American Veterans and the Paralyzed Veterans of America.","Junior staff at the White House frustrated the Big 6 leaders by failing to establish an open channel of communication between the groups and the president, according to Rick Weidman and another senior veterans advocate familiar with the matter who asked not to be named discussing sensitive topics. In early February, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, a retired Marine general, met with the leaders to mend fences and promised to soon schedule a follow-up meeting that might include face-time with the president, Weidman and the other veterans group official said.","“That never happened and I don’t know if it will ever happen now,” Weidman said."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5abd6b8f1e0000fb077b022d.jpeg?cache=PUIaHd7es8&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Foxconn In Choppy Waters Over Plan To Drain The Great Lakes","authors":"Stateline, Editorial Partner","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/foxconn-in-choppy-waters-over-plan-to-drain-the-great_us_5abe43afe4b0f8e848433752","short_description":"Wisconsin brokered a deal that gives Foxconn billions in incentives to open a factory in the state.

But the deal’s legality has been brought into question by its Great Lakes neighbors as Wisconsin prepares to drain millions of gallons a day from Lake Michigan.","By Rebecca Beitsch","The approval of a new factory just outside the Great Lakes Basin could mark the beginning of a manufacturing revitalization that relies on draining millions of gallons of water from the lakes.","It’s what Wisconsin’s government hopes for — and environmentalists fear.","If given the go-ahead by Wisconsin’s Department of Natural Resources, electronics manufacturer Foxconn Technology Group, which is based in Taiwan, would make liquid crystal displays, more commonly known as LCDs, in a factory just outside Racine, Wisconsin.","Wisconsin courted Foxconn hard. The state offered $3 billion in incentives and exempted the plant from the state’s wetlands regulations and an environmental impact review. In luring Foxconn, Wisconsin beat out many of its Great Lakes neighbors — Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and Pennsylvania also vied for the plant.","The company has pledged to hire 3,000 people in Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan’s district in a largely rural part of the state with a struggling economy. But the company needs more than just a wealth of manufacturing workers. Making LCD panels also requires large volumes of clean water: The plant is seeking approval through Racine’s water utility to drain 7 million gallons a day from Lake Michigan.","But other Great Lakes states are questioning the legality of the deal, and some environmentalists say it could create a slippery slope that will allow other outside interests to tap into lakes.","Environmentalists object to Wisconsin leaders allowing Foxconn to skirt some environmental regulations, and they worry Racine’s wastewater treatment center won’t be able to treat all the pollution from the plant before releasing the water back into Lake Michigan.","Perhaps the biggest question, however, is whether the deal violates the Great Lakes Compact, a 2008 deal signed between the eight Great Lakes states and whose governing body includes Ontario and Quebec. The agreement aims to keep Great Lakes water from being diverted to areas far beyond the Great Lakes Basin, but it also requires that any water that is diverted be used to serve mainly the public, not industry.","“There had been musings in years past done by water-thirsty states out West that the way to solve the water problem is to build pipelines to Lake Superior,” said Bill Davis, executive director of the Wisconsin chapter of the Sierra Club, which is opposed to the Foxconn project. “If you undermine the compact, you potentially lose the ability to prevent things like that from happening.”","The Foxconn plant is set to be built in Mount Pleasant near Racine, not far from the Great Lakes Basin. Racine is requesting 7 million gallons of lake water a day, of which 6 million would go to the plant and 1 million would go to other commercial and industrial users. That’s not enough water to trigger a review by the rest of the Great Lakes states in the compact, under which one state’s “nay” would be enough to veto the project.","Instead, it’s up to Wisconsin’s natural resources agency to make sure the proposal meets the compact’s standards when it comes to diverting water. The agency hopes to decide on the project by the end of May.","Officials from New York and Illinois, the two Great Lakes states that did not compete for the plant, questioned aspects of the deal during the proposal’s comment period, which concluded earlier this month.","A letter from New York’s Department of Environmental Conservation quoted the compact’s requirement that water diverted to nearby communities largely serve residential customers.","“Here, it is unclear that the proposed diversion is largely for residential customers,” the letter said. “The water is intended to facilitate the construction and operation of the future industrial site.”","New York also questioned whether Wisconsin could unilaterally approve the deal, saying the compact’s general prohibition of new diversions “favors and potentially mandates” review by the other states bordering the lakes.","A letter from the Illinois Attorney General’s Office said the utilities involved in the project haven’t made clear how they would treat wastewater from the Foxconn plant before ultimately releasing it back into Lake Michigan. They argue that Racine should not be able to exceed the amounts defined in its current permit for returning wastewater to the lake.","Republican Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s office referred questions about whether the Foxconn project comports with the Great Lakes Compact to the state environmental agency. A spokesman for the agency would not comment on the Foxconn project while its regulatory review is underway.","Keith Haas, general manager of Racine’s water utility, said the Foxconn project pales in comparison to the more than 700 million gallons of Lake Michigan water Chicago uses every day. He said much of the area’s current population was drawn there to work at factories that have since closed.","“Because of the industry decline of last 20, 30 years, we have lots of capacity to meet the demands of future development,” he said. “This just gives us an industry that doesn’t exist right now, and maybe some people could go and work at this industrial place.”","Haas said once the project is approved, Foxconn and the utility will begin the process for determining how to deal with wastewater, following the typical timeline of applying for permits a few months before opening. As for concerns of pipelines whisking water away to Iowa or Montana, he thinks those fears are overblown.","Foxconn declined a request for an interview but said in a statement that “environmental sustainability is a priority and that includes compliance with the Great Lakes Compact and Wisconsin’s laws, rules and permitting procedures relating to water quality and wastewater treatment.” Under the deal with Wisconsin, the company is required to create 2 acres of wetlands for each one it destroys, more than the typical 1.2 acres required by law.","Other diversion projects have spurred controversy in the past — but those were proposals to use lake water to serve largely residential consumers.","When Waukesha, a town of 72,000 about 20 miles from Milwaukee, wanted to tap into Lake Michigan because its own water supply was contaminated with radium, a naturally occurring radioactive element, the diversion was significantly scaled back after objections from other states in the region.","“There’s an argument that this is not public infrastructure,” said Jim Olson, an environmental lawyer in Michigan who has spoken out against the Foxconn deal. Olson worries it will open the door to similar projects that, when combined, will slowly drain the basin. “The Great Lakes are an important but exhaustible resource. … If you interpret the exceptions to the diversion ban too broadly, you have to treat anyone else that comes along in a somewhat equal manner.”","Environmentalists have also questioned Foxconn’s planning skills: If the company had proposed to build its plant just a little farther east, it would be entirely in the basin and require no review at all. Still, many expect the project will be approved.","“It’s kind of obvious to some of us that if they built it 2,000 feet to the east there’d be no problem,” Haas said. “But we don’t tell people what to do.”","Stateline home page","Sign up for exclusive state policy reporting and research"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5abe43f81f00001a0016bef3.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"MEDIA","headline":"Republican Strategist Nails Why David Hogg Got To Laura Ingraham","authors":"Rebecca Shapiro","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republican-strategist-david-hogg-laura-ingraham_us_5abd7f37e4b0a47437a9be6b","short_description":"If only elected officials in the Republican Party would stand up to Fox News like school shooting survivor David Hogg did.","date":"2018-03-30"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"BLACK VOICES","headline":"Autopsy Shows Police Shot Unarmed Man Stephon Clark 8 Times","authors":"Sebastian Murdock","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/autopsy-shows-stephon-clark-unarmed-was-shot-8-times-by-police_us_5abe4651e4b055e50acd11a4","short_description":"Police shot at Clark 20 times outside the Sacramento home he shared with his grandparents and children.","date":"2018-03-30"},"articleContent":["Stephon Clark , the 22-year-old father of two who was unarmed when he was fatally shot by police in California earlier this month, was hit eight times, an independent autopsy shows.","On March 18, two Sacramento Police Department officers responded to reports of someone smashing car windows in Clark’s neighborhood.

The latest episode of “ Atlanta” makes that clear when Paper Boi, through a series of shenanigans that put them both in legal jeopardy, remains loyal to Bibby ― his Bluetooth-wearing, toothpick-chewing, slick-talking barber.","“Barbershop,” the fifth episode of Season 2, opens with Paper Boi waiting for Bibby to arrive at the shop. In true black barber fashion, he’s late. The rapper has been sitting in the chair for God knows how long, a fact made evident by the exasperation on his face. When Bibby finally walks in, dressed like your uncle who sells Vector Knives and flips tax refunds, he wants to do everything but cut Paper Boi’s hair: talk on the phone, eat, watch viral videos ― you name it (Shirley Caesar voice). When a woman only known as 💦🍑, the name saved in his phone, calls, he asks Paper Boi, who has a lopsided haircut thanks to Bibby chopping off one side before going to the restroom, to come with him to run an errand. Paper Boi is fed up but he obliges because loyalty to your barber takes precedence over everything.","Of course, one errand turns into an entire day of bullshit. All the while, Bibby promises Paper Boi that they’ll head back to the barbershop right after he finishes each task “real quick.” But in the midst of the day’s chaos lies a message about the importance of black men seizing control of their beauty. We rarely get to see intimate scenes of a black man getting his hair cut despite it, arguably, being one of the most vital relationships in a man’s life. It’s the one place black men can go and just, well, be.","Julia Craven and Taryn Finley discuss the damn-near unbreakable relationship between a man and his barber and why the barbershop is a vital safe space, despite its flaws, on this week’s “Run That Back.”","Julia: This episode was literally a ride.","Taryn: Accurate. I knew when Bibby walked into the barbershop at least 30 minutes late for Paper Boi’s appointment that this was about to be a ride. And boy, was it.","Julia: I love how “Atlanta” got all the usual barbershop/hair salon gripes out the way early ― your stylist is late, they’re on the phone, they’re oversharing their personal life, they stop mid-appointment to eat, and they ask you to hold something. Then it got really absurd, borderline unrealistic, yet somehow the most realistic thing I’ve ever seen in my black-ass life. When Bibby said, “I’m on 85 right now!” I knew he was on some other shit that only Atlanta can deliver (the city and the show).","Taryn: All on a Bluetooth at that. Talking shit about his baby mama and making plans with his tax refund that you know he ain’t gon follow through on. Paper Boi can’t tell when Bibby is talking to him or the nigga on the phone. Bibby wants to do everything but do his job. I don’t know a black person who hasn’t been in this position.","Come to think of it, I think Bluetooths are the universal symbols for finesse OGs.","Julia: It’s hands down the universal symbol. If I see a man with a Bluetooth, I run the other way, because I know he’s a scammer on the same level as Joanne.","And Paper Boi gets trapped in this series of ridiculous scams all because of his loyalty to his barber. And I get it, because if Reya (the woman who does my nails) ever pulled me out the chair to ride along so she could do my nails at her homegirl’s house, I’d go, because NO ONE ELSE can shape my nails like her.","Am I supposed to let another tech no my fill-in? So I can look busted? Absolutely the fuck not.","Taryn: Right. Paper Boi is fed up, but he’s more loyal to his barber than he is to any of the women he’s dealing with.","But that relationship with a barber/hairdresser/nail tech is sacred. Who else am I gonna go to and they just know what I want from jump? Nobody. That’s why Paper Boi deal with his bullshit.","Julia: Exactly! This episode, in its own absurd way, shows the deep connection black men have to their barbers. Black men are already likely to have a barber longer than they have a primary care physician. And what Paper Boi and Bibby show us is that that haircut, that trust is worth going through hell for. Paper Boi doesn’t even put his hands on Bibby until half the episode is over, when last season he shot a dude over waaaaaaay less.","You know, another thing that makes this episode super funny is that a few weeks ago I asked #Bae about his relationship with his barber. We were listening to a podcast that was talking about the barber/client relationship. So I asked him if he’d ever leave his barber. And he said, “I don’t know what I’d do if he broke up with me. I’d be fucking crushed. Nobody else knows how to line my beard up like he does.”","Like you said, it’s a sacred bond. I feel like #Bae would leave me before he left his barber LMAO.","Taryn: So Bibby finally begins cutting Paper Boi’s hair but only chops part of the side off before Bibby stops and tells him to watch a viral video of an NBA player’s invisible Lamborghini hitting someone outside of the club. Paper Boi doesn’t care to see it because he actually witnessed it (refer to Season 1, Episode 6) but Bibby insists. As he’s watching, 💦🍑calls. And, of course, Bibby was supposed to have BEEN at her house to cut her son’s hair. So what does Bibby do? He tells Paper Boi to come with him to her house.","Now, pause for the cause, raise your hand if you ever had to leave Point A with your beautician to go with her to run an errand with a half-done head of hair before she actually finished your hair at Point B. 🙋🏾","Julia: Sis, one time she sent ME out for more hair.","Taryn: It’s really the name of the game, and we just deal with it because who else is gonna slay our shit like we like it?","Julia: I actually cannot get over how triggering “I’m on 85 right now!” is.","Taryn: It’s so black. Knowing damn well you ain’t no where near the car. I’d protest it if I didn’t always say “I’m on my way” when I haven’t even taken a shower to leave yet.","Julia: Honestly, when a man tells me he’s 10 mins away, I don’t start getting ready until 30 mins later and I still be ready before he pull up.","Taryn: You better than me. I don’t start getting ready till he gets there. I also ain’t shit so ...","Julia: This episode is also the first time I’ve actually laughed in a “funny haha” way at “Atlanta.” Like, this episode was FUNNY.","Taryn: I fought air so many times this episode. I didn’t catch it the first time I watched, but when Bibby actually decides to leave, they gotta go out through the back of the shop because “them people be out there.” Now, I don’t know who “them people” are, but I do know Bibby probably owes them money.","Julia: He absolutely owes “them people” money.","We arrive at the house of 💦🍑 to discover that Bibby owes her son a haircut, too. The kid’s appointment was technically before Paper Boi’s, leaving the rapper to sit in a lounge chair and wait on his barber yet again. After Bibby delivers a beautiful cut, 💦🍑 yells from upstairs that the water isn’t running and inquires if Bibby paid the water bill. He says he did ― but then the lights suddenly go out. Bibby grabs Paper Boi, and a couple dollars out of 💦🍑’s purse, and scurries out of the house and on to the next scam.","Julia: I do wanna discuss the time we spent at 💦🍑 house.","Taryn: At 💦🍑’s house, we see how slick Bibby’s tongue really is.","Julia: Mainly I wanna know why no one wiped that lil boy nose.","Taryn: Because you know there’s always one little boy who woke up and went to bed with dried-up snot on his nose.","Julia: That poor child. And this scene is when we see the episode’s biggest gag. Bibby is an excellent barber. That boy cut was SICKENING!","Taryn: It was. I also love how much of a close-up we get on black hair. Not only was the cut nice, but the way in which it was shot was beautiful. We spend a good amount of time really looking at the tenderness and care that goes into a black barber’s work and how it truly is an art form. Through all the madness and chaos of the episode, I really appreciated those moments of serenity (here with the little boy and later with Paper Boi). Black men don’t really have those images that reflect the beauty of their hair on mainstream TV today, so it was kinda heartwarming to me.","Julia: Yes! Yes, yes, yes! It was very humanizing and showed how much care black men put into their appearance. We tend to focus on women ― mainly white ones ― and how much we care about how we look, but we don’t get into men’s connection with beauty. And we definitely neglect black men when we do dig into it. It was really beautiful and showed that despite the shop being a time-suck filled with regressive sociopolitical views (that “I thought quince meant 18! What’d she have on a wedding dress for?!” shit), this is place where black men can be free and catered to.","Taryn: Exactly! Barbershops can be a place where black men can be vulnerable, which is rare. There are definitely some hypermasculine themes that still exist within them. But this place is like intro to therapy, low-key. Even though Bibby stressed Paper Boi tf out all day. Hell, he stressed me out.","Julia: Right! It’s a black man’s safe place where they can just exist. And I’m not defending the regressive views on women and gender ... but that doesn’t change the fact that this is a place where black men find solace. They crack jokes. They talk about sports and say all the non-PC things they wanna say about women in a place they won’t be dragged for it. And that’s important! We all have trash views we need to deconstruct so I’m glad black men have a place they can possibly do that.","Now do they do that? Most of them prolly don’t, which is a different conversation.","Taryn: Right! That safe space is so important. It’s the first place many black men and boys learn to be vulnerable. There aren’t many spaces like that.","And chile, that’s a WHOLE NOTHER conversation that will last longer than Paper Boi’s day with Bibby, I’m sure.","On the way to the next scam, Bibby asks Paper Boi if he’s hungry ― specifically if he wants Zaxby’s. Paper Boi, like all of us, loves Zaxby’s and gets slightly excited about the possibility of having a Wings & Things plate. Bibby, like the scammer he is, drags Paper Boi into a half-built house, hands the rapper a half-eaten plate of food and then Bibby makes the rapper help him steal some lumber from the site. They’re caught by the white woman who owns the property, but, once again, they manage to flee the scene without being caught.","Julia: “Of course I love Zaxby’s.” ― Who said it? Paper Boi or Julia?","Taryn: Trick question! It was actually Taryn.","Julia: I hate you. I just screamed.","Taryn: I love how Paper Boi got an attitude when Bibby asked him if he likes it. Like duh, nigga. It’s Zaxby’s!","Julia: That’s how I feel when I’m home and my parents ask me if I want Zaxby’s. Fuck you think? (I’m sorry, Mama. Please don’t cuss me out.)","Taryn: LMAO.","Julia: Listen, I’m just playing it safe before I get a random knock on my door and it’s Tammy. (Sorry, I know I’m not supposed to call you by your first name either. Please do not cuss me out.)","Taryn: Listen. I get it. I got a mama who don’t play games either. (Hey, Rhonda ... I mean, Mommy!)","Julia: I’ll be in an Uber and it’ll suddenly get rear-ended like Bibby did that poor woman at the stop sign.","But who is the driver? My mother. Pulling up on my ass.","Taryn: fhduihuiref. Also, joke’s on Paper Boi though cause ain’t no Zaxby’s bih! If Paper Boi wasn’t on probation, I know he would’ve knocked Bibby tf out for bringing him to a half-built house with a box of half-eaten chicken.","A perfect metaphor for Bibby’s half-ass ass.","Julia: It reminded me of abandoned houses I ended up in as a young whippersnapper. I don’t know why, but I have eaten in an abandoned home before. Granted, all of my serving was there. It wasn’t some nigga’s scraps LMAO.","Well, let me not lie. I know why I was in the house but that’s not America’s business.","Taryn: Lol. I ain’t mad. Don’t implicate yourself, sis.","Julia:","Presumably on their way back to the shop, Paper Boi and Bibby drive past a group of children who should be in school. Bibby slows down and stares at the group before whipping his pickup truck around and chasing after the kids. He takes a shortcut and cuts the kids off in the alley. He hops out the truck and screams at his son, Lamar, for not being in class.","Julia: I think my favorite scene though is when they’re leaving the construction site and Bibby sees his son skipping class. The way he whipped that pickup around and cut the kids off in the alley reminded me of a cop-movie trope we always see, but I loved it. Then Lamar (of course that’s his name) had an attitude about being chastised!","He skipped class and ain’t even put up the scammer posters his daddy gave him. I was over it. But these minor inserts of “bad-ass kids” were the perfect garnish to this black-ass episode.","Taryn: Mind you, Bibby promised about 4,789 times to take Paper Boi back to the shop. But when Bibby looked at Lamar and Lamar looked at him, shit got real! The fear in Lamar’s eyes can only be evoked by a parent. (Hey again, Rhonda!) That shit had me triggered and hollering at the same time. The background music didn’t help.","Julia: (Hey Tammy!) That look of “I know this lil nigga ain’t [insert something you ain’t supposed to be doing here]” was VERY triggering.","And that attitude he had upon being caught was his survival instincts kicking in. How do I know that? Well, hey Tammy. And that head cock to the side?! alikhdklahsduygerfdsg.","Taryn: Then when Bibby told Paper Boi to get outta the car to check his son, I died for a few reasons. 1. Lamar FLAMED Paper Boi’s raggedy, lopsided haircut that he gave him before they left the shop. 2. Like you said, THAT HEAD COCK.","That head cock is such a black kid thing. I remember getting checked for doing some shit I wasn’t supposed to be doing and cocking my neck all the way to the side just so I didn’t have to look at whoever was telling me I was wrong. That attitude is like no other lmao.","Julia: Sometimes, this show is so black I’m like, that couldn’t have been scripted. That head cock could NOT have been scripted. It was too authentic, too natural. That young man cocked his head because that’s what black kids do when they’re chastised. That head cocks to their left ― and only to the left ― and they start shifting their weight from foot to foot. Your hands go in your pockets and you start staring off into the background, looking past the person chastising. That couldn’t have been scripted.","I’m shocked Bibby or Paper Boi didn’t say, “Look at me when I’m talking to you.” But I may have had a heart attack from my Black Kid PTSD.","Taryn: AND ONLY TO THE LEFT! Wow. I never noticed that until just now but it is only to the left. Black Kid PTSD is real.","Bibby did tell him to get his ass in that tiny-ass pickup, though.","Julia: “Get your ass in the car!” shudders.","“You going back to the shop.” I am so triggered.","Taryn: The back of that pickup was TIGHT. And Bibby was so busy cussing his son out and threatening to call his mom (on his flip phone, which he probably doesn’t have minutes on at that) on the way to the barbershop (finally) that this nigga rear-ended some lady. I SCREAMED.","Julia: Sis, my parents threw me behind the seat of my uncle’s pickup to move me into college my freshman year. I KNOW IT WAS TIGHT, OK?! Chapel Hill is an entire 1.5 hours away from my hometown. And I sat back there, and when I said my legs were sleep, my parents cracked jokes and laughed. I’ve lived Lamar’s life.\n","Also, just to go back a few messages, I swear only black kids will roast someone checking them. My god.","Taryn: LMAO YO! It’s true. “Why you ain’t fresh?”","Julia: The hilarity in this is how relatable it all is!","Bibby is finally taking Paper Boi back to the shop and he’s berating his son as they go. Paper Boi keeps telling Bibby to watch the road. But, if you know black parents, you know that Bibby is keeping half his mind on the road and both eyes looking back at Lamar while he cusses him out for skipping school. They, inevitably, get into a wreck before returning to the shop where Bibby gives Paper Boi a haircut made for God herself.","Taryn: I can’t imagine being in the back of that pickup when they hit that lady. Then when Bibby told Paper Boi to get in the driver’s seat cause he got warrants, I was done. But when that lady got out the car hollering and holding her lower back, I genuinely couldn’t take it.","Bibby peeled off like, “I ain’t going back to jail!”","Julia: I wanna know where they found that footage of me holding my back and screaming. I want my royalties.","But no, that bounce around was too much! “I got warrants.” “I got weed in my pockets.” And the last nail in my coffin was Lamar saying “I ain’t got a license” before Bibby made the executive decision to peel off. I wanna make sure we characterize it as an executive decision he made in the group’s best interest, because in a lot of ways it was. You know how the police are ― they would have pulled up and ran everybody’s pockets just because the driver who caused the accident was black.","Taryn: Paper Boi has dodged the cops so many times already this season. I’m so glad Bibby acted in the group’s best interest even though the intention was really for his best interest. He saved the day.","Julia: Bibby is a hero, tbh.","Taryn: A lying, scamming hero. But a hero, nonetheless.","Julia: Despite it all, he delivered a very fresh cut. And then Paper Boi broke up with him and went on to get what I assume to be a whack cut next time. Paper Boi can’t win. It’s tragic.","Taryn: Paper Boi shouldn’t have paid Bibby, though. He should’ve just kept on walking out the door.","Julia: I wouldn’t have paid him either.","Taryn: Bibby deserved to get broken up with, because he plays too many games, but that shit hurt my feelings. Paper Boi didn’t even know what the other barber was talking bout when he asked him if he wanted a 2 or a 3. I know Bibby ain’t shit, but I really hope they work it out and Bibby does right by him.","Julia: Bibby also didn’t care about the breakup, which is what hurt me.","Taryn: Bibby’s ego was bruised more than anything. He had that look like, “Oh, so this want we doing, nigga? Aight.” Then moved on cause he knows his blade stays sharp and somebody else can (and did) replace Paper Boi’s spot in the chair.","Julia: Tragic. I guess the moral here is don’t leave your barber ever.","Taryn: Also, can we just take a moment to acknowledge Bibby’s three and a half jobs?","Julia: No I’m done. 😂 I canna.","Taryn: Barber. Bootleg cable guy (with a “K”). Construction contractor (Read: Con artist). And street team poster hanger.","Oh, he also sells toothpicks for 50 cents each. One other thing and I’m done.

Fur coats. Gucci bags. Prada slacks. On social media, the law student and onetime student employee in Howard’s financial aid office flaunted his love of high-end fashion on campus, where he allegedly drove a Range Rover, and his glitzy trips abroad. When a pseudonymously written Medium post mentioned Hankerson Jr. in connection with a scheme whereby university officials had allegedly embezzled $1 million in financial aid money, it was all too perfect.","The story claimed that Hankerson Jr. had received thousands in ill-gotten aid. He released a statement to ABC News on Wednesday proclaiming his innocence.","During a sit-down interview with journalist Roland Martin on Friday, Hankerson Jr. and his lawyer, James L. Walker Jr., maintained his innocence once again and offered more details on the situation. (You can watch the interview above.)","They said Hankerson Jr. was a student worker in Howard’s financial aid office from 2011 to 2015. His time there ended with the completion of his undergraduate degree. The two men took credit for the removal of the Medium post, which they said defamed Hankerson Jr.’s character. (The post, written under the name “Veritas 1867,” was suspended sometime on Wednesday.) They also said that Hankerson Jr. was not one of the six employees fired from the financial aid office.","While Hankerson Jr. said he had received at least $200,000 in aid during his undergraduate career, he denied receiving $429,000 ― the amount claimed in the Medium story. Walker added that his client had gotten financial aid — in the form of stipends, scholarships and grants — over the course of seven years, not four as was suggested in the Medium post. Hankerson Jr. also denied driving a Range Rover.","But even before his public defense, Hankerson Jr. had already been convicted in the high court of meme justice and sentenced to hours and hours of beclownment.","In a SoundCloud audio file dug up by one Twitter user, a person the user suggests is Hankerson Jr. raps: “Drop a pic on Instagram / They ain’t liking but they lookin’ … It’s mad niggas out here tryna dress like me.”","Someone even put a scammer-themed playlist on iTunes.","On Wednesday, Howard University President Wayne Frederick confirmed that financial aid officials had indeed misappropriated funds earmarked for low-income students between 2007 and 2016. How much, exactly, he wouldn’t say. Six university employees had been fired, he added, although he did not name them. In an interview with ABC 7, Frederick said the university would not be pressing charges.","Hankerson Jr. did not respond to multiple HuffPost requests for comment sent to his personal email address. HuffPost also reached out to Walker, his lawyer, who on Thursday sent along the same statement given to ABC News.","“Please know that I have done nothing illegal or wrong,” Hankerson Jr. said. “When the truth comes out, it will be confirmed that I followed all rules and protocol with the approval of the, then, financial aid officers in any grants, scholarships or awards given to me as a student who attended class all year round and traveled abroad.”","When asked about Hankerson Jr.’s alleged role in the misappropriation of aid money, a university spokesperson focused more on the student’s having been named in the Medium story. “There has been no authorized disclosure by the University of any information related to Mr. Hankerson Jr., nonetheless we are concerned about this situation,” the spokesperson told HuffPost. “We are taking a close look to see if we can determine the source of information published about him.”","Citing the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, the spokesperson declined to make “any comments about the protected information of Mr. Hankerson Jr. or any other Howard University student.” The university’s office of financial aid and the law school’s media relations contacts did not respond to requests for comment about Hankerson Jr.","But students have coalesced loudly around the issue: calling for the president’s resignation, rallying at the flagpole and staging a sit-in in the administration building — which includes the financial aid and president’s offices.","One student, who also declined to speak to HuffPost, tweeted on Wednesday what appears to be an email exchange with Hankerson Jr. (whose name is underlined in red).","The student asked for continued financial aid. Hankerson Jr., in his capacity as a financial aid employee, allegedly replied saying the university had utilized its financial aid budget for the academic year and couldn’t help the student. The email is dated Feb. 2, 2015.","Howard, like many other historically black colleges and universities, has battled with high-stakes financial problems over the past several years.","A letter written by university trustee Renee Higginbotham-Brooks in 2013 stressed her concern that the school was “in genuine trouble” due to a decrease in federal aid, a lack of “infrastructure for fundraising” and a smaller pool of potential students who could obtain financial aid, meaning more students who opted for cheaper state schools. The financial aid office meanwhile has often delayed or messed up aid packages for students. A 2013 change to the criteria for obtaining a Parent PLUS Loan caused enrollment in HBCUs nationwide to drop significantly. Howard lost about 585 students. And students have long been frustrated with the state of housing at the university, including the cost of it all.","For now, the social media backlash seems to center on Hankerson Jr., the guy with the fashionista posts that now seem to taunt those who struggled for aid.","Aside from the memes, Hankerson Jr.’s personal website and social media presence ― including his YouTube, LinkedIn, Twitter and Instagram accounts ― have been scrubbed from the internet, with a few exceptions.

He blogged for HuffPost in 2016 and was quoted in two stories in which he discussed the burdens of student loan debt.","“For many of my classmates, their families simply do not have the financial resources to pay for college,” he said at a 2015 Howard forum on student loan debt. “What I have witnessed in my role are determined students who try their hardest to find a way through.”","“They sometimes work nearly 40 hours a week with full course loads; their parents take on loan debt that they cannot truly afford to repay; they sometimes get denied for Parents PLUS Loans and find aunts and cousins and grandparents to co-sign,” he continued. “They search high and low for scholarships, they take classes over the summer at cheaper rates so they can graduate on time, they take semesters off, and they come back. And sometimes, when all has failed them, they are left with no option but to give up.”","This story has been updated with Hankerson Jr.’s interview with Roland Martin."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5abd0a3b1f0000270616bd9e.jpeg?cache=23mNF8mWAI&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"CRIME","headline":"Parkland High School Shooter Nikolas Cruz Has Been Receiving Tons Of Fan Mail In Prison","authors":"Alex Lasker, AOL.com","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/parkland-high-school-shooter-nikolas-cruz-has-been-receiving-tons-of-fan-mail-in-prison_us_5abe4cc1e4b055e50acd19e9","short_description":"Like many infamous prisoners before him, accused Florida gunman Nikolas Cruz is receiving torrents of fan mail from people","date":"2018-03-30"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"QUEER VOICES","headline":"A Gay Take On 'The Golden Girls' Has Been Picked Up For Development","authors":"Curtis M.

The show has direct “Golden Girls” ties, too: Screenwriters Stan Zimmerman and James Berg were co-writers on a number of episodes of that classic sitcom, which ran from 1985 through 1992.","Though details of “Silver Foxes” are scarce, the show is believed to have been inspired by “Gen Silent,” an acclaimed 2011 documentary that explored the issues many LGBTQ seniors face in assisted-living facilities. The series will follow two older gay men and one younger man who rescue their friend from a homophobic nursing home and bring him back to their Palm Springs house.","Casting for the show has yet to be announced, but a 2016 reading featured George Takei, Leslie Jordan, Bruce Vilanch and Todd Sherry as the central foursome.","Zimmerman posted a photo of that reading to his Instagram for posterity.","Zimmerman and Berg have stressed that while “Silver Foxes” is “inspired” by “The Golden Girls,” it isn’t intended as a formal reboot. Still, it’s been reported that the pair have written a cameo for original “Golden Girls” star Betty White.","Just as “The Golden Girls” touched on hot-button topics like same-sex marriage and the AIDS crisis, “Silver Foxes” will touch on current issues in America’s political climate, Zimmerman told HuffPost in 2017. The show, he said, “has much to offer the world, especially after ... we had a president tweeting a trans ban in the Army and our own government arguing in court against basic rights for LGBTQ people in housing and employment.”","“Hollywood should give ‘Silver Foxes’ a chance because it’s important to hear the voices of older LGBTQ people, a segment of our community that is often overlooked,” Zimmerman, whose credits also include episodes of “Roseanne” and “Gilmore Girls,” said at the time. “Like ‘The Golden Girls,’ we think audiences of all ages will respond to their wit and wisdom.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5abe71be1e00008e0b7b0349.jpeg?cache=OQrH0DmY95&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"COMEDY","headline":"Sean Penn Rips Steve Bannon: You Can't Age Like That Without Hating People","authors":"Lee Moran","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sean-penn-steve-bannon-conan-obrien_us_5abdddcbe4b0f112dc9b3f18","short_description":"Penn worked with Bannon on his 1991 movie \"The Indian Runner.\"","date":"2018-03-30"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"WOMEN","headline":"Larry Nassar Survivors Feel 'Violated All Over Again' After MSU Surveillance","authors":"Alanna Vagianos","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/larry-nassar-survivors-msu-surveillance_us_5abe749ee4b0f112dc9bff57","short_description":"Monitoring social media accounts during a criminal case is not uncommon, but it's left many of the women feeling revictimized.","date":"2018-03-30"},"articleContent":["Michigan State University paid a public relations company $517,343 to monitor and track social media activity surrounding the recent Larry Nassar sexual abuse case, the Lansing State Journal reported on Wednesday.","Many of the social media accounts the New York-based firm Weber Shandwick monitored included accounts of survivors, their families and notable celebrities, journalists and politicians. The Lansing State Journal included screenshots of Weber Shandwick’s report to MSU that quoted specific survivors’ tweets, retweets and commentary. The PR firm also outlined news articles that created spikes in conversation surrounding the Nassar case.","MSU’s Office of Communication and Brand Strategy had initially been collecting and tracking the information, but handed the majority of the work over to Weber Shandwick in December.","“Michigan State University hired Weber Shandwick in December 2017 to provide crisis communications counsel as well as additional media staffing to handle the high volume of communications tasks related to the Larry Nassar matter,” a spokeswoman for the university told HuffPost. “The relationship ended in early March and we are no long working together.”","Although this type of monitoring is not uncommon in criminal cases, the explosive report garnered intense media attention and prompted many Nassar survivors to criticize the surveillance as invasive and triggering.","Weber Shandwick responded to the criticism in a press release provided to HuffPost.","“The majority of our work involved crisis counsel to address the tragedy. We were not hired to monitor victims’ social media accounts. As with any assignment, we forwarded to our clients traditional media and publicly available social media pertaining to the horrible tragedy at MSU, including statements made online by the victims,” the statement reads. “The victims were and continue to be the most important voices in the conversation.”","Criminal defense attorney Stuart Slotnick, who is not affiliated with the Nassar case, told HuffPost that while MSU’s move may appear to be borderline unethical, it is not unheard of and usually doesn’t violate any laws.","“Monitoring social media accounts is not uncommon in the world of litigation. Although it may appear to be unseemly, when monitoring the accounts of victims of the crime, MSU could have been being proactive in addressing complaints by hearing them directly the source,” he said. “There are no legal implications to monitoring social media accounts, so long as they are public accounts and not private.”","Still, many survivors feel the university unjustly invaded their privacy. Finding out that MSU was surveilling them the entire time they were screaming for justice has made many survivors feel they’re being targeted yet again ― and by the very institution that so horribly failed them in the first place.","“I was absolutely disgusted to learn that MSU was using such an invasive tactic,” former gymnast and Nassar survivor Larissa Boyce told HuffPost in an email. “I felt violated all over again.”","Boyce, who says that Nassar began abusing her when she was 16 years old in 1997 and continued until 2001, told then-MSU gymnastics coach Kathie Klages of the abuse the year it started. Klages, who has since retired, told Boyce she must have misunderstood the medical procedure and sent the teenager back to Nassar.","After everything Boyce has endured at the hands of MSU, she said she’s not surprised by the university’s most recent move.","“Sadly, I’m not surprised, as this is yet another example of how [MSU is] more concerned about protecting their brand than survivors,” she said. “They’ve been saying that they are on our side but this proves once again they are re-victimizing us and trying to find ways to attack our character. Time to start looking at their own house! That money should have been used to check all of their employees computers & social media!”","Rachael Denhollander, the first woman to publicly accuse Nassar of sexual abuse, reacted on Twitter to the surveillance news Wednesday.","“If MSU wanted to know about me and other survivors, they could have just talked to us. We had outstanding offers [to] meet with them,” she wrote.","Nassar served as the team doctor for USA Gymnastics and for several different sports teams on MSU’s campus. Over the course of two decades, he sexually abused over 260 young girls and women under the guise of medical treatment. He recently received three concurrent sentences of 60 years, 40-125 years and 40-175 years in prison for child sexual abuse and child pornography.","Although Nassar will spend the rest of his life in prison, many survivors have called for heads to roll at USA Gymnastics, the U.S. Olympic Committee and specifically MSU, claiming those institutions enabled Nassar’s abuse.","Several of Nassar’s victims (including Boyce) say they reported the abuse to MSU coaches and trainers over the course of two decades, but their accusations were continually disregarded or swept under the rug. At least 14 MSU representatives knew about Nassar’s abuse and failed to report it. Both the Michigan attorneys general’s office and the U.S. Education Department have launched investigations into how the university handled the Nassar abuse allegations.","Attorney John Manly, who represents more than 100 Nassar victims, tweeted his disappointment as well: “Michigan State paid $500,000.00 in January to spy on Nassar survivors and their families on social media. The MSU Board was copied on these reports. Not one Board member had the moral courage to say this is wrong. Stop it. Not one. Shame on MSU. Shame on each and every Trustee.”","Morgan McCaul, a Nassar survivor and current first-year student at MSU, explained to HuffPost how invasive it felt when she found out the university had been tracking her social media all along.","“While MSU tracked our social media cries for accountability and justice, they ignored and enabled yet another predator ― and they did it at an incomprehensible cost,” McCaul said, referring to Nassar’s longtime boss, William Strampel, who was recently arrested on multiple sexual misconduct charges for allegedly sexual harassing and assaulting female MSU students.","McCaul told The State News, MSU’s student newspaper, that she believes this is possibly the worst thing the univeristy has done.\n\n“They’re trying to weaponize our own grief and trauma and self-expression against us, and truly, this might be one of the worst things that I’ve seen them do yet,” she said.\n\nKristen Houser, the chief public affairs officer for the National Sexual Violence Resource Center, told HuffPost that this is a tough situation to unpack, because what MSU did is not uncommon ― but it doesn’t change how it affects survivors.\n\n“It’s totally legal and common to monitor social media and comments on news stories; it’s all out there in the the public purview, and that’s something that any agency in crisis may want to do,” Houser said.\n\n“On the flip side, when victims who have already experienced an institution not responding to them in a helpful way find out that this institution has also been monitoring their social media accounts specifically, it’s easily understandable why that would feel like an intentional invasion of privacy, even though it’s in the public realm,” she continued. “It can leave a person feeling targeted.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5abe8a3e2000007d06eb37c7.jpeg?cache=mxqjXoCUi5&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"BUSINESS","headline":"MyFitnessPal Security Breach Affects 150 Million Users, Under Armour Reports","authors":"Carla Herreria","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/myfitnesspal-security-breach_us_5abd5859e4b0a47437a9a459","short_description":"The company alerted its app users four days after learning of the hack.","date":"2018-03-30"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Trump Has No Idea Why He Gets To Fill So Many Empty Court Seats","authors":"Jennifer Bendery","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-federal-judges-obama-republicans_us_5abd47c4e4b0a47437a98594","short_description":"He should be thanking Mitch McConnell. He thinks Obama just mysteriously left him 100+ court vacancies. 🤦","date":"2018-03-30"},"articleContent":["WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump marveled Thursday at all the federal court vacancies he gets to fill and wondered why President Barack Obama left him so many ― apparently unaware that Senate Republicans blocked Obama’s judicial nominees to those seats for years in hopes that a GOP president would fill them.","“You know, when I got in, we had over 100 federal judges that weren’t appointed,” Trump said at an infrastructure event in Ohio. “I don’t know why Obama left that. It was like a big beautiful present to all of us. Why the hell did he leave that? Maybe he got complacent?”","The whopping 108 court vacancies Trump inherited when he took office was a present ― that’s double the number that Obama inherited when he became president ― but it wasn’t from Obama. It was from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), whose record of blocking Obama’s judicial nominees will go down as his greatest legacy.","Under McConnell’s leadership, Republicans leaned on every procedural rule in the book to stop Obama’s court picks. They refused to recommend judicial nominees to Obama’s White House. They slow-walked committee hearings. If a nominee cleared the committee, Republicans made the person wait three times longer for a Senate confirmation vote than did President George W. Bush’s nominees. Their efforts to deny judicial nominees the ability to even get a vote on the Senate floor ultimately led Democrats to change the rules in order to make it easier to advance nominees.","When Republicans won control of the Senate in the fall of 2014, it got even harder for Obama’s judicial nominees. By the fall of 2015, the GOP was confirming judges at the slowest rate in more than 60 years and had left the federal bench emptier than it had been in decades. By the end of Obama’s presidency, Republicans had driven up the number of judicial emergencies ― when a court is so overburdened it can barely function ― from 12 to 43 in the span of two years.","McConnell, of course, also prevented Obama from filling a Supreme Court seat in early 2016. Trump’s first major achievement as president was confirming Neil Gorsuch to that seat ― the final step in a plan that McConnell had set in motion a year earlier.","This was the strategy all along by McConnell: hold open as many court seats as possible under Obama so a future Republican president could fill them. It worked.","But for now, Trump is just mystified at how he got so lucky.","“We were left a present!” he told the Ohio crowd. “It was like the gift from heaven. We were left judges .... Amazing. It was the gift. Thank you very much, President Obama. We all appreciate it. What happened? How did he do that? How did he do that?”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5abd484b1f0000280616be15.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Once Trampled By Fans, Jesse McCartney Just Wants To Experience Life Now","authors":"Lauren Moraski","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jesse-mccartney-new-music_us_5abbe724e4b06409775ca122","short_description":"The former teen heartthrob, now 30, returns with new music for the first time in four years.","date":"2018-03-30"},"articleContent":["Imagine being 16 years old and getting mowed down by thousands of people at a mall.

There are 8,000 people here and we don’t really know how to get you in,’” McCartney told HuffPost at Build Series.","His security team even had a difficult time navigating through the crowd of screaming fans.","“Immediately they just started going down one by one — all the security guards. … I’m helping them up,” he said. “It was like my first real experience with sort of mania, but I wouldn’t trade it for the world.”","By that point, McCartney had been accustomed to the spotlight, but not quite like this. He entered the music scene at 12 years old as part of the boy band Dream Street. The group disbanded in 2002, and it didn’t take long for McCartney to break out on his own. He released his debut solo album in 2004, featuring the hit “Beautiful Soul.”","Now 30 years old, McCartney is far from a teenager but he’s still a “heartthrob” to many of his fans. Outside Build Series in New York City on Wednesday, people of all ages waited for him to exit the studio, just to say hello or sneak in a selfie or two.","“This group of fans has amazed me time and time again,” he said.","Particularly now.","McCartney’s last studio album, “In Technicolor,” arrived four years ago. Since then, he has done some acting gigs, including a stint on “Young and Hungry” and appearances on “Fear the Walking Dead” and “Major Crimes” ― not a stretch for the singer, who previously starred in “All My Children” and “Summerland.” But he’s stayed largely quiet on the music front as of late.","“I’ve been traveling quite a bit. I’ve been exploring different creative avenues and not necessarily music. … I did a lot of like learning how to cook, learning how to barbecue, learning how to be a grill-master. I’ve been doing music for so long that I’ve never really had a chance to go see the world without having to work,” he said. “And I never got to see people and meet people and experience different cultures like people get to when they’re traveling.”","During that time, McCartney also took part in a songwriters workshop in Nashville, which triggered his interest in writing again. The result is “Better With You,” his first new song in four years, unveiled this month. Reminiscent of the sound of his earlier music, the track is inspired not only by his own life but also by what’s been happening around him.","“It was kind of a crazy time last year. I felt like there was a lot of division among everybody. It was very intense both politically and socially and I just felt like there needed to be a song that would make people feel better and bring people together,” he said. “And I think everyone can kind of relate to knowing or finding somebody that just makes them a better version of themselves.”","He says it’s definitely autobiographical.","“I have a special somebody,” McCartney said, hinting at his longtime girlfriend Katie Peterson. “And I think everybody has a special somebody in their life that they know — just brings the best out of them. Whether that’s your significant other, or your mom or your pet.”","So far, reaction to the single has been really positive, McCartney said.","“I didn’t know what it was going to be like to re-engage after four years. I didn’t know what the reaction was going to be,” he said. “They made it pretty clear immediately that they were there and they were ready for new music.”","And music they will get.","Now an independent artist, McCartney has the luxury of releasing songs on his own timeline. He doesn’t have plans for a full-length album release yet but promises more tracks will come soon.","“I have the best job. I really do,” he said. “It’s just the best gig ever.”","Watch the full Build Series interview with McCartney below."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5abd35052000001311eb3660.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Cameron Diaz Says She's 'Actually Retired,' So There","authors":"Ron Dicker","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cameron-diaz-retired_us_5abdff53e4b0f112dc9b6ef6","short_description":"A former costar previously said Diaz had called it quits, but then said she was joking.","date":"2018-03-30"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"BLACK VOICES","headline":"Megachurch Pastor Accused Of Defrauding People Out Of More Than $1 Million","authors":"Carol Kuruvilla","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kirbyjon-caldwell-accused-of-defrauding-people_us_5abe40fce4b0f112dc9bae2d","short_description":"Many of the investors who trusted Rev.

Van Hook of the Western District of Louisiana said Thursday. The charges against the men, who allegedly conspired with each other, include wire fraud and money laundering.","Van Hook’s office claims Caldwell used his status as pastor of the Houston church to help gain investors’ trust.","The Securities and Exchange Commission is also suing Caldwell and Smith in federal court for allegedly violating financial laws.","Dan Cogdell, an attorney for Caldwell, told HuffPost in a statement that the accusations against the pastor are “simply false.”","Cogdell said his client believed the bonds to be legitimate and had invested a significant amount of his own money into the scheme. He also said Caldwell “never used his status as a Reverend at all regarding the investments.”","The SEC says that between April 2013 and August 2014, Caldwell and Smith allegedly convinced 29 people, many of them “vulnerable and elderly,” to invest more than $1 million in bonds issued by the former Republic of China.","These bonds are not recognized by China’s current government and have no value beyond being collectors’ items. But Smith and Caldwell reportedly promised their investors high rates of return, sometimes three to 15 times the value of the investments.","Smith was responsible for finding the investors, according to the SEC complaint. Caldwell would then instruct them to wire transfer money to an associate or to a company he and his wife controlled in Wyoming.","“Instead of investing the funds, the defendants used them to pay personal loans, credit card balances, mortgages, vehicle purchases and other personal expenses,” Van Hook’s office said.","Throughout 2014, Caldwell and Smith reportedly sent emails and texts to investors promising them they would be paid. The SEC states that these “lulling emails” provided “elaborate” explanations about why the investors had yet to see returns. Caldwell also reportedly used “religious references” to give investors hope that they would be repaid, repeatedly telling them to “remain faithful.”","Many of the investors were allegedly “unsophisticated retirees” who followed Smith’s advice to liquidate their annuities to invest in the scheme. The SEC says none of the investors received any return on their investments, and that the majority never made back their principal investment.","“Although many investors did not understand the investment, they ultimately trusted Smith and took comfort in the fact that a high-profile pastor was offering the investment,” the SEC complaint reads.","Cogdell claimed his client refunded unsatisfied investors with his own money.","Caldwell has been a prominent religious figure in Texas and the U.S. for many years.","Caldwell has led Windsor Village Church since 1982, helping the congregation grow from 25 members to more than 16,000, according to the church’s website.","He also served as a spiritual adviser to President George W. Bush, and officiated the wedding for his daughter Jenna in 2008. Caldwell went on to be one of President Barack Obama’s spiritual advisers, publicly endorsing the candidate in 2008 and reportedly donating to his political campaign.","Before becoming a United Methodist Church pastor, Caldwell was an investment banker and bond broker, The Washington Post reports. He also wrote a book in 1999 called The Gospel of Good Success: A Road Map to Spiritual, Emotional and Financial Wholeness, in which he said God wants Christians to be successful in all aspects of their lives, including their finances.","Don Thomas, media director at The Window Village Church, told HuffPost on Friday evening that Caldwell never advertised the bonds at church events. Thomas said he does not expect Caldwell to take a leave or be fired from the church during the course of the investigation.","“The church community is very supportive and affirming during this time,” Thomas wrote in an email.","A spokesman for the Texas Annual Conference of the UMC told HuffPost on Friday afternoon that Caldwell remained a pastor there.","“The United Methodist Church has high standards for the moral conduct of its clergy, and we recognize the seriousness of the charges against him,” wrote Scott J. Jones, the conference’s bishop. “We will walk through this difficult situation with Rev. Caldwell and the Windsor Village congregation and keep them in our prayers. We have faith that the judicial process will find the truth.”","Caldwell plans to preach at Windsor Village Church this weekend, reports local news outlet KTRK, citing Cogdell.","The attorney said the pastor will surrender to authorities in Louisiana “in the next week or so.” He said he expects Caldwell to be released on bail pending trial.","Caldwell and Smith each face 20 years in prison for the wire fraud charges, and 10 years for the money laundering charges.

She was facing life in prison.","The 2016 attack claimed the lives of 49 people. At the time, it was the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Salman was arrested in January 2017, seven months after the attack, and has been held behind bars ever since.","Salman, 31, cried as she heard the verdict. The first thing she said was “thank you,” her lawyers said.","Salman has maintained that she was completely in the dark about Mateen’s plans, and was herself a victim of his depraved violence inside the home.","The jury began deliberating around 1:46 p.m. on Wednesday and reached its verdict around 9:40 a.m. on Friday. Hours later, Salman walked free.","In comments outside the federal courthouse, Salman’s uncle Abdallah Salman thanked the jury, the judge and Salman’s pro bono team of lawyers.","“We are looking forward to taking my niece and hiring the best therapist for her,” he said. “I don’t know how to make up for the past two years.” He said her son, now 5, has already been notified his mother is coming home to California.","“Her son is the only thing she wants,” he said.","Susan Adieh, Salman’s cousin, expressed deep sympathy for the victims of the Pulse shooting, but said she was grateful that Salman did not become the final victim of the tragedy. “She is innocent,” Adieh said.","Salman’s family said they hoped to have her home in time to color Easter eggs with her son.","In a statement sent to the Orlando Sentinel after the trial, the unnamed foreman of the jury said jurors suspected Salman knew her husband was planning something, even if she didn’t know the date or location.","The foreman — who said his statement spoke only for himself, not the other members of the jury — noted that jurors were not tasked with deciding if Salman knew about Mateen’s desire to commit an attack, but rather if she helped him in some way.","They found she did not.","The trial upended many ingrained assumptions about the massacre. Despite initial speculation based on the location of the shooting ― a gay nightclub ― investigators found nothing to suggest Mateen was motivated by homophobia.","Government lawyers said Pulse was not Mateen’s initial target that night. He first drove to Disney Springs, a hub of shops and restaurants at Disney World, and found security to be tight. He then Googled “downtown orlando nightclubs,” and drove to EVE Orlando, where he also encountered strict security. Finally, he moved on to Pulse.","During the massacre, he called 911 and pledged allegiance to the Islamic State. Investigators who analyzed his phone and computer found he regularly read about terrorism and air strikes in the Middle East, and watched beheading videos.","In contrast, investigators could not find a single social media post or internet search on Salman’s phone to suggest she had any interest in extremism.","Prosecutors proposed to jurors that Salman, who was not radicalized, was motivated by money instead. Mateen bought her a diamond ring in the days before the shooting, which prosecutors posited bought her support of his heinous plan.","It is extraordinarily rare for the federal government to lose a terrorism case, said Mia Bloom, a terrorism expert at Georgia State University.","The government’s case was undone by the fact that its key evidence ― an alleged confession signed by Salman after an 11-hour interrogation ― was contradicted by forensic data, Bloom said.","“Why was there no video or audio of it?” she added. “It was very problematic.”","In a statement, which was handwritten by an FBI agent, Salman said she knew her husband was going to Pulse that night, had seen him looking at Pulse’s website, and had cased the nightclub with him the week before.","Those claims were undercut by evidence presented at trial that Mateen picked the club at random that night, and cell phone data showing Salman had never been near Pulse, contradicting her FBI statement. None of the couple’s electronic devices had ever accessed the club’s website either.","In a statement, Pulse owner Barbara Poma said she respected the criminal justice process, and would trust that the jury made its decision free of bias.","“Those of us directly affected by this tragedy must find peace in our hearts and remember that he was the one who pulled the trigger that night,” she said. “He was the perpetrator, and he should not have one more minute of power over our lives.”","Charles Swift, one of Salman’s lawyers, said that the trial helped clear up misperceptions about Salman that flourished in the press after the massacre.","“A year and a half ago, you believed she dropped him off the Pulse!” he chided a gaggle of reporters. “You believed they scouted Pulse!”","None of that was true, as shown in court, he said.","“We pursued the truth, and the truth was to her benefit,” he said. “The jury, 12 ordinary citizens, were heroes today.”","Linda Moreno, another one of Salman’s lawyers, said Salman was overwhelmed and emotional, and will need time to recover from her 14 months in jail.","“It did not destroy her, but of course it changed her,” she said.","This story has been updated with a statement from the jury foreman.","CORRECTION: Due to an editing error, the headline on a previous version of this story indicated Salman had been found guilty.","Senior reporter Melissa Jeltsen has been covering the terrorism trial from Orlando.

The officers, Paul said, were responding to a call about a man with a gun.","The footage appears to show Salamoni and Lake attempting to subdue Sterling in front of the store. After a brief scuffle, Salamoni can be heard shouting profanities at Sterling. “I’m going to shoot you in your fucking head,” Salamoni appears to yell, before hitting Sterling with a stun gun.","The officers are then seen pinning Sterling to the ground, and shortly afterward, three shots are fired. Sterling, still alive and with a visible wound to his chest, moves his left arm toward his head and face. Moments later, an officer can be heard telling Sterling to “Get on the ground.” Three more shots are fired. As one of the officers sits on the ground, the other can be seen pulling an object from Sterling’s right pocket.","Warning: The videos below are graphic and disturbing to watch.","Paul, the police chief, announced on Friday that Salamoni had been fired over the shooting, and Lake had received a three-day suspension.","“Officer Blane Salamoni has been terminated from the Baton Rouge Police Department as of today,” Paul said.","“We have two officers involved in one incident, two different perspectives, and they perceived the threat differently [and] one officer did not follow tactics or training,” the police chief said of the shooting.","“My finding is based on the actions of the officers,” Paul said. “These actions were not minor deviations from policy as they contributed to the outcome that resulted in the death of another human being ... Officer Howie Lake answered all of the questions that was presented during the hearing. On the advice of his attorney, Officer [Blane] Salamoni chose not to answer any of our questions.”","It’s unclear whether other evidentiary items, including audio recordings and eyewitness statements, will be released.","The release of the footage and the disciplinary actions against both officers come almost two years after Sterling, a father of five, was killed outside of the store.","Cellphone videos of the events surrounding Sterling’s killing went viral on social media in its immediate aftermath and sparked heated protests in Baton Rouge and elsewhere.","Those videos had showed that Lake wrestled Sterling to the ground, and that Salamoni shot him multiple times at close range in the back and chest. But it was unclear from the videos whether Sterling had been a threat. Following the shooting, Salamoni argued that Sterling had reached for a gun during the encounter. Authorities said the officers found a loaded revolver in Sterling’s pocket.","Attorneys for Sterling’s family demanded the release of the police videos last year, when the Justice Department declined to pursue federal civil rights charges against the officers.","Just four days ago, Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry announced that his office, too, would not pursue charges against Lake or Salamoni.","“Both officers acted in a reasonable and justified manner in the shooting death of Mr. Sterling,” the prosecutor argued on Monday, adding that Sterling was shot because he resisted arrest.","With the federal and state investigations concluded, it was up to Paul to decide whether to discipline or fire the officers.","“Policing isn’t easy,” Paul said. “Treat our police officers with the respect that they deserve … Please stop resisting.

The closures affected schools across the state, including in its two largest school districts: Jefferson County Public Schools in Louisville and Fayette County Public Schools in Lexington. More than one-third of all school employees in Lexington called out of work, the Fayette County school district said.","Kentucky’s public pension system is among the worst funded in the nation. Gov. Matt Bevin (R) has prioritized reforming it since he was elected in 2015, and Republicans have taken up the issue since gaining control of both houses of the state legislature in 2016.","Teachers and public employees have fought the proposed changes, which have included transitioning new hires into a “hybrid” system that more closely resembles a 401(k). They argue that such changes would lead to steep cuts to their retirement systems and could violate their contracts with the state.","Educators have spent weeks protesting the proposed pension plans, and appeared to have derailed any potential reform earlier this week as Kentucky’s 2018 legislative session drew to a close.","But on Thursday afternoon, Republicans tucked many of their proposed changes into a piece of legislation relating to public sewage. And after mere hours of debate, both state legislative chambers approved the bill in late-night votes, with the state Senate voting around 10 p.m. to send the bill to Bevin’s desk.","The 291-page bill dropped some reform proposals that had drawn the most opposition, such as cuts to annual cost-of-living raises for teachers and a Bevin-backed provision that would have increased the amount teachers have to pay into their health insurance funds.","Still, it included major changes to the system. If the bill becomes law, for example, it will take longer for new teachers to gain eligibility for retirement benefits. And the bill would end a contractual obligation that prohibits lawmakers from changing pension plans or reducing retirement benefits for any teacher already under contract, according to the Lexington Herald-Leader.","Bevin is expected to sign the bill into law, and praised its passage. He tweeted that “49 members of the Kentucky House and 22 members of the Kentucky Senate voted not to keep kicking the pension problem down the road.”","The potential financial impact on Kentucky’s pension system is unclear, as lawmakers suspended legislative rules requiring an actuarial analysis of the bill ahead of the vote.","But Kentucky teachers, who have stressed throughout protests that they are not eligible for Social Security to help fund their retirement, say they are well aware of how changes to the pension system will affect them.","“Our pension is our only fallback,” said Katy Smalley, who teaches first and second grade in Bullitt County, where schools remained open Friday. “I don’t get Social Security. So taking anything from that is changing the way I have to plan for retirement. It’s huge.”","Educators also criticized the rushed and opaque process used to pass the bill.","“They had a 291-page bill that was still warm from the copier, and that they had not read. And they were given it to vote on,” said Anita Davis, a retired teacher who was among those protesting at the state Capitol building in Frankfort on Thursday. “Even if it was the best bill in the world, the way it came about [would make] everybody very suspicious. Put that on top of the rhetoric that has been stirred up, and it has poisoned the well for so many teachers in terms of having trust for the governor and so many representatives and senators.”","Students also joined the protests, even in some districts where schools didn’t close.","The Kentucky Education Association called the legislative process “shameful.” Chris Brady, a member of the Jefferson County Public Schools Board of Education, tweeted that the lawmakers who had voted in favor of the bill had “voted not to be re-elected.”","Kentucky Attorney General Andy Beshear announced Friday that he planned to sue over the legislation, which he said violates the state constitution.","“Last night we saw government at its worst,” Beshear said in a video posted on Facebook. “Last night, the House and Senate ... broke their word, but I am going to keep mine.”","“We will take this to court,” Beshear said.","Kentucky teachers are the latest to stage walkouts or threaten strikes over changes to their pensions and other benefits. In February and early March, West Virginia teachers went on strike after years of tax cuts left the state without money to grant them raises and caused deep cuts to state education programs. Teachers in Oklahoma, meanwhile, have said they plan to strike next week over similar problems, and Arizona teachers could soon follow.","It’s unclear whether the protests will lead to extended closures in Kentucky, especially since many of the districts that were shut down Friday are approaching spring break. But with a state budget proposal that includes cuts to education funding still looming, the closures are at least a hint that the pension reform bill could turn into a breaking point for Kentucky’s teachers.","“I have never seen this type of anger and pushback from teachers,” said Davis, the retired teacher. “They are tired of this, of public workers being demonized. ... People think it’s about money and a pension, but it’s a bigger thing than that.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5abe4d801e00003b137b0303.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Jim Carrey's Submission For Donald Trump's Official Portrait Cannot Be Unseen","authors":"Lee Moran","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jim-carrey-donald-trump-portrait_us_5abdedf0e4b0a47437aa0ef4","short_description":"The actor titled the portrait: \"You Scream.

But when there’s nary a single nook or cranny of the entire country that’s not absolutely stunning, we figured it would be worth it to venture beyond our familiar Italian horizons (yep, even beyond Cinque Terre and Positano). So here are some of Italy’s lesser known towns and tiny hamlets that you probably haven’t heard of before but are so worth the trip.","1. CEFALÙ","Region: Sicily","That beach vacation you’ve been dreaming of? Plan it in this picturesque Sicilian port town. The city abounds with culture and history and is also home to some of the island’s most serene beaches. The Duomo di Cefalù, for one, is an Arab-Norman masterpiece with one of Sicily’s oldest mosaics. But if it’s proximity to the water you’re after, nothing beats a leisurely stroll down the lungomare, the seafront promenade, followed by a dip in the warm waters.","Where to Stay: The Ai Mulini Resort’s peaceful and lush surroundings, on-site Sicilian restaurant and pool are a must for some serious R&R.","2. ISOLA SAN GIULIO AND ORTA SAN GIULIO","Region: Piedmont","The tiny, magical island on Lago d’Orta is about a quarter mile (or a 20-minute ferry) from the lake town of Orta San Giulio. Both are so small, they’re mostly pedestrian only, which has its way of turning a visit here into a romantic throwback the likes of which Friedrich Nietzsche, Honoré de Balzac and Robert Browning all enjoyed. Unlike Lake Como, the international tourists haven’t really been tipped off to this sparkling body of water yet, making it a particularly tranquil getaway.","Where to Stay: Built where a monastery once stood, Hotel San Rocco maintains those baroque-yet-updated vibes all while overlooking the shores of the Lake Orta (from the pool if you choose, to boot).","3. BURANO","Region: Venice","No, that’s not Disney World; it’s the rainbow-colored island town about 40 minutes from Venice on the same lagoon. It’s world-renowned for its lace-making—there’s even a lace museum — and glassblowing (the island of Murano, aka Murano glass, is nearby), which means finding all those little gifts you need to bring home can probably be done here in one fell swoop. Beyond being a DIY-er’s dream vacay, Burano is also a seafood haven, so bring an appetite. (The local risotto de gò is a must.)","Where to Stay: Since the island is so small, you’re better off staying somewhere like the Liassidi Palace Hotel in Venice, about an hour ferry ride from Burano.","4. ALBEROBELLO","Region: Puglia","This may look like one small, adorable corner of a Hobbit town, but Alberobello is actually composed of 1,500 of these traditional trulli, aka white cone-shaped houses made of limestone. So yeah, no surprise here that Alberobello is deemed a Unesco World Heritage Site. While the town can dip into tourist trap territory, perusing the one-of-kind locale for a day or so is truly a unique, memorable experience.","Where to stay: Trulli Holiday Resort (because, duh, you have to stay in a trullo, of course).","5. CASTELMEZZANO AND PIETRAPERTOSA","Region: Potenza","The best way to get from one of these mountaintop towns to the other? By zip line, of course. The Volo dell’Angelo is one of the longest and highest zip lines in the world. While thrill seekers, mountain climbers and hikers are certainly drawn to these Dolomite-cradled villages, a stopover at these twin towns is so worth the elevation — if not for the scenic selfie alone.","Where to Stay: The best option is to stay right outside town, like at the family-owned Grotta dell’Eremita, just a couple miles from Castelmezzano.","6. BERGAMO","Region: Lombardy","The northern city sits right between the sublime Alps and the Po River Valley, making for a distinctly gorgeous 360-degree backdrop. But the dual-nature of Bergamo doesn’t end there. The city is essentially made of two parts: Città Alta (Upper City), which is built into cliffs and surrounded by its 16th-century Venetian walls, and Città Bassa (Lower City), the modern center. While you should take your time exploring both areas (get between the two via cable car), an excursion to Serio Falls, Italy’s highest waterfalls, is definitely worth the day trip (and you might recognize them from Call Me By Your Name).","Where to stay: After hopping between two cities, you’ll want to indulge in the luxe accommodations of the five-star The Relais San Lorenzo. Trust us.","7. LUCCA","Region: Tuscany","The Renaissance-era walled city is just about an hour away from Florence by train, making it perfect for a day trip. But with its rich history (um, remember learning about the First Triumvirate with Julius Caesar, Pompey and Crassus? It formed in Lucca), scenic setting and delicious Tuscan food, Lucca is well worth a longer stay. We also have to recommend renting bicycles to spend an afternoon riding along the wall.","Where to Stay: If you’ve always wanted to stay in an old Tuscan mansion, Hotel Fabbrica di San Martino should be right up your alley. And for all the oenophiles out there, its wines are organic and biodynamic certified. Under the Tuscan sun, here we come.","Related:","The 5 Best (and Most Affordable) Places to Travel in April\nUm, Can Every Airline Follow What Air New Zealand Is Doing to Make It Easier to Fly with an Infant?\nThese Are the Most Affordable Times to Visit the World’s Most Expensive Destinations\nPack Your Bags: This Cruise Will Take You to All 7 Continents in 4 Months\n5 Desert Resorts That Feel Straight Out of ‘Westworld’"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5abd34f91f00001a0016bdf3.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"BLACK VOICES","headline":"Rapper Fabolous Accused Of Assaulting Girlfriend Emily B","authors":"David Moye","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fabolous-rapper-assault-emily-b_us_5abe68bde4b055e50acd49b1","short_description":"He allegedly told his longtime girlfriend he wanted to hit her in the head with a baseball bat.","date":"2018-03-30"},"articleContent":["Rapper Fabolous is facing charges of third-degree aggravated assault and third-degree terroristic threats after he allegedly attacked his longtime girlfriend Emily Bustamante (aka Emily B).","Fabolous, whose real name is John Jackson, turned himself in to the Englewood Police Department in New Jersey Wednesday evening and was booked on two felonies.","The 40-year-old didn’t spend time in jail, but was cited for the charges and given a notice for his court appearance, according to TMZ.","The charges stem from an alleged incident on March 7, when Jackson was in Los Angeles on a business trip.

The news prompted outrage from conservatives who claim Rice misled the public about the 2012 attacks on the American consulate in Benghazi, Libya. Rice, who was serving as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations at the time, initially attributed the attacks on the U.S. mission to an anti-Muslim YouTube video. Former President Barack Obama named her his national security adviser in 2013.","The National Center for Public Policy Research, a right-wing think tank, lambasted Netflix’s move in a press release, calling Rice an “Obama Crony” and urging the company’s investors to oppose her addition.","“This Obama Administration influence only serves to enforce corporate America’s leftward tilt,” said Justin Danhof, director of the group’s Free Enterprise Project, in the statement.","Conservative media outlets were quick to criticize the announcement.","“Noted Story Teller [sic] Susan Rice Named To Netflix Board,” read a headline on the conservative website Daily Caller.","This isn’t the first time that Netflix has provoked right-wing consternation. The streaming service is reportedly negotiating a content deal with Obama, which conservatives see as evidence of the service’s left-leaning slant.","“Right now, 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi is available on Netflix,” wrote Philip Wegmann in an op-ed criticizing the negotiations for the conservative Washington Examiner. “Not available on that streaming site? The YouTube video the Obama administration falsely blamed for inciting the 2012 terrorist attack on our embassy in Libya…”","Rice’s appointment has prompted some conservatives on social media to say they are canceling their Netflix subscriptions, with the #BoycottNetflix hashtag gaining steam this week.","Ralph Zazula, a Massachusetts-based conservative political consultant is participating in the boycott.","″[Rice] certainly seems to be somebody that, if you’re a conservative, would not have the best interests of the country at heart,” Zazula told HuffPost.","Zazula, 64, added he also doesn’t buy French wines “because of the way Jews are treated in France,” stopped following his beloved Boston Celtics because NBA players have become “hoodlums” who all “seem to be beating up their girlfriends” and usually borrows DVDs to avoid supporting a supposedly liberal Hollywood studio.","“The world, by and large, is a liberal bastion,” Zazula said.","Chris McCoy, a civil litigation attorney in Lakewood, Colorado, and another participant in the boycott, expressed similar sentiments to HuffPost. McCoy says he has previously stopped eating at McDonald’s, because a franchise in Linwood, California, flipped the iconic “M” to a “W” in honor of International Women’s Day. He also cancelled his subscription to the music-streaming service Spotify after it banned white supremacist bands.","McCoy, 46, says he isn’t offended by International Women’s Day and opposes white supremacy, but he is put off by what he perceives as a larger trend of companies exhibiting a liberal bent.","Media companies, McCoy added, “don’t care about the third of the country that are Trump supporters.

Mary Fallin (R), would quell the statewide walkout that educators had set for April 2 to demand more money for schools. But not even a day after the state Senate approved the first tax increase package in years, legislators in the state House voted to undo one of its main provisions, a tax on hotel and motel stays.","After applauding legislators for approving the funding bill, the state’s leading teachers union, the Oklahoma Education Association, renewed its call late Thursday for teachers around the state to stay out of school and descend on the Capitol in Oklahoma City on Monday.","“Yesterday, the Legislature passed a historic education funding increase,” the union said Thursday in a Facebook post. “Today, they started dismantling it by cutting millions out of the plan. Now they’re gone for the weekend. Oklahoma: we’ll see you at 9 a.m. April 2 at the Capitol.”","Oklahoma is one of a wave of red states now facing a teacher revolt after years of anemic funding for education.","Over the past decade, Oklahoma carried out a series of tax cuts that, combined with falling energy prices, have left the oil- and gas-rich state with little money to steer toward teachers or textbooks. It’s more or less the same story that played out in West Virginia, where tax cuts forced educators to forego raises while their health care costs increased. Teachers there walked off the job for nine days in February and March, prompting the state legislature to fund pay increases for public employees.","The historic and successful strike in West Virginia has inspired a burgeoning uprising among austerity-weary teachers around the country. In addition to Oklahoma, Arizona could soon face a strike by teachers, who are demanding the state boost pay by 20 percent and return to pre-recession funding levels for education. (Meanwhile, teachers in Kentucky shut down public schools in 25 counties on Friday to protest proposed cuts to the state pension plan.)","Teachers in West Virginia, Oklahoma and Arizona are all among the lowest-paid in the country, with schools facing growing teacher shortages. Republicans control the statehouse and governor’s office in all three states.","“After ten long years in a lot of these conservative states, the chicken is finally coming home to roost,” said Lily Eskelsen Garcia, president of the National Education Association, the 3-million member union with which the Oklahoma Education Association is affiliated. “They’ve given tax breaks to big corporations, defunded public schools, and said, ‘What could go wrong?’”","After Oklahoma legislators passed the tax hike, it seemed the walkout could turn instead into a one-day rally on Monday. Now nobody knows for sure what next week will bring. The mixed actions by Oklahoma’s legislature could lead to a situation where some school districts close only for Monday or not at all, while others engage in a work stoppage for days. Many Oklahoma teachers on Facebook have called for keeping schools shut down until all their demands are met.","To a certain degree, their walkout will require the cooperation of their largely sympathetic superintendents, who decide whether schools are formally open or closed. If schools are open and teachers refuse to return to work, the state could consider it an illegal strike. Several districts announced Friday that their schools would not be open on Monday.","Beth Wallis, an assistant band director who teaches in a Tulsa suburb, said teachers in her district voted unanimously to stay off the job beyond Monday. Although the legislation passed this week includes average pay raises of $6,100, Wallis said the lack of state funding guaranteed in the bill could leave local districts on the hook to pay for them. She also said securing teacher pay raises is secondary to increasing general school funding.","“The school funding in the bill is laughably small,” Wallis said. “It’s not enough to buy every kid in my district a single textbook. We have buildings that are falling apart and textbooks that need to be taped together.”","Like most states, Oklahoma cut school funding in the wake of the Great Recession. But it also pursued tax cuts during the economic recovery that followed, dropping income taxes and reducing the gross production tax on oil and gas companies. With little money to devote to schools, Oklahoma has led the nation over the past decade in cuts to its education formula funding, which is the main well of state money for individual districts.","“They sort of maximized the damage that the recession did to their schools and other public services, and as the economy improved, they kept cutting taxes,” Michael Leachman, an analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, recently told HuffPost. “You’re just digging your hole even deeper.”","With less funding, many cash-strapped schools have gone to four-day weeks, while certifying a growing number of emergency teachers to fill vacant jobs. Such teachers don’t meet the state’s normal minimum requirements to teach in public school. The union says the state will have to increase salaries and school funding significantly if it wants to stop losing teachers to Arkansas and other nearby states that pay better.","Reversing course will not be easy. Approving tax hikes in Oklahoma is extraordinarily difficult, requiring a three-fourths supermajority in both chambers. Legislators were barely able to approve the tax package that has already foundered. Legislators had only hours to digest that bill before it was passed, and many apparently did not have time to read it. One state representative argued that the bill had a $75 million hole in it before taking the repeal of the hotel and motel tax into account.","“The more the bill has gotten to sit,” Wallis said, “the more people have gotten to read it and find problems with it.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5abe983e1f0000270616bf80.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"WOMEN","headline":"The 20 Funniest Tweets From Women This Week","authors":"Hollis Miller","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-20-funniest-tweets-from-women-this-week_us_5abe36e7e4b055e50acd048e","short_description":"\"'Did I put deodorant on?' -- Me six times a day\"","date":"2018-03-30"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Thursday's Morning Email: The Trump Administration's Wobbly Reasons For Shaking Up The Census","authors":"Ariel Edwards-Levy","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/thursdays-morning-email-the-trump-administrations-wobbly-reasons-for-shaking-up-the-census_us_5abcc596e4b03e2a5c79acf6","short_description":"Experts are skpetical.","date":"2018-03-29"},"articleContent":["TOP STORIES","(And want to get The Morning Email each weekday?

Unfortunately, they say, it isn’t nearly enough.","Congress set aside $380 million that will be divvied up among states to shore up election security, including new software, cybersecurity staff and other protections for state registration databases and aging voting equipment. But while the funding is certainly welcomed by local election officials, many of them warn it falls far short of what they need to deal with the potential security challenges of the midterm elections in November.","It’s only “a drop in the bucket of what is really needed,” said Jeff Greenburg, the director of elections in Mercer County, Pennsylvania.","Pennsylvania is one of 41 states where some counties and cities use election equipment that is more than a decade old, according to the New York University School of Law’s Brennan Center for Justice. Older machines are more likely to malfunction or break down on Election Day, causing long lines and potentially dissuading some people from casting their ballots. Some older machines also are susceptible to wireless malware attacks, even if they are not directly connected to the internet, or have removable memory devices a hacker might manipulate.","Pennsylvania is also one of 13 states where some counties use voting machines that lack a paper record. Paper records are essential to having a secure election, said Larry Norden, the deputy director of the Brennan Center’s democracy program. They can ensure an accurate audit if electronic records of vote tallies are compromised.","During the 2016 presidential election, Russian hackers targeted election systems in Pennsylvania and 20 other states, according to U.S. intelligence officials. Those officials fear that, during the 2018 midterms, hackers may target state voter registration databases, county websites and official social media accounts to spread misinformation and sow doubt in the U.S. election system.","In February, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, directed all counties that are planning to update aging election equipment to buy machines that create a paper trail. However, the directive from Wolf, aimed at machines used by 83 percent of the state’s voters, did not come with funding attached, placing the financial burden on federal or local budgets.","It could cost as much as $79 million to replace paperless machines in Pennsylvania, the Brennan Center estimates. With the Trump-signed spending bill, the state is only expected to receive $13.5 million, covering just 17 percent of the estimated costs. Barring a new proposal at the state level, counties would have to foot the rest of the bill.","“If they want to make any real dent in the cost to replace an election system,” Greenburg said, “this is woefully insufficient.”","His county of 72,000 mostly middle-class registered voters in western Pennsylvania uses paperless voting machines, which officials there purchased in 2006. Replacing its current voting machines would cost between $750,000 and $2.5 million, depending on the type of equipment — a hefty bill for a county like his, Greenburg said.","‘It’s Killing Us’","Kim McKiernan, the registrar of voters in Rappahannock County, Virginia, knows all too well the burden of replacing election equipment in a very small county without state and federal support.","With just two months left in the 2017 gubernatorial race, Virginia’s Board of Elections in September ordered all counties that use touchscreen voting machines to replace them with paper ballots and optical scanners before Election Day. The state provided no financial assistance.","Rappahannock County was one of the 22 local jurisdictions in the state that used a paperless voting system. The small community with 5,600 registered voters, nestled in the Blue Ridge Mountains, quickly set aside $53,000 to purchase eight new machines, calibrate the equipment and train poll workers.","McKiernan and her assistant — the only two election officials in the county — pulled off the quick transition, but it was a struggle.","“It’s killing us,” she said. “Mentally and physically, it’s killing us.”","In California, Debbie Bautista, Tuolumne County’s clerk and auditor-controller, is worried her 13-year-old voting machines won’t last much longer. The ones that still do work often require repairs.","It would cost about $200,000 for the small county to update its voting equipment, Bautista said. But the county, which has 32,000 mostly lower-income registered voters, seems unwilling to make that investment, she said, preferring instead to spend money on a new jail and juvenile center.","“We don’t have the money,” she said. “Even though people believe elections are important, they have a hard time justifying the money to run them.”","Bautista is hopeful some funds may trickle down from the state level in the coming months. In his budget, Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown allocated $134 million to help pay for new voting equipment — about half of what counties need statewide. The state Legislature has until June to reach a budget agreement.","“There’s just no finish line in this race,” said Neal Kelley, the registrar of voters for Orange County, California.","With the investment from the state, Kelley said his county of 1.6 million registered voters may get new equipment in 2019. Though it is wealthy, the county has been using the same 11,000 voting machines since 2004.","Finally Getting Support","Joe Gloria, the registrar of voters for Clark County, Nevada, started seeing some of his voting machines break down around five years ago. If the problems continued, he feared, the public might lose confidence in statewide elections.","So, in 2015, he began lobbying the state to help fund updated election equipment. His county, the largest in the state, encompasses Las Vegas and has more than one million registered voters.","Soon, election officials from all 17 counties in Nevada joined the fight, and in 2017 the state enacted a law setting aside $8 million to update election equipment ahead of the June 2018 primaries.","“Not every county has the resources that we do,” Gloria said. “And I only got a small portion of it.”","Clark County received $4.5 million in a state grant. New election equipment, including 5,000 new voting machines, would cost an additional $12.5 million, for a total of $17 million.","Douglas County, which hugs the southeastern shore of Lake Tahoe, received $250,000 in grant funding from Nevada, which paid for nearly half of the county’s 147 new voting machines. The new machines, which will replace units that have been in service since 2004, produce a secure paper trail.","The state grant “means a lot,” said Kathy Lewis, the clerk-treasurer, even if the county of 37,000 registered voters is one of the more affluent counties in Nevada. It means even more, she said, to the many rural counties who may not have been able to afford upgrades. Esmeralda County, the smallest county in Nevada, has just 600 registered voters.","“Elections aren’t in a vacuum,” she said. “We have some very small counties. If they fail, the whole state fails. It’s something we all have to work together to make sure the integrity is there.”","States such as Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota and Utah also enacted legislation in 2017 that allocated money for new election equipment.","Norden, at the Brennan Center, recently lauded the Trump-signed spending bill as an “important down payment,” but said it provided “only a fraction of the necessary funds” for states. The reality is that in a U.S. election system with more than 10,000 separate jurisdictions, local election officials are working on limited funding to make sure their polls are secure.","“Just because a county might be small, it doesn’t mean they don’t matter,” he said in an interview. “When the election system in this country is so decentralized, you’re only as strong as your weakest link.”","Stateline home page","Sign up for exclusive state policy reporting and research"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5abd08e62000001a00eb360e.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Hilary Swank And Brother Goof On Wine Tasters In Hilarious Prank","authors":"Ron Dicker","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hilary-swank-and-brother-goof-on-wine-servers-in-most-hilarious-way_us_5abcf69ae4b06409775e0158","short_description":"That's a vintage stunt.","date":"2018-03-29"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Disney, Pixar To Release A Short About A Li'l Dumpling, And It Sounds Darling","authors":"Kimberly Yam","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/disney-pixar-to-release-a-short-about-a-lil-dumpling-and-it-seems-so-precious_us_5abd2172e4b03e2a5c7a70d2","short_description":"This is also the first original Pixar short to be directed by a woman.","date":"2018-03-29"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Oklahoma Approves Tax Hike To Avert Teachers' Strike","authors":"","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/oklahoma-teachers-strike_us_5abceb0ae4b06409775dea9c","short_description":"Oklahoma’s teachers rank among the worst paid in the United States.","date":"2018-03-29"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"QUEER VOICES","headline":"Washington Becomes Latest State To Ban Gay 'Conversion Therapy'","authors":"Sara Boboltz","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/washington-latest-state-to-ban-gay-conversion-therapy_us_5abcf0d3e4b06409775df9eb","short_description":"The new law protects anyone under 18 from the discredited practice.","date":"2018-03-29"},"articleContent":["Washington Gov.

She returned on Thursday and was removed by a U.S. marshal.","Salman, the 31-year-old widow of Pulse gunman Omar Mateen, is charged with aiding and abetting the attack and obstructing justice for allegedly lying to the FBI. She has pleaded not guilty, and maintains she was in the dark about her husband’s plans. Her lawyers say she was another of his victims, not his co-conspirator. The jury is currently deliberating.","After closing arguments on Wednesday, Salman’s family stood outside the federal courthouse to address the media. A reporter asked what Salman will do if she is found not guilty.","“She will return to California to be with her son,” replied Susan Clary, the family spokesperson. Referring to Salman’s son, the spokesperson added: “He was asking if she was going to be home to color Easter eggs. I’m not sure whether that’s quite possible ― we can be hopeful about that.”","Loomer, a conspiracy theorist who was banned from Uber and Lyft in 2017 after she went on an virulent tirade about Muslim drivers, was among the gaggle of reporters.","“You said her son wants to color Easter eggs ― but isn’t Noor Salman Muslim? Why is she celebrating Easter?” Loomer asked.","“We believe in all religions,” Salman’s cousin, Susan Adieh, said.","Loomer continued pushing. “Do most Muslims color Easter eggs?” she asked.","“I’m a Muslim and my kids, they color Easter eggs,” Adieh replied.","As the family walked across the street and into the parking lot, Loomer followed, recording with her phone. She repeatedly asked them if jihad means an act of Islamic terrorism. Clary, the family spokesperson, said they weren’t making any more comments.","“She stuck her phone in their faces,” Clary said of Loomer.","An email from the court later in the day said a reporter had lost their media credentials and was banned from the courthouse after engaging “in highly inappropriate behavior with the Defendant’s family members outside the courthouse.”","Loomer, who previously worked for conservative activist James O’Keefe’s Project Veritas, is best known for interrupting a New York production of Shakespeare’s “Julius Caesar” last year that featured a President Donald Trump-like character who was assassinated. Loomer has a documented history of preaching anti-Muslim hate speech. Just last year, Loomer, who calls herself a “proud Islamophobe,” photographed random hijab-wearing women in New York and tweeted that Muslims were “out in full force”","She did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","In tweets about the trial, Loomer called Salman an “ISIS widow” and a “Real Housewife of ISIS.”","There is zero evidence that Salman was radicalized, a fact not disputed by prosecutors. Investigators who scoured through her internet history, phone and social media accounts found nothing to suggest she shared her husband’s extremist views.","Clary said Salman’s family was shaken by Loomer’s provocation, and canceled a planned interview with the BBC Thursday morning.","“There’s enough pressure already to have a loved one charged in federal court,” Clary said. “On top of that, many people in this community think that because Noor was married to a terrorist that she is a terrorist, and they’ve spent the last month in Orlando trying to show people that she had nothing to do with it.”","Many of Salman’s supporters worry that her prosecution is rooted in “gendered Islamophobia and patriarchy.” On the last day of trial testimony, more than 80 domestic violence and civil rights groups released a statement, asking for the charges to be dropped.","“She is being prosecuted under the guise of guilt by association as a Muslim woman married to a Muslim man who committed mass violence,” they wrote.","If convicted, Salman faces up to life in prison.","Rowaida Abdelaziz contributed reporting."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5abd18cb1f0000280616bdcb.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Huge Debate Blows Up Over Which 'Friends' Character Would Have Voted For Trump","authors":"Lee Moran","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/friends-character-donald-trump_us_5abcd730e4b06409775daa96","short_description":"\"I can't believe some of these people saying Ross.

How can I use my platform to help people who are so often ignored be seen and heard?”","That question led Wilkinson to The Bowery Mission where, with the director’s blessing, she proposed having visual artists paint or draw portraits of homeless men and women who passed through the shelter.","“I ended up sharing my idea with a room full of people who were experiencing homelessness, and had just come for a warm meal,” she said. “I was overwhelmed by the response; so many people wanted to share their story.”","Since launching the Face New York project, 20 artists from all over the world have completed 30 portraits. At exhibition openings ― there have been a handful since 2015 ― the subjects of the portraits are usually taken aback by the work.","“I remember this man Milo saying he never thought he’d have a portrait done of him because ‘portraits are for important people,’” Wilkinson said. “It made me think: Who are we memorializing? Who are we seeing in museums and art galleries? And who are we forgetting or ignoring?”","Wilkinson’s mixed-media project is especially vital given the state of homelessness in the U.S. The nation’s homeless population rose in 2017 for the first time since 2010, in large part because of a surge in homelessness on the West Coast in Los Angeles and Silicon Valley.","On any given night in 2017, almost 554,000 people were experiencing homelessness, according to a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development report.","“Face New York” compels viewers to hold the gaze of some of them, and it gives homeless men and women a much-needed opportunity to control the narrative about their lives.","“We’re fed a limited narrative about how people end up homeless, which leads us to ignore or dehumanize people,” Wilkinson said. “That absolves us of any responsibility around this issue. I hope this project leaves people connected to each other’s humanity.”","Scroll down to read some of the stories, and head to The Bowery Project to make a donation toward hot meals, emergency shelter, medical care and life-transforming programs for the homeless."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5abbe4382000007d06eb349c.jpeg?cache=H6LauaKSjd&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Donald Trump Jr. Gets In A Snit Over Accurate BBC Headline About Ronny Jackson","authors":"David Moye","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-jr-bbc-tweet-ronny-jackson_us_5abd2678e4b06409775e561b","short_description":"He can't handle the truth.","date":"2018-03-29"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"QUEER VOICES","headline":"Two Generations Of Queer Women Reflect On Life, Love And Feminism","authors":"Curtis M.

Other activists have advice for how they can get it done.","date":"2018-03-29"},"articleContent":["The message at the March for Our Lives rally in Washington this weekend was clear: Gun violence isn’t just a problem of mass shootings like the one at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, last month. Nor is it isolated to the bloodshed that tears through cities on a daily basis, or to other routine shootings often tied to mental health, domestic violence or police intervention.","Gun violence is an all of the above issue.","As speakers took the stage on Saturday ― none of them above the age of 19 ― they offered differing perspectives on the many ways guns affect individuals and communities alike.","This diversity shouldn’t have come as a shock to anyone following the Stoneman Douglas students as they prepared for the event. In the lead-up to the rally, they spoke out about their own privilege and the need to broaden their scope beyond the mass shootings that rarely, but explosively, strike affluent communities like theirs. They met with students from Chicago and Washington to discuss what gun violence looks like to them, and how best to confront it.","The lineup of speakers seemed like proof the Parkland students weren’t just talking the talk. They had worked to make their movement genuinely inclusive, both in terms of race and socioeconomic class, and in its embodiment of the varied experiences of gun violence around the nation.","But now comes the hard part for the March for Our Lives movement. As it evolves beyond activism and into more concrete advocacy, the students face the challenge of crafting an agenda that continues to embrace inclusivity while working toward solutions to tackle gun violence in all of its forms.","“Gun violence is such a local issue,” said Paul John, leader of the New York City chapter of Million Hoodies, a racial justice group. “Whereas some communities may have more of an issue with domestic violence, certain suburbs may have been impacted my mass shootings, others by suicide.”","Each of those problems requires a different set of tools to address. When it comes to urban gun violence in particular, which accounts for a disproportionate share of overall shootings, it can be a challenge to get people outside the affected communities to understand how pervasive and deeply intertwined the issue is with other structural inequities that have long plagued inner-city neighborhoods, John said.","“It’s going to be important for the young Parkland students to realize how complex gun violence really is and take steps toward being more informed as to how gun violence affects communities around the country,” he said.","The March For Our Lives campaign has already identified a number of policy objectives, including universal background checks for gun purchases and a ban on assault weapons like the AR-15 style rifle used in Parkland. But to those who have been actively involved in community-based gun violence prevention efforts, prescriptions like these are far from a catch-all.","“We all agree gun laws are a good start, but we really need to look more comprehensively at what it is that causes people to act out violently,” said Miguel Dominguez, director of youth programs at Community Coalition, a social justice nonprofit in Los Angeles.","Lamar Johnson, the violence prevention coordinator for BRAVE (Bold Resistance Against Violence Everywhere), based out of St. Sabina Parish in Chicago, sees it similarly.","“We have legislation and we have tough gun laws, but what we don’t have is investment in our community,” he said.","A decadeslong lack of investment in neighborhoods in Chicago and Los Angeles has helped feed a “culture of violence,” said Johnson. With little funding for schools, businesses and social services, many local kids suffer from a lack of opportunity, which serves as a pipeline into the sorts of criminal activity that often leads to shootings.","Both Community Coalition and BRAVE take a holistic approach to violence prevention, providing outreach to youth to give them the skills and resources they need to resist the traps that can lead them down these roads in the first place.","Youth leaders from both organizations spoke on Saturday to offer a window into the realities they face. Edna Chavez, a 17-year-old from Los Angeles, recalled learning how to “duck from bullets” before she could read. Trevon Bosley, a 19-year-old from Chicago, reminded the crowd that “everyday shootings are everyday problems.” Chavez and Bosley both lost brothers to gun violence.","Johnson said he was happy to see those voices represented at the March for Our Lives, but he noted that initiatives like BRAVE need more than just a larger stage from which to tell their stories.","“People figure they gave us a platform to speak so they did their due diligence, which is like a slap to the face, because giving me a microphone means nothing if you’re not going to give me the funding and the resources for my youth program and violence prevention programs,” said Johnson. “We still have to go back into this crime element we live in every day.”","St. Sabina has seen an uptick in calls from interested donors since Bosley’s speech, said Johnson. But so far, there have been no celebrities or high-dollar donations ― no Oprah, or George and Amal Clooney, who together donated $1 million to the March for Our Lives.","“We’re still pushing for that and we still need that and that’s why we’re trying to publicize it as much as possible to say, it’s not just in Chicago but in all the urban cities across America that have the same issues,” said Johnson.","Johnson added that his BRAVE members have remained in touch with the Parkland students, and that they’ve discussed additional events for the summer, when violence in Chicago and in many cities tends to spike.","The March for Our Lives students will need to continue actively fostering this collaboration if they want to keep their movement truly inclusive, said Amber Goodwin, founder and executive director of Community Justice Reform Coalition, a national advocacy group focused on gun violence prevention. Goodwin said this sort of cooperation will be mutually beneficial.","“Plugging in with groups that are already doing the local work is really important,” she said. “It’s a great way to show partnership, but also to meet people where they’re already at, versus asking people to come to where folks in the gun violence prevention space have been for so long.”","A crucial part of this alliance will involve the Parkland kids simply listening to the concerns of other communities and using their input to inform the movement’s agenda, said Goodwin.","Policies can have different effects and connotations for different groups of people, and solutions that appeal to some may seem dangerous to others.","That disparity was on display in Parkland this week, where a group of black Stoneman Douglas students spoke out, explaining that the increased police presence at school since the shooting made them uncomfortable. They also said they felt they’d been left out of conversations about the local response to the massacre.","This sort of oversight has cropped up in the national gun violence prevention movement as well, said Goodwin, who previously worked for the gun control organization launched by former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.). She said many groups working on the issue been “siloed,” which has meant marginalized communities have sometimes not had “the self-determination and the space” to be able to advocate for their specific needs.","The March for Our Lives was an all-too-rare example of what it looks like when these communities are given that opportunity, said Goodwin. She advised the Stoneman Douglas students to continue reaching out to elected officials and organizations that center communities of color, and to take advantage of existing local partnerships and gun violence prevention programs that have already shown tangible results.","“This has to be an intersectional issue,” said Goodwin. “But it’s not just a matter of saying that things are not diverse and that we need diversity and inclusion; it’s actually going to be dismantling a lot of the systems that have been built.”","That won’t be an easy task, Goodwin admits, which is one reason she believes the young organizers behind March for Our Lives shouldn’t be afraid to lean on adults for their experience and expertise.","“Yes, young people should lead, but we should be thinking about how we do this inter-generationally, where we’re looking at the strategies that have worked for more seasoned organizers,” she said.","But even if the March for Our Lives students do dedicate themselves to building and strengthening these sort of partnerships, many of the obstacles for local gun violence prevention efforts will remain. Getting the necessary resources and support needed for them to succeed is a constant struggle, said Paul of Million Hoodies.","“Many times, the local governments are strapped for funding to implement these strategies ... so being able to bring in private funding and being able to bring in people who are looking to support gun violence prevention organizations on a consistent basis is key,” he said.","With a massive platform, the March for Our Lives organizers may be able to help channel resources toward those initiatives.","Another way the March for Our Lives movement can champion these causes is through the ballot. Organizers made a big push to register voters at the weekend rallies, and the Parkland students have made the November elections a key focal point in the movement.","But activists want young people to know that it’s not just a matter of backing members of Congress who support gun reform. It’s also about mayors, city councilmembers and other local officials who, in some ways, have more direct power to address gun violence in their communities.","Although the Parkland students have a lot of work ahead to ensure that their movement can deliver on the promising vision laid out on Saturday, John is cautiously optimistic that they’ll be able to succeed where others have failed.","“Generation after generation, you see people become at least a little more radical in their thinking of how to change the world,” he said. “These young folks, I think, are much more willing to work together than I’ve seen historically in this movement.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5abd49921e0000fb077b0210.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Trump Lawyer’s Lawyer Issues Absurd Defense Of Client's Threats To Megyn Kelly","authors":"Jenna Amatulli","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/megyn-kelly-michael-cohen-lawyer-death-threats_us_5abd0896e4b04a59a3157151","short_description":"An attorney for Michael Cohen insists there’s “another side” to vicious messages sent by the notorious Trump defender.","date":"2018-03-29"},"articleContent":["Megyn Kelly grilled the lawyer representing President Donald Trump’s personal attorney Michael Cohen on Thursday morning over Cohen’s “vulgar and ... arguably threatening comments” as well as the threats he allegedly made against Stormy Daniels.","Kelly first brought up an incident from 2015 when Cohen laid into reporter Tim Mak over a Daily Beast story about Ivana Trump accusing her former husband of “violating” her.","“You write a story that has Mr. Trump’s name in it, with the word ‘rape,’ and I’m going to mess your life up,” Cohen told Mak. “For as long as you’re on this frickin’ planet.”","About his client’s rhetoric, lawyer David Schwartz told Kelly: “When your boss is being threatened like that?

By suggesting that I should be gutted?”","Schwartz then tried the two-sides-to-every-question approach.","“I don’t accept everything that you’re saying, because he has another side to the story. Maybe one day you guys can talk this out,” he said.","“Because there are two sides to every story,” he added. “It’s not just Megyn’s side of the story.

Well, kind of, middle-of-the-road Republican, whatever you call it.","Right of center?","Yeah, I guess I would be a little bit right of center.","OK, so now, tell me what you think the Cambridge Analytica scandal is.","Well, the main problem, I guess, is that they got permission from different people on Facebook to use their information — I think they used it for targeted ads. Like, this company wanted to use it for targeted ads, so they got permission. I think it was using an app — at least, that’s what I heard on TV. And these people downloaded the app, and they gave permission for Ana ― whatever, Cambridge Analytica — to use their information.¹ Well, Cambridge Analytica not only used their information from Facebook, but they used all their Facebook friends’ information, too. Which they hadn’t gotten permission to do.² So that’s part of the problem. But I’m not sure if that’s illegal or it’s just wrong to do, or... I don’t know if it’s really illegal, but something about that isn’t on the up and up.³ They shouldn’t have done that!","So then they had information not only on however many thousands of people, now they had information on millions of people, and most of them hadn’t given out permission.","So then I guess what’s-his-name, who runs Facebook —","Mark Zuckerberg.","Mark Zuckerberg! Yeah. I heard that when it happened, Facebook found out that they were doing it and told them not to do it anymore. But that’s all they did, was tell them.⁴ So they still did it. And even though they still did it, Facebook didn’t do anything about it. So that’s why they’re in trouble, because they let it go on.","And when you say they took information, what sort of information did they take?","I don’t know. I guess things that they pick up from people on Facebook, like what sites they look at, what they click on that interests them. I guess, also, they took what they talk about on Facebook, like their political interests, their clothing interests. You know, anything so that they can target ads towards those people. And I guess they also thought that Trump had used — or actually, Trump did use some of their information or bought the rights to use some of that information.⁵ Oh! But I heard that even though he’d bought the rights to use it, he had never actually ended up using it.⁶ This is just what I heard.","Heard where?","On TV. Probably Fox News.","Does it concern you that other people could have this information on you?","Like, as far as me? That they might have my information? I guess, only because then I might start getting more advertisements trying to target me, and I hate advertising. I try to get rid of it all. But I haven’t done or written anything that I would care if anyone knew about. I don’t usually write stuff that I don’t want to be out in public, and anything I click on usually isn’t anything controversial.","And who do you think runs Cambridge Analytica?","Oh, I have no idea.","Would it sound right to say that Steve Bannon had been the vice president of Cambridge Analytica?","Oh, you know, actually, I don’t know if it’s from something I read that you wrote or what, but I do remember reading something that said Steve Bannon — or whoever like that — had a part in it. I don’t remember what it was.⁷","Do you know who the Mercers are?","The Mercers? No.⁸","How much money do you think the Trump campaign spent on Cambridge Analytica?","I don’t know, a couple million? I have no idea. I’m guessing in the millions.⁹","And do you know of anything else Cambridge Analytica did that might have been bad?","Besides this thing with Facebook? No, I don’t think so. This is the first time I’ve ever heard of them.","I mean, like, something that might have come out in the past week or so.","No, that’s all I remember.","So you didn’t hear anything recently about them telling a reporter that they use sex workers to blackmail politicians?","I don’t think — have you written anything about that?","Not really.","Yeah, I haven’t heard anything about that.¹⁰","OK, so back to the Facebook stuff, are you hesitant at all to use Facebook now?","No, I don’t really care. Because the only way it affects me, that it bothers me, is if I’m going to start getting all these advertisements coming up when I’m looking at stuff. I don’t like that.","Has this scandal affected your opinion of Donald Trump at all?","No. Because you know what? With Trump, I know he has a lot of faults, a lot of things he does that I don’t think he should do, but the fact that, I think, he’s doing well with the economy so far, that other stuff is just personality stuff. Like the tweeting. I don’t like a lot of the tweets that he does, and stuff like that.","So it doesn’t concern you that a guy who was one of Trump’s closest political advisers, Steve Bannon, was involved with a company that said it bribes and entraps politicians?","No, I mean, first of all, is Steve Bannon still working for him?","No, but he was his chief strategist and ran his campaign.","Yeah, but, you know, it doesn’t bother me because all the politicians have weird, sneaky people working for them. I mean Obama did, too. He went to a church, or he was friends with this — what was he? A preacher? I forgot his name — who did a lot of not nice things. So you know, they all do.¹¹ Personally, I think Washington and the politicians and everyone there and the congressmen and senators, they’re all bad. I think you can’t be a really nice person and be in politics. I think you have to be, kind of, willing to do things that aren’t exactly morally right. You have to be willing to do that to actually be a success politically. I think the nice guys, if they get in, they don’t stay in long, maybe because they see how it is and can’t handle it. But I think most of those politicians are not nice people.","And has your opinion of Mark Zuckerberg changed at all?","Yeah, it probably has changed a little. I used to think I really liked him. I actually used to think, when he first started Facebook, and he was really rich and he wasn’t too much older than you and he was Jewish, I thought, oh, he’d be good for you! I used to think that.","But you don’t anymore?","Well, not now, because I see that he kind of ignored that bad stuff, and he seems to have done some things he shouldn’t have done. So he doesn’t seem like such a sweet, nice person that I thought he was at first. Not that I’d be upset if you married him, because I wouldn’t be!","You know he’s already married?","Anything can happen!","So the Cambridge Analytica scandal affected your opinion of Mark Zuckerberg but not Trump?","No, because my opinion of Trump was already that he wasn’t the greatest guy. Like I knew that he had a lot of faults. But some of the things that he’s good at outweigh that for me. Like, I’m more interested in the economy — I just am. And that, I think, is more important than him doing these stupid tweets and stuff like that. Or even, like, I’m sure he fooled around with those hookers,¹² I’m sure he did, but you know, I’m sure a lot of the politicians did stuff like that. It’s just, you didn’t — I mean, Kennedy did it. But that’s not affecting how he runs the country.","What would it take for you to no longer want to use Facebook?","I guess if my... I don’t know. I like using Facebook because my friends and college friends and high school friends are on there. I mean, you’re not on there as much anymore and neither is Jason,¹³ really. But I like it so I can see what those people are doing, my friends from college and high school and people I know but normally wouldn’t have any contact with if it weren’t for Facebook.","But is there anything you could find out about what they might be doing that would make you want to stop using Facebook, or that would make you feel unsafe on Facebook?","Um... I guess if I found out that they had little webcam cameras in there that I didn’t know about, and every time I looked at Facebook they were watching me — I wouldn’t like that. Then I would probably stop using it.¹⁴","Has your opinion of Steve Bannon changed at all?","I never really liked him. He’s kind of creepy-looking anyway.","That’s judgey of you.","Well, I don’t know. He’s just kind of creepy-looking. Plus, like I said, I’m not far right. A lot of the stuff that he talks about I don’t really agree with. And like Breitbart, Breitbart is way too far right for me. I’m more in the middle.","What’s your main source of news, would you say?","Well, on TV, it’s probably more Fox News. But sometimes when I want to hear the other side, I’ll listen to CNN or MSNBC for a little while. But then they’re both — both sides, Fox News and all those are just so slanted one way or the other, it’s hard to find something that’s just explaining the news.","You should just ask me to explain it.","You’re slanted, too! You always give an opinion. I liked your article about the dolphin, though. I thought that was cute!","Those were all my questions. Is there anything else notable you think you learned from hearing about the scandal?","Well, I already knew that they use your information to give you targeted ads, because I get them all the time if I click on something, and then I start getting all this stuff. Like, I don’t like that, but it doesn’t make me stop using it. Because it’s just an annoyance.","OK, I think that’s it.","Oh! Now that it’s over, what did you think of my answers?","You got more right than I expected, actually! But a lot of it was still extremely wrong.¹⁵","Oh well.","Footnotes","¹ People were under the impression that they were just granting access to “thisisyourdigitallife,” a personality quiz app, and its creator, Dr. Aleksandr Kogan, a Cambridge University professor who’d been recruited by Cambridge Analytica.","² Under Facebook’s rules, while Kogan was allowed to harvest data from the friends of people who had used the app, he was not allowed to sell it to a third party.","³ At this point, it’s not actually clear whether Cambridge Analytica’s actions were illegal, as far as its use of Facebook data is concerned. If there was lawbreaking involved, it would likely have been due to the fact that Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix, as a foreign national, should have recused himself from any involvement with a U.S. political campaign, which he of course did not.","⁴ Technically, in 2015, Facebook also made Cambridge Analytica promise real hard that it’d destroyed the data it was never supposed to have had in the first place. Cambridge Analytica assured Facebook it had done so (although it hadn’t), and Facebook apparently saw no need to check further.","⁵ It wasn’t so much that the Trump campaign bought the rights to use Cambridge Analytica’s data as it was that Cambridge Analytica, a company created by Trump donors and supporters, was working directly with the Trump campaign.","⁶ He definitely did.","⁷ Steve Bannon was indeed the vice president of Cambridge Analytica until he stepped down to take over the Trump campaign.","⁸ The Mercers, specifically the father-daughter team of Robert and Rebekah Mercer, are conservative, billionaire Trump supporters with deep ties to Bannon.

Jeremiah Wright, Barack Obama’s former pastor and the source of considerable controversy during Obama’s 2008 campaign. Wright didn’t have anything to do with breaking election laws, but he did say a number of egregiously true things, like that America has “more black men in prison than there are in college” and that America is “deeply involved in the importing of drugs, the exporting of guns, and the training of professional killers... We bombed Cambodia, Iraq and Nicaragua, killing women and children while trying to get public opinion turned against Castro and Gaddafi.”","¹² At the time of the alleged affairs, Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal were an adult film actress and a Playboy model, respectively.","¹³ My brother.","¹⁴ This is fair.","¹⁵ Facebook collects more than just your profile info. It also tracks your browsing history. It records all your “likes.” And then it rounds out whatever it’s culled from this internal surveillance with personal data purchased from a number of brokers, including financial information. Facebook is valuable largely because it makes this large mass of data about you available to third parties, who are in effect purchasing your attention. The potential for abuse is enormous, and Cambridge Analytica’s misdeeds are just one very prominent example."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5abbf9491f00002d0016bc1b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"QUEER VOICES","headline":"Teacher Suspended After Discussing Her Sexual Orientation In Class","authors":"Elise Solé, Yahoo Lifestyle","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/teacher-suspended-after-discussing-her-sexual-orientation-in-class_us_5abcfeebe4b04a59a3155992","short_description":"An elementary school teacher has been suspended for discussing a topic related to her sexual orientation in class.

This is absolutely false. Further, she never received directives to change her behavior — and never refused to follow any directive.”","According to a March 7 story published by the Dallas Morning News in August, Bailey emailed the district to ask that “sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression” be included in the school’s anti-discrimination policy.","“I think it is important that MISD starts movement towards progress now,” Bailey’s email read, according to the news outlet. “We have many LGBTQ teachers, students, and families in this district. We deserve the right to feel protected by our district.”","A few weeks later, Bailey received notice that she was suspended “until an investigation is completed.” She was also told to ”make no contact with students, parents or other staff members.” (The school denied that Bailey’s request was related to her suspension).","On Wednesday, Bailey’s lawyer said the school’s public statement was a violation of the law.” [I’m] shocked by the school district’s decision to speak openly about a personnel matter — Stacy’s administrative leave — in spite of its legal obligations of confidentiality,” Ortiz told the Dallas Morning News. “The district’s actions violate Stacy’s rights under the U.S. Constitution.”","On Tuesday night, the paper reported that three dozen people, including Bailey’s wife, father, and sister appeared at a school board meeting requesting answers regarding Bailey’s suspension. A 9-year-old student also addressed the board, calling Bailey a “role model.”","The Dallas Morning News also published text messages it claims are from Charlotte Anderson principal Sheira Petty who messaged a staffer named Donna about the situation. In response to whether Bailey had done something similar in the past, Petty reportedly replied, “Not to his [sic] extent. She has said she had a girlfriend and she showed a slide show of her friends that included girlfriend. … In talking with HR, it was always determined I was NOT to tell her she can’t say certain things.

The prosecutor asked why.","“Um,” Day responded, choking back tears. “I was not going to let him kill these innocent women because they were who they were, because they were Somalis or Muslims.”","“It was very scary,” he added. “I thought I might have to kill somebody. I’m not a killer.”","Day said he eventually calmed Stein down and they drove away. He still remembers the “fear” in the eyes of the two women.","Stein and two other men — Curtis Allen and Gavin Wright — are on trial this week at a federal courthouse in Wichita, accused of being part of a 2016 terrorism plot to massacre Muslims. Prosecutors say the three men, all members of a militia group called the Crusaders, had planned to bomb a Garden City apartment complex that housed Somali refugees, whom the men referred to as “cockroaches.” Prosecutors say the trio scheduled the attack for the day after the 2016 presidential election, so as not to hurt President Donald Trump’s chances of victory.","Their plot was foiled, however, in large part due to evidence collected by Day, whom the FBI recruited as an informant in 2016, the prosecution said.","Wednesday marked Day’s first appearance in the trial, which started last week. Stein, Allen and Wright have pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction and conspiracy against civil rights. The trial is expected to last through April, when a nearly all-white jury will determine the militiamen’s fate. If convicted, they face life in prison.","As an informant, Day secretly recorded the men openly discussing killing Muslims. “The only good Muslim is a dead Muslim,” Stein said in one taped conversation. “If you’re a Muslim, I’m going to enjoy shooting you in the head.”","But the defendants’ attorneys have thus far characterized such talk of slaughtering Muslims as mere bluster. “Locker room talk” is what Allen’s attorney, Rich Federico, called it. “Bull sessions” is how Wright’s attorney, Kari Schmidt, referred to it.","But in court Wednesday, Day made it clear that he thought Stein, the ringleader of the group, really wanted to massacre Muslims.","“He could be a normal person,” Day said of Stein. But when he talked about Somalis, Day said, Stein “did a total 180. It was like Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde. He got angry, very angry.”","Day recounted another incident when he and Stein monitored Somali Muslims in Garden City back in 2016. (Anti-government militia groups in America have become increasingly paranoid about, and hateful of, Muslims in recent years. It’s common for such groups to surveil peaceful Muslim communities.)","Day says he and Stein were driving by the Somali apartment complex that Stein, Allen and Wright allegedly would go on to target in their bomb plot.","“He was irate that there were so many Somalis,” Day recalled.","“Muslims are like cockroaches,” Day said Stein told him. “You can’t kill one of them. You have to kill all of them. They keep coming back. You have to exterminate them all.”","Day is expected to take the stand again Thursday morning.","HuffPost is in Wichita, Kansas, to cover this terrorism trial.

But the policy also provided exemptions for women facing mandatory detention or security threats. In practice, ICE detained more than 500 pregnant women in 2016, the last full year the policy was in effect.","With the change, outlined in a Dec. 14 directive signed by acting ICE Director Thomas Homan, ICE will no longer presumptively release pregnant women from detention. It supersedes a 2016 memo, also signed by Homan, that codified the policy against detaining pregnant women except under “extraordinary circumstances or the requirement of mandatory detention.”","Under the new policy, ICE will detain “only those whose detention is necessary to effectuate removal, as well as those deemed a flight risk or danger to the community,” according to a fact sheet obtained by HuffPost. ICE will generally not detain pregnant women during their third trimester.","Philip Miller, deputy executive associate director for ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations, told reporters on Thursday that many pregnant women encountered by immigration enforcement are already subject to mandatory detention by law, particularly if they were apprehended at the border and are not deemed eligible to move forward with any claims for relief.","Others may be subject to mandatory detention because they committed certain crimes within the U.S. Since the policy went into effect in December, ICE has detained a total of 506 pregnant women, according to ICE, though the agency did not say how many of those women were later deported or released into the U.S. He said that on March 20, the last date for which ICE has the data, there were 35 pregnant women in detention, all of them subject to mandatory detention.","“To miscategorize this as some wholesale change or some kind of draconian act is really just hyperbole,” Miller said. “We’re aligning this policy, as we have with all of our policies, with the direction from the president.”","The changes, which will apply to pregnant women seeking asylum, bring ICE policy closer in line with an executive order signed by President Donald Trump a week after taking office last year. That order scrapped the Obama-era prosecutorial discretion policy instructing officers to deprioritize detaining and deporting certain immigrants.","Several human rights organizations filed a complaint with the Department of Homeland Security in September on behalf of pregnant women detained by ICE. The complaint alleged that ICE was failing to abide by its own policy against detaining pregnant women and that the women were not being given adequate care.","Critics maintain that ICE detention centers are ill-equipped to treat the complex medical issues pregnant women face. Two women told HuffPost they lost pregnancies at ICE detention centers last year.","Immigrant women in detention are also sometimes the victims of rape, said Kathryn Shepherd of the American Immigration Council, which was one of the groups that filed a complaint last year against the detention of pregnant women.","“Being in detention is not an appropriate setting for not just a pregnant woman, but a pregnant woman who may or may not be pregnant as a result of a significant trauma like that,” she said.","Michelle Brané of the Women’s Refugee Commission, which was also part of the complaint, said ICE did not notify her organization after the directive in December, even though the two groups have been in communication with each other. Still, she said she was not surprised by the policy change ― it is one that immigrant rights advocates feared was coming after Trump’s executive order last year.","She said it is impossible to know for sure whether the number of pregnant detainees will go up, but “it’s pretty clear that the intent is to reduce the number of pregnant women who are released.” Alternatives to detention, like mandatory check-ins or ankle bracelets, are both more humane and less expensive for taxpayers than detaining pregnant women, she said.","“The crazy thing about it is they’re claiming it’s because they should be treated like everyone else and that they’re going to go after everybody who has immigration status issues, but the reality is that those aren’t your only options,” Brané said. “Not detaining a pregnant woman doesn’t mean she won’t have to go through the immigration legal process.”","This story has been updated with more details of and reaction to the policy change."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5abd08161f0000270616bd9a.jpeg?cache=IqRRnmOkpQ&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Roseanne Barr Snaps Back At Wendy Williams With A Personal Burn","authors":"Ron Dicker","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/roseanne-barr-wendy-williams_us_5abcafe6e4b04a59a314a830","short_description":"The talk-show host discovered why you don't ask Roseanne about an ex-husband.","date":"2018-03-29"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Donald Trump Gets Brutally Mocked Over Latest White House Ousting","authors":"Lee Moran","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-shulkin-out-reaction_us_5abc899fe4b06409775d1d49","short_description":"\"Does Donald Trump genuinely think he is supposed to eliminate someone each week?\"","date":"2018-03-29"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"SCIENCE","headline":"Paleontologist Talks About Fossil ‘Find Of A Lifetime’ In Area Cut From Bears Ears","authors":"Chris D'Angelo","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fossil-discovery-bears-ears-rob-gay_us_5abc0d44e4b04a59a314254e","short_description":"“I will probably spend the rest of my career working on this site,\" said paleontologist Robert Gay.","date":"2018-03-29"},"articleContent":["BLANDING, Utah — In 2016, paleontologist Robert Gay and a group of students stumbled upon a trove of prehistoric fossils in southeastern Utah, in what is part of the more than 1 million acres President Donald Trump recently cut from the Bears Ears National Monument. The team had been en route to another excavation site when an outcropping of rocks from the Triassic period caught Gay’s eye.","They stopped to investigate and immediately began picking up fossilized chunks of bone.","“The entire surface was carpeted with fossil bones,” Gay, the education director at the Colorado Canyons Association, told HuffPost. “Everywhere on the hillside, for 60 meters.”","What Gay’s team discovered could be the densest bed of Triassic-era fossils in the nation, and maybe the world. During an initial excavation at the site last year, he unearthed the intact skulls of three long-snouted phytosaurs, a reptile that lived more than 200 million years ago. That’s nearly 120 million years before Tyrannosaurus rex showed up.","During the Triassic period, which spanned 251 million to 199 million years ago, dinosaurs and a slew of other bizarre creatures roamed the Earth. There were many crocodile-like reptiles — armored plant-eaters, a two-legged species with a beak, and another with a blowhole on its head — along with “salamanders the size of cars, with toilet bowl lid heads,” Gay said. The period ended with a global extinction event that wiped out some 76 percent of marine and terrestrial species. And thus began the Jurassic period, the age of the dinosaurs.","Gay says he’s only scratched the surface of the fossil record at this Utah site, a record he believes could prove key to understanding how dinosaurs were able to respond to rapid climatic changes and came to dominate the landscape.","“This is the find of a lifetime,” he said. “I will probably spend the rest of my career working on this site.”","HuffPost talked to Gay this week at the first of two public scoping meetings the federal government held to receive input on managing what remains of Bears Ears National Monument. Trump’s December announcement cut Bears Ears by 85 percent, to just over 200,000 acres, opening the door for new mining, drilling and other development on lands now left outside of the monument.","Gay still has a permit to work the site, but because it is no longer part of a national monument, he and his team are unable to use the $25,000 grant they received through a special Bureau of Land Management program that funds research on conservation lands. Gay said he can use the funds for other sites still in the monument, but not this one.","Work at the site will remain stalled until the team locates another source of funding. Gay has applied for other grants and is exploring partnerships that would allow for his team to continue field work there.","The question he’s looking to answer: “Why did dinosaurs come to rule the world?”","The latest fossil discovery is one of several important paleontological sites within the area cut from the monument.

Russo filed on Monday.","The woman had been seeking a restraining order against the man who allegedly raped her.","During the hearing, the plaintiff said she and the defendant had just returned from a trip to Home Depot when he raped her. The two share a daughter.","Later, Russo took over a line of questioning from a defense attorney aimed at illustrating that the plaintiff could have done more to prevent the assault. When Russo asked whether she knew “how to stop somebody from having intercourse” with her, the plaintiff gave several responses, saying she would either physically harm the assailant, tell them no or run away.","“Close your legs? Call the police? Did you do any of those things?” Russo continued, according to the court transcript.","The complaint stated that the judge “mistreated the victim” with his “irrelevant” and “discourteous” questions.","In another instance detailed in the complaint, Russo allegedly violated rules of conduct when he ruled on an alimony case in which he admitted to knowing both parties. The judge reduced the amount of back alimony owed by the man involved in the case from $10,000 to just $300.","“Judge Russo looks forward to a public hearing in which he will be able to respond to the allegations against him,” attorney David Corrigan said in a statement provided to KPVI, a local NBC affiliate. “We have respect for the process as well as the advisory committee on judicial conduct, and therefore won’t comment further.”","Russo was placed on paid administrative leave from New Jersey’s Ocean County Courthouse in May.

The Maryland Court of Special Appeals upheld Syed’s claim that he received “ineffective assistance of counsel.”","Thursday’s decision could go next to the Maryland Court of Appeals. A representative for the office of Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh told The Baltimore Sun that the state’s attorneys are “currently reviewing today’s decision to determine next steps.”","“Serial,” which meticulously re-examined the murder in Baltimore and original 2000 trial, helped bring renewed attention to Syed’s case. The case was later reopened.","“‘Serial’ was enormously helpful,” a lawyer for Syed, Justin Brown, said at a press conference shortly after the verdict was read. “[Syed] asked me to convey his deep gratitude and thanks from the bottom of his heart to all those who have supported him and believed in him.”","Syed’s lawyers may try to secure bail to get him out of prison ― where he has been for 19 years ― as they hope for a retrial.","“If we get back in court for a jury trial, we like our chances,” Brown said. “We like them a lot. We think that we would win a trial.”","In 2016, a lower court judge in Baltimore vacated Syed’s murder conviction and determined he had the right to a new trial, citing poor legal counsel he received at the time.

Some said the hire highlighted a general lack of diversity in the arts, while others suggested the hires were just another sign of Brooklyn’s gentrification.","Meanwhile, other Twitter users are comparing the hire to the museum heist scene from the hit film “Black Panther.” The scene begins with antagonist Erik “Killmonger” Stevens browsing through a museum while security watches closely over him. A white female curator eventually approaches Killmonger and gives him the history of the West African artifacts he’s looking at.","When Killmonger tells her that one of the artifacts actually originated from the fictional Wakanda and was stolen by British soldiers, the curator looks surprised.","“How do you think your ancestors got these,” Killmonger asks the woman, after saying he would take the artifact. “Do you think they paid a fair price? Or did they take it, like they took everything else?”","“We as museum professionals need to talk about the inclusion of this scene,” writes Casey Haughin, a Johns Hopkins University art student and editor of The Hopkins Exhibitionist, in an op-ed that went viral in February.","“The museum is presented as an illegal mechanism of colonialism, and along with that, a space which does not even welcome those whose culture it displays,” she continued.","That scene from the fictional Marvel film, and now the Brooklyn Museum’s latest hire, illustrate the very real lack of diversity in the art world.","African-Americans made up a mere 4 percent of all curators, conservators, educators and museum leaders, while Hispanics made up 3 percent and Asians made up 6 percent, according to a widespread museum demographic survey completed by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation in 2015. White scholars occupied those roles at overwhelming rates, while people of color were more represented at museums through janitorial or security roles.","“Art history, generally, has not always attracted people of color or first-generation students,” Chika Okeke-Agulu, a professor of African art at Princeton University, told HuffPost in an email.","“And there is still not enough black and African students in US institutions interested in studying and making a career in ancestral arts of African societies, the sort of art that still form the core of African art collections of museums like Brooklyn.”","But Okeke-Agulu, whom Windmuller-Luna studied under while earning her Ph.D., does not think that museums should only hire black curators to oversee African exhibits.","“Do I think that museums should only hire black curators to oversee their African art collections? Absolutely not; or we might as well prevent non-black students from studying or seeking a career in the field,” he said.","“Should museums make sure that they don’t overlook qualified black curators in their curatorial and senior management job search process? Absolutely.”","Mariët Westermann, vice president of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, noted in the summary for the foundation’s 2015 survey that underrepresentation of people of color is a well-known phenomenon within museum circles.","That’s partly why art scholars of color are angry over the Brooklyn Museum’s hire.","“These are fraught issues, and the curator in question is a highly qualified scholar poised to do great work,” Ananda Cohen-Aponte, an art historian who teaches at Cornell University, wrote on Twitter.","“But we’re in a complex cultural moment where institutions are being held accountable in unprecedented ways, [especially with] social media bringing many more into the [conversation].”","While people are criticizing the museum of hiring Windmuller-Luna, Okeke-Agulu thinks that the Brooklyn Museum has done a fair job of encouraging a diverse staff ― especially considering the art world’s general elitism.","“The art world ― as constituted by scholars, curators, critics, collectors, dealers, schools, museums, and art administrators ― has always been elitist, and that won’t be changing anytime soon, largely because of the long-established entanglement of art, money and power,” he told HuffPost, adding that the diversity of “any given society’s elite class has direct bearing [on] the diversity of its art world.”","“Still, some museums have done more in diversifying its curatorial staff than others,” Okeke-Agulu added. “And I think that Brooklyn has been much more active in this respect than many of its peers in New York and elsewhere in the US. Take a look at its curatorial staff.”","In a statement to HuffPost on April 6, a week after this story was first published, Brooklyn Museum director Anne Pasternak said the museum “unequivocally stands by” its decision to hire Windmuller-Luna.","“We were deeply dismayed when the conversation about this appointment turned to personal attacks on this individual,” Pasternak said. “Many respected scholars in the field have expressed the same sentiment.”","Pasternak cited Nigerian-American arts leader Okwui Enwezor as a scholar who is disappointed in the backlash against Windmuller-Luna, his former student.","“The criticism around her appointment can be described as arbitrary at best, and chilling at worst,” Pasternak quoted Enwezor as saying.","According to Pasternak, a museum committee made up of members from several departments completed a yearlong search to fill the position of African art curator and “unanimously selected” Windmuller-Luna due to her expertise and experience.","According to several biographies of her published by universities and museums, she has received her Ph.D. in African Art History from Princeton University, worked as an African Arts research specialist at Princeton’s art museum, and is a lecturer at Columbia University.","While Brooklyn Museum supports Windmuller-Luna’s hiring, Pasternak said the museum is aware that the “longstanding and pervasive issues of structural racism profoundly affect the lives of people of color.”","“It is right to press museums and other institutions to diversify their leadership,” she added.","To be sure, Windmuller-Luna is qualified for her new job. But the question many people are asking is whether there was an art scholar of color suitable for the role, too. And, in case the museum couldn’t find one, Cohen-Aponte has started a #POCarthistory Twitter thread filled with exceptionally qualified candidates.","This story has been updated with comment from Chika Okeke-Agulu and an April 6 statement from the Brooklyn Museum."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5abc345f1f00002d0016bc3f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"BUSINESS","headline":"These Stock Photos Show Masculinity Is More Than Biceps And Beer","authors":"Angelina Chapin","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/these-new-stock-photos-try-to-redefine-masculinity-with-male-nurses-makeup-and-hugs_us_5abbfb26e4b06409775cc5d2","short_description":"Discarding gender stereotypes, new collections feature male nurses and stay-at-home dads, along with guys who wear makeup and jewelry.","date":"2018-03-29"},"articleContent":["Stock photography is synonymous with outdated and ridiculous gender stereotypes. There’s women laughing alone with salad ― a viral meme that has morphed into women laughing alone with tablets ― and the many shots of alpha men sitting at the head of boardroom tables or barbecuing steaks. The models in all these examples are usually white and extremely heteronormative.","But stock photo companies are increasingly trying to reflect our current culture. In the past few years, Getty, Adobe and Shutterstock have all tried to break away from the clichés they’re known for reinforcing, especially as a new crop of stock photo startups focus exclusively on diverse images.","Giants like Getty started with tackling female stereotypes, teaming up with Sheryl Sandberg in 2014 to create the “Lean In” collection, which shows women working in labs and hiking, no romaine lettuce in sight. Now the company is turning its lens on men by focusing on the theme of “Masculinity Undone.” Getty recently released a compilation of images that feature men parenting, hugging one another and looking pensive as they stare out windows.","Launched in January, the photos include men of color, men with long hair, and men who are shirtless despite lacking well-defined pecs and biceps.","“We’re trying to focus on imagery that represents a more complex version of manhood and a more gentle side,” Guy Merrill, Getty’s global head of art, told HuffPost. “We’re breaking away from stereotypes: the business leader, the absent father and buffoon … the lonely guy who doesn’t need any friends or community.”","Shutterstock has created a “Modern Man” collection full of male nurses, gay couples and guys who love to garden, while Adobe is showcasing “The Fluid Self,” which includes photos of men wearing makeup, earrings and dressed in drag, as well as portraits of the transgender community.","The shift comes amid an ongoing cultural conversation about what it means to “be a man.” There’s been a backlash against the type of aggressive, authoritative manliness embodied by President Donald Trump and white nationalists, along with a growing awareness that men struggle with mental illness and high suicide rates. Today’s hip young male celebrities are less macho in appearance and demeanor ― think Timothée Chalamet and Harry Styles. Jay-Z talks openly about being in therapy, Jaden Smith wears dresses, and in every episode of “Queer Eye,” the Netflix makeover series, a man breaks down in tears.","Advertisers have taken note: Last year Axe body spray launched a campaign called “Is It OK For Guys?” that tackles the vulnerabilities men are taught to suppress (Is it OK to be skinny? Is it OK to be depressed?). And Lululemon released videos of men talking about emotional strength.","Stock photo companies say data, client feedback and cultural trends have pushed them to focus on changing definitions of masculinity and gender fluidity. In the past few years, Getty searches for “man meditation” went up by 126 percent, “man looking worried” by 100 percent and “gay dads” by 53 percent, according to the company. A recent Shutterstock survey found that 41 percent of U.S. marketers think it’s important to use images that reflect “modern day society.”","“Younger people are getting into college and moving into the workforce and they have much more modern ideas about masculinity and femininity,” said Robyn Lange, Shutterstock’s curator. “There’s no longer buckets you place these [genders] into. It’s more of a spectrum.”","In theory, stock photography is well-poised to help people think more progressively about gender. These images are ubiquitous, appearing on billboards and storefronts and in online articles and videos, where they are constantly tempting us to take out loans, travel to Hawaii and whiten our teeth.","“People aren’t aware of how much stock they’re seeing every day, everywhere, on every platform,” said Brenda Mills, Adobe’s principal of creative services and visual trends. “And so it has a huge influence over people’s lives.”","Raising the visibility of men with regular bodies being emotionally vulnerable or working in traditionally “female” jobs would allow them to become normal aspects of masculinity, rather than effeminate anomalies.","“Part of what we need are images to help us create a new reality,” said Tristan Bridges, an assistant sociology professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara. “What would it look like if men and women didn’t have to wear different types of clothes or we didn’t have to imagine them in different types of jobs?”","But Giorgia Aiello, an associate media and communication professor at the University of Leeds in England who studies stock photos, sees these diversity collections as “branding exercises” ― a way to appear “cutting edge” rather than to truly change gender norms.","“Although Getty images in particular tries to really confer a political kind of tone to what they are doing with stock photography, in the end the bottom line is purely commercial,” she said. “In some ways it is good they are doing it, but it’s certainly not going to really deeply affect their business model.”","Stock photo businesses have little control over what their photographers shoot and how clients use those images. Getty and Shutterstock both have more than 200,000 contributors, ranging from iPhone amateurs to professionals, who all earn royalties every time their work is licensed. While companies send out reports detailing the type of shots they want ― more men sitting in half lotus, please ― once contributors have been accepted onto the platform, they can upload whatever images they choose, so long as they aren’t offensive or illegal.","Getty’s “Lean In” collection, for example, represents just 0.01 percent of the company’s more than 190 million images. “If someone wants to shoot pictures of women eating salad, despite all the memes, we can’t stop them,” said Merrill, though he noted that Getty art directors are working directly with some of their professional contributors on “Masculinity Undone”-themed shoots.","Stock photo companies also have no control over how clients use the photos. In 2007, Getty’s top-selling image for the search term “woman” was a half-naked woman lying on a bed. Now it’s a woman hiking a rocky trail. But Aiello said that doesn’t necessarily equal progress. She has found that photos from the “Lean In” collection most often appeared in “lightweight” lifestyle articles or articles on gender discrimination.","“Quite a few of these images showing women as scientists were not used in general science journalism,” she said, “but in articles that talked about how difficult it was for women to have a career in science.”","While it’s possible that images of diverse masculinity will be confined to pieces about fashion or the evolution of manhood rather than used to illustrate more general topics, Adobe’s Mills doesn’t think that’s a problem. Her “fashion and grooming” clients currently have the biggest appetite for non-stereotypical images of men, she said, because those photos help them reach a new market. But more companies have begun to show interest.","“I’m surprised by some of the clients, who I thought might be more conservative, being incredibly open to this ‘Fluid Self’ trend,” Mills said. “They’re actually incredibly hungry for it.”","Getty’s Merrill said that even if his customers aren’t begging for more nuanced photos of men, his team has a responsibility to push them in a more progressive direction.","“It’s not simply our jobs to create the images our customers want ― we also want to re-picture clichés for them,” he said. “This is where we need to be in a year or two. Our customers might not be there yet, but we know they are going to be. And we want to make sure they have the pictures and the imagery when that happens.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5abd1f161f0000260616bdd2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Michelle, Ross and Carson On The Wild Ride To 'RuPaul’s Drag Race'","authors":"Leigh Blickley","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/judges-rupauls-drag-race_us_5aac09ade4b0c33361b042b7","short_description":"The show's permanent judges open up about their personal journeys to self-love.","date":"2018-03-29"},"articleContent":["When RuPaul made the decision to cast another full-time judge ahead of “Drag Race” Season 7, he had three requirements: The person who would sit alongside him and longtime table mate Michelle Visage had to be “wickedly funny, smart and experienced.”","As it turned out, two candidates fit that bill. And since Ru couldn’t choose between them ― one a beloved style guru, the other a red carpet stalwart ― he went ahead and hired both. Enter Carson Kressley and Ross Mathews.","On a reality series that boasts its fair share of celebrity guest judges (Kathy Griffin, Margaret Cho, Johnny Weir, Lena Headey, Neil Patrick Harris, Vanessa Williams, Lady Gaga, Christina Aguilera, to name a few), Michelle, Carson and Ross manage to do what a cameo player never could. They rise above the enthralling fracas of competition to deliver whip-smart commentary and artistically sound evaluations episode after episode, without falling prey to the show’s real stars: the queens.","As RuPaul insists, the judges aren’t “just showbiz experts, they’re super-fans and longtime lovers of the art of drag.”","Fans and lovers, yes, but also cultural critics who have been endowed with a serious responsibility. Whereas Simon, Randy and Paula needed only to identify a good voice and a pop-friendly image on “American Idol,” Michelle, Carson and Ross (and Merle Ginsberg and Santino Rice before them) must coronate a queen who meets the drag world’s highest standards ― all the while entertaining an audience who might be getting their very first taste of drag culture courtesy of VH1. It’s no small task, and it takes a trio of entertainment veterans to pull it off.","HuffPost caught up with Kressley, Mathews and Visage before the Season 10 premiere to learn more about their ability to amuse the masses and their careers before “Drag Race.” Here’s how, in their own words, they came to sit comfortably beside Mother Ru.","Michelle Visage","Michelle Visage was raised in New Jersey by overly supportive adoptive parents, who never failed to tell her how special she was “from the moment they received me.”","RuPaul, it seems, had a similar reaction to meeting Visage. They first came face to face in the late ’80s New York nightclub scene, when Visage was 18 or 19, and then officially reunited in 1992 at the New Music Seminar.","“We bumped into each other in the green room and that’s when I said, ‘Honey, I don’t know if you remember me?’ And he was like, ‘Bitch, remember you?! You are a fucking superstar. I have been watching you for years.’ And I was looking around going, ‘Me?! You’re talking to me?! I’m a superstar?’” she told HuffPost. “This is the first person other than my mom and dad who ever told me I was a superstar. Somebody like RuPaul saw me clearly, with full vision, and that was the moment where I was like, ‘There’s something else to this relationship.’”","Of course at that point, Visage, now 49, had already made a name for herself in the music business. Being an entertainer was something she’d dreamed about ever since she performed “Rhinestone Cowboy” on her organ in the second grade. From an early age, she wanted to become the next Madonna, so she moved to New York City, attended the American Musical and Dramatic Academy and hustled to find gigs after graduation. Theater casting directors initially told her that she wasn’t the right fit for Broadway, so Visage decided to follow a different path.","“I auditioned for [the R&B girl group] Seduction, which was really ballsy and weird because they had already had the Caucasian girl, so to speak,” Visage said. “I basically said, ‘Well, you don’t have me and you haven’t heard me. I’m the one that you really want.’ I always had balls of steel and that’s kind of how it started.”","At 19, Visage became a member of Seduction, with April Harris and Idalis DeLeón. The ladies produced a few hit songs, including “It Takes Two” and “(You’re My One and Only) True Love,” but never had the leadership they needed to achieve bonafide success.","“En Vogue was out at the same time and they were so amazing, but everything went to them at that point and Seduction was forgotten about,” Visage said. “The record label and PR people didn’t really know how to work us in the correct way. And then, of course, there were personal issues amongst the girls.”","After the group disbanded in 1991, Visage had no management, no agent and no support from producers.","“I ended up not knowing what to do, not getting my solo deal and working in a strip club in Queens hosting the hot oil wrestling on the microphone,” she said. “I did that for nearly two years, starting out in Queens at Goldfingers, and then Goldfingers opened in Manhattan and it was huge. That’s when C+C [Clivillés and Cole], [Seduction’s] producers, contacted me to do a solo project, which ended up being S.O.U.L. S.Y.S.T.E.M.”","S.O.U.L. S.Y.S.T.E.M.’s one hit, “It’s Gonna Be a Lovely Day,” appeared on the 1992 soundtrack for “The Bodyguard,” reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Dance Club chart and peaked at No. 34 on the Hot 100.","After that moment of fame, Visage dabbled in radio and eventually landed a gig with WKTU in New York. Following her successful stint as the “girl on the street” alongside Hollywood Hamilton and Goumba Johnny, the station decided to set Visage up with another on-air personality.","“They said, ‘We want to send a person to fashion week, so meet at 5 a.m. tomorrow morning,’” she recalled. “I show up to the hotel at 5 a.m. and in walks RuPaul. Literally, Ru looks at me ― I didn’t know it was going to be Ru, he didn’t know it was going to be me ― and he said, ‘Of course it’s you sitting here! Who else would it be? This is why all roads led to this day.’ And we did our week together, they hired us immediately, our first ratings book beat Howard Stern in New York City ― which hadn’t been done in decades ― and they knew it was a hit. So we signed for two years, and then Ru immediately brought me in as a sidekick on his VH1 show.”","Since then, Visage has been by RuPaul’s side, officially joining “Drag Race” as a regular mentor on Season 3 in 2011.","“It’s been a gift, and the biggest gift of all is to be able to sit next to my best friend and watch the amazing talent that comes through,” she said. “The more the show continues, grows and expands, the more drag changes, grows and expands. These kids who were once 11 and grew up on ‘Drag Race’ are now 21 and can audition, so there’s a whole new crop, plus the ones who were already in existence for 20 years. There’s no end in sight to me and it’s changing the queer landscape for the better.”","Carson Kressley","Carson Kressley was gliding out of “Queer Eye” fame when RuPaul summoned him to the “Drag Race” stage in 2014.","“We did a show together called ‘Skin Wars,’ which was on the Game Show Network, and he was one of the hosts and permanent judges,” Kressley told HuffPost. “I was a guest judge and that’s when he asked, ‘Why haven’t you been on my show?’”","A fitting question for someone who has more experience than most in the realm of lifestyle critique.","Born and raised outside Allentown, Pennsylvania ― “almost in Amish country, I call it Amish-adjacent,” he said ― fashion aficionado Kressley has always considered himself a standout.","“I grew up on a pony farm, which I know sounds like the reason why I might be gay,” he joked.","Kressley became an equestrian at a very young age and spent a lot of time alone with the horses on his family’s farm. “It was a little bit like an after-school special but not quite that sad,” he said. “It was the 1970s, so I think I was wildly influenced by television. I became enraptured by ‘The Carol Burnett Show’ and ‘Fantasy Island,’ and I think I got my penchant for shopping from watching ‘The Price Is Right’ on sick days. My eye for fashion came from TV as well, from shows like ‘Hart to Hart’ and ‘Charlie’s Angels.’”","The 48-year-old said that when other kids were drawing pictures of race cars, he “was drawing French provincial houses and pantsuit sketches,” adding that he begged for and eventually received the Fashion Designer set by Milton Bradley as a present.","Kressley also credits his mom with inspiring his love of design in the ’70s. “I remember being marched off to a store called The Hum to get a suit that I wore on Sundays — it was polyester and a terra-cotta color,” he said. “Seeing my mom wearing Bob Mackie long evening gowns to go to a cocktail party or a pantsuit for work, I was taught the importance of wearing the right thing at the right time.”","His passions drove him to New York City in the ’90s, where he eventually landed a job at Ralph Lauren.","During his seven-year tenure as a stylist-turned-creative director at Ralph Lauren, Kressley more or less stumbled across “Queer Eye for the Straight Guy,” a reality series being created for Bravo in the early 2000s. (He doesn’t appear in the Netflix reboot.) On the set of an ad campaign, a producer friend told Kressley that Bravo was looking for a stylist to be part of a group of gay men (aka the Fab Five), all with their own expertise, who would help straight men discover their true potential.","“I called Bravo, and at that point I thought they were a non-stick cooking spray. I had no idea they were even a network,” Kressley laughed. After some back and forth, he was called in for an interview, and then another, and another, until he was cast in the pilot episode.","“I took a couple of vacation days off of work, we made a pilot on Newbury Street in Boston, and then lots and lots of time went by,” he said. “In that interim, Bravo was purchased by NBC and the new head of the network said, ‘I really like this concept for “Queer Eye,” let’s do it.’ So the producers called and said, ‘Are you ready to quit your job?’ And I said, ‘Oh my God, do you guys have dental insurance?’”","The show was an overnight success, and Kressley and his co-stars became household names.","“We had no idea the show would do what it did,” he said. “I look back at the pictures and I’m like, ‘I did host the Flame Worthy Awards with Dolly Parton! We did go to the White House!’ We did so much in such a whirlwind amount of time that we couldn’t really savor it all.”","After “Queer Eye” ended in 2007, Kressley was given opportunity after opportunity, and he didn’t turn down a single one. “I say yes a lot,” he joked. “I call it the William Shatner School of Showbiz.” Programs like “How to Look Good Naked” and “Carson Nation” led him to appear as a contestant on “Dancing With the Stars” in 2011 before he ultimately met up with RuPaul, who he believes offered him the perfect gig.","“A lot of the judging on this show I think of as coaching,” Kressley said. “Michelle, Ross, Ru and myself, we’ve all done a thousand auditions at the start, and we all realize the importance of presentation and the hoops you have to jump through in showbiz,” he said. “We just want them to be successful ... and we can save them, hopefully, a lot of time and heartache by giving them some valuable kernels of wisdom.”","Ross Mathews","Ross Mathews bumped into RuPaul at a red carpet event a few years into his budding career as Ross the Intern on “The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.”","Already a longtime fan of Ru’s, Mathews grew even more enamored as they chatted about the drag queen’s first book, Lettin’ It All Hang Out. “I remember thinking, ‘This person looks so fabulous, so show business and so glossy, but here they are writing about the real nitty-gritty.’ I was intrigued by that juxtaposition,” Mathews told HuffPost.","Admittedly, Mathews has always been dazzled by Hollywood types.","“I wanted to meet every celebrity in the entire world. I wanted to interview them, I wanted to see a soundstage, I wanted to know who pulled the lever that made the curtain open. I just wanted to know everything about show business,” he said.","That’s pretty much how he found himself as a correspondent on “The Tonight Show,” where he appeared for nearly 15 years beginning in the early 2000s. He would do bits and attend red carpet events for the late-night program, showing off his natural charisma and built-in comedic chops while attending California’s University of La Verne as a communications major.","“I went from zero to a million miles an hour on that show,” he said. “I was literally living in the dorms but appearing on the No.1 late-night show in the nation, and so I learned incredible work ethic and incredible gratitude. It was like showbiz bootcamp — I was learning from the best of the best.”","Mathews said he’s wanted to be a talk show host since he was 7 years old. Growing up in a little farm town in Washington, he was well aware that he wasn’t like the other kids, but he had the unending support of his family and friends.","“It could’ve been really difficult, because I’m kind of like a gay cartoon and there weren’t a lot of people like me growing up in Mount Vernon, Washington,” he said. “But I lucked out. Of course I had challenges, but I had the best weapon in the world, which is humor.”","While learning the ins and outs of production as a creative consultant alongside Leno and his team, Mathews began booking side gigs on networks like VH1 and E!, where he was a regular commentator on Chelsea Handler’s show, “Chelsea Lately,” and co-hosted red carpet shows.","“All those years I covered the red carpet, it wasn’t just like a pinch-me moment but a pinch-me life,” Mathews said. “I used to cut out pictures of the Oscars or Golden Globes from the magazines and tape them to my wall, and here I was, as a grownup, on the red carpet year after year after year.”","Throughout his career, mentors like Leno, Handler and Rosie O’Donnell have taught him to “trust my own voice and carve my own lane. I couldn’t sort of imitate anybody,” Mathews said. “No matter how hard I try, I’m never going to sound like anyone else. I realized that some people may be funnier than me, but nobody has my point of view.”","That confidence is what caught the attention of RuPaul, who after their initial meeting asked Mathews to appear as a guest judge on Season 4 of “Drag Race.” The team asked Mathews to return as a permanent judge a few years later.","“It was one of those moments in life where I wanted to push pause for a second and let it digest, because I don’t know if I’ve ever been more qualified for anything in my entire life,” he gushed. “I love drag queens, I go to drag shows all the time, I love sitting in the front row, I love breaking a $50 so I can tip the girls. I judge like a fan.”","The 38-year-old said he’s honored to be a part of “Drag Race” and to sit beside his fellow panelists.","“It is unbelievable how Ru and these producers up their game every single time. Just when I think things couldn’t get any better, it gets so much better, and that’s a testament to Ru,” Mathews said. “I just want to say something about RuPaul: Ru is the most fabulous person I’ve met in my entire life and the fact that Ru thinks I’m fabulous makes me feel like a unicorn,” he added. “It makes me feel like I could do anything in the entire world. And I think anyone who’s met Ru or seen Ru on TV can understand how I feel.”","“RuPaul’s Drag Race” Season 10 airs Thursdays at 8 p.m. ET on VH1."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aac0a292000003800eb229b.jpeg?cache=4mDUHpg6JI&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"BUSINESS","headline":"Trapped Inside The Monster Energy Frat House","authors":"Emily Peck","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/monster-energy-sexual-discrimination-women_us_5aba7f31e4b04a59a31208c9","short_description":"A woman who worked at the drink company said she was sexually harassed and abruptly fired. This is what can happen when a boys club runs amok.","date":"2018-03-29"},"articleContent":["A sixth woman has come forward to complain about sexual discrimination at Monster Energy, a male-dominated beverage company that appears to be plagued by a toxic work culture.","The woman, Karen Simmons, a 50-year-old former sales representative based in Alabama, spent nearly two years with Monster. She amassed a strong track record, even as she fended off one of her Atlanta-based managers, Ted Cook, who hit on her, made comments about her breasts, tried to get her drunk and invited her more than once for an “evening nightcap” in his hotel room on work trips, she told HuffPost.","Robert Duck, Simmons’ direct boss who works out of Monster’s office in Florida, also witnessed Cook’s behavior, but told her to brush it off, she said. “He said Ted was harmless, ‘a dirty old man,’” Simmons recalled.","Through a company spokesman, Duck said Simmons never complained. When reached by phone by HuffPost, he hung up. He did not respond to follow-up texts. Cook also did not respond to a call, text or LinkedIn message.","Simmons took her complaints no further. “What was I gonna say? I loved my job. I needed my job,” she said.","Simmons had worked for about 20 years in the beverage industry, a notoriously unfriendly business for women. “I knew saying things gets you retaliation.”","What Simmons did not realize was that whether or not she spoke up, she was already trapped inside a company where the odds are stacked against women.","Last April, Simmons was fired for reasons she still doesn’t quite understand. Monster says it was for poor performance, according to a spokesman for the company. Simmons says her dismissal occurred a few months after receiving a generally positive performance review and just as she was poised to win an internal sales contest. In the fall, she filed sex and age discrimination charges against Monster at the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.","Monster is also facing lawsuits from five other women over complaints of sexual discrimination and other issues, as first reported in a HuffPost investigation in January.","One Monster executive, head of music marketing Brent Hamilton, is facing felony assault charges for allegedly strangling his girlfriend on a company business trip. He is still employed by the company.","Another executive, John Kenneally, a vice president accused of sexually harassing two women at the company, resigned after HuffPost published details of the accusations in January. He ran the business unit that Simmons worked in.","In public statements at the time, the company painted the women as disgruntled employees and said that the suits were unrelated.","“Monster Energy has zero-tolerance for discrimination or harassment of any kind,” the company said in January. “Monster takes all reported complaints very seriously. Any suggestions to the contrary are false.”","Just as HuffPost was set to publish this story, Monster announced it was hiring a third party to review its human resource policies and procedures. The investigators will report straight to the company’s board of directors.","“We are confident that the recent portrayal of the company in the media is not representative of [our] culture and practices,” Monster chairman and CEO Rodney Sacks and vice chair and president Hilton Schlosberg said in a statement. But they added that “in the context of the allegations made by the women bringing these lawsuits, we believe it is prudent.”","The company declined to provide more details on the third party. “If there are areas where there are deficients, we will correct them,” Sacks and Schlosberg said.","In a statement to HuffPost earlier in March, Monster said it wasn’t aware of Simmons’ complaints until recently.","“Ms. Simmons did not make any allegation of harassment to the company or to her manager while she was employed by the company,” the statement said. Monster only learned of the claim at a mediation session with Simmons and her lawyer in mid-February, the statement said. This was about three weeks after HuffPost published its investigation, the statement points out. Monster also said that Cook is no longer with the company.","Simmons’ former boss Duck, who she said witnessed Cook’s behavior, is still working at Monster.","Through a spokesman, Monster also told HuffPost that Simmons’ account was “not accurate.” Simmons’ last employee evaluation included significant feedback about areas for improvement, the spokesman said. It was not positive.","In response to other questions and requests for information, the spokesman wrote: “Many of the other allegations or questions are untrue, are missing facts or are irrelevant but we are not going to engage in a back and forth about this.”","I Wasn’t The Only One","After reading HuffPost’s reports, and looking into the cases filed against Monster, Simmons was shocked to learn that another female employee at the company, Page Zeringue, had gone to the human resources department to complain about Cook ― well before Simmons started working under him.","In a lawsuit against Monster, Zeringue alleges that her complaint to HR helped trigger her firing, ostensibly for bad performance.","Meanwhile, Cook was sent to sexual harassment training, according to internal documents viewed by HuffPost. This was around the same time Simmons was hired.","Monster Energy markets its drinks primarily to men using cliched tropes about masculinity. Scantily clad Monster Girls in leather bikini tops serve as brand ambassadors. One beverage is actually called “Assault.” A few years ago, the company gave out Monster branded condoms as a promotional gimmick.","That toxic male culture translates into policy where sexual harassment is not taken seriously. Monster’s employee guidelines ― reviewed by HuffPost ― require that managers who observe sexual misconduct must report it. But in Simmons’ case, it appears that her direct boss, Duck, never informed HR about Cook’s conduct.","Even if HR learns about misbehavior, what passes for an investigation into sexual harassment complaints seems to amount to a surface questioning of the parties involved, where the accounts of men are weighed more seriously.","At Monster, terminations may be helped along by a confusing performance review process where managers are allowed to add damaging comments into evaluations, months after employees read their reviews, according to documents reviewed by HuffPost.","A Problem of Culture","Even in an industry known for being heavily male, Monster stands out ― particularly in the sales division where Simmons worked.","Overall, only 13 percent of the company’s 505-person U.S. sales team are women. If you include administrative assistants, the percentage rises to 18 percent female, according to an internal employee directory from January obtained by HuffPost. None of the company’s 11 vice-presidents in sales are women.","Monster said some of the numbers HuffPost obtained were incorrect, but declined to offer specifics or provide its own data. In an earlier statement to HuffPost the company said “many women hold top leadership positions within Monster,” and pointed to its chief commercialization officer, Emelie Tirre.","Still, sales is so male-dominated at Monster that at a 2016 national sales meeting in Las Vegas ― even with human resource representatives in attendance ― a vice-president told a blatantly misogynistic joke to a packed room, according to three separate accounts from current and former employees.","The joke goes like this: There is an old bull and a young bull on a hill, overlooking a field of cows. Young bull says to the old bull: “Let’s run down there and fuck a cow.” Old bull says, nah: “Let’s walk down there and fuck them all.”","It was meant to inspire.","Simmons recalls being appalled. But she was used to hearing sexist talk from male colleagues. After all, she had spent most of her career in beverage sales, a notoriously sexist culture. She knew how to handle herself.","Over the past three years, at least four other women in the east division, where Simmons worked, were fired or pushed out. They include Simmons, two other women who are suing the company for sex discrimination, and one who declined to speak on the record with HuffPost but has since quit. As of January 2018, there were only 16 women out of 153 employees working in the east division.","Simmons was often the only woman at the dinners and events where she would meet up with Cook and Duck. Given the company’s cultural penchant for partying, drinking alcohol at these meet-ups was a given.","She didn’t drink, and repeatedly rebuffed Cook’s efforts to “get her drunk,” she said. She declined his invitations for a “nightcap” in his hotel room.","“The more Ted drank, the more handsy he got,” Simmons told HuffPost. On one occasion when he asked for a hug, Simmons said she uncomfortably gave him a half-hug. He wasn’t satisfied, and pulled her in for a do-over, she said. “He said, ’I felt that,” Simmons said, meaning he could feel the pressure of her breasts on his chest.","Harassment Training Was A Joke","Arguably, Simmons should never have had to deal with Cook in the first place. Two years earlier Zeringue had filed her complaint about him with the human resources department, according to the lawsuit she filed last year against the company.","Huffpost obtained Zeringue’s original complaint to HR. In it she said Cook had a reputation for getting grabby when he drinks, and was known as “Touchy Ted” around the office. She detailed an incident where he talked to her about her breasts and those of a coworker; he also pulled the hugging-close move on her, she said.","The HR department reached out to Cook’s boss, Kenneally, the executive who recently resigned in the face of harassment allegations after HuffPost’s investigation published. Kenneally defended Cook, telling the HR representative he had already spoken with him about the incident and there were “no noted recurrences,” according to a review of an internal HR report obtained by HuffPost.","Kenneally also made a point of criticizing Zeringue. Her “performance is not where it needs to be,” he is quoted as saying.","When Cook was confronted by HR, he confessed and said “he learned his lesson,” according to internal notes. He also conceded that “touchy Ted” was one of the nicknames he was known by inside the company, another being “Uncle Ted.”","He was assigned to sexual harassment training, called “stop sexual harassment training for supervisors,” and given a warning. It’s unclear if HR ever planned any kind of followup to make sure he stayed on track.","Zeringue was fired a month later. In her complaint against Monster she claims her firing amounted to retaliation for speaking up. That suit is now headed to private arbitration ― outside the public court system.","It was around this time, at a dinner in New Orleans that Simmons attended with Cook, Duck and several other male Monster employees that she said she heard them joking about “having to go to HR classes,” if they misbehaved.","“It was just like a big joke,” Simmons said","Where Is This Coming From","Simmons’ last few months at Monster played out like a corporate gaslighting.","In February 2017, less than two months after she had received a decent performance review from Duck, he asked to meet up with her in Florida where they had both traveled for business.","What happened next came as a total shock.","Duck showed her a disciplinary write-up.","“For stuff I didn’t do,” Simmons said. The writeup ― which HuffPost has reviewed ― claimed she was unwilling to leave her hometown for work. Yet, she was in Florida on a business trip at the time she was given the writeup. “I was out of town every week,” she said.","The writeup also claims that Duck spoke with Simmons in January about these issues. Simmons said the only feedback she got that month came when she downloaded her performance review from the company’s internal website. Monster provided HuffPost with a copy of the document.","Dated Dec. 31, the review judges Simmons’ performance as “Meets Standards,” giving her a 2.14 rating out of 4, and was generally upbeat and positive but is peppered with constructive criticism.","“At this point the only thing I can ask Karen to improve on is slowing down,” Duck wrote. “She also needs a little more work on time management.” He called her a “great problem solver,” who sometimes needs help prioritizing, “I have asked her to make sure when she schedules a meeting...to ALWAYS make sure she can do it…”","In the category of “job knowledge and skill,” Duck gave Simmons a rating of 3 or “exceeds expectations.”","So the negative writeup baffled Simmons.","She cried.","“Where is this coming from?” she asked him. She wanted to understand what she did wrong, so she could fix things. He refused to provide more details. “He said I was making things worse and to go home and forget about it,” Simmons said.","The Weird Review Thing","For about a month-and-a-half after that, Duck, still Simmons’ direct supervisor, did not talk to Simmons. She said he wouldn’t respond to texts or calls.","One thing he apparently did do: update Simmons’ Dec. 31 performance review ― topping the document off with an extremely harsh “summary paragraph” slamming her for poor performance.","The added paragraph is dated March 3, 2017. The tone of this text is vastly different from the rest of the document. “At this point, Karen has lost the trust of some of her bottlers and needs to ‘fix’ this soon or she will struggle,” Duck wrote. “Karen acts disconnected in meetings and face to face with her Coke partners.”","Duck used gender-coded words like “abrasive” and “demanding” to describe her demeanor with outside contacts at Coca-Cola bottlers Simmons worked with.","The final comment was meant to assess Simmons’ work from the end of December through March, a Monster spokesman told HuffPost. “The final comments reflect not only her manager’s assessment of her work through 12/31/17,” he said. “But the final comment on 03/03/17 was also influenced by her performance in the months after 12/31/17 and before the final comment.”","Simmons said she had not seen this paragraph until she was asked about it by HuffPost.","Monster, which provided HuffPost with the review, claimed that Simmons had likely seen the additional paragraph. However, Monster could not provide evidence that she did. According to Monster’s records, Simmons signed her review on March 1 ― two days before Duck signed off on the harsh additional paragraph.","“I Just Think It Was Wrong”","Finally, in late April, Duck broke the silence. He called Simmons and said he needed to meet in person. But when he met her in a hotel lobby in her hometown of Daphne, Alabama, he was there with Cook and they had an HR representative on the phone to talk to her.","She was fired.","“It was like somebody just punched me in the stomach,” Simmons said. She cried and begged, she said, telling them she needed the insurance and that her family would suffer.","She was offered two weeks severance ― if she signed a document promising not to sue. “I didn’t sign. I just think it was wrong. It was totally wrong,” she said. “Two weeks pay for what they did is wrong.”","Zeringue ― the woman who had complained about Cook years earlier ― also was offered two weeks severance when she was fired. She declined, too.","Interestingly, Cook retired less than a month later. It’s unclear why.","His colleagues threw him a going away party.","And just a few months later, during Christmas time in 2017, Cook returned to Monster’s Atlanta office dressed up as Santa Claus. Young women at the office sat in his lap and posed for pictures. One woman posted a shot on Facebook captioned #UncleTed.","Simmons, meanwhile, took her dismissal hard. She was so embarrassed about being fired that she stopped leaving her home during the day, not wanting anyone in her small Alabama hometown to ask her why she wasn’t working. “The first six months were awful,” she said. “If I needed to go out, I’d go at three or four in the morning or ten or 11 at night.”","Because she lost her job, Simmons’ husband, a 68-year-old who supervises utility crews in Tampa, has had to put off his retirement. He had relocated to Tampa temporarily to make a little extra cash before finishing his career. Now it’s unclear when he can come home.","“This has affected my marriage, my life. It’s been really tough on my family,” she said, breaking down in tears. Simmons is responsible for paying college tuition for her 21-year-old daughter. “My daughter worries all the time. I told her don’t worry about it; we’ll figure a way around it.”","Do you have a story to tell about sexual harassment or discrimination at Monster or another workplace?

While it may not be fancy or private, it’s got an air of sophistication and serenity.","What is this magical place? Well... Target, apparently.","It’s no secret that parents, particularly moms, love to love Target. They write rhapsodizing blog posts, create fan Instagram accounts, draw comics and tweet endlessly about their Target obsessions. At least one mom chose to take her maternity photos at a Target store, and another even gave birth to her child in one (albeit unintentionally).","But what exactly is it that makes Target so appealing to moms and dads?","We spoke to marketing experts, therapists and parents themselves to find out.","A Sense Of Escape","“I never thought dashing to Target without kids would feel like a mini-vacation, but it does. And sometimes that’s all a mom of little kids needs to recharge,” mom and blogger Jennifer S. White told HuffPost.","Indeed, many parents find that Target offers them an opportunity to escape the chaos and stress at home without feeling guilty … because, after all, they’re running errands and buying necessities (and some non-necessities, too) for their families.","“Target is close by and a more socially acceptable place for parents to sneak away to solo than, say, a bar,” said mom and blogger Samantha Taylor, who also told HuffPost she sees solo Target trips as “mini-vacations.”","Jennifer Cutler, an assistant professor of marketing at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management, believes Target offers a sense of “whimsical escapism” that particularly appeals to parents.","“Part of its brand is trying to make the shopping experience a treat. One thing that parents have in common is a shortage of time. Being able to reframe the drudgery of running errands as whimsical escapism is really powerful,” she told HuffPost, pointing out the colorful ― and even magical ― imagery in the brand’s marketing materials.","“It’s saying, ’Come to this magical place where you can get whatever your heart desires; a clean, friendly place with Starbucks coffee and popcorn waiting for you,’” Cutler added. “I think that really resonates because it joins a productive activity with something whimsical and almost vacation-like in the experience.”","The Sheer Convenience","The convenience and affordability of a big-box store are undeniable as well.","“Target is so addictive because it has everything you need: from batteries, to groceries, to cat litter. And it has a bunch of stuff you don’t need but really want when you see it, like super-cute earrings for you and cheap, adorable outfit separates for your kids,” Taylor explained. “We feel guilty about going on a frivolous shopping binge but not about throwing a $5 pair of clearance earrings in with the cleaning supplies inside our cart.”","Still, it goes beyond the convenience and low prices, which many major stores offer. The physical experience of being in a Target store is another reason parents give for their fandom.","“Walking into a Target is a mild high in itself,” said Taylor. “That food court and smell of popcorn. That cute little dog. That comfortingly simple logo. That Dollar Spot where everything is actually $3, but that’s OK.”","The blogger also also cited the presence of Starbucks in many Targets: “HELLO strolling the racks under the guise of shopping for necessities with a steaming Caramel Macchiato.”","The Visual Appeal","The neat appearance of the stores can also feel refreshing for parents, as households with young kids are not necessarily so clean and organized, said Mabel Yiu, a licensed marriage and family therapist and mother of twins.","“You walk into Target, and the lighting, the colors, even the smell really capture you because it feels great,” said Yiu. “It’s like it increases the dopamine in the brain. You see that everything is really well-organized and even color-coded. As a mom, my home doesn’t look like that. So you walk in and think, ‘This is really great.’”","Dad and blogger Beau Coffron echoed this sentiment. “They do a great job of keeping the aisles organized, so you don’t feel like you’re in the middle of a tornado with stuff everywhere, like some stores are,” he told HuffPost.","The look and feel of Target stores appeal to consumers’ different senses ― from the sound of upbeat music to the scent of coffee and popcorn. Rima Touré-Tillery, an assistant professor at the Kellogg School who studies the intersection of motivation and self-perception in marketing, said the inviting appearance of Target relates to the brand’s colors: red and white.","Research shows that people see red as a fun, fiery, daring color and “the color of love.” Meanwhile, white gives a sense of cleanliness, spaciousness and elegance.","“These associations are not things people consciously think about, but they influence you,” said Touré-Tillery. “So just being exposed to the red and white in the store can give you an impression of sophistication.”","Maybe that explains why people say “Tar-jay” to make the store sound fancier. Collaborations with high-end brands like Proenza Schouler, Missoni and Jason Wu also add to this classier image.","Store layouts and color schemes are typically very conscious choices meant to appeal to consumers.","“Brands aren’t stupid. They’re studying this, and the retail environment they’re trying to create is to maximize the experience, the memories, the emotion,” said the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania marketing professor Americus Reed, noting that there are design principles meant to pique shoppers’ curiosity and guide them through the store.","Something For Everyone","Store designs can also appeal to children shopping with their parents. “Aisles are designed a certain way. Things that are going to be important for kids are lower to the ground. That’s for a reason,” Reed told HuffPost.","In the case of Target, parents can use the presence of toys and other fun things for kids to their advantage ― by using them as potential rewards for good behavior in the store.","“I prefer to shop Target alone as a sort of pathetic mini-vacation, but if I bring my kids, I like to keep them strapped in to the baby seat whenever possible,” Taylor told HuffPost. “Usually I’ll reward them with a trip to the toy aisle, just to look, if they behave.”","Creating a memorable, appealing shopping experience is crucial in the age of online retail giants. Indeed, recent reports have shown disappointing profits for Target as it competes with Amazon.","“Behemoths like Amazon are commoditizing convenience. People don’t want to go out and be physically in stores as much anymore because you can just hop online and get a box in a few hours,” Reed said. “You have to create other experiences in a shopping context that are going to make it worthwhile to go out and do that instead of going to Amazon.com. So maybe that’s creating some more motivational impetus for these brands like Target to craft a richer experience for parents and children going in the store.”","Brand Loyalty","One way to combat the growing influence of Amazon happens to be another reason experts cited when exploring why parents are so obsessed with Target: identity loyalty.","“The concept is that there are some brands for which the brand itself transcends the functional features, the utilitarian benefits in terms of what it does, and it becomes something that is part of who you are,” Reed explained. “When the brand becomes part and parcel with some important aspect of your desired self-expression, then the brand’s identity and your own identity become fused. It’s like the brand is part of who you are, and you have loyalty to it because it’s a symbol of what you aspire to express to other people.”","Kellogg marketing professor Angela Lee echoed that. “Many young moms identify with Target, with the image of ‘fun and fashionable’ that the store projects. That’s what it means when one is a committed loyalist ― the brand becomes part of the self.”","When brands achieve identity loyalty, they essentially have a free marketing department. Loyal followers proselytize and also defend the brand against criticism, because an attack on the brand feels in some way like an attack on the self.","In some ways, one’s identity as a parent can become wrapped up in a store like Target.","“At the end of a shopping trip, you have shopped for many aspects of your life ― you got birthday gifts for a kid’s party, gifts for your in-laws, yoga pants for exercising, work clothes, etc. You walk out feeling very accomplished and competent,” Yiu explained. “And your self-image matches the idealized self you see in Target ads showing happy, competent parents.”","White told HuffPost she’s noticed many kids love Target almost as much as their parents do.","“Once I took my kids out for ice cream. It was a surprise, and I expected them to be thrilled,” White recalled. “They weren’t. They looked out the window, across the street to Target and said they wanted to go there for their ‘surprise’ instead.”","In this way, the store creates opportunities for parenting wins, ways to live up to an idealized image of a perfect parent.","The connection between Target and identity might also involve the company’s values and stances on specific issues ― like its support for breastfeeding mothers and transgender people.","White told HuffPost she supports the company’s attention to many issues that matter to parents. “Target has done an incredible job attempting to stay on top of current parental concerns, like clothing and gender, and making the store accessible for families with special needs.”","“They’re family conscious and socially conscious, so it’s a cool brand to be behind and something to be proud of,” said Kathy Morelli, a New Jersey-based mental health counselor.","Target as a company is clearly quite aware of its cult-like status among moms.","“Target is much more than a place that just sells stuff. We’re a meaningful part of the community and our guests’ lives. From our registry benefits to baby must-haves to the many ways moms can shop and get their orders quickly and all at affordable prices, we often hear that Target is her ‘happy place,’ and that’s a badge of honor we never take for granted,” Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer Rick Gomez told HuffPost.","The company has even played into its friendly image with family-focused initiatives, like their “First Target Run” onesies.","“[W]e see a number of moms share on social that their first outing with their new baby is often to Target ― it’s where they feel safe, comfortable, and know they can check off a few errands and maybe sneak in a treat or two for themselves,” said Gomez. “We decided to have a little fun with this and thank moms who registered at Target by sending them a surprise ‘First Target Run’ onesie for their new baby. It was a huge hit and a way to bring a little extra joy to moms during this special time.”","Don’t Forget The Dads","Of course, Target mania is not just a mom thing. With studies showing dads are more involved in their children’s lives than ever (and the growing number of same-sex couples raising kids), it’s no surprise many fathers are tweeting about their Target runs, too.","“Usually I feel great because I can pick up anything I want there, and there’s a location everywhere. So I can stop on my way home from work, or when I’m just trying to get my kids out of the house for a bit,” Coffron told HuffPost. “Let’s drink this Icee while we look at bikes and Easter candy, and also pick up an entertainment center on our way to the checkout.”","Coffron said he and his wife also go to Target on date nights. “We usually don’t have much time with our kids being babysat, so we grab a quick dinner and then go to Target. We are pretty much hopeless romantics, I guess,” he said. “But seriously it’s fun because we can goof off and be silly but also be efficient because we’ll just buy light bulbs at the same time.”","Reed said his 7-year-old daughter loves going to Target ― especially because she loves the popular “L.O.L. Surprise!” dolls you can buy there.","The professor said he’s more than happy to take her on his Target runs and occasionally indulge her with a toy.","“Parenting is the hardest job on the planet. Period,” he said. “Anything that makes life a little easier, that brings a little bit of joy to a child vis-à-vis what the parent is doing ― in this case, running errands ― is seen as this fantastic elixir. It’s fantastic. I can take her to Target and she’ll be happy, and I can also do some shopping and get some stuff done.”","Is There A Drawback?","Of course, there are always concerns about spending and unhealthful materialism when it comes to fanaticism around a specific brand, given that the underlying mission is to sell you more products.","“Unfortunately this Target movement is centered around consumerism, so I can’t say for sure if it’s good or bad,” Morelli told HuffPost.","But Touré-Tillery believes those concerns don’t really apply to a brand like Target.","“I think if we were talking about a luxury brand that sells thousand-dollar shoes, then that would be more relevant to the discussion. But Target is not a luxury brand. You’re going to buy toilet paper and yogurt because you need those kinds of things. And if you can go there and feel good about yourself and have fun in the process, it really doesn’t get better than that.”","A Supportive Community","To say it all boils down to materialism also ignores another big appeal of the Target experience, something money doesn’t necessarily buy: community.","Overworked parents ― particularly moms, who still bear most of the burden when it comes to household responsibilities ― find comfort in knowing they aren’t alone and tend to seek a sense of community","“Let’s face it. Moms still do most of the shopping, so it makes sense that they would be the ones to have this fun [Target fan] club,” said Touré-Tillery. Because women tend to be more active on social media than men are, it also makes sense that the social media component of Target fandom would seem more mom-focused.","“A lot of moms actually gather at Target, so it provides some social support,” said Yiu.","Jennifer White told HuffPost she finds a sense of comfort and community in her Target runs, even if she’s only shopping with her children.","“After my second child came along, errands became stressful, and overwhelming. Toting two young children, and all their supplies, suddenly I didn’t run a quick errand anymore. Nothing was ‘quick,’” White said.","“Many times when I attempted a cute, easy errand to Target and it turned into a migraine, I’d see other moms and we’d smile knowingly at each other, or we’d make jokes over our kids’ heads,” she added. “That felt something like the ‘village’ everyone wants but not all of us have.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5abd5a731f0000260616be28.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"The 'What Are Those?'

It’s a notoriously unwelcoming field for women of color, but she’s ready for it. Ideas for apps are already popping into her head, like one to streamline route planning for student bus systems.","A few hours each day, in addition to her usual classes at one of the city’s top public high schools, Rayford attends an academic and athletic youth program. She’s taken several tech-focused workshops at the nonprofit Downtown Boxing Gym, located on a stretch of road where many of the buildings have been torn down and greenery is reclaiming the empty spaces.","In addition to teaching kids proper combat footwork and punching techniques, the gym also offers free programs for academic achievement and career readiness. It’s where Rayford learned how to set up a wireless network, take apart a computer and test out a 3-D printer. She was failing math when she started at the gym as a sophomore; a tutor helped pull up her scores.","Rayford still occasionally trains with a boxing coach, but most days she heads straight to the gym’s computer lab to do homework or write scholarship essays. With no computer at home and unreliable internet, every minute counts.","If she doesn’t finish her schoolwork at the gym, she’ll set up shop on a computer at Cass Technical High School, occasionally skipping a class to complete an assignment for another teacher. There are other obstacles: A recent project required Microsoft Word, but the school had stopped paying for the software. So Rayford figured out a workaround, Google Docs, which she now uses to tap out essays on her phone at night.","“Everything is so zoomed in, and it’s harder to spell-check and make sure your paragraphs are spaced right,” she told HuffPost. “You know what you’re doing on a computer, compared to a phone.”","Cobbling together computer time frustrates Rayford, but it’s an ordinary burden for students in Detroit. The largely African-American city of 675,000 has the lowest rate of internet connection in the country. Nearly 40 percent of households have no home internet and more than 15 percent only have cellular data plans, according to U.S. census estimates. Twenty percent have no computer or smartphone. (Nationwide, 5 million school-age kids don’t have internet at home, according to the Pew Research Center.)","Recent research in Detroit indicates that most teens have some kind of access to the internet ― but far fewer have reliable internet and computers at home. Many students have more tenuous connections, relying on schools and libraries to get online, or else hopping on and off public WiFi connections from their mobile phones.","As technology becomes increasingly essential for achievement and employment tasks, advocates worry Detroit’s digital divide shuts students out of opportunities they desperately need ― most kids live in poverty, and young adult unemployment is more than double the national rate.","Connectivity is “the gateway to so many pieces of life and the economy that the lack of access to internet is really contributing to many of the disparities that we see in urban areas,” said Vernice Anthony, interim chief executive of Focus: Hope. The civil rights nonprofit offers education programs and job training, including information technology certifications.","National figures gloss over the real divide in Detroit’s internet ecosystem, Michigan State University researchers suggested in a January report. Instead of a total lack of internet access, they see a “mobile-only divide.” They mailed surveys about internet use to more than 500 residents in three neighborhoods. Nearly all respondents reported using the internet, which surprised William Dutton, MSU professor of media and information policy and co-author of the report. Dutton told HuffPost he was specifically impressed by teens’ ingenious strategies for getting online ― whether tracking public locations with open networks or befriending classmates with WiFi at home.","Nearly half the residents in the survey said they primarily used the internet on their phones. Many of them, particularly teens, don’t see that as a disadvantage ― but those users, with limited device capabilities and data caps, were less likely to report “productive” uses, such as homework and job searches.","“The strong dependence on mobile phones ― while it mitigates some of the worst digital divides somewhat ― may be holding Detroiters back,” the report warns.","Bridging the digital divide isn’t just about providing cheap, fast internet. Computer access matters, as Dutton explained. And tools aren’t that useful if students aren’t taught how to use them.","Qumisha “Q” Goss, who runs tech programs at the Parkman library branch near Focus: Hope, said adults often overlook kids’ digital literacy, assuming they’ll intuit technology they grew up with. But when students, who can be experts in social media, use library computers for school, she finds, they’re unfamiliar with basics like how to fill out a spreadsheet or how to double-space a document.","“That part is kind of heartbreaking for me, because I feel like they’re being neglected,” Goss said.","One of the classes Goss developed is Parkman Coders. She’s taught kids programming with Minecraft, a popular computer game, and by using cheap, cutting-edge hardware built for learning, like Raspberry Pi mini-computers and micro:bits. When former students rack up fees on overdue coding books, Goss is happy to forgive their fines.","Parkman and the Downtown Boxing Gym ignite some students’ untapped passion for tech and give useful digital skills to more. Of the 300 kids who have gone through the gym’s youth learning program, all have graduated high school, compared with a 78 percent graduation rate in Detroit’s public school district last year. And Parkman has students returning summer after summer for the coding programs.","A smattering of other local organizations are doing similar work or expanding digital equity. However, community programs ultimately serve only a fraction of Detroit’s disconnected students. (The gym currently serves 185 kids but has more than 800 on its waiting list.) Closing the digital divide on a broader level is more challenging.","Nine years ago, Focus: Hope and other partners taught computer skills to 6,000 residents, gave out thousands of discounted computers and worked with an initiative that brought free broadband to a few hundred people. Despite the program’s impact, it ended when federal funding dried up, and residents lost internet after the service provider went bankrupt.","Internet providers help some get past the cost hurdle, with $10 monthly plans for low-income families. One in 20 residents gets internet through Comcast Essentials, which also offers cheap laptops, free routers and classes. However, the program’s slow speeds still leave users behind national standards ― it offers subscribers download speeds of 15 megabits per second, lower than the 25 mbps definition for broadband internet used by the Federal Communications Commission. Focus: Hope tried to help people sign up for Comcast Essentials but ended its initiative due to lack of interest ― residents were turned off by the rigorous application requirements.","The failure of major internet providers to close the coverage gap spurred a grassroots movement, the Equitable Internet Initiative, in which local residents have built wireless networks serving dozens of families in three neighborhoods.","Community efforts could move the needle more if organizers collaborated and shared their knowledge, Goss and others said, and the city needs to take the lead on tackling the digital divide across all neighborhoods. Officials reportedly plan to release recommendations to expand internet access soon. The school district is also looking to improve digital learning.","Rayford aims to become one of those collaborators. She’s already envisioning what comes after her high school graduation: She’ll attend Wayne State University’s College of Engineering in Detroit and then plans to start a business using her engineering skills. Later she’ll give back by launching a community organization inspired by her grandmother ― who died of complications from alcoholism ― to support teen girls struggling with mental health issues. Rayford wants to teach them tech skills, unlocking the same doors for them that she’s walked through already.","For more content and to be part of the “This New World” community, join our Facebook Group.","HuffPost’s “This New World” series is funded by Partners for a New Economy and the Kendeda Fund.

His claims were backed up by two independent cybersecurity researchers, according to NBC.","A little more than a week before NBC’s report was published, the app tweeted:","Grindr officials told NBC that they were aware of the security issues Faden had uncovered and that they had changed their system to prevent access to data regarding blocked accounts.

In 2014, cybersecurity firm Synack found that Grindr allowed users to access profiles and locations of others anywhere in the world. That information, researchers wrote, could “ultimately unmask the identities” of Grindr users who wished to remain anonymous and put them at safety risk.","That same year, an anonymous tipster reportedly sent messages to Grindr users in countries that have anti-LGBTQ legislation in place or are otherwise hostile to queer people telling them that they could be targeted, persecuted or even murdered as a result of the app’s location sharing data.","“As part of the Grindr service, users rely on sharing location information with other users as core functionality of the application, and Grindr users can control how this information is displayed,” a spokesperson told HuffPost at the time. “As always, our user security is our top priority and we do our best to keep our Grindr community secure.”","UPDATE: After this story was published, Grindr’s Chief Technology Officer Scott Chen released a statement to HuffPost, which can be found below.","As a company that serves the LGBTQ community, we more than many, understand the delicate nature of our users’ privacy. Ensuring safety and security of our users is of paramount importance to Grindr. For many years we have worked with numerous international health, digital rights, and privacy organizations as well as community leaders through our Grindr For Equality program to develop and release many safety and security features specifically to help our users in places where it’s not safe to be LGBTQ.\n\nGrindr monitors the climate of LGBTQ rights and safety around the world. In territories where homosexuality is criminalized, or it is otherwise unsafe to be LGBTQ identified, we deliberately obfuscate the location-based features of our application to protect our users. We also publish safety guides in local languages across the world to encourage our users to protect themselves from those who would do us harm just because of who we are.\n\nLike any high-profile social network app, we face numerous hacks and attempted security breaches. We zealously defend against these attacks to maintain the safety and security of our users. We also leverage our impressive scale and global team of security researchers to verify and resolve any real security concern as quickly as possible. The company is in the process of implementing a bug bounty program to ensure potential security issues are responsibly disclosed in the future.\n\nThat said, anytime a user discloses their login credentials to an unknown third-party, they run the risk of exposing their own profile information, location information, and related metadata. We cannot emphasize this enough: we strongly recommend against our users sharing their personal login information with these websites as they risk exposing information that they have opted out of sharing.\n\nGrindr is a location-based app. Location is a critical element of our social network platform.

A bleating lamb is the first to greet Sandra Hennessee as she opens the van door and lets in the midday sun.","To get here, on an Amish farm in rural western Kentucky, Hennessee headed west from the small town of Mayfield and drove for miles on a two-lane road, passing churches, farms and open fields. With every bend and bump in the road, the wooden shelves inside the 27-year-old van creaked. With every stop, the hundreds of plastic-wrapped and paperback books on the shelves shifted.","Now on the farm, a woman dressed in a floor-length blue skirt, a black jacket, boots and a bonnet climbs inside. “Hi, honey,” Hennessee says. “What can I help you find?”","As the Graves County Public Library bookmobile librarian, Hennessee says she serves some of the most isolated areas of her community.

Now, there are fewer than 650, according to the most recent data from the Institute of Museum and Library Services, a research arm of the federal government.","Despite the decline, librarians say their services remain vital, especially in rural areas, where people often live far from their library branch and have limited internet access. Bookmobiles help close this gap by creating a traveling branch, said Michael Swendrowski, a board member of the Association of Bookmobile and Outreach Services and owner of Specialty Vehicle Services, which helps libraries design bookmobiles.","“There are tons of populations that don’t have access, who can’t get to the library, can’t get the internet,” he said. “Bookmobiles and outreach services are key to serving those people.”","Kentucky has 75 bookmobiles, the most of any state. In Graves County, Hennessee stops at day care centers and schools, bringing books to low-income children whose parents may not have time to stop by the library. She stops at nursing homes, whose residents may not be able to drive. And as access to high-speed internet becomes increasingly essential, she connects residents in remote areas to broadband through the bookmobile’s hotspot.","Most importantly, Hennessee says, is the sense of community and friendship she brings to every stop.","“Some of them, I’m the only person they talk to, or see,” she said.","While the number of bookmobiles has been dropping, librarians say that in some places interest is picking up as libraries look for ways to reach more patrons and prove their worth during tight budget years, and as people become more accustomed to having goods and services delivered to their doors.","This is true in urban and rural areas. King County, Washington, which includes Seattle, added most of its 16 mobile service vehicles, including bookmobiles and mobile computer labs, in the past decade, said Christine Anderson, the county library system’s outreach services coordinator. Other counties — in Oklahoma, New York, Louisiana and Virginia — have added more than one bookmobile in that time as well, according to a Stateline analysis of the institute’s data.","The King County library system gets a couple inquiries a month from librarians and others interested in getting their own bookmobiles, Anderson said.","“I get the sense there is a renaissance of bookmobile service,” she said.","Closing the Gap","Early on a recent crisp and sunny morning, Hennessee climbed into the 18-foot-long box van and tried to start the generator. It didn’t work. Her next try did. The 1991 Chevrolet van has seen better days. In 2014, it got a new engine and a fresh coat of black paint, but, she said, it still has problems.","Her first stop was on the edge of Mayfield at a day care center called the Kidstruction Zone. As she pulled into the driveway, the excited 4- and 5-year-olds’ faces appeared in the window on the day care center door. Soon, the children bounded toward the van — the first of two groups who would climb aboard.","This is what Hennessee calls her “bunches, bunches and more bunches.” She makes several stops at day care centers and schools, visiting each about twice a month. “I love my young’uns,” she said.","The preschoolers’ chatter filled the small space in the back of the van. A few children at a time climbed onto a step along the bookshelf to study the books. A small boy reached for one with a bus on the cover, called “Bus! Stop!” A girl chose a book of scary stories because, she said, it looked like Halloween. “A Christmas book again?” Hennessee asked another girl. “Oh yes, we love our Christmas stories.”","The preschoolers fit their tiny feet into footprint stickers on the floor, where they waited to check out their books. The children swap books with each other so they can have fresh reading material every night, said Nichole Gibson, director of the day care center. This helps encourage parents to read to their children, she said, when some may not make it a priority.","Like most rural areas in America, Graves County is a bit less educated and a bit poorer than the U.S. average. Most of the 37,000 county residents live outside of the county seat here in Mayfield, population 10,000. Many county residents work in manufacturing, or agriculture. After long workdays, Hennessee said, not many people here are interested in reading books other than the Bible.","About 32 percent of rural Americans said they hadn’t read a book in the past year, compared with about 23 percent of urban Americans, according to a 2016 Pew Research Center survey. (The Pew Charitable Trusts funds both the Center and Stateline.)","This may be, in part, due to lack of access to books. Nearly 1 in 5 people who live in non-metro areas live more than six miles from a public library, according to a recent study by Frank Donnelly, a geospatial data librarian at Baruch College at the City University of New York.","About 18 percent of bookmobiles operated in a rural area in 2015, according to a Stateline analysis of the Institute of Museum and Library Services data. And more are starting up. The rural library system of Summers County, West Virginia, last summer received $35,000 to buy a new bookmobile, in the form of a grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s rural development program. The New Mexico State Library bought two new bookmobiles last month to serve rural areas.","Bookmobile Renaissance","Leaving the day care center, Hennessee drives the bookmobile past a yellow sign with a black horse and buggy. “All right, we’re leaving civilization as we know it,” she says. A few Amish families are next on her stops.","Graves County is so expansive — one of the largest counties in the state — that Hennessee ends up driving about 500 to 700 miles a month. She’s racked up most of the 191,356 miles on the van over several years. Others have trouble driving the long van, she said, but to her, “it’s like an appendage.”","Just before lunch, she pulls in front of the house of Katie Wooley, a retired teacher who isn’t Amish but lives in the area, and starts scanning the shelves for books to take to her. “She likes cozy mysteries,” she said, pulling a book called “Banana Cream Pie Murder.” Hennessee opens the front cover and, when she sees the initials “KW,” puts it back. Her patrons often mark their books so they can remember what they’ve already read.","Wooley invites Hennessee in. “You caught me without my clothes on,” she says, dressed in a pink nightgown and slippers. She sits back in a burgundy recliner and Hennessee takes a wooden rocking chair. “So, what’s new in your neighborhood?” Hennessee asks her.","More Fun Than Work","In Graves County, Hennessee waves to other drivers as they pass. It took her a long time to build up relationships around town, she said, especially with the Amish families, who were hesitant to speak to her at first.","About a quarter of the library books that get checked out in the county are from the bookmobile. Last year, Hennessee averaged about 1,600 books a month.","The bookmobile is costing the county more as it ages, said Deana Gschwind, Graves County’s library director. But it’s such a staple, she said, and it fulfills such a need, it’s worth it.","Like all library services, the funding for bookmobiles across the country becomes threatened when budgets are tight, said Swendrowski, with the bookmobile association.","In Kentucky, Gov. Matt Bevin, a Republican, has proposed cutting all funds for local library operations from the state budget. Last year, the state gave about $2.5 million to local libraries, which was split among the 118 library districts in the state, said Dave Schroeder, advocacy chair for the Kentucky Public Library Association.","This won’t have a large impact on the Graves County library, or most libraries in the state, Schroeder said, because they receive most of their funding from local sources. But at least three library systems may close if the cuts happen, Schroeder said. The Legislature is still finalizing the budget.","Hennessee said she doesn’t cost the county much. Last year, she made about $29,000. But, most days, she considers it more fun than work.","On the Amish farm, with the hens and the lamb, the woman climbs on board, followed by three of her children. “I’ve got a request,” she says. “Any books on vegetable gardening?”","“I’ll take a look,” Hennessee says. “I got some gardening I just put on here a few days ago.”","Hennessee often spends time with the Amish children doing crafts, like painting and building birdhouses. She has an idea for the spring, but wants to run it by their mother first. “We’re gonna make kites,” Hennessee says. “Can you all fly kites?” “Oh, yeah,” the woman responds.","For today, she has a smaller craft in mind. “Come on, kiddos,” she says, handing them each a plastic baggie with foam paper that can be tacked together into a tiger. Hennessee says she doesn’t try to be educational — that’s for school.","“I try to instill that love of reading,” Hennessee said. “Not, ‘you have to read.’ And if you like to read, you’ll be a lifelong reader.”","After she has made all her stops for the day, she pulls off on the side of the road, grabs the broom on the van, and sweeps out clumps of dried mud. Next, she’s headed to an Amish Tupperware party.","“Technically, this is not part of my job,” she said a few minutes later, steering the van up the dirt driveway. “Sometimes, you just have to be fluid and cool that way. I guess, in a sense, it’s just being part of the community.”","Stateline home page","Sign up for exclusive state policy reporting and research"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5abe920e1f00002a0616bf76.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"'Roseanne' Reboot Snags More Viewers Than 1997 Season Finale","authors":"Jenna Amatulli","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/roseanne-reboot-ratings_us_5abbbf36e4b03e2a5c787995","short_description":"The show hit 18 million viewers, which is, as one Twitter user said, \"Big Bang Theory territory.\"","date":"2018-03-28"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"TECH","headline":"Facebook Still Allows Discriminatory Housing Ads, Despite Pledge To Crack Down: Lawsuit","authors":"Hayley Miller","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/facebook-discriminatory-housing_us_5abb89ede4b04a59a3130a37","short_description":"Landlords using the platform's ad technology can exclude women and families with children from viewing rental ads, according to the complaint.","date":"2018-03-28"},"articleContent":["Facebook continues to enable landlords and real estate brokers to post discriminatory housing ads, despite its promises to crack down on such practices in 2016, according to a new lawsuit.","The social media platform creates “pre-populated” lists of people that allow advertisers to exclude certain types of consumers, the National Fair Housing Alliance (NFHA) contends in a lawsuit filed Tuesday against Facebook. This includes barring women and families with children from viewing or receiving rental ads, the group says.","By allowing these options, Facebook is violating the Fair Housing Act, which protects people from discrimination when renting, buying or securing financing for a housing, the lawsuit alleges.","The Fair Housing Act, passed in 1968, specifically covers “discrimination because of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, disability and the presence of children,” according to the Department of Urban Housing and Development.","In October 2016, a ProPublica report found Facebook illegally allowed advertisers to discriminate based on race. The NFHA sent Facebook a warning the following month that the platform appeared to violate the Fair Housing Act. In response, Facebook vowed to change its advertising options. But the company didn’t do enough, according to the NFHA lawsuit.","Advertisers can still choose to “exclude” certain types of families with children (“parents with preteens,” “parents with toddlers,” etc.), as well as some women (“moms of preschool kids,” “corporate moms,” etc.). Users with certain interests related to “disability” or “national origin” (such as “Disabled American Veterans” and “Telemundo”) may also be excluded.","The NFHA, as well as the Fair Housing Justice Center, Housing Opportunities Project for Excellence, Inc. and Fair Housing Council of Greater San Antonio are the four plaintiffs in the lawsuit, which was filed Tuesday in New York City at the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.","“Facebook’s use and abuse of user data for discriminatory purposes needs to stop,” Lisa Rice, president and CEO of NFHA, said in a statement. “It is already a challenge for women, families with children, people with disabilities and other under-served groups to find housing. ... Facebook ought to be opening doors to housing opportunities instead of closing them.”","“There is absolutely no place for discrimination on Facebook,” a spokesman for the company told HuffPost in an email Wednesday. “We believe this lawsuit is without merit, and we will defend ourselves vigorously.”","The lawsuit comes as Facebook faces mounting backlash over its privacy policies and apparent failure to protect user data.","Earlier this month, The New York Times and The Observer reported that the British voter-profiling firm Cambridge Analytica obtained and exploited more than 50 million Facebook users’ personal data. The social media company reportedly allowed a researcher to gain access to the data and then failed to follow up on how the data was used for more than two years.","Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is expected to testify before the House Energy and Commerce Committee about the Cambridge Analytica disaster next month.","Read the National Fair Housing Alliance’s full complaint against Facebook below:"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5abb93ad1e00003b137aff5b.png?cache=FWJzrn6E9I&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Spurned By Top Lawyers, Trump's Defense Elevates Washington Outsider","authors":"Karen Freifeld, Reuters","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-lawyer-outsider-ekonomou_us_5abbb055e4b04a59a3137656","short_description":"Many top-tier lawyers are shying away from representing Trump in Mueller's Russia probe.","date":"2018-03-28"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Student Marchers Rally In Paul Ryan's Hometown For Gun Law Reform","authors":"Antonia Blumberg","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/wisconsin-students-march-paul-ryan-gun-reform_us_5abbd9cfe4b03e2a5c78a1f9","short_description":"After a trek of 50-plus miles, they're challenging young people around the country to take up the charge.","date":"2018-03-28"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"U.S. Judge Refuses To Toss Suit Against Trump On Foreign Payments","authors":"Andrew Chung, Reuters","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-emoluments-lawsuit_us_5abbd965e4b04a59a313cf71","short_description":"The District of Columbia and the state of Maryland filed the lawsuit last June.","date":"2018-03-28"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Mitt Romney Says He's More Of A Hawk Than Trump On Immigration","authors":"Willa Frej","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mitt-romney-hawk-immigration-trump_us_5abb5daae4b06409775b60ee","short_description":"DACA recipients need to justify their right to remain in the United States, he said.","date":"2018-03-28"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"COMEDY","headline":"Conan O'Brien Takes Evangelicals To Church With Donald Trump Porn Gag","authors":"Lee Moran","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/conan-obrien-donald-trump-porn-mainstream_us_5abb94cbe4b03e2a5c780222","short_description":"The host explored claims that evangelicals are \"helping to bring porn into the mainstream.\"","date":"2018-03-28"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"BLACK VOICES","headline":"6 Fired At Howard University For Misconduct Involving Need-Based Tuition Funds","authors":"Sara Boboltz","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/6-fired-at-howard-university-for-embezzling-need-based-tuition-funds_us_5abbe29ce4b03e2a5c78b3b6","short_description":"A blogger alleged financial aid employees misappropriated nearly $1 million just a day before the announcement.","date":"2018-03-28"},"articleContent":["Howard University President Wayne Frederick confirmed Wednesday that for nearly a decade, financial aid officials had misappropriated funds earmarked for low-income students.","The announcement came one day after an anonymous blogger accused university officials of abusing funds amounting to around $1 million in a now-suspended Medium post.","Six university employees have been fired, Frederick said. He did not reveal how much financial aid had been misappropriated.","The Medium writer alleged that Frederick had been aware of the scandal since at least May 2017. Seemingly corroborating that account, Frederick said after he first learned about the alleged misconduct in December 2016, he commissioned an outside auditor to look into it, leading to a May 2017 audit report.","The auditor found that university grants were given to employees who also received tuition discounts from 2007 to 2016, resulting in payments that well exceeded the cost of attendance.","“An investigation of individual employee actions was completed in September 2017 and as a result, six employees have been fired for gross misconduct and neglect of duties. We will refer this matter for criminal prosecution, as appropriate,” Frederick said in the statement.","Frederick added he reported the problem to the Department of Education in July. A Department of Education representative did not immediately return HuffPost’s request for comment.","The Medium blogger cited an unnamed student whistleblower who once worked in the financial aid office and noticed irregularities in grant dispersals. According to the post, a different student employee at the financial aid office allegedly received more than $400,000 in financial aid awards over four years.","The Medium post gave the name of a former financial aid office student-employee as Tyrone Hankerson Jr., and said he received need-based tuition aid and a special scholarship. Hankerson later responded through his attorney in a statement shared by ABC News on Twitter, saying, “Please know that I have done nothing illegal or wrong. When the truth comes out it will be confirmed that I followed all rules and protocol with the approval of the, then, financial aid officers in any grants, scholarships or awards given to me as a student who attended class all year round and traveled abroad.”","The news sparked an outpouring of anger and frustration from Howard students and alumni, with many asking why it took so long for action to be taken.","Juan McFarland, a senior at Howard involved in the student group HU Resist ― which aims to hold administrative officials accountable ― told HuffPost he was “disappointed but not surprised” to learn about the misappropriation of funds.","″We’ve had suspicions about mishandling of funds based on how many people always never received their financial aid on time,” McFarland said, “and also based on how many fees were added to our accounts out of nowhere.”","“The energy on campus is really high,” he said, adding that more of his classmates have been motivated to demand change at the school.","The university has been plagued by a series of administrative issues, leading to mistrust between administrators and swaths of the student body.","Frederick was slammed on campus last year for taking meetings with the Trump administration that some saw as a betrayal in light of the president’s past comments about black Americans. In January, school officials postponed classes for more than a week over heating system problems. Earlier this month, Frederick prompted criticisms over his response to a student who emailed him with deep concerns about whether she would be able to secure a spot in university housing ― an reportedly scarce resource. Frederick had told the student her “tone and tenor” was “inappropriate.”","HU Resist demanded a number of specific fixes in a letter to Howard administration this week. The group is specifically calling for Frederick and the school’s board of trustees to step down, and it would like students to have more say in administrative affairs.","In response to the financial aid scandal, Howard plans to implement several new accountability measures. These include greater transparency in how much aid is awarded, increased oversight of the financial aid office and enhanced training for financial aid employees.","“While this has been a very difficult and disappointing situation, I know our campus community deserves better and I am committed to ensuring that each of our campus offices operate with integrity and are the best that higher education has to offer,” Frederick concluded his statement."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5abbf3482000007d06eb34a7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"QUEER VOICES","headline":"Imagine Dragons Singer Makes Plea For LGBTQ Equality In Brazil","authors":"Curtis M.

But the 45 percent who said global warming poses a serious threat in their lifetimes stayed steady between 2017 and 2018.","Public opinion has seesawed slightly over the years, but the long-term trend is overwhelmingly toward the scientific consensus that climate change is real, man-made and dangerous. Gallup found that 66 percent of Americans understand that scientific evidence shows the Earth’s temperatures rising, and 64 percent acknowledge that burning fossil fuels, deforestation and industrial farming are the cause.","The results echo 2016 survey data from Yale University’s Program on Climate Change Communication, which found 69 percent know global warming is happening and 52 percent understand humans are triggering it.","Still, the shift, recorded during a week of telephone surveys earlier this month of 1,041 adults across all 50 states and the District of Columbia, mirrors surging climate denialism among Republicans. Just 35 percent of Republicans understand that humans cause global warming, down from 40 percent in 2017, while 34 percent said the effects of climate change have already started, 7 points less than the previous year.","The findings come just months after historic hurricanes wreaked havoc on Puerto Rico, Florida and Texas, and California’s largest wildfire on record killed 18 people and scorched more than 280,000 acres of land. Yet the disasters, which scientists said were made worse by warming global temperatures, seem to have stoked further debate over the causes of climate change and the policies to address it.","President Donald Trump has repeatedly mocked climate science over the past year, suggesting winter weather disproved long-term warming trends, as his administration gutted funding for climate programs and slashed the few regulations in place to curb greenhouse gas emissions. The Republican Party, the only major political party in the developed world to make rejecting climate science a platform issue, has doubled down on the issue as megadonors such as the fossil fuel magnate Koch brothers and the right-wing billionaire Mercers have increased their political spending.","The political debate over climate change, propagated by years of Big Tobacco-style misinformation campaigns funded by the fossil fuel industry, does not mirror the scientific debate. Ninety-seven percent of peer-reviewed research agrees with the conclusion that human-caused emissions are enshrouding the planet in heat-trapping gases, and a research review published in November 2016 found significant flaws in the methodologies, assumptions or analyses used by the 3 percent of scientists who concluded otherwise.","Perhaps in part because Trump has proved such an agitational avatar for climate denialism, Democrats’ political opinions on global warming trended overwhelmingly toward the scientific consensus. Just 4 percent believed warnings of global warming have been exaggerated, down from 10 percent in 2017. The number of Democrats who said humans caused global warming inched up 2 points to 89 percent, and 82 percent said the effects of climate change have already begun, up from 73 percent the previous year. The share of Democrats who said most scientists believe global warming is occurring stayed steady at 86 percent.","That suggests Democrats could run on much more aggressive climate policies, particularly in primary battles. The party, however, has failed to rally around a national strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The two most significant pieces of climate legislation introduced in Congress this year have embraced conservative approaches and gave exemptions to major polluters. Even in liberal states under Democratic control, climate policy has proved hard to pass, as the failure of Washington state’s proposed statewide carbon tax showed.","Yet the party’s base appears to be more unified than ever around belief in climate change. Roughly 8 in 10 Democrats fell into the category of “Concerned Believers,” according to Gallup. Women, younger Americans and college graduates, all key demographics for the Democrats, were all more likely than their counterparts to be Concerned Believers."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aba92192000001311eb329e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"George W.

The White House provided reporters with background information about Jackson that touts his expertise in medicine, but there’s little to suggest that would be a likely nominee to run the sprawling Veterans Affairs Department ― a place known for bureaucratic mismanagement.","VoteVets, a progressive organization representing veterans affairs, said it was troubled with the lack of information surrounding Jackson’s ability to lead.","“Other than a total lack of awareness of where he stands on any issue, we are also concerned that he has never managed an agency like the VA,” Will Fischer, VoteVet’s director of government relations, said in a statement. “Now is not the time for people who need training wheels.”","A political moderate, Shulkin favored a more measured approach that involved introducing private care options only to offset long waiting times at veterans hospitals and only with the department’s approval.","Shulkin appeared to think that the investigation into his trip spending was an effort by opponents in the administration “to undermine the department from within.”","Shulkin is the latest in a string of departures from the Trump administration. On March 22, Trump announced by tweet that national security adviser H.R. McMaster would be replaced by former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton. According to a March 22 Politico report citing two top administration officials, the decision surprised White House chief of staff John Kelly, who had been preparing to ax McMaster at the same time as Carson and Shulkin.","One week before, the president said he had decided to fire Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and replace him with CIA Director Mike Pompeo.\n\nNational security adviser Michael Flynn stepped down in February 2017 after less than a month on the job, following revelations that he discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia with that country’s ambassador before Trump’s inauguration.\n\nIn May, the president fired FBI Director James Comey, who had been leading an investigation into whether Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 election.

Their defense attorneys, in turn, are putting the FBI on trial ― accusing the nation’s premier law enforcement agency of improperly targeting the three men due to their conservative ideology.","It’s common for defense attorneys to suggest their clients were wrongfully singled out by biased law enforcement officials. And to be sure, there’s nothing wrong with healthy skepticism about law enforcement and the FBI.","But the situation here is striking: A U.S. president has taken pains to undermine the FBI (declaring that the bureau’s reputation is “in Tatters—worst in History!”), and defense attorneys for accused terrorists are seeking to capitalize on that reality. This is happening as the president is trying to neuter a special counsel probe that’s already resulted in multiple charges against and guilty pleas from a variety of his associates. The government, meanwhile, will have to deal with jurors primed to believe a conspiracy theory fundamentally at odds with the facts ― namely, that the FBI is a hotbed of liberalism that worked behind the scenes to somehow try to stop Trump’s election.","Supporters of the FBI have long expressed concern about the effects of Trump’s attacks in federal courtrooms. Former Attorney General Eric Holder warned that the “long-term negative collateral consequences are substantial” and worried that Trump’s attacks on the FBI would sow doubts among jurors. Thomas O’Connor, the president of the FBI Agents Association, told HuffPost that such attacks “clearly trickle down to the person, the agent, the analyst, the FBI employee on the street, in the field offices.”","The trickle-down effect was on display during jury selection and opening arguments in Wichita last week, as potential jurors echoed complaints about the FBI voiced by Trump and conservative media figures like Sean Hannity.","One potential juror expressed concerns about honesty and corruption at the top levels of the FBI. Another in the jury pool had concerns about former FBI Director James Comey and former Deputy Director Andrew McCabe ― both Republicans ― and said he personally questioned the stability and integrity of the organization. A third person said he thinks many Americans are concerned about the decisions being made at the top of the FBI, and a fourth potential juror said he’d grown up wanting to be an FBI agent, but he now believes top bureau officials have engaged in wrongdoing. Yet another potential juror, a concealed carry supporter, said he held a negative view of the FBI due to recent events.","Those potential jurors with concerns about the FBI’s prior leadership said they would be able to distinguish between the bureau’s leadership and the work of the agents in the field. No prominent FBI detractors during jury selection made it into the final jury. But their airing of their views on the FBI illustrated a new challenge for federal prosecutors in the Trump era.\n","In most criminal trials, prosecutors would likely be happy to have conservatives on a jury, since they’re more likely to be strong supporters of law enforcement. But now, with fewer than one-third of Trump voters saying they have even a “fair amount” of trust in the FBI, conservative jurors are more of a gamble ― especially in a case that involves Islam, guns and immigration.","Assistant U.S. Attorney Anthony Mattivi, the Kansas-based federal prosecutor leading the case, told one set of jurors that “the FBI is kind of a hot-button issue right now” as he questioned jurors about their views on the bureau.","In opening arguments before a nearly all-white jury, defense attorneys argued that their clients were unfairly targeted by a biased FBI. Richard Federico, a federal public defender who previously represented Guantanamo detainees when he was a JAG Corps officer, skillfully weaved a narrative for jurors suggesting his client was a victim of a government conspiracy.","Federico said it was the FBI that plotted and conspired and targeted the defendants, hoping to make an example of them because of their political beliefs.","“Curtis Allen sits before you today because of what he thought, because of what he said, and because of who he associated with,” Federico said.","In a turn of phrase reminiscent of Trump, Federico said the defendants’ discussion of killing Muslim “cockroaches” amounted to “locker room talk.”","HuffPost will have continuing coverage of the trial from Wichita this week.","Ryan Reilly is HuffPost’s senior justice reporter, covering the Justice Department, federal law enforcement, criminal justice and legal affairs.

They mine coal and produce coal-fired power.","The environmental groups analyze how much money the banks have pumped into the top 30 companies operating in each category of extreme fossil fuels and grade them from A to F in each category based on an analysis of the banks’ publicly available policies on fossil fuels.","This is the ninth annual report, and the news is not good, especially when it comes to U.S. and Canadian banks.","“The first year after the adoption of the Paris Climate Agreement, was a year of progress. 2017 was a year of backsliding,” the report said.","Financing for extreme fossil fuels by the big banks increased 11 percent, from $104 billion in 2016 to $115 billion in 2017, according to the report. Three of them ― Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) and JPMorgan Chase ― were identified as the “biggest backsliders,” meaning they showed the greatest increases in such financing. All three tout their commitments to clean energy and environmental protection.","But “every single dollar that these banks provide for the expansion of the fossil fuel industry is a dollar going to increase the climate crisis,” said Stephen Kretzmann, executive director of Oil Change International.","U.S. and Canadian dominance in extreme fossil fuel financing may have political roots, suggested Alison Kirsch, climate and energy research coordinator at Rainforest Action Network. “Banks [in these countries] might be emboldened by the political leaders that are pro fossil fuels,” she said.","Tar sands received by far the biggest increase, reaching nearly $47 billion in bank financing in 2017 ― a hike of 111 percent on the previous year. The report identified RBC, TD and JPMorgan Chase as the key financial institutions injecting cash into tar sands projects. Those include the embattled Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain pipeline from Alberta to British Columbia, Canada, which indigenous groups are protesting.","Liquefied natural gas (LNG) saw $45 billion in bank financing, with Morgan Stanley identified as one of the top lenders. LNG is often pitched by advocates as a weapon in the climate change fight, because it can have lower emissions than coal and oil. However, the fuel is predominantly made up omethane, a very potent greenhouse gas, and it doesn’t take much methane to leak during operations to give LNG a bigger carbon footprint than other fossil fuels.","When it comes to coal, Chinese banks remain the top funders, while Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank lead the pack among Western lenders, according to the report.","“Coal financing has essentially stagnated,” Kirsch said. But she added that wasn’t good enough. Financing for coal should be dropping “towards a phase-out goal of zero,” she said.","The upward tick in extreme fossil fuel financing runs counter to indications that global reliance on fossil fuels may have peaked. The cost of renewables like solar and wind energy has plummeted, and energy storage is burgeoning with the world’s largest lithium ion battery coming online in Australia late last year. Countries such as the U.K., China and France and states including California have all announced plans to move away from combustion engines and embrace electric vehicles.","Meanwhile, hundreds of coal plants are shuttering as they become economically unviable. “It’s still far from game over for the fossil fuel industry, but the game has drastically changed,” the report said.","There is some good news from the report, said Kirsch, who praised some banks in Europe for “really bold policy movement.” In particular, she pointed to the French bank BNP Paribas, which last year pledged to stop financing shale and oil sands projects.","“The financial sector overall is not blind to the weakness of the oil and gas industry ... but we’re just not seeing the action on policies come quick enough,” Kirsch added. She called on banks to take the immediate first step of stopping the financing of fossil fuel expansion.","Banks cannot shirk their role in fighting climate change, said Catherine Howarth of U.K.-based nonprofit ShareAction. “The financing decisions of banks are utterly critical to climate outcomes and to the pace of decarbonization in the global economy. Bank boards should be held accountable on the financing of high carbon projects,” she said.","For their part, several big banks contacted by HuffPost insisted that they are committed to clean energy. Deutsche Bank referred to its 2016 commitment to no longer finance new coal mining or coal-fired plant construction or expansion.","A TD spokeswoman said the bank had committed to provide some $77.5 billion in financing for low-carbon initiatives by 2030. “TD is taking clear steps to help accelerate the development of a low-carbon economy, while recognizing the importance of responsibly developing conventional energy, vital to North America’s economic strength and security,” she said.","A Goldman Sachs spokeswoman said that the bank “is committed to mobilizing capital to scale up clean energy” and noted that it has provided more than $30 billion in clean energy financing and investment since 2016. She also said Goldman Sachs applies “enhanced due diligence” to coal investments, which includes looking at companies’ environmental track records, evaluating ecological impacts, and considering local community and human rights.","RBC and Morgan Stanley did not immediately reply to requests for comment.

Don’t represent me on TV because I don’t look like Chow Young Fat? Like f**k you, dude!\"","date":"2018-03-28"},"articleContent":["Jimmy O. Yang has made a name for himself on comedy series “Silicon Valley,” portraying the awkward and notoriously douche-y, heavily accented app developer Jian-Yang, who’s also a Chinese immigrant.","Yang is not a notoriously douche-y, heavily accented app developer in real life. He is, however, an immigrant from Hong Kong who’s no stranger to the painfully uncomfortable moments that come with assimilating to American culture.","The 30-year-old, who came to the U.S. when he was a teen, still remembers the confusion he experienced during those formative years. On top of carving a space for himself in a new world, Yang says he constantly walked the line between working toward his own hopes and dreams ― a very American idea ― and pleasing his parents ― an ever-important pillar of Chinese culture.","His complex mish-mash of identity is documented in his new comedic book “How to American: An Immigrant’s Guide to Disappointing Your Parents,” which was released earlier this month. As the political debate over immigration policy roars on under the Trump administration, Yang says his book attempts to “humanize” the immigrant experience. It’s the good, the bad, and the awkward moments of a new American that every human being can relate to.","Yang sat down with HuffPost to chat about his own immigrant experience, Asian masculinity, and the untold impact that one movie, “Ninja Assassin,” had for Asian men.","Your book is entitled “How To American,” so at what point did you feel that you had successfully “Americaned?” When did you feel you could claim the American identity as your own?","I think when I joined my fourth fantasy football league, I thought, “I know what’s going on now.” [Laughs] Really, the big moment was when I went against my parents’ will. Up until that moment I felt, in a way, very Asian ― doing something that I deep down didn’t want to do just to please my parents because it was a real job to them and to Chinese culture. When I quit my internship and started doing standup to pursue my dreams and do that full time ― I feel like that’s when I “Americaned.”","Your book includes these very Chinese references ― like the tiny stool that people sit on while preparing vegetables ― that Asian-Americans never really see in books. It’s something so specific and insider-y. Why do you feel it was important for you to weave these elements into your story?","Everybody talks about that stool! I think one of the reasons I wanted to write this book is there isn’t a lot of this material out there. I wanted people to relate. When I went to my grandpa’s house, where everything was Asian inside but the outside world was very American, it was very confusing. You feel lost. You feel like you’re the only one going through it because you don’t see a lot of that representation anywhere else. An American family can look at a TV show like “Everybody Loves Raymond” and go, “Oh, my dad does that too!” We didn’t have that. We have more and more of that now, but still it’s on the surface. ...","I want this book to be not just relatable to immigrant people and Chinese kids, but also tell a really honest, first-person, point-of-view story of an immigrant assimilating to this country. Immigration is in the media and the news right now and people talk about it in a partisan way, a political way. And that’s just not really a reference for most Americans of a real immigrant story, so I think it’s important to share that with them. I just want this book to show a real experience and then they can come up with a more informed opinion on immigration. ... I want to humanize the process of immigration ― in an honest, easy-to-read humorous way.","No matter how long we Asians are in the U.S., or even if we’re born here, we’re often just seen as Asian immigrants in the eyes of many non-Asians. But as Constance Wu, who’s in “Crazy Rich Asians” with you, pointed out, there’s a distinction between the Asian experience and the Asian-American experience. When you first immigrated here, did you notice the contrast?","...We all go through the same experience to some degree. When I became an American citizen, nothing’s changed because I’m still Asian. Nobody’s going to look at me as an American before an Asian person ― at least for now. If I go to Italy, or even Japan, nobody’s going to look at me and say, “Look, it’s an American person! Look at his cool passport! Rocky Balboa!” and give me a high five. ... But when I first came here, one of the things that was most painful was not just that I would go up to a group of white kids or black kids and they didn’t accept me because I didn’t speak English well enough, it was when I went up to other Asian kids who were born here and they shunned me even more. They themselves don’t want to get made fun of and be associated as a foreign person as I am. I understand it, especially when you’re a kid you just wanna be normal and fit in ― why would you want to be a foreign kid? But that’s tough.","Even in Hollywood, in acting in general, there’s this discussion of character representations and ethnic representations. I know some actors who will not even audition for a role with an Asian accent. I empathize with that but I completely disagree with that because that’s the same kid who didn’t want to hang out with me in high school or middle school ― that Asian-American kid who didn’t want to hang out with the foreign kid because they think it makes them look bad. I understand the whole constant foreigner stereotype but for me it’s important to portray immigrant characters like Jian-Yang and Danny Meng with humanity. It’s maybe a better thought to change the perception of an accent than to avoid it all together. I take offense [when people don’t go for parts with accents] ― it’s like saying, “I’m better than my immigrant brother with an accent.”","I wanted to get into the character of Jian-Yang. In the Asian-American community, he is divisive. Some, including one media watchdog, have labeled him a trope or a collection of stereotypes. Do you feel there’s any truth to that? Or do you think there’s much more to Jian-Yang?","Jian-Yang at the end of the day is a foreign guy like I was. First of all, I play the accent really real. A lot is taken from my mother, and a lot is taken from my uncles and relatives back home in Shanghai. It’s not just a shitty impression of a Cantonese Bruce Lee accent, it’s a very specific Mandarin accent. And then the character itself, maybe in the beginning when he only had a few words, few lines, [he was a trope], but I never tried to play him as a stereotype at all. This is me ― a lot of stuff was a parallel to my own life. Like on the first day of school, when I heard the pledge of allegiance and I just followed along because I didn’t know what was going on. Jian-Yang does that quite a bit ... you’ve got to find the right motivation, the right parallels.","I think as the character develops, he becomes a much more three-dimensional character. Beyond just the accent, he’s just kinda an asshole now and he’s funny. ... I get where [the criticism’s] coming from but is it warranted? I don’t know. For me, I always play these characters as if they’re just a version of myself 15 years ago.","Look, to be honest, when certain movies like “Ninja Assassin” came out, that had a sexy, sexy Asian man with a six-pack, that made some people think, “Maybe I should go out there and date an Asian dude.” And that did pretty good for us in a way of representation. But if you look at it, any TV show, let’s just talk about white people ― there’s a whole gamut of white people. ... They’re all different people but when Thomas [Middleditch] is playing a nerdy character, does he take shit for it? No, because there are a million other white people who play good-looking characters or whatever.","I think people get sensitive, and I get it because there’s just not enough representation. So I somehow carry a lot of weight. I’m not a good-looking guy in general. What are you going to tell me? Don’t represent me on TV because I don’t look like Chow Young Fat? Like fuck you, dude! I’m just a quirky, funny dude. Are you saying a fat, geeky Asian dude can’t represent you on TV? Fuck you, that’s who he is, and he could be a good actor.","Really at the end of the day, certain movies like “Crazy Rich Asians” ― I think that’s gonna be huge because that’s the one movie that shows a whole gamut of people. Me and Ken [Jeong] are both in that movie and we’re really comfortable just being the funny guys. Then you have other people who play the good-looking guys. And you have tall, short, fat, whatever. We can just be ourselves.","I’d like to touch on masculinity. There’s a debate in the Asian-American community over whether Asian-American feminists are supporting Asian men enough? Do you think they are? Do you think that should even be part of their responsibility?","Go fuck whoever you want! I think everyone should support Asian men and men of all kinds. But is your preference white dudes because you grew up watching Brad Pitt? I can’t blame you, I grew up watching Jennifer Aniston, too.","Look, I think representation is extremely important but people have their preferences. You can’t tell someone, “You need to go date an Asian guy!!!” Go ahead, date whoever you want. At the end of the day, representation forms people’s opinions a lot of the time.","Girls had the pickings out there for Johnny Depp, Brad Pitt, Mark Wahlberg ― those guys spoke to them in their teenage years. We just don’t have that many choices for Asians. There just aren’t that many of us out there. Hopefully we can all kinda be part of that mainstream society and be part of people’s psyche coming up in the future.","In your time as an actor, has there been a shift in how people have seen Asian men?","Let’s talk about my life in general ― I swear ever since “Ninja Assassin” came out, I got laid a little more [laughs]. Seriously! That’s why i’m saying [representation] is super important. But I’m sorry if I’m not super fucking good looking!","Maybe kids growing up now, after they watch “Crazy Rich Asians”, they can say what I said ― I got laid so much more after “Crazy Rich Asians”! Or K-pop! These things that make Asians look good.","... At the end of the day, Ken Jeong, Bobby Lee, myself, we might not be the hunky dudes but I’d like to think that we help in that equation too by helping Asians be more normal on your TV screen and be funny. Once again, I apologize I’m not good looking. I apologize I look like a geek with glasses in real life. And I apologize to the people who say I’m making Asians look bad. But also, fuck ’em.","We’re all looking forward to “Crazy Rich Asians.” We obviously don’t get a ton of films with an all-Asian cast. Do you feel a lot of pressure for this film to succeed?","I want it to succeed badly. There’s nothing more that I want than for this film to succeed. But do I feel pressure? As an actor you’re kinda numb to everything. For every movie you shoot, you can’t expect an Oscar.","The camaraderie we built shooting this movie ― it made me so proud to be Asian even just making this movie. We have all the most beautiful, the most talented and funny Asians coming from all over the world for this movie.","With “Crazy Rich Asians,” we formed our own clique and we hang out all the time ... that’s our family now. If people can just feel an ounce of that. I hope it’s going to be a box office hit, but I think either way, when people watch it, especially Asian people, they’re going to feel some kind of bond. Already just making the movie is a huge success."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ababc031f00002d0016ba38.jpeg?cache=ifqZ8JIz48&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Helen Hunt Gives Promising Update On ‘Mad About You’ Reboot","authors":"Ron Dicker","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mad-about-you-reboot-helen-hunt_us_5abb643be4b06409775b705f","short_description":"Now this is encouraging.","date":"2018-03-28"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Here's What Is Coming To Netflix In April 2018","authors":"Todd Van Luling","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/netflix-coming-arriving_us_5aba4eede4b0decad04e41f4","short_description":"Also, here are the shows and movies you've got to watch before they leave.","date":"2018-03-28"},"articleContent":["April is a beautiful month, when warm mists can carry the flowery smells of a new spring into the air.

There, on the screen, was her looping signature, right next to Omar Mateen’s. Proof she wed a killer.","The 31-year-old widow shivered and hiked a purple blanket up to her neck, glancing over at her team of defense attorneys for reassurance. They often soothed her in court with physical touch, squeezing her shoulder or patting her arm. Her fear was palpable.","Later, Salman watched herself on the same screen, testing perfumes at Victoria’s Secret. In the security camera footage shown to the jury, she sniffed a paper strip, then passed it to her husband for his thoughts. He must have agreed; they left with a shiny pink bag.","Three days after that shopping trip, Mateen slaughtered 49 people inside Pulse nightclub in Orlando. In calls with police from the scene, he declared allegiance to ISIS and said he acted to avenge U.S. airstrikes in Syria and Iraq. At the time, it was the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Mateen was killed during the attack.","While her husband was committing mass murder, Salman was in her pajamas, asleep in their home in Fort Pierce, Florida. Seven months later, she was charged with aiding and abetting her husband and obstructing justice for allegedly lying to the FBI. Prosecutors claimed that Salman helped her husband scout potential locations for the attack, created a cover story for him and participated in unusual spending.","The seemingly ordinary excursion to a mall store was now center stage in a federal terrorism trial. In the days leading up to the shooting, Mateen spent thousands of dollars on Salman, buying her clothes and jewelry, including a diamond ring. Prosecutors suggested she got the gifts in exchange for agreeing to help him carry out his heinous plan.","There was zero evidence that Salman was radicalized herself, they admitted. Instead, they argued that she was content to trade her husband – the sole provider for her and her 3-year-old son – for baubles and designer wear.","Salman, who did not testify in the trial herself, pleaded not guilty, and maintained through her lawyers that she had no knowledge of Mateen’s plans. When he began showering her with presents in the weeks before the massacre, Salman was optimistic about their future, her lawyers said, and believed it was a sign her husband – a brutish, abusive man who only permitted her a $20 allowance each week – was changing.","For the 49 families of the victims, the trial was an opportunity for closure. And yet, they didn’t get to see the man that took their loved one’s lives. Instead, they got his wife.","In courtroom sketches, Salman resembled a Disney princess — oversized eyes, a button nose and lustrous, thick hair. But in person, sitting in the courtroom here in downtown Orlando just two miles from the club where the massacre took place, she was pale with deep, dark circles under her eyes. Her clothes were ill-fitting, she wore no visible makeup, and her hair was pulled back into a simple ponytail.","By the time of the trial, Salman had spent 14 months in jail, mostly in solitude. Each day, she was allowed a single phone call to her son, but that was it. She missed holding him and hugging him, her family said.","During opening statements, Salman’s lawyer said she had been eagerly awaiting her day in court. After her arrest, rumors and speculations about her abounded and settled in like a rot. She drove him to the club that night. She was a member of ISIS. She fled the country after the attack. All were untrue.","Finally, in court, she got to set the record straight.","Perpetrator Or Victim?","Outside the federal courthouse, on a lunch break from the trial, Salman’s cousin was seething. Susan Adieh, didn’t recognize the one-dimensional cliched caricature the prosecution had described, and she didn’t understand why Salman was on trial. The wives of other terrorists and mass killers never faced charges. She wondered if her family’s religion played a role, even though Salman was not religious.","After all, they were Muslim.","Adieh, 59, who owns several convenience stores in Mississippi, has known Salman since she was born. She attended every day of the trial, sitting a few rows behind her, along with Salman’s uncles and other cousins. Salman’s father died in 2012, and her mother, who currently takes care of Salman’s young son in California, couldn’t attend the trial because of health issues. In her absence, Adieh stepped up as a momma bear figure, advocating on behalf of her cousin in interviews with the press.","Susan Clary, the family spokesperson, said that many other relatives wanted to come to support Salman, but they were afraid. As Muslim Americans, they worried about being associated with the terrorism case; their jobs could be at stake.","In court, Adieh nodded along with Salman’s defense attorneys when they made a point she liked and scowled when the prosecutors said something she found objectionable. Mostly, she looked at the back of Salman’s head. A few times, Salman turned around to flash Adieh a quick, nervous wave and a tight smile before her face returned to its standard sober expression.","As a child, Adieh said, Salman would let other kids take her toys rather than start a fight.","“She has no toughness in her,” she said. “She has a good heart. That’s her problem.”","Immediately after the Pulse shooting, Adieh flew to Florida to be with Salman. With approval from the FBI, Adieh brought Salman and her son back home to Mississippi. For four months, she cared for her traumatized cousin. Salman, an American-born daughter of Palestinian immigrants, struggled with the enormity of the destruction her husband had caused — 49 lives snuffed out in an instant — and worried how she and her son would survive in his infamous shadow, her cousin said.","While Salman was married to Mateen, she didn’t visit or talk much to her family. They said he discouraged it. But in Mississippi, she slowly told them everything. Mateen was violently abusive, she said: He beat her and forced her to have sex against her will. He controlled what money she spent, and even dictated what she was allowed to eat.","Salman, a housewife with a young child, had few options. She didn’t have money of her own, as she wasn’t employed. She didn’t have a driver’s license, and had to ask Mateen for a ride when she wanted to go to the supermarket or run an errand at the post office. She lacked a support system in Florida outside Mateen’s family, since most of her family was in California.","“I asked her, ‘Why didn’t you call me?’” Adieh recalled, a pained expression crossing her face. “She was too afraid,” she said. Salman had told her that Mateen threatened to kill her and take away her son.","The abuse that Salman said she survived was all-too familiar to Sitora Yusufiy, Mateen’s first wife. She told HuffPost that during her short marriage to Mateen in 2009, he hit her, confiscated her paychecks, and told her when she could and could not leave the house. He would resort to violence without a thought.","“Living with him, I know the situation she was in,” she said, referring to Salman. “I know she had no rights, and no knowledge of what he was doing. He would lie to me and hide many things behind my back.”","Had Yusufiy stayed married to Mateen, “that could very easily have been me,” she said.","After Salman was arrested and taken into custody, Jacquelyn Campbell, a nurse and leading expert on domestic violence in the U.S, evaluated her at the request of Salman’s defense attorneys. Campbell is known for developing a tool used to determine if an abused woman is at risk of being killed by her intimate partner.","Based on Salman’s responses to questions, she was in the “extreme danger range” during her marriage to Mateen – the highest possible level. Salman wrote in the assessment that Mateen strangled her, beat her while she was pregnant, and controlled most of her daily activities.","To the question “Do you believe he is capable of killing you?” Salman replied, “yes.”","The Evidence","It was a typical Saturday night for Salman on June 11, 2016. Her husband told her he was going out with his friend Nemo, and said he’d be home later.","After he left, her mother-in-law called, inviting them to come to the mosque for dinner. Salman didn’t want to go; it was hot and she didn’t want to have to wear the hijab, she complained to a friend in a call at the time. She texted Mateen, asking him to tell his mom they weren’t coming.","“If ur mom calls say nimo invited you out and noor wants to stay home,” she wrote, misspelling Mateen’s friend’s nickname. This text would later be used as evidence for the crime of aiding and abetting. The prosecution said what she wrote was a cover story that Salman concocted to help her husband avoid suspicion from his parents.","But for Salman, she just wanted to have a quiet night with her son, according to the defense. She took him to Applebee’s for dinner and then to Walmart to pick up a Father’s Day present for Mateen. At home, after she put her son to sleep, she browsed for leather biker jackets on her phone and waited for her husband to come home.","He never did.","By 2:40 a.m., she tried calling, but there was no answer. Then she texted Mateen: “Habibi, where are you?” she wrote, using an Arabic term of endearment. She tried him again two hours later, reminding him that he had work in the morning.","Mateen wrote back at 4:28 a.m., asking her if she’d heard what happened. At that moment, he was holed up in a bathroom with hostages. Several minutes later, he would Google “how to remove bullet lodged in barrel?” His rifle had jammed. Within the hour he’d be dead, shot by the police.","“???” she answered. “What happened? !” She tried to call again, but he didn’t pick up.","Just minutes after she sent her husband that text, police were at her door, ordering her out of the house. She picked up her son and came outside. The police didn’t tell her why they were there; they asked her to wait in the back of a squad car while they searched her home. Then, she was whisked to the FBI headquarters in Fort Pierce for questioning.","She would spend the next 11 hours with law enforcement, without a lawyer.","FBI agents were immediately suspicious of her. She was strangely calm and passive, they testified, not asking a lot of questions about her predicament. The agents put her and her son in a large conference room, and assigned a female FBI agent to play with the child while Salman was questioned. After serving them McDonald’s hotcakes and hash browns for breakfast, FBI agents notified her that her husband was dead.","Her reaction to that news concerned them, too, they said. One agent claimed Salman didn’t cry, although another agent recalled her crying for five minutes straight, a contradiction that was never explained. Prosecutors described her as “staged and rehearsed.”","After hearing how Salman behaved at FBI headquarters that night, Campbell, the domestic violence expert, said it was not that unusual. Abuse victims, under pressure, often develop a flat affect and come off as disengaged. It’s a survival mechanism, she explained.","“When you are terrified of someone, you try not to be reactive to anything or let any of your feelings show,” she said. “You just try to obey and do whatever you think will please that person, or at least make them not hurt you.”","For hours and hours, FBI agents interrogated her, choosing not to film or record any of her statements. When asked in court about why the FBI did not record the interview of a potential suspect in a high-profile terrorist case, an agent said, “I honestly never thought about it. It never crossed my mind.”","At some point, getting nowhere with Salman, the FBI brought in a polygraph examiner and sent her son home with a relative.","On the stand, Special Agent Ricardo Enriquez described his interrogation of Salman. He falsely told her that he was sent by then-FBI Director James Comey, to impress upon her the gravity of the situation, he said. He asked her to sign a consent to be polygraphed, though he never used it. Instead, he just talked to her.","He asked her a series of questions about her husband and what she might have known about the attack. She told him she knew nothing, but over the next four and a half hours, Enriquez kept insisting that she knew more than she was letting on. He said that if she lied during the interview, he didn’t know what would happen to her son.","Salman was exhausted, having barely slept the night before – and in shock, her family and lawyers said. By the time she left FBI headquarters late in the afternoon, she had allegedly confessed to knowing about her husband’s plans.","Her statement, which was handwritten by Enriquez because she was too nervous to do it herself, claimed she knew Mateen was headed to Pulse that night to commit an attack, that she’d seen him look at the club’s website, and that they’d cased Pulse together the week before, driving around the venue slowly with the windows down.","“That’s what she said, and that’s what I wrote down,” Enriquez said.","But much of what she confessed to was impossible. Salman had never been in the vicinity of Pulse, according to cell phone and GPS data. Neither had Mateen. And none of their computers or phones showed a record of accessing Pulse’s website. The claims were simply untrue.","The defense said there was no way Salman knew where Mateen was headed that night because he didn’t know himself.","Pulse wasn’t actually Mateen’s intended target that night. He first drove to Disney Springs, a hub of shops and restaurants at Disney World, and found security to be tight. He then Googled “downtown orlando nightclubs” and appeared to pick the gay club at random. Despite initial speculation based on the location of the shooting, investigators found nothing to suggest he was motivated by homophobia.","But why would an innocent person confess to something she didn’t do?","Bruce Frumkin, a forensic psychologist who evaluated Salman with a series of personality tests, explained to the jury that people with certain traits – like mental illness, low intelligence and high rates of suggestibility ― may end up saying what the police want to hear. People who’ve been interviewed for long periods of time or have been deprived of sleep are particularly vulnerable to making false statements under pressure, he said.","In his professional opinion, Salman was “at much higher risk than the average person” to give a false confession, because of her extremely suggestible and submissive personality, and her low average IQ of 84, he testified.","Waiting To Find Out Her Fate","Inside the courtroom, Salman clutched a small resin guardian angel in her hand. It was too small to be seen by the jury or the judge. When testimony was painful to listen to, she squeezed it. The angel helped to ground her, her family spokesperson said.","Much of the presented evidence was graphic and stomach-churning. Salman could hardly watch as they played the video of the actual slaughter. There was her husband on the screen, mowing down all those innocent people. She turned her head away and cried, balling tissues in her fist.","For six days, Salman listened as prosecutors picked apart her life, depicting her as manipulative, materialistic and cruel. After prosecutors rested their case, they dropped a bombshell: Mateen’s father was an FBI informant up until the massacre, they said, and was under criminal investigation himself.","Upon learning this, Salman’s lawyers asked U.S. District Judge Paul Byron to toss the case, arguing that their entire defense strategy would have been different if they had known. He denied the request.","The defense’s case took just a day and a half. Salman’s lawyers called her friends and family to the stand to tell the jury what kind of person she was. One friend began crying when she saw Salman. She described how Salman helped her when she was struggling to care for an infant and study for school at the same time.","“She would offer to help me clean or cook, or give the bottle so I could concentrate on my studies,” she said. When asked if Salman was peaceful, she agreed vehemently.","“Nothing harmful would come out of her,” she added.","The defense also called two female witnesses who said they had romantic relationships with Mateen while he was married to Salman. He was a liar, her lawyers said, and he kept up a secret life. Why on earth would he tell his wife of his plans to commit terror?","On the very last day of trial, over 80 domestic violence and civil rights groups released a statement in support of Salman, saying the prosecution against her was “rooted in gendered Islamophobia and patriarchy.”","“She is being prosecuted under the guise of guilt by association as a Muslim woman married to a Muslim man who committed mass violence,” they wrote.","But whether the jury saw it that way is yet to be determined. They began deliberations on Wednesday afternoon. Salman faces up to life in prison if convicted.","Her family said the truth came out in the trial, and they have faith in the jury.","In closing arguments, Salman’s lawyer rejected the government’s depiction of Salman as diabolical and greedy, arguing that she didn’t know what her husband was planning, and she certainly didn’t help.","She was a “devoted mother. Not a monster,” her lawyer said.","She just married one.","Update: March 30 ― After more than 12 hours of deliberation, a jury found Salman not guilty on all charges related to her husband’s attack. She walked free that day."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5abbe3ac1f0000260616bbfd.jpeg?cache=YtyulcBGWe&ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"WOMEN","headline":"Don't Tell Model Winnie Harlow She's 'Suffering' From Vitiligo","authors":"Alanna Vagianos","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/model-winnie-harlow-on-why-shes-not-suffering-from-vitiligo_us_5abb87b5e4b04a59a313061f","short_description":"\"Do you see me suffering?”","date":"2018-03-28"},"articleContent":["Model Winnie Harlow is sure as hell not a “vitiligo sufferer.”","The 23-year-old Canadian model made her message clear in a Tuesday Instagram post blasting British tabloid the Evening Standard for describing her as a “vitiligo sufferer.”","“I’m not a ‘Vitiligo Sufferer.’ I’m not a ‘Vitiligo model.’ I am Winnie.

To deplane is to rejoin a world where you can get up from your seat whenever you want, gulp non-recirculated air, and enjoy more than precisely 10 peanuts at a time. But perhaps the worst thing about air travel — worse than the overpriced snacks and jet-engine noise — is the fact that you’re crammed into a confined space and forced to interact with the other people inside it for hours on end.","Planes make us reckon with the fact that humans are gross, virus-carrying, disease-burdened flesh sacs. You can avoid someone coughing in the grocery store, but you can’t escape inhaling the same recirculated air as the man in 14B who sounds like he’s dislodging part of his lung.","And that’s why scientists study disease transmission on aircraft. Three billion people fly every year, and studies have shown that several serious illnesses have hitched rides to areas they never could have reached otherwise. The SARS virus jumped from Hanoi to Paris in just 14 hours and 50 minutes. H1N1 influenza hopped from L.A. to Auckland and Birmingham in under 10. These transmissions would never have been possible without air travel.","But recent research suggests these may be the exceptions that prove the rule. You actually have to be quite close to a sick passenger to catch their disease yourself, depending on how much movement there is during the flight, and most of the surfaces inside an aircraft are surprisingly clean. That’s according to a new study in the journal PNAS, anyway.","“If you are seated further away than a meter from an infected passenger, you are unlikely to get infected during flight,” says Howard Weiss, a mathematics professor at Georgia Tech and one of the lead authors on the paper. Weiss works on modeling disease transmission and collaborated with Boeing, which helped fund the study, to figure out how pathogens might travel on planes.","To make a model like that, though, you have to actually catch people in the act of spreading viruses. So that’s exactly what they did. The team from Emory and Georgia Tech flew on 10 total flights between Atlanta and the West Coast, recording literally every interaction the passengers had with each other. Close physical proximity is how many diseases spread, so any contact between flight attendants or seat mates is an opportunity to disseminate a virus. And wow, are there a lot of interactions — though not a lot of coughing.","“What most surprised me was that on 10 flights, eight during flu season, only one of 1,500 passengers on 10 flights was coughing,” says Weiss. Which is probably a good thing, since he says the other thing that surprised him was the sheer number of interactions: 5,000 on a four-hour flight.","Despite all those points of contact, their mathematical model shows that a sick patient would only be likely to spread illness to people in their own row and one row in front and behind them. Consider this the sneeze splash zone, if you will. Outside of that immediate proximity, it seems passengers are pretty much safe. The researchers even swabbed many of the hard surfaces inside the plane — bathroom door handles, seat belt buckles, and tray tables — all of which came back negative for a panel of 18 respiratory viruses. This either means that either not many sick people were flying on those particular days, or airlines are preternaturally good at disinfecting. No word yet on how clean the fabric seats are.","It also seems to show that the air filtration systems in airplanes are actually pretty good. The recirculated air may be unpleasant, but it is sent through a HEPA filter, which removes 99.9 percent of all particulates in the air — it’s what hospitals use in operating rooms and ICUs. Circulating air also stays in a pretty small area, roughly every couple of rows, so any errant viruses probably get trapped in one little air loop.","And now comes the point in the story where we note that these results can’t be extrapolated to every flight. These were transcontinental American flights, so it won’t necessarily apply to larger or smaller planes with shorter or longer flight times. It also doesn’t apply to all viruses—measles, for example, is a particularly tiny virus that stays airborne for long periods of time. And of course, while this study did the best it could with the data it had, 10 flights is still a pretty small number. It’s possible that, on average, planes are far dirtier (or carry far sicker passengers). As is always the case in science, we’ll need more data to be sure.","Here’s what we do know: being around lots of people, especially while doing something stressful like traveling, makes you more likely to get sick. Weiss’ advice, even after observing so few coughing fits and viruses in the field, is to practice good hygiene and to keep your hands away from your face. Planes aside, we should all probably be washing our hands more. “I suspect that many people do not understand the importance of good hand hygiene,” notes Weiss. And he’s right. Many of us don’t even realize how we get sick: sharing a water glass with a sneezy friend isn’t dangerous because you might drink their backwash, but because you’re liable to touch your face not long after touching the glass (the average person touches their face about 3.5 times every hour) which means you’ll get their virus or bacteria right into your vulnerable mucus membranes.","Pathogens love the moist, warm environment inside your nose and lungs, and your hands are the vehicle that gets them there. Don’t let the viruses win: wash your hands. And maybe just don’t go on airplanes? They’re awful anyway, even if they aren’t germ-infested.","This article originally appeared on Popular Science."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aba96801f0000250616ba09.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Maryland Democrats Went Too Far In Gerrymandering.

Fort Bend County, Texas, was a mostly white community in the 1980s, and many kids had never met an Asian person before, Nguyen recalls. His parents were “boat people” ― refugees from the Vietnam War who escaped the fall of Saigon in 1975.","They lived in Chicago, where Nguyen was born, before settling down in Texas. In school, he was quiet, and most kids left him alone. His race was never really an issue until he got to college at the University of Texas at Austin.","“We would almost get into a fight every weekend,” Nguyen said. “It was always because some guy would get drunk. It was the first time he had ever seen an Asian, and he would have to say something stereotypical.”","Nguyen said he’s often been on the receiving end of stereotypes and mockery for being Asian, enduring everything from slant-eye gestures to sibilant accents.","Similar stories are not uncommon in the Asian-American community ― the more an ethnic group branches out, the greater the likelihood for discrimination. Asian-Americans have become the fastest-growing ethnic group in the U.S., and the growth is happening fastest in the South, according to Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Data, a policy research program at the University of California, Riverside.","The number of Asian-Americans in the South increased by 69 percent between 2000 and 2010, according to an analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data from the group Asian Americans Advancing Justice.","The growing Asian population in the South includes transplants from other regions of the U.S. and immigrants from Asia, with job opportunities and a lower cost of living drawing people to the region, according to demographers.","“The South is the new destination for Asian immigrants,” said Karthick Ramakrishnan, the founder of AAPI Data.","In Georgia, for example, the number of Asian-Americans grew 136 percent from 2000 to 2016, and now accounts for 4 percent of the total population. The number of Asian-Americans in Virginia grew 113 percent in the same period.","The effects of the population growth are vast. In areas where Asian-American communities have been firmly established, experts say Asian-Americans have slowly gained the potential to affect school curriculums and influence elections.","Asians are also the only ethnic group in the U.S. with more members born outside the country than inside it, according to AAPI Data, with most Asian immigrants coming in on either employment-based visas or family-based visas. This leads to diverse Asian-American communities, with distinct challenges in navigating majority-white areas and gaining political influence.","Nguyen, now in his 40s, has witnessed those changes at home in Texas, where he’s now the co-owner of the popular South African restaurant group Peli Peli in Houston.","“I’m just amazed at how a city that used to be very vanilla, very conservative, has now grown to be a city of innovation and diversity,” Nguyen said. “It was steak and potatoes. It was pretty plain Jane, and now Houston is so vibrant to me.”","Voter Suppression And Shifting Politics In Georgia","Despite growing visibility, many Asian-Americans are still fighting to have their voices heard in politics.","During the 2016 election, Asian Americans Advancing Justice’s Atlanta chapter launched a major initiative to register new Asian-American voters. The state rejected thousands of registrations because applicants’ Westernized names contained middle names or hyphens that were slightly different from their other identification forms. These different spellings were the side effect of the various romanization systems used to translate Asian names ― not an example of voter fraud, AAAJ had argued.","“Voter suppression is very real here, and it’s definitely institutionalized in a way I did not understand, coming from California,” said Stephanie Cho, the executive director of AAAJ’s Atlanta chapter. “Mostly people of color were getting kicked off the rolls. We saw all of these names come back from the secretary of state, and they were all Korean and Vietnamese names.”","AAAJ, along with other civil rights groups, ended up filing a lawsuit against the state, arguing that Georgia’s failure to recognize these voters was a violation of the Voting Rights Act. The groups won an injunction shortly before Election Day, which got more than 8,000 newly registered people added back to the voting rolls.","Community advocates still find challenges in getting Asian community members registered, especially in the South.","Many potential voters are still learning English, and may be daunted by language barriers or generally unaware of the registration process in their state. That means many may not even try to register to vote in the first place.","“In Georgia, as well as in many places in the South, there is little to no outreach into immigrant communities by state or local officials when it comes to elections,” James C. Woo, AAAJ’s outreach associate, wrote in an email. “We are just starting to see bilingual staff at one county elections office for Spanish [speaking] voters, but other than that, our State has yet to implement policies, procedures, or effective staffing to be able to work with communities of color, specifically immigrants.”","But there has been progress. The number of Asian-Americans registered to vote in Georgia doubled from 2004 to 2012, and turnout increased 168 percent. Around 80 percent of Asian-Americans voted Democrat in Georgia, Cho said.","And even if Asian-Americans are the smallest racial group in Georgia, the number is still big enough that Asian voters could close the margin in a tight election. Asian-Americans have had the strongest impact in the Atlanta suburbs of Gwinnett County, which turned blue in 2016 when Hillary Clinton took 51 percent to Donald Trump’s 45 percent. It’s the first time the county has voted Democrat since Jimmy Carter was a candidate in the 1970s.","There are also more Asians seeking political office. In 2016, Sam Park, the son of Korean immigrants, was the first openly gay man ever elected to Georgia’s state House and the second Korean-American to serve following B.J. Pak’s election in 2011. In December, Georgia picked Bee Nguyen, the first Vietnamese-American woman elected to the Georgia House of Representatives in a close runoff for Dekalb County.","“There hasn’t been enough Asian-American Pacific Islanders or immigrants that have really taken their power ... so it’s just starting to turn,” Cho said.","How A Tech Boom Brought Asian Immigrants to Virginia","Experts note that immigrants tend to migrate to established enclaves, either areas that relatives have scouted out and moved to already, or cities that have a community from their home county. These initial ethnic huddles grow into demographic hotspots.","Shekar Narasimhan remembers people staring at his wife when she wore her sari back when they first moved to northern Virginia from India in 1979.\n","“If you came here today and went into some of the shopping centers, and women were wearing … [their] native dress, you wouldn’t even blink,” Narasimhan, the founder of the Super PAC AAPI Victory Fund, told HuffPost. “It’s just like California. It’s changed that much.”\n","Part of that change happened when AOL (now a brand of Oath, HuffPost’s parent company) set up shop in northern Virginia in the 1990s, attracting a large number of Asian tech workers to the region. While Asians represented 3.2 percent of the northern Virginia population in 1980, they now make up about 15 percent, according to census data.","The growth of the Indian population in Virginia can be traced back to robust numbers of highly skilled software and engineering labor moving to northern Virginia, Ramakrishnan said. Virginia currently ranks third in the nation for the best high-tech industry economy.","“The move away from government contracting to technology innovation and entrepreneurship has brought people here, especially immigrants, and they’ve started businesses and weaved their way into the fabric,” Narasimhan said.","Whereas 40 years ago, 1 in 100 Virginians were born outside the U.S., that percentage is now 1 in 9, according to University of Virginia researchers. Asian-Americans now make up an estimated 7 percent of Virginia’s population, with people of Indian, Filipino, Chinese and Korean descent having the strongest presence. It’s led to Asian cultures fusing into the townscapes, from restaurants to small businesses to prominent houses of worship.","The level of civic engagement and political visibility within the Asian-American community of Virginia has never been higher, said J.R. Smith, the chair of the Virginia Asian American Advisory Board, which advises the governor. He pointed out that there are currently more senior AAPIs in the cabinet of Gov. Ralph Northam (D) than at any other time in Virginia’s history.","From 2004 to 2012, the number of Asian-Americans who voted in Virginia increased 180 percent. Though it’s taken a while for Virginia to build an Asian-American community, civic and political leaders feel that they finally have a seat at the table.","“Virginia is showing what the rest of the South can be in the next 15 to 20 years,” said Mark Keam, the first Asian immigrant elected to the Virginia House of Delegates.","As Population Grows, So Do Racial Conflicts","The rising visibility of the AAPI community in the South has not come without its share of racism. A report released last year showed a higher number of hate incidents in the region during the 2016 election cycle than elsewhere in the country.","Nationwide, the overall number of reported violent and xenophobic incidents against South Asian and Middle Eastern communities increased 45 percent in one year, between November 2016 and November 2017, according to South Asian Americans Leading Together, a civil rights advocacy organization.","“What we’ve increasingly seen, which has frankly surprised us, was an uptick in the hate violence incidents occurring in places where our communities are well-established,” said Suman Raghunathan, the executive director of SAALT.","Within the Asian demographic, South Asians are the fastest growing group, according to SAALT. In the South, the South Asian-American population has doubled from about half a million to more than 1 million since 2000.","“What we concluded was that when our communities become more visible by virtue of building houses of worship, by virtue of establishing community centers, by virtue of gaining prominence in local conversations and local politics, that, in turn, appears to spur hate violence and xenophobic political rhetoric,” Raghunathan said.","SAALT blames the current state of politics and the rhetoric of the Trump administration for creating a climate that hurts the Asian community. The organization’s latest report found that following the 2016 elections, 20 percent of perpetrators of racially motivated violence explicitly invoked a Trump administration policy, campaign slogan or the president’s name itself. Of the incidents documented over the past year, 82 percent were found to be motivated by anti-Muslim sentiment.","A School System In Texas Integrates Asian Culture","When Chavez High School in Houston celebrates the Lunar New Year, you might see a parent picking up their kids on horseback while students practice a traditional dragon dance.","“Two horses, and each kid hops up onto the saddle behind the adult,” said the school’s principal, René Sanchez. “That’s just Texas for you.”","The Houston area has the highest Asian population of any Southern metropolitan area, and the rise of the Asian population has prompted school officials to evolve their approach to engage more students and parents.","In 2004, the Houston Independent School District ― the largest in Texas ― formed the Asian Advisory Committee to address the growing Asian population and to make sure Asian immigrant parents’ voices were being heard. Since then, the committee has led the way in celebrating Asian culture with regular district events and in making sure Asian parents who aren’t fluent in English are well-versed on issues affecting the district.","“We’re kind of like the odd one out in the Southern states,” said Annie Song, the HISD representative on the district’s Asian Advisory Committee. “You really don’t feel a challenge being an Asian immigrant because the community here is so big.”","Asians currently make up around 8 percent of the Houston area population, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, with Vietnamese people making up the largest group. From 2000 to 2016 in Texas, the Asian population rose 132 percent, per AAPI Data. The Houston school district has a Mandarin immersion school, and currently, the Asian Advisory Committee is working on introducing an Asian history and culture awareness curriculum in the schools.","HISD staff have also been on learning delegations to Beijing and Shanghai to enrich their programs back home. Various district schools are now partnered with nearly a dozen schools in China so students in Texas can practice their language skills via video chat with students abroad. In December, HISD’s superintendent, Richard Carranza, was in Taiwan, where he signed a school partnership agreement.","Houston is also the most diverse city in the U.S., and the way this manifests itself in a school setting could be viewed as uniquely American. At the same high school where families can pick up their kids on horseback, a multicultural stage with Latino students participating alongside Asian-Americans in a Lunar New Year K-pop dance is just a normal celebration."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aba5d8b2000002d00eb3247.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Leaked Memo: EPA Shows Workers How To Downplay Climate Change","authors":"Alexander C.

That directive would disqualify huge amounts of public health research conducted on the condition that subjects’ personal information will remain private. Two former top EPA officials called the move an “attack on science” in a New York Times op-ed published Monday.","Last year, the EPA reassigned the four staffers in the policy office who worked on climate adaptation, shuttered its program on climate adaptation and proposed eliminating funding for programs that deal with rising seas and warming temperatures.","Pruitt personally oversaw efforts to scrub climate change from EPA websites, and staunchly defended President Donald Trump’s decision last June to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord. In October, Pruitt proposed repealing the Clean Power Plan, one of the only major federal policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.","The agency had also suggested zeroing out funding for most of its major climate and regional science grant programs, only to see Congress reject most of the cuts in the budget bill passed last week.","The assertions made in the new EPA talking points are not rooted in science. Ninety-seven percent of peer-reviewed research agrees with the conclusion that emissions from burning fossil fuels, deforestation and industrial farming are enshrouding the planet in heat-trapping gases, and are the primary causes of rising planetary temperatures. A research review published in November 2016 found significant flaws in the methodologies, assumptions or analyses used by the 3 percent of scientists who concluded otherwise.","But for the past three decades, a Big Tobacco-style misinformation campaign funded primarily by oil, gas and coal interests has fueled political debate over the integrity of the scientific consensus.","“Administrator Pruitt encourages an open, transparent debate on climate science,” the final point states.","Here’s the full email (emphasis theirs):","Dear Colleagues:\n\nDuring the recent meeting of our Cross-EPA Work Group on Climate Adaptation, several individuals suggested it would be helpful to develop consistent messages about EPA’s climate adaptation efforts that could be used across all Program and Regional Offices.

Some are calling on allies to participate in a silent march on Wednesday in Paris in memory of the grandmother and other recent French victims of anti-Semitism.","“We need more people to feel moved, concerned, and therefore take an active part in this fight,” Simone Rodan-Benzaquen, director of the advocacy group American Jewish Committee (AJC) in Europe, wrote in an op-ed for HuffPost France. “When anti-Semitic violence grows, democracy is at stake.”","Knoll was reportedly stabbed 11 times during the attack inside her Paris apartment on Friday. Her body was partly burned after the attackers tried to set her home on fire, The New York Times reported.","Two men have been arrested in connection to the killing and face preliminary charges of murder with anti-Semitic motives, according to The Associated Press.","The woman’s son, Daniel Knoll, said that his mother had known one of the suspects for a long time and often invited him into her home against the advice of her children.","“My mother had a thirst for knowledge and meeting new people and talking to them and that’s what killed her,” he told the AP.","Some Jewish leaders reflected on the tragic irony of Knoll’s death, which came decades after the woman fled the Holocaust. In 1942, a then-9-year-old Knoll narrowly escaped being deported to a Nazi concentration camp with thousands of other Parisian Jews. Knoll was able to escape the mass arrest, which became known as the Vel d’Hiv roundup, with the help of a family member with Brazilian citizenship, the AP reported. The family fled to Portugal. Knoll returned to her home country after the end of World War II.","Nearly all those who were arrested during the roundup ― more than 13,000 people ― were murdered at Auschwitz.","Francis Kalifat, head of the Representative Council of French Jewish Institutions (CRIF), an umbrella group for French Jewish organizations, said Knoll was “absolutely massacred.”","“This makes one feel something absolutely terrible,” Kalifat told The New York Times. “She escaped the anti-Semitism of the Nazis, but in the end her destiny followed her because she was killed because of anti-Semitism.”","France’s Grand Rabbi, Haïm Korsia, said he was “horrified” by Knoll’s death. He compared the murder to that of another Jewish woman in the same Paris arrondissement, Sarah Halimi, last April. The 65-year-old Orthodox Jewish woman was assaulted and thrown out of a window by a suspect of Malian origin. It took months for French prosecutors to classify Halimi’s murder as an anti-Semitic attack.","“The horror of crime and the violence of the murderers are identical and remind us of the negative side of humanity,” Korsia wrote in a tweet.","France’s Jewish communities have grown increasingly concerned about safety in recent years. In 2015, four people were killed during an attack on a kosher supermarket in Paris. Nearly 8,000 French Jews reportedly moved to Israel in the year after this attack.","In 2012, three children and a teacher were murdered outside a Jewish school in Toulouse.","Anti-Semitic violence in France increased by 26 percent in 2017, while criminal damage to Jewish synagogues and cemeteries increased by 22 percent, according to a national study.","This January, a kosher grocery store near Paris was damaged in a suspected arson attack. Weeks later, an 8-year-old boy wearing a Jewish kippa was beaten up in a northern Paris suburb.","Marc Knobel, a historian at CRIF, told The Local France that the deaths of Halimi and Knoll have contributed to a “great feeling of fear and insecurity” in Jewish communities.","“People are extremely shocked and very worried,” he said.","Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo called on Parisians to join Wednesday’s silent march in honor of Knoll. A wide array of French politicians have promised to attend, the AP reported.","In a tweet, French President Emmanuel Macron said he was appalled by Knoll’s murder and expressed his “absolute determination to fight against anti-Semitism.”","Rodan-Benzaquen, director of AJC Europe, said that while these declarations for politicians help French Jews “feel less lonely,” more needs to be done by French citizens and society at large. She called on all Parisians to march on Wednesday for “our assassinated grandmother.”","“Many French Jews believe that while they have tried to warn their fellow citizens that this hatred will spread and ultimately attack French people everywhere, only few have listened,” she wrote."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5abab8931f0000260616ba34.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Lawmaker Says Rumor Swirling That Ryan Will Resign; Speaker's Aide Says Otherwise","authors":"Nick Visser","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-ryan-resignation-rumors_us_5ab97262e4b0decad04d1b2d","short_description":"Ryan's spokeswoman denied the claim, saying \"the speaker is not resigning.\"","date":"2018-03-27"},"articleContent":["A Nevada lawmaker says Capitol Hill is buzzing with a rumor that House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) will soon resign and be replaced by Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.).","But Ryan’s team quickly responded to the speculation, saying there were no plans for the Wisconsin lawmaker to step down anytime soon.","“The rumor mill is that Paul Ryan is getting ready to resign in the next 30 to 60 days and that Steve Scalise will be the new Speaker,” Rep.

Earlier in March, the brothers’ parents sued Butowsky and Fox News, alleging that they had “intentionally exploited” Seth’s death “through lies, misrepresentations and half-truths.”","“How many family members do they have that want to sue me?” an exasperated Butowsky told HuffPost over the phone on Tuesday afternoon. “I’m waiting for first and second cousins to sue me now.”","Asked to confirm he was speaking on the record, Butowsky exclaimed: “Yes! I want it all out there.”","“How many Riches are there?” Butowsky continued. “I know there are a couple other Riches in Omaha that haven’t sued me yet. So tell them; everyone sue me and get it over with.”","Seth Rich was shot and killed while walking home in the early morning hours of July 10, 2016. Washington police have yet to arrest anyone connected to the case, which they have described as a robbery attempt gone wrong.","Butowsky, a Dallas-based financial consultant who has previously made major donations to Republican candidates, reached out to the Rich family in the wake of the murder with an offer to help finance a private investigation into it. That led to the hiring of Rod Wheeler, a former Washington Metro Police Department investigator and Fox News contributor with a history of dabbling in conspiracy theories.","Instead of solving the murder, though, the Rich family has claimed that Butowsky only helped fuel the far-right conspiracy that Seth and Aaron Rich were the true culprits behind the hacking of DNC servers that led to the leak of internal emails and memos before the 2016 elections.","Seth, in the view of these conspiracy peddlers, delivered the emails to WikiLeaks, and was then killed by Democratic Party operatives in order to keep him silent.","Those theories have never had any basis in fact, according to police, the Rich family or American intelligence officials, who issued a report in January 2017 that tied the leaks to Russian hackers.","The Daily Beast reported in March that intelligence officials had also tied Guccifer 2.0, the “lone hacker” who has taken credit for the original breach of the DNC’s servers, to the Kremlin itself after he failed to shield his identity with a virtual private networking service.","Butowsky, who called the lawsuit from the Rich family “bullshit” and “one of the dumbest things” he’d ever seen, reacted similarly to news of Aaron’s complaint, which claims that Butowsky, conservative newspaper The Washington Times, and internet activist Matthew Couch and his own right-wing media company falsely tied Aaron to the leaks.","“I’m not sure what these lawsuits are about, or why they’re doing them,” Butowsky said. “All these people are running around talking about some guy named Guccifer 2. I don’t know what a Guccifer is. I really don’t care about any of this. It’s not a part of my life that matters.”","Aaron, the lawsuit states, “has suffered substantial economic harm” and “severe emotional distress” thanks to Butowsky and the other defendants’ “campaign of defamation.”","But despite Aaron’s agonies and the lack of evidence supporting the conspiracy theories around Seth’s murder, Butowsky continued to insist that the Rich parents had admitted their son’s involvement when he first spoke to them.","“Just tell the darn truth and be honest with this country with what you know and what you said, and let’s move on,” Butowsky said. “They’ve made up this fallacious story, calling me a political operative. What the hell is a political operative? Am I James Bond or something?”","Butowsky and the other named defendants “are entitled to their own opinions, but they are not entitled to spread vicious lies about an innocent man,” Aaron’s attorney, Michael Gottlieb, said in a statement. “Those who defame and harass decent American citizens in an effort to advance their personal financial and partisan gain will be held accountable in court.” A spokesperson for the Rich family declined to respond to Butowsky.","Butowsky issued his own threat to a family that has said they only pursued legal action “to help prevent this kind of malicious and reckless behavior in the future so that others can be spared the hell the Riches have had to endure.”","“If this keeps going, I’ll start filing my lawsuits,” Butowsky said. “Because I’m a little annoyed by the Rich family.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aba98a5200000d30ceb32a9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"CRIME","headline":"Suspect Reportedly Arrested Over Explosives Sent To Washington, D.C.

Heartbreaking reports of the youngsters’ final moments suggest many were trapped in a cinema where they’d gone to enjoy a screening of a kids movie. Many of them called family members to ask for help or say goodbye as the blaze encroached.","One child penned a final message on social media: “We are burning,” wrote 13-year-old Maria Moroz. “I love you all. This is perhaps farewell.”","The fire reportedly started on the fourth floor of the “Winter Cherry” shopping center in Kemerovo, Russia, at around 4 p.m. on Sunday afternoon.","According to Vladimir Chernov, a deputy governor of the region, the blaze originated in the children’s play area in the mall. The cause of the fire remains unknown, though Chernov suggested a child may have used a lighter to ignite the foam filler of a trampoline in the play area, according to The New York Times.","Video shared online by Russian news outlets showed thick smoke rapidly filling the fourth floor as the fire began to spread.","Russian authorities confirmed Monday that emergency exits at the shopping center had been blocked and the fire alarm system had been switched off, corroborating eyewitness accounts.","Harrowing videos posted on social media showed desperate people jumping from windows to escape the fire. An 11-year-old boy was among those who jumped.","Russia’s Health Minister Veronika Skvortsova said the child had survived but was in “serious condition.” He lost his parents and a younger sister in the fire, Skvortsova said.","At least 64 people died in the inferno, described as one of the worst fire disasters in modern Russian history. Interfax news agency said Monday that at least 41 of those killed were children. Earlier reports said an entire fifth grade class and their teacher had perished in the blaze.","The aunt of one of the fifth-graders said her niece, 11-year-old Viktoria, had called her just minutes after the fire began.","“She said that everything was in flames, and that the doors were blocked in the cinema. She said she couldn’t escape and couldn’t breathe,” Yevgeniya Oganesyan told the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda. “I told her: Vika, take off your clothes and bring them to your nose, breathe through your clothes. She told me, ‘Tell Mummy that I loved her. Tell everyone that I loved them.’”","Other families recounted similarly agonizing calls.","Alexander Lillevyali told independent news outlet Meduza that his daughters had called him from the movie theater saying the room was filling with smoke but they couldn’t escape because the doors were locked.","Lillevyali said he’d accompanied his three young daughters into the theater and had placed them in their seats with boxes of popcorn. He’d then gone downstairs to wait for their movie to finish when he received their desperate call.","“As I was running up the stairs, somebody handed me a wet rag, and I used it to cover my nose,” Lillevyali said of his attempt to rescue his children. “When I reached the fourth floor, I broke a window to send the draft upwards. Then I collapsed. I started crawling, but I realized at this point that I’d lost all strength.”","One of his daughters “kept calling me and calling me,” he continued, speaking through tears. “I just shouted into the phone that she needed to try to get out of the theater, but there was nothing I could do. In front of me, it was already flames.”","Igor Vostrikov said he also lost his three young children in the fire. His wife and sister had also perished, he said ― all of them had been in the cinema when the fire broke out.","“[My wife] Lena called from there,” Vostrikov told Komsomolskaya Pravda. “She screamed, ‘Help us, rescue us, we’ve been locked up.’”","Russian authorities have launched an investigation into the cause of the fire and said they would punish anyone found guilty of negligence. Several people involved in the mall’s operation, including the building’s owner, have reportedly been detained for questioning.","Russian President Vladimir Putin visited the scene of the blaze Monday and blamed “criminal negligence” for the tragedy.","“What’s happening here? This isn’t war, it’s not a spontaneous methane outburst. People came to relax, children.

It was alive. And it was awkward. Because there’s the humor involved, it almost is like, the door’s open. We can do this.”","Birth control was just one of the many progressive topics “Roseanne” tackled during its nine-season run from 1988-1997. The ABC comedy also featured storylines involving gay relationships and abortion ― all while portraying the realities of a working-class family in the Midwest.","On Tuesday, “Roseanne” will return for a 10th season ― two decades after the show went off the air. The main cast is back, including Goranson and Barr, along with John Goodman as Dan, Laurie Metcalf as Jackie, Sara Gilbert as Darlene, Michael Fishman as D.J., and Sarah Chalke, who played Becky in later seasons. The Conners remain rooted in a working-class household ― one that still faces financial issues and job struggles. It’s real. It’s raw. It’s America. It’s a slice of life we don’t get to see on TV too often.","“Maybe it’s not glamorous to depict the working class, for some people. I think America is a lot about glitz and glamour and waving the dollar bill in front of people,” Goranson said. “I think that at the core, there is a great deal of suffering in this country and a great deal of strife and there’s a lot of voices that aren’t being recognized and aren’t being heard.”","Goranson added that Barr, who executive produces the series alongside Gilbert, wanted to continue to show those real-life struggles on the show.","“I know that for Roseanne, the person, that that really is what what’s most important ― is to depict the working class. And that’s what drives the show. And that’s what drives her. It’s her passion.”","A lot of attention has been placed on the first episode of the new season because of its mentions of President Donald Trump, who’s at the heart of a riff between Roseanne and her sister Jackie. In one scene, Roseanne explains why she voted for Trump in the 2016 presidential election.","Roseanne: He talked about jobs, Jackie. He said he would shake things up. I mean, this might come as a complete shock to you, but we almost lost our house, the way things are going.\n\nJackie: Have you looked at the news? Because now things are worse.\n\nRoseanne: Not on the real news.","Goranson noted that although Trump is mentioned in the first episode, he’s not a constant throughout the entire season. Rather, U.S. politics are there to establish a divide in the family.","“We really wanted to put that out there and say, ‘This is what’s happening in people’s families. There’s a lot of division.’ How do we get past that division on a personal level? And I think what’s really unfortunate that a lot of people just hear ‘Roseanne/Trump’ and they just go with it. And they can go wherever they want with that instead of thinking about all the nuance that really is happening on the show,” Goranson said. “One thing about all the characters on the show is that we really all do have arcs. No one stays in the same place, just like in life.”","Roseanne’s character arc will definitely will be one to watch this season.","“You kind of see her deal with some of the issues that maybe you would think a Trump supporter would have a stance on. But then she transforms,” Goranson said. “I really think that it’s well handled … I would just encourage anyone who, when they hear ‘Roseanne, Trump supporter,’ that it’s really not propaganda. It’s not heavy on that.

Others urged officials to ensure monument lands remain open for grazing, off-road vehicles and other activities. And several questioned if the administration wasn’t getting ahead of itself by moving forward with land-use planning amid numerous legal challenges.","Monday’s event in Blanding comes nearly four months after President Donald Trump gutted the 1.35 million-acre Bears Ears National Monument by 85 percent, reducing it to just over 200,000 acres. He described the monument, designated by President Barack Obama in the final weeks of his presidency, as a massive federal land grab that “threatened” local economies and Utahns’ way of life. The new monument is divided into two disconnected sites, named Shash Jaa and Indian Creek, and includes two small satellite units around well-known archaeological sites.","Ernie Washee, a resident of Blanding and a member of the Navajo Nation, dismissed the meeting a “big charade.”","“They call it a planning process, but the decision has already been made,” he said. His wife, Rebecca Stoneman-Washee, called the recent rollback “tragic” and said the administration shouldn’t do anything until the numerous legal challenges play out in court.","Named after a pair of buttes, Bears Ears is home to more than 100,000 Native American archaeological and cultural sites and is considered sacred to many tribes. The Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition — a group of five Native American tribes that petitioned for the area to be given monument status — is among the parties now suing the Trump administration over its recent decision.","Monument supporters aren’t the only ones disappointed with the final outcome.","For Zeb Dalton, a cattle rancher from Blanding, 85 percent wasn’t enough. He said he appreciates what Trump did — “It’s better,” he said — but hoped the monument would be rescinded altogether.","Dalton, who has grazing permits both within the original and new monument boundary, argues the designation does nothing to protect archaeological sites and said he worries the management plan will limit his ability to ranch on the lands, despite the fact that the Obama-era declaration clearly stated that ranching can continue. He said he can’t understand how one person — the president — could have the power to single handedly designate such a large area of land.","“If they want to do this, they ought to put it through Congress,” he said.","Representatives of the Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service stressed to participants that the meetings were the beginning of a long process to draft and ultimately implement a management plan, and that their comments were important and would be considered.","It’s understandable why some might be skeptical.","Following a months-long review of 27 national monuments, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke recommended that Trump shrink or otherwise weaken protections for 10, including Bears Ears and nearby Grand Staircase-Escalante. In his final report to the White House, Zinke acknowledged that the vast majority of the 2.8 million public comments received by the Interior Department as part of the review favored maintaining the current size of all monuments, but cast them off as part of “a well-orchestrated national campaign organized by multiple organizations.”","Leslie Lamont, who attended Monday’s meeting from Carbondale, Colorado, said it’s been frustrating to watch all the input and work that went into having the monument designated be sidelined by Trump’s unprecedented and sweeping cut.","“I feel that a process occurred and it never got off the ground,” she said. “It was just chopped off.”","Lloyd Nielson, of Blanding, said he’s not for or against the monument. Rather, he finds the designation “pointless,” as he said it created more work for the Bureau of Land Management at a time with resources and federal funding are stretched thin.","“There’s no right answer,” he said. “It’s just stupid.”","A second meeting to receive input on Bears Ears National Monument is scheduled for Tuesday in Bluff.

Last week, Trump’s lead attorney for the special counsel investigation, John Dowd, tendered his resignation, prompting a White House search that has yet to yield a suitable replacement. At least six lawyers in the last week have turned down an offer to represent the president.","Lawyers and legal experts say it’s not hard to see why: Lawyers could place themselves at great risk by working for a client with a reputation for impulsiveness and an inability to heed advice, who tends to undercut legal strategy with haphazard public statements and an itchy Twitter finger and who, as a result, may not be worth the publicity and likely future business associated with representing a president of the United States.","“One of the things you always wonder about when you’re asked to replace another lawyer is ‘Why?’” said George Clark, a Washington, D.C.-based attorney specializing in legal ethics.","Clark noted that many lawyers endure guilty or ethically challenged clients ― the right to legal counsel being something attorneys strive to uphold ― but erratic clients are a whole different can of worms. Refusing to take advice from counsel, for example, is a common reason why lawyers drop clients.","Trump’s difficulties with staffing his legal team come as special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation is said to be entering a critical phase. While the president has publicly embraced the prospect of sitting down for an interview with the special counsel’s team, Trump’s lawyers have been divided on the subject. Dowd reportedly opposed it, and his departure clears a path to begin preparations for an interview.","Trump has, in recent days, also escalated his attacks against the Russia probe, leading many to speculate that Mueller’s job itself could be in peril. Last week, the president ignored cautioning from his counsel and lashed out at Mueller by name for the first time.","Further complicating the search for lawyers is that representing Trump could present a conflict of interest, since the existing clients of high-profile and seasoned litigators may already be connected to individuals under investigation. Attorneys Joe diGenova and his wife Victoria Toensing, for example, were ultimately unable to represent the president as was previously announced, due to conflicts of interest with the case.","Robert Rizzi, a partner at Steptoe & Johnson who also teaches government ethics at Harvard Law School, declined to be interviewed for this story. But he too said there was a “good chance” he had represented or worked with many of the involved parties. Rizzi was one of a number of lawyers at prominent firms with large political practices who declined to comment to HuffPost for that reason.","Potential candidates for Trump’s legal team are likely dissuaded by other factors, too ― such as the seemingly unending upheaval in the White House and among the Cabinet agencies.","“I think everybody would agree this is turmoil, chaos, confusion. It’s not good for anything,” Ted Olson, who served as solicitor general in President George W. Bush’s administration and who recently declined White House entreaties to join Trump’s legal team, said Monday during an interview on MSNBC. “We always believe that there should be an orderly process, and of course government is not clean or orderly ever, but this seems to be beyond normal.”","Jed Shugerman, a law professor at Fordham University, said that representing Trump in the Mueller probe could also threaten one’s professional reputation and may even put one in legal jeopardy.","Shugerman pointed to a recent episode involving Dowd and the circumstances surrounding the firing of then-national security adviser Michael Flynn. In December, Dowd claimed he drafted a tweet for the president’s Twitter account that said: “I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI.” The tweet seemed to indicate that Trump was aware that Flynn had lied to the FBI before firing him, an admission that could bolster a possible obstruction of justice case against the president.","Dowd’s explanation for why he ― and not the president ― had authored the tweet may have exposed him to questions from the special counsel, as well.","“It is difficult for one to maintain one’s appearance of being an ethical lawyer while trying to represent Donald Trump,” Shugerman said. “Any lawyer who has observed those episodes is going to see that joining this team at this stage runs a risk to their professional lives.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab987c61e00003b137afcf4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"COMEDY","headline":"Trump Can’t Find A Lawyer And Tweeters Think It's Hilarious","authors":"Ed Mazza","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-cant-find-a-lawyer_us_5ab9d8a7e4b008c9e5faab8b","short_description":"Maybe Vincent LaGuardia Gambini or Bob Loblaw can help.","date":"2018-03-27"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Prince Died Of An ‘Exceedingly High’ Amount Of Fentanyl, Report Says","authors":"Elyse Wanshel","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/prince-had-an-exceedingly-high-amount-of-fentanyl-when-he-died_us_5aba4c18e4b0decad04e3a5c","short_description":"A toxicology report obtained by the Associated Press sheds light on the shocking quantity.","date":"2018-03-27"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Retired Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens Calls For Second Amendment Repeal","authors":"Marina Fang","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-paul-stevens-2nd-amendment_us_5aba403ce4b008c9e5fb6cfe","short_description":"\"That simple but dramatic action would move Saturday’s marchers closer to their objective than any other possible reform,\" he wrote in a New York Times op-ed.","date":"2018-03-27"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"GOP Food Stamp Plan Would Shift Some Funds From Benefits To Training","authors":"Arthur Delaney","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republican-food-stamp-plan_us_5abaaca4e4b03e2a5c770ce0","short_description":"Almost 1 million people could lose benefits by 2028 under the plan, Democrats say.","date":"2018-03-27"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Mark Zuckerberg Is Expected To Testify Before Congress On Data Misuse: Reports","authors":"Nina Golgowski","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mark-zuckerberg-testify-congress_us_5aba6aa7e4b008c9e5fbceec","short_description":"The Facebook CEO's decision follows a number of requests by lawmakers in both the U.S. and the U.K.","date":"2018-03-27"},"articleContent":["Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is reportedly planning to testify before Congress about the recent Cambridge Analytica data scandal.","The House Energy and Commerce Committee is working with the social media company to determine a date and time for the executive to appear, a spokeswoman for the committee told HuffPost.","CNN, which was the first to break the news on Tuesday, reported that he is currently planning a strategy for his testimony, according to Facebook sources.","Zuckerberg has received a barrage of such requests by lawmakers in both the U.S. and the U.K. since it was revealed that personal data belonging to millions of Facebook users had been shared with the political research firm without users’ consent.","The House Energy and Commerce Committee on Friday requested Zuckerberg’s testimony in a letter that detailed its concerns about Facebook’s use and protection of user data.","“As the Chief Executive Officer of Facebook and the employee who has been the leader of Facebook through all the key strategic decisions since its launch, you are the right person to testify before Congress about those decisions and the Facebook business model,” the letter addressed to Zuckerberg read.","“The hearing will examine the harvesting and sale of personal information from more than 50 million Facebook users, potentially without their notice or consent and in violation of Facebook policy,” it continued. “The hearing will also explore broader questions about Facebook’s policies at the time Facebook Platform was launched, today, and in the future regarding both Facebook’s use of user information and the access to user information Facebook provides to others.”","In the U.K., a Facebook official on Monday turned down Parliament’s request for Zuckerberg to testify.

I can face all kinds of past pain and humiliation with a smile on my face because I know Laurie Metcalf walks this earth.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab973812000007d06eb3124.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"IMPACT","headline":"This German Teen Is Leading A Global Plan To Plant A Trillion Trees","authors":"John Vidal, On assignment for HuffPost","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tree-planting-felix-finkbeiner_us_5ab3b850e4b0decad0478b8c","short_description":"Felix Finkbeiner, 19, has already planted 15 billion saplings.","date":"2018-03-27"},"articleContent":["Felix Finkbeiner is a young man in a hurry to get the world to plant trees. The 19-year-old from a small Bavarian village near Munich, now studying at a university in London, has founded a global youth movement, Plant For The Planet, which has spearheaded the planting of over 15 billion saplings, signed up 75,000 children as climate ambassadors.","Alongside setting up Change Chocolate, a successful fair-trade chocolate company to raise money, the tall, spectacled teenager has joined with three of the world’s biggest conservation charities to launch the most ambitious reforestation project in history.","The Trillion Tree campaign aims to get the world to plant 1 trillion trees in the next 30 years. To put that into context, scientists calculate there are currently 3 trillion trees growing worldwide.","Each mature tree absorbs about 22 pounds of carbon dioxide per year, Finkbeiner says, “so one trillion could capture 25 percent of all human-made CO2 emissions and help to keep global temperature rise below the crucial 2-degree C limit. It does not replace the need to avoid carbon emissions, as agreed in Paris, but is a necessary addition.”","Finkbeiner thinks big. He has spoken at the United Nations and European Parliament, and reels off numbers like the politicians, who he says have mostly failed to act.","No one paid him much attention back in 2008, when, at age 9 and inspired by Kenyan Nobel Peace Prize winner and tree-planter Wangari Maathai, he announced at his primary school assembly that he intended to get children to plant 1 million trees in every country.","But his motto, “Stop talking, start planting,” went viral. Competition between schools, “pester power,” and slick social media saw the million-tree target reached within two years.","Since then, Plant for the Planet has grown into a well-funded NGO backed by the World Wildlife Fund, the German government and others, and has taken over a U.N. environmental campaign to get the world to plant 1 billion trees. An estimated 15.2 billion trees have been planted since 2006 by individuals, governments and businesses.","While adults talk about addressing climate change, Finkbeiner says, young people act. “Children could plant 1 million trees in every country on earth and offset CO2 emissions all on their own, while adults are still talking about doing it,” he says.","Some people doubt it is possible to plant so many trees in such a short time. In Mexico last month, talking at a world sustainable development conference, Finkbeiner was challenged by journalists about the practicalities of planting on such a scale, and was questioned whether it would mean giant plantations and a reduction in the amount of land available for growing human food.","Some researchers point to the social consequences of planting on such a vast scale, and say the massive, managed plantations of trees needed to hold temperatures below the 2-degree C limit from pre-industrial levels could trigger potentially irreversible changes in the planet.","Lena Boysen, now a researcher with the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Germany, is lead author of a study investigating the potential of trees as carbon sinks. Extensive tree plantations “would require a major fraction of the global land surface with intolerably large environmental and social costs,” Boysen says. “Our results showed that extensive terrestrial carbon dioxide removal measures are unable to counteract business‐as‐usual emissions without eliminating virtually all natural ecosystems and compromising food production and biosphere functioning.”","But Finkbeiner is undeterred, and says he is also backed by science. Research shows the world has space for up to 589 billion mature trees without competing with agricultural lands, he says.","“We need to plant at least a trillion trees to get 600 billion, since many will not survive,” he says. “Additionally, we must protect the 170 billion trees in imminent risk of destruction.”","Most of the planting, says Finkbeiner, should be in the so-called Global South, because trees generally grow faster than in Europe or North America, and are cheaper to plant and maintain.","Tom Crowther, a professor at Swiss university ETH, who led the Yale University study that calculated the number of trees on the planet and advises the U.N. environment program, says the trillion-tree target is a good goal. “Given enough support from the thousands of restoration efforts around the world, it is possible to make a massive dent in this goal,” Crowther says. “They must understand which soils to restore, which species to plant, how to manage the ecosystem following restoration, along with many other ecological questions.”","Trees are far more than CO2 sinks, says Finkbeiner. “They can provide millions of jobs and other benefits. The use of local timber-intensive materials in construction substitutes CO2-intensive materials like steel and concrete, and the timber industry can create hundreds of millions of additional jobs and wealth in the Global South, thus reducing population growth and migration.”","Besides, he says, the initiative’s timing is good. One-quarter of all the emissions reductions pledged by countries in the 2015 Paris agreement will come from tree planting and land restoration. Countries, including the U.S., U.K. and Germany, have promised to plant and restore large areas of degraded forest and other land as a response to the climate crisis.","The U.N. has set a target to restore 350 million hectares by 2030 – an area bigger than India. A single province in Pakistan has just planted 1 billion trees. China plans to create forests the size of Ireland. And many Latin American countries have pledged to reforest on a large scale. Meanwhile, Ethiopia, Niger, Mali and other African countries are strongly backing agroforestry and the reforestation of degraded land.","Finkbeiner is immensely proud of the 13,500-hectare (33,359-acre) Plant for the Planet ranch in Campeche province, near Cancun, Mexico, which his foundation bought in 2014 and which now employs 78 people. The land had been deforested, and the aim is to plant 10 million trees there by 2020.","The climate crisis does not need technological intervention to resolve it because trees are by far the simplest and most efficient way to absorb the world’s emissions, Finkbeiner says. “Why not use them? Sometimes adults are really difficult to understand.”","In Mexico last month, he pressed his argument: “We know it is a complex challenge and no, we don’t have all the answers. But in the end, If we follow the scientists and we act and in 20 years find out they were wrong, well we didn’t make any mistakes. But if we follow the skeptics and in 20 years we find out that they were wrong, it will be too late to save our future.”","For more content and to be part of the ‘This New World’ community, join our Facebook Group.\n\nHuffPost’s ‘This New World’ series is funded by Partners for a New Economy and the Kendeda Fund.

Michigan District Court Judge Richard Ball of East Lansing authorized a criminal complaint and warrant against Strampel on Tuesday morning detailing four criminal charges, including misconduct of a public official, which is a felony punishable by five years in prison and a $10,000 fine. He was also charged with fourth-degree criminal sexual misconduct and two misdemeanor counts of willful neglect of duty.","The two counts of willful neglect of duty relate directly to the way Strampel handled a 2014 Title IX investigation into sexual abuse accusations against Nassar. Strampel allowed Nassar to continue working throughout the investigation, during which time the former doctor abused at least a dozen athletes.","Four female MSU medical students are accusing Strampel of sexual misconduct dating back to 2010. The former dean allegedly groped multiple female students, solicited them for nude photos and sexual acts in exchange for favorable treatment, and repeatedly made sexually charged comments. Investigators also found pornographic images and videos on Strampel’s work computer.","Michigan State Police Lt. Ryan Pennell said in the affidavit that among the videos on Strampel’s computer was one of Nassar sexually abusing a young female athlete during one of his “treatment sessions.”","One of Strampel’s accusers alleges that in 2011 he asked her to come to his office after she fell asleep in his class. During the meeting, he allegedly asked her to turn around in a circle twice “so that he could observe her body” and proceeded to berate her about her appearance, telling her she was “never going to make it in the profession if she did not dress sexier.”","The same woman said Strampel repeated his behavior during a 2013 meeting about her surgical residency, during which he advised her to learn her place in life and asked, “What do I have to do to teach you to be submissive and subordinate to men?”","Another woman told investigators that Strampel once declared that “it was good when women were drunk, because then it was easy to have sex with them.” She said that Strampel also grabbed her butt during a College of Osteopathic Medicine ball in 2010.","One woman told police that she “was not surprised Nassar had been able to victimize so many women under the supervision of Strampel.”","Strampel’s lawyer did not immediately answer HuffPost’s request for comment.","MSU’s interim president, former Michigan Gov. John Engler, responded to Strampel’s arrest in a statement to HuffPost:","One of the first actions I took upon my appointment as interim president of Michigan State University in early February was to pursue revocation of tenure and removal of former Dean William Strampel. As explained then, it was plainly evident he had not acted with the level of professionalism expected of an MSU employee, particularly one holding an office that involves student and patient safety.\n\nMSU will continue to cooperate with all official investigations related to sexual assault or other misconduct. But we have and will do more. With our action to revoke tenure, we are sending an unmistakable message that employees who do not treat students, faculty, or anyone else appropriately are subject to administrative discipline up to and including firing. Allegations about Strampel’s own behavior as well as lack of attention to the conduct of Larry Nassar now have resulted in criminal charges against him from the Michigan Attorney General. Some of the allegations about his personal conduct, especially conduct toward students, are disturbing. Today’s charges confirm our belief that he has fallen short of what is expected and required from academic leadership. They are not in alignment with this university’s values and they never have been.\n\nHis failings are unacceptable and that is why our work to change procedures, strengthen accountability and prevent sexual misconduct is so important. While the crimes of one doctor and the misconduct of his dean do not represent our university, they do demand the scrutiny of everyone in order to assure individuals like these can never be in a position again to harm others.","Attorney Jamie White, who represents several Nassar survivors, told HuffPost that he was not surprised by Strampel’s arrest.","“The University has been grossly negligent in its investigation of these matters,” White said, adding, “We will never know how much evidence has been lost, tampered with, and destroyed over the course of the last several years. But, based on the complaint issued against Dr. Strampel, it appears that attempts to conceal and/or delete evidence continued up until very recently.”","Strampel supervised Nassar, then MSU’s team doctor, for almost 15 years, during which time Nassar sexually abused hundreds of athletes. He stepped down as dean last year, officially due to medical reasons but under pressure for how he handled complaints about Nassar. Strampel is still an MSU employee and is named as a defendant in several civil lawsuits against MSU.","Engler began the process of terminating Strampel’s employment in February, although a spokeswoman for MSU told HuffPost earlier this month that the termination process could take up to a year.","Strampel is scheduled to be arraigned at 2:30 p.m. on Tuesday. Special Prosecutor Bill Forsyth, who has been tasked with investigating the university’s role in Nassar’s case, is set to comment on the charges at an afternoon press conference.","Olympic gymnast and Nassar survivor Aly Raisman reacted to the news of Strampel’s arrest on Tuesday afternoon.","Last week, The Wall Street Journal reported that Strampel said during a 2016 university meeting that he thought some of the athletes then accusing Nassar of sexual abuse were lying.","Nassar abused at least 265 children and young women during his time at MSU and as the USA Gymnastics team doctor. His victims include Olympians Gabby Douglas, McKayla Maroney and Simone Biles. Last year, he was sentenced to 60 years in prison on child pornography charges. This year he was handed two separate sentences of up to 175 years for sexual abuse.","The Michigan Attorney General’s Office launched an investigation into MSU after news broke that a number of Nassar’s victims had told school authorities about the abuse. The Detroit News reported that 14 school officials, including Strampel, were warned of the doctor’s behavior over the course of two decades.","Lou Anna K. Simon, also named in the investigation, resigned as MSU president days after Nassar’s conviction in January. The NCAA and the U.S. Department of Education have launched their own investigations into how MSU handled reports of sexual abuse.","This story has been updated with comments from MSU interim President John Engler and Aly Raisman."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab9c1c11f0000270616b889.jpeg?cache=OAJdBz3pwo&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Congresswoman To Paul Ryan: Make Blake Farenthold Repay $84,000 Sex Harassment Settlement","authors":"Jennifer Bendery","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jackie-speier-blake-farenthold-sexual-harassment-settlement_us_5aba9ae5e4b03e2a5c76f483","short_description":"Hold the Texas Republican accountable to \"the high standards our office demands,\" says Rep. Jackie Speier.","date":"2018-03-27"},"articleContent":["WASHINGTON ― Rep. Blake Farenthold (R-Texas) may be hoping that you forgot that he owes you $84,000 in taxpayer money that he used to settle a sexual harassment lawsuit against him, but at least one congresswoman has not.","Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) privately pressed House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) last week to do more to make sure Farenthold does not weasel out of paying back the taxpayer money he spent to settle a lawsuit involving gross allegations by a former female aide three years ago. Among other things, Farenthold allegedly told a staffer that the female aide could “show her nipples whenever she wanted to” and that he had “sexual fantasies” and “wet dreams” about her.","Details of his settlement weren’t public until last December, at which point he said he would retire at the end of 2018 and immediately repay the money. He never did.","“I urge you to make sure that Congressman Farenthold keeps his promise to the American people and reimburses the U.S. Treasury immediately for the full amount of the settlement,” Speier wrote in a March 15 letter to Ryan, which HuffPost has obtained.","She describes the GOP congressman’s changing justifications for refusing to repay the money, and says that while an ongoing House Ethics Committee probe into his office is important, it’s not relevant to the $84,000 he vowed to pay back “for which taxpayers have already been on the hook.”","Here’s her full letter:","It certainly appears that Farenthold is trying to get out of paying back the money. He’s gone from saying he would repay it immediately, to saying he would do it after the House passed a bill related to workplace protections on Capitol Hill, which it did, to saying that he wanted to see what the Senate and President Donald Trump do with that bill.","“Once the final bill is done and the law is changed and is complete and he can see that, he will make a determination of how he proceeds,” Farenthold’s chief of staff Bob Haueter told HuffPost in February.","The guy is not hard up for money, either. He’s worth millions of dollars.","A Farenthold spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment on when, or if, the lawmaker plans to repay the money.","Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong said only that “The speaker has reiterated to Mr. Farenthold that he needs to keep his promise to repay taxpayers for the settlement.”","Politico reported last week that Farenthold may be planning to resign from Congress sooner than the end of the year. That would allow him to dodge the House Ethics Committee investigation into allegations that he sexually harassed other members of his staff, used official money for campaign purposes, and lied or omitted details in previous testimony to the committee.","Speier, a leading voice in the push to crack down on sexual harassment on Capitol Hill, told HuffPost in February that GOP leaders could be doing more to demand that Farenthold repay the $84,000 ― or compel him to step down.","“They have the ability to force it,” said the California Democrat. “Blake Farenthold has to be, I think, cajoled, embarrassed, pressured by all of us to pay the money back. We had a situation on the Democratic side, we pressured members to resign, and they did.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aba9b1e1e00003b137afe73.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Chrissy Teigen Says She Knows Which Actress Bit Beyoncé In The Face","authors":"Cole Delbyck","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chrissy-teigen-beyonce_us_5aba41fce4b0decad04e1dd1","short_description":"SPILL THE TEA.","date":"2018-03-27"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Brie Larson Goes Full Superhero For Intense 'Captain Marvel' Workouts","authors":"Cole Delbyck","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/brie-larson-goes-full-superhero-for-captain-marvel-workouts_us_5aba5a14e4b008c9e5fbac2a","short_description":"She plays \"one of the universe’s most powerful heroes.\"","date":"2018-03-27"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"The 'Roseanne' Revival Catches Up To Our Thorny Political Mood, For Better And Worse","authors":"Matthew Jacobs","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/roseanne-revival-review_us_5ab3a497e4b054d118e04365","short_description":"What begins with an unrefined, heavy-handed tone eases into a show that again tackles American affairs with humor and candor.","date":"2018-03-27"},"articleContent":["The “Roseanne” that existed two decades ago didn’t have to remind us that it was topical. From 1988 to 1997, the show built its foundation on the everyday plight of a working-class family struggling to stay afloat in small-town America. The verisimilitude was often searing, and always rollicking. Even in the titular matriarch’s loudest moments, no one preached about current events in such a way that politics superseded the actual situations greeting characters in this situational comedy.","But today’s rendition, returning to ABC on Tuesday, is jonesing to announce its topicality, figurative megaphone in hand, almost as quickly as the opening credits roll. Face-to-face with the Donald Trump era, the inaugural episode’s politics are thundering, confrontational and ham-fisted.","Early on, a svelte Dan (John Goodman) returns from the pharmacy to report that the Conners’ health insurance no longer funds all the medicine they need ― their “candy,” as Roseanne (Roseanne Barr) calls it. Dan and Roseanne are left to divide what’s left of their statins, anti-inflammatories and pain pills as if playing a game to see who lands the bigger stash. After the next commercial break, Jackie (Laurie Metcalf) arrives at the Conners’ comfortingly cluttered home wearing a pink “Nasty Woman” shirt and pussy hat, estranged from her sister because Roseanne pulled the lever in Trump’s favor.","“How could you have voted for him?” Jackie demands before we’ve even been reintroduced to the whole clan. Their argument turns to talk of “snowflakes” and “making America great again” ― the same polarization that plays out ad nauseam on social media and during cable-news cage fights.","That transition, from medical woes to tired retorts about an election we’ve spent a year and a half mourning, epitomizes the shift in woke sitcom writing that has occurred in the years since “Roseanne” first signed off. The original program was founded upon situational concepts that couched real-world issues in primetime banter, while the reboot opens with a showboating scheme that borrows low-hanging ideological fruit to paint a heavy-handed divide across party lines.","Despite her feminism, it makes some sense that Roseanne Conner would have voted for Trump. Discounting the messy final season that aired in 1996 and ‘97, in which the Conners won the lottery and imploded the series’ spirit, the eight years Roseanne spent assembly-lining at a plastics factory, sweeping a beauty-parlor floor, telemarketing, working a fast-food joint and eventually co-owning a small luncheonette, all the while fretting about bills and taxes and college funds, make her a fitting figurehead for toiling middle-class parents who felt ostracized by the proverbial establishment and lashed out in the 2016 election. Trump “talked about jobs,” she insists.","Alas, watching Roseanne and Jackie bark clichés at each other in 2018 is already stale, as if the writing team ― spearheaded by Bruce Helford (who also oversaw one previous season) and Whitney Cummings ― took too many notes from the virtue signaling that attracts retweets and viral headlines. “Roseanne” was already the most political sitcom in history; must it be so literal and loudmouthed about it now?","But, as a longtime disciple who thinks the Conners’ living room is among popular culture’s greatest hallmarks, I’m pleased to report that this bug is not a feature of the entire season ― at least it isn’t so glaring in the third and seventh episodes, which, oddly enough, were the only other installments ABC provided to press ahead of the premiere. In fact, once we get past the unrefined, rhythm-less debut, what I’ve seen of the show is downright wonderful. We can exhale. “Roseanne” is indeed back.","It must be hard, anyway, to revive characters left dormant for 20 years, especially for someone as erratic as Barr, who hasn’t maintained much of an acting career beyond guest spots on “The Office,” “Portlandia” and the short-lived “Cristela.” But by Episode 3, she’s restored her brassy groove. Everything about Roseanne’s repartee with Jackie, along with her hard-edged but ultimately loving parenting tactics, feel plucked right out of the “Roseanne” we once knew, with one golden difference: Where her own mother (Estelle Parsons) was once the out-of-touch try-hard, it’s now Roseanne who has to play catchup with the world her children (and grandchildren) occupy. As such, the banter between them is laugh-tracked and whip-smart, the punchlines are pithy and purposeful, and the politics aren’t reduced to ersatz sermonizing.","“Roseanne” does a splendid job recontextualizing its characters. A divorced and jobless Darlene (Sara Gilbert, who orchestrated this reunion) moves back in with Roseanne and Dan, bringing along her teenage daughter (Emma Kenney) and gender-probing 11-year-old (Ames McNamara), who identifies as a boy but prefers to wear skirts and nail polish. These are the sort of politics at which “Roseanne” excels: Through the lens of their underemployed daughter and nonconforming grandchild, Dan and “Granny Rose” are forced to examine their own prejudices. They want to protect their beloved from schoolyard bullying but encourage his self-acceptance, opening up a conversation about identity that need not to underscore its message with platitudes or homilies.","The rest of Episodes 3 and 7 operate with the same delicate blend of comedy and domestic drama. Jackie spouts the canned advice she now doles out as a life coach ― Metcalf again nails Jackie’s mania with supercharged precision ― while a waitressing 43-year-old Becky (Lecy Goranson) sparks when a woman (Sarah Chalke, the other Becky) offers her $50,000 to serve as a surrogate mother. And tender D.J. (Michael Fishman) has just returned from military duty in Syria, caring for his young mixed-race daughter Mary (Jayden Rey) while his wife serves overseas. Meanwhile, Roseanne can’t afford surgery to fix a bad knee, so she’s hogging those analgesics her insurance will hardly pay for. When she and Dan attempt to cash in on rewards points for their anniversary by spending a night at a hotel, the credit card they’re required to log upon check-in is declined, thwarting their respite and shoving them back out into the jungle. (“I just want to go home, and if you saw where we live, you would know what an insult that is,” Roseanne quips.)","There’s even a peanut-allergy subplot thrown in, proving just how down and dirty this reboot is willing to get.","Through it all, the writing is faithful to the Conners we knew in the pre-internet age, letting the show be woke without proclaiming itself as such. Maybe that’s the hurdle in expunging a series’ plot points, as “Roseanne” did with Dan’s death and “Will & Grace” did with the title pair’s parenthood: There’s so much exposition to establish and history to redraft that preaching about the corrupt election we can’t stop stressing about simply adds another layer of bulk. Why are our characters debating Trump’s candidacy now? Well, because that’s when their TV show is airing ― a poor excuse that convinces some sitcom writers they have a duty to address the national mood head-on.","Roseanne and Jackie’s feud probably sounds familiar to many American families, sure, but let’s see them experience the world, not just argue about it like a half-baked Facebook debate. That dynamic may have worked for Archie Bunker on “All in the Family,” but, 40 years later, we need characters who will do more than regurgitate media buzzwords.","By most accounts, it looks like “Roseanne” will, eventually, return to its nuanced roots, crocheted afghan and all.

Engaging the government is more difficult.”","TOP LGBT EXECUTIVE\n\nThere have been other signs of growing acceptance.\n\nHong Kong is set to become the host of the 2022 Gay Games, a sports and cultural event dubbed the “Gay Olympics,” after fighting off bids from cities in the United States and Mexico.\n\nIn a rare victory, a Hong Kong court last year ruled that a British lesbian whose partner worked in the city should receive a spousal visa.\n\nThe charity Big Love Alliance - of which Chao is a founding member - organises an annual Pink Dot gathering to campaign for LGBT rights and it has attracted sponsorship from embassies and investment banks.\n\nChao also works with the United Nations on LGBT rights and became the first Asian to be named as the top LGBT executive on an annual OUTstanding list compiled by the Financial Times which ranks LGBT role models in business.\n\nA qualified helicopter pilot, Chao said the marriage bounty episode did not tarnish her ties with her father - who like her also shares a passion of flying.\n\n“You build a much stronger bond in these relationships after you have been able to live your full self, be a full person and live as an honest person in front of your mum and dad,” she said.\n\n“It is an important process to go through although in the short term it does jolt them into a bit of shock.”\n\nBut in a signal that there is still a long way to go for same-sex marriage in Hong Kong, Chao said she and her partner have had to temporarily put aside the idea of having children.\n\n“Even for people like me - who many perceive as having all the resources in the world to do whatever I want in some ways - it is very difficult,” she said.\n\n“It is not easy because you can’t do it in Hong Kong or anywhere else in Asia.”",""],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aba8542200000d30ceb3287.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Tiffany Haddish Has Dating Tips For Guys, And None Involve Turpentine","authors":"Ron Dicker","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tiffany-haddish-dating-tips_us_5aba5a3fe4b054d118e73afc","short_description":"The \"Girls Trip\" actress gives the definitive answer on whether men should spray cologne on their privates.","date":"2018-03-27"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"QUEER VOICES","headline":"Aaron Carter Says News About Being Bisexual Was 'A Little Misconstrued'","authors":"Curtis M.

In the tweet, which has since been deleted, he said he’d “started to find boys and girls attractive” as a teen, and had “an experience with a male” whom he “worked with and grew up with.”","Carter, however, set the record straight March 23, and told Hollywood Life’s Bonnie Fuller he doesn’t see himself in a relationship with another man anytime soon.","“It was more so just a story that happened when I was, like, 17 with somebody,” he said on the podcast. (Carter’s comments on sexuality start at about 19 and a half minutes into the interview.) “I can find men and women attractive, but when it comes down to it, I think it was a little misconstrued.

It was something that I just felt like was important and I needed to say.”","At the time, he hinted that his relationship with girlfriend Madison Parker ended because of his admission.

They’ll never leave you over you saying that ‘I want to be honest’ about whether it’s about me being bisexual, bicurious, being gay, or anything.” (Parker denied Carter’s claims.)","Later in the TMZ interview, however, Carter said he was “going to be pursuing relationships with women.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aba543c1f0000260616b995.jpeg?cache=E8aA3YJRbm&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Minnesota Woman Blamed For Al Franken's Fall Had Nothing To Do With It","authors":"Amanda Terkel","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lindsey-port-al-franken-minnesota_us_5ab92abce4b054d118e59175","short_description":"Lindsey Port accused another man of harassment. But fellow Democrats say she \"softened the ground\" for Franken's resignation.","date":"2018-03-27"},"articleContent":["Lindsey Port, 35, doesn’t really know Al Franken. She met the Minnesota Democrat in passing at political events, but that’s about it. And she never even called on him to resign from the Senate after a number of other women accused him of sexual harassment.","But for some reason, she’s being blamed for his downfall.","Port has spoken out about sexual harassment. In November, as a Democratic candidate for the Minnesota state House, she and state Rep. Erin Maye Quade (D) accused state Sen. Dan Schoen (D) of harassing them. Schoen eventually stepped down, and Port became one of the most visible faces of the Me Too movement in Minnesota.","She initially received a flood of goodwill for speaking out. But the reaction changed when the Franken allegations surfaced.","Port’s willingness to call attention to sexual harassment went from being applauded to being questioned. Members of her own party said she had “softened the ground” for Franken’s resignation in early January, and some people even wondered if she was secretly a conservative operative who had planned to take down the popular senator all along.","On social media, Port saw comments that questioned her identity, motives and truthfulness.","This Facebook commenter above was right that it wasn’t just a “coincidence” that the Schoen and Franken scandals happened so close together ― but it’s not because there was a large GOP conspiracy to bring them down. The country was in the middle of the Me Too moment, when powerful men like Harvey Weinstein and Matt Lauer were facing a reckoning for their years of abuse, and more women were feeling emboldened to speak up.","That the backlash came from within her own community is particularly disheartening for Port.","“I honestly think the most frustrating part of it has been not only Democrats ― this is our team, these are the people who are supposed to be with us ― but it has been primarily women. There’s definitely a generational divide, 100 percent. But it has primarily been women pushing this,” she said of the criticism she’s faced.","Speaking out has cost Port financially. About a week after Franken’s resignation, she dropped her state legislative bid because donors began pulling their contributions, and she felt she couldn’t focus on the district and its priorities.","Port also co-operates a nonprofit, Blueprint Campaigns, that helps progressive individuals from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds run for office. The nonprofit also lost donations.","“We had $70,000 pulled the week that Al Franken said he was going to resign,” Port said. “In that same window, I also lost $6,000 from my own campaign.”","One person asked that her contribution to the campaign be returned. The rest of the unhappy donors, to both the campaign and the nonprofit, pulled their pledges. One donor told Port that she was “too controversial” to support at that time, as MinnPost reported. Port had never had any contributions taken back before.","Meredith Stacey, Port’s partner at Blueprint, said she also noticed that after the allegations against Franken broke, people weren’t reaching out or returning their phone calls quite as frequently.","“Democratic donor doors are very shut to me right now,” Port said. As evidence, she noted that Ken Martin, the chair of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (the state’s version of the Democratic Party), unfriended her on Facebook ― an accusation that he denies.","“God’s honest truth, I’ve never unfriended anyone,” Martin said. “So to be honest with you, I don’t even know how to do it.”","“I guess what I am concerned by is any kind of insinuation that me personally or the state party hasn’t stood by Lindsey. We’ve been very supportive of her in these efforts. We believe her,” he added. “We think that at the end of the day, if there’s any retaliation going on ― as I mentioned to her the other day ― I want to know about it. Because I will call those donors myself.”","Port said she hasn’t been able to get Martin on the phone to tell him about the problems she’s had and the donations that were pulled. She also said she’s asked him to raise money to replace the sums that Blueprint Campaigns lost, and he hasn’t followed up.","Martin said that he hadn’t heard from Port about any request to help her raise money and that he has tried to be as helpful as possible in supporting her.","Feelings about the Franken scandal are still raw in Minnesota. The issue remains so divisive that a number of state Democrats were only willing to give their opinion about the situation off the record.","The former senator’s Facebook page is filled with people saying how much they miss him:","“I am still incredibly bitter that you were forced to resign. You were/are one of the good guys.”\n\n“I hope you don’t retire from politics, Al Franken. There was no due process when you left. I thought it was premature.”","State Rep. Erin Maye Quade has also heard the insinuations that she and Port were part of some grand conspiracy to oust Franken or that they’d put party members in a difficult position because after denouncing Schoen, Democrats then were forced to weigh in on Franken.","“I’m the one who gets harassed, and all of a sudden I face all the consequences,” Maye Quade said. “No matter who it is, it’s always about the fall of men and never about the women who were just trying to work and do their job and have to endure this over and over and over.”","“I was more surprised about how much my story was never really about me after that,” the lawmaker added. “It was always about the men and their downfall.”","Port and Maye Quade aren’t the only women who have faced the ire of Franken supporters. At least one major Democratic donor has said she’ll reconsider her support for senators who called for Franken to quit ― including Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), who was one of his toughest critics. (Recall that Port never actually urged Franken to resign.)","MinnPost first reported on Port’s decision to drop her state legislative bid because of the backlash she received after the Franken scandal. The story received surprisingly little pickup, especially compared to the attention her initial allegations against Schoen garnered.","But one person who did notice was Laura Flynn, a member of the advisory board for the Movement Voter Project, which raises funds for nonpartisan and progressive groups around the country that are mobilizing and doing voter engagement work. In February, Flynn mobilized other MVP donors and so far, they’ve raised $26,000 for Blueprint.","“Yes, this is a story about an individual woman facing backlash because of what she did, because of speaking out. ... But secondly, it’s a real question for the Democratic Party,” Flynn said. “If you’re going to turn on the most forward-thinking young people who can actually go out there and run grassroots campaigns and win elections ― it’s very clear here in Minnesota, we’re not going to be able to win the statehouse if we’re going to silence or quash those voices.”","Another person who has supported Port has been state Rep. Ilhan Omar (D), who made history in 2016 when she became the first Somali-American legislator in the country.","“I think that for women, we’ve always known what is at stake,” Omar said. “It’s really important for people to realize that once you take that step, yes, there are people who are going to be against you, but there are going to be people ― if not as much, but more ― who will stand by you, who will uplift you, who will celebrate you for living your truth, for being brave and for continuing to widen the door for other women to step through.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab92c3a1e0000fb077afc85.jpeg?cache=BsdKSSQtl8&ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Nickelodeon Cuts Ties With 'iCarly' Creator Dan Schneider After Alleged Abusive Behavior","authors":"Cole Delbyck","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nickelodeon-cuts-ties-with-icarly-creator-dan-schneider-over-abuse-allegations_us_5aba7b37e4b04a59a31205e1","short_description":"The famed producer helped launch the careers of stars like Ariana Grande and Amanda Bynes.","date":"2018-03-27"},"articleContent":["Nickelodeon has officially cut ties with famed producer Dan Schneider, creator of major hits including “iCarly,” “All That,” “The Amanda Show” and “Drake & Josh,” following allegations of abusive behavior.","The network and Schneider, who’ve worked together since the late ’80s, mutually agreed not to extend a production deal with his company, Schneider’s Bakery.","“Following many conversations together about next directions and future opportunities, Nickelodeon and our long-time creative partner Dan Schneider/Schneider’s Bakery have agreed to not extend the current deal,” Nickelodeon and Schneider said in a joint statement to HuffPost. “Since several Schneider’s Bakery projects are wrapping up, both sides agreed that this is a natural time for Nickelodeon and Schneider’s Bakery to pursue other opportunities and projects.”","Neither Nickelodeon nor Schneider gave a reason for the split.

The campaign ― dubbed “Project Ripon” ― continued even after an attorney warned the firm to obey U.S. election laws, which mandate foreigners cannot “directly or indirectly participate in the decision-making process” in a political campaign.","Despite the warning, at least 20 non-Americans were sent to advise congressional and legislative campaigns in 2014, and helped to decide who to target with political messages, the Post reported. Such voters were dubbed “hidden Republicans.”","Wylie, who helped found Cambridge Analytica and worked at the firm until 2014, sparked a firestorm earlier this month when he revealed that the company had misused the private information of more than 50 million Facebook users. He told the Post that the use of foreigners on the ground often led to legal discussions about U.S. election laws between Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix and then-vice president Steve Bannon.","“Its dirty little secret was that there was no one American involved in it, that it was a de facto foreign agent, working on an American election,” Wylie told the Post.","Earlier this week he told NBC News that “it was not just me.”","“Like 20 other people were. We had Canadians, British, Eastern Europeans, Lithuanians, Germans, Romanians, Greeks,” Wylie said. “We weren’t just working on messaging. We were instructing campaigns on which messages go where and to who.”","The use of foreign nationals in U.S. elections was first detailed in a memo Wylie supplied to media outlets earlier this month. In the document, a lawyer for the data firm warned Nix that he would need to refrain from “substantive management” due to his citizenship and that Cambridge Analytica would need to find U.S. citizens or green card holders to make any larger decisions.","Two other employees at the firm, speaking anonymously, told the Post that they worried about violating U.S. law and echoed that such concerns were regularly discussed in 2014.","“We knew that everything was not above board, but we weren’t too concerned about it,” one of the employees said. “It was the Wild West.

Elaine and Dennis, Toby’s father, were single-minded in their devotion to their only child.","All of which makes the story of their relationship during the last years of Elaine Davidow’s life so surprising.","Toby Davidow, a program coordinator in the student affairs office at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., lays the blame on her parents’ live-in caregiver, 58-year-old Ann Fry. With Toby’s father’s cooperation, Fry barred Toby and the rest of her family, including Elaine’s only surviving sister, from seeing or speaking to her for the last three years of her life, from late 2014 until her death in October, at age 72.","Toby Davidow said she didn’t even know that for the last three months of her life, her mother, who had multiple sclerosis and dementia, was in hospice care, first in her Cherry Hill, New Jersey, home and then in a nearby facility.","Nobody bothered to tell her or other relatives that her mother had died until a week later. By then, Elaine Davidow had been cremated, against the wishes she had expressed before her cognition began failing, according to her daughter.","The events over the past years have devastated Davidow.","“Especially in the later years, Mom and Dad would travel down to my home in Virginia every 6 to 8 weeks from New Jersey, so that Mom and I could go to the spa together,” she recalled in an email. “We’d both get manicures and pedicures done together, giggle over magazines, and share stories. Mom really loved those visits, so much so that I even got a two-bedroom apartment so that my parents had a place to stay when they visited.”","Experiences like Davidow’s have prompted at least 11 states to enact laws that would provide a legal remedy, besides seeking guardianship, which can be costly and complicated, for relatives who have been prevented from seeing infirm or disabled family members.","Under the laws, relatives can seek a court order permitting visitation and communication. The order must be granted, unless the ailing relative is found to be mentally competent and objects to contact.","Celebrity Children Testify","The Maryland House this month passed a visitation bill unanimously, sending it to the Senate. The vote came a few weeks after the children of a trio of celebrities appeared before a House committee to recount experiences similar to Davidow’s.","They were led by a daughter of the late disc jockey Casey Kasem. Through public appearances and her foundation, Kasem Cares, Kerri Kasem has spearheaded largely successful efforts to enact visitation laws throughout the country. Her father, creator and host of radio’s “American Top 40,” a countdown of popular hits, died in 2014 at 82, kicking off a round of wrongful death claims and counterclaims between his widow and his children. Before his death, there had been highly publicized legal squabbles about his guardianship.","Joining Kasem in Annapolis were Travis Campbell, son of the country music legend Glen Campbell, who died at age 81 last summer of complications from Alzheimer’s disease, and Kelly Rooney, the eldest of Mickey Rooney’s eight children. Rooney, the movie star whose career spanned nine decades, died at age 93 in 2014.","Davidow joined them to testify about efforts by stepparents or caregivers to keep them from seeing or communicating with ailing parents or siblings with disabilities.","“He was in a guardianship for the last 18 months, and we never saw him again,” Kelly Rooney said in an interview. At age 90, Mickey Rooney appeared before a U.S. Senate committee and claimed he had been a victim of physical, emotional and financial abuse at the hands of his eighth and last wife and her adult children. His conservator, another term for “guardian,” continued to keep her father from his biological children until his death, Kelly Rooney said.","Travis Campbell also was denied visits with his father. He only found out through media reports that his father, who lived in California, had been transferred to an Alzheimer’s facility in Tennessee. Once he found out, he said, his stepmother still severely curtailed his ability to spend time with his father, whose most famous songs included “By the Time I Get to Phoenix” and “Wichita Lineman.”","“If there had been a law in effect,” Campbell said, “I would have had the most precious gift of all — time with my father.”","In Maryland, the visitation bill has not attracted a great deal of opposition. But Ria Rochvarg, a Maryland attorney who practices guardianship law, testified against it.","“I’m not against the idea, but it doesn’t do what supporters say it does,” she said in an interview. The legislation, Rochvarg said, would require another, possibly expensive judicial process involving lawyers.","“I want people to get visitation without a lengthy process and without lawyers,” she said. “This bill doesn’t do that.”","Isolation","Catherine Seal, the immediate past president of the National Academy of Elder Law Attorneys, said the underlying concern in such cases is that somebody is exerting “undue influence on the senior.”","“One of the classic hallmarks of undue influence is to isolate the person in question by limiting both in-person and phone contact,” said Seal, who practices in Colorado Springs, Colorado. “They convince the person that all these outside people, even family members, are a threat.”","Seal is sympathetic to the intentions behind the new visitation laws, but she prefers her organization’s model guardianship legislation, which would prevent guardians from restricting access to family members the ward wishes to see or communicate with. Critics point out, however, that Seal’s approach doesn’t address the many situations where there is no appointed guardian, or cases in which the caregiver is manipulating the ward into thinking poorly of family members. No state has yet enacted NAELA’s model legislation.","The Maryland bill, like laws that have passed elsewhere, contains provisions beyond visitation. It also would require guardians or caregivers to quickly notify family members when their wards have been hospitalized or when they have died.","Not all of those hoping for passage of the Maryland bill have elderly parents in mind.","Kim Ruszala of New Market, who also testified at the Capitol in Annapolis, has been fighting with her stepmother to gain unfettered access to her 44-year-old brother, Chris Asher, the youngest of her three siblings, who is developmentally delayed. From December 2015 to February 2017, a period after the death of their father, Ruszala said, she wasn’t allowed to see Asher except for a single brief visit at a McDonald’s. The guardianship agreement now permits Ruszala to visit with Asher twice a month.","“I just wanted to see my brother on a regular basis,” Ruszala said in her testimony.","On a recent Friday afternoon, Chris’ stepmother, Constance Asher, brought him to see Ruszala at a Cheesecake Factory in Columbia, Maryland, so the siblings could spend the weekend together. Chris joked happily with Ruszala and her boyfriend, Glenn Weigle, reminiscing about their times together, going camping, thrilling to amusement park rides, and that day he had his face painted for a Baltimore Ravens game.","“The biggest frustration for me,” Ruszala said, is “there’s no avenue to get into the court system to ask for visitation for someone who has a guardian.”","In November, Constance Asher alleged in a court filing that Ruszala’s visits with Asher were “damaging Christopher’s social and emotional well-being.” Asher told the court that Ruszala gave her brother alcohol and cigarettes.","Ruszala told Stateline she allowed Chris to have an occasional beer, as did his father, and that her brother had once stolen a pack of cigarettes from her and smoked one. At the Cheesecake Factory, Chris backed up his sister’s story.","Asher did not respond to several phone and email requests for comment.","If a visitation law had been in place in New Jersey, Davidow might have been able to spend time with her mother. Until the caregiver appeared around 2010, Davidow said, she was also close to her father, a school administrator in New Jersey for 30 years. “We were friends my entire life,” she said.","But he became a man she didn’t recognize, hostile to a daughter he had once showered with affection. He wouldn’t let Davidow in the house and hung up on her when she called.

That was unfair to you and it was wrong, and it disparaged some very noble work you’re doing.”","The rapper faced enormous backlash on social media after NRATV shared video of him criticizing National School Walkout Day.\n\n“I told my kids on the school walkout, ‘I love you, [but] if you walk out that school, walk out my house,’” he says in the interview.\n\n“We are a gun-owning family, we are a family where my sister farms, we are a family where we’ll fish and hunt, but we are not a family that jumps on every single thing that an ally of ours does because some stuff we just don’t agree with.”","Killer Mike also argues that mainstream progressive movements responsible for massive protests aren’t always allies for the black community’s issues.","“If you’re not in a reciprocal relationship, why are you in this relationship?” he asks. Later, he adds: “Why are your allies not fighting your other fights with the same vigor you’re fighting these?”\n\nMany on social media responded to the interview with confusion, anger, and disgust:","Killer Mike, whose offstage name is Michael Render, has been an outspoken social activist for years, taking on social inequality, police brutality and systemic racism.","Killer Mike said he agreed to be interviewed by the NRA because he wanted to follow Martin Luther King Jr.’s playbook and sit “with people who I might not always agree with” to further the national conversation about black gun ownership.","His apology videos stressed that he is an ally to young people organizing for ending racism, and those advocating such issues as health care and LGBTQ rights. The NRA video, he said, should have never been used in a context with with March for Our Lives.","“I think it’s wrong,” he said of the gun group’s tactic. “To the young people that worked tirelessly to organize, I’m sorry adults chose to do this. I’m sorry NRATV did that. I’m sorry that adults on the left and the right are choosing to use me as a lightning rod.

But when Garcia arrived for his most recent appointment in Atlanta, in January, the agency detained him.","Garcia told the officer he wanted to stay in the U.S. until at least May 2019, when his eldest daughter will graduate from medical school. He hoped to watch her walk across the stage at Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine and accept her diploma. If he could just be present for that moment, he’d buy his own ticket to Guatemala, the country he left 23 years ago to seek asylum in the U.S.","The officer said no.","Garcia’s been locked up in detention ever since. His daughters are now petitioning the Trump administration for his release and hope to have his removal order overturned in court. He is scheduled for deportation on April 4.","Garcia is one of a growing number of undocumented immigrants being detained during periodic check-ins with ICE as part of President Donald Trump’s efforts to increase deportations. Like many of them, he was ordered removed by a judge but was allowed to stay in the U.S. for years as long as he appeared at appointments and otherwise kept out of trouble.","Now, these immigrants are easy pickings for removal — they walk into ICE offices for check-ins and aren’t allowed out, based on orders from years back that they can’t easily fight.","Detaining people like Garcia at check-ins is an increasingly common tactic to “rack up numbers of deportations without needing to go back into the immigration court system,” according to Charles Roth, director of litigation of the National Immigrant Justice Center, who is not representing Garcia but is familiar with his case. “What the immigration authorities tend to do is to go after the low-hanging fruit.”","ICE spokeswoman Tammy Spicer confirmed that Garcia was detained on Jan. 23 because of his final order of removal. The agency “takes seriously its obligation to enforce the nation’s immigration laws, and the enforcement actions ICE employs are intended to accomplish this fairly and efficiently,” she said in a statement.","“ICE does not exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement,” she said. “All of those in violation of the immigration laws may be subject to immigration arrest, detention and, if found removable by final order, removal from the United States.","Garcia’s deportation is now just a week away. That means he could soon be separated from his family, including three daughters: one a U.S. citizen, one a green-card holder, and one who has temporary protections under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA. That daughter, Belsy Garcia Manrique, is in her third year at Stritch School of Medicine, which has made a concerted effort to enroll DACA holders and rally behind them.","For now, Garcia is at Stewart Detention Center in Lumpkin, Georgia, where he sleeps in a room with 60 other men. Many of the other men he’s talked to have also been in the U.S. for years and have clean criminal records.","“They are not sending only people that deserve to be sent,” Garcia said. “They are sending everybody.”","Garcia came to the U.S. in 1995 seeking asylum. In Guatemala, he was studying to be an accountant and was in a leadership position at school when he began to receive threats, so he decided to go to the U.S. for safety and a better future. His case moved quickly through the court process — unusually quickly compared to most nationwide, Roth said. Garcia didn’t have an attorney and was given only weeks to find one. He didn’t, and ultimately was ordered deported. That year, 88 percent of unrepresented asylum seekers were denied in court, versus 66 percent of those with lawyers.","Garcia didn’t know that he could appeal, and because he didn’t do so at the time, it will be more difficult to have the removal overturned now. He stayed in the U.S. without documents and began to learn English by writing down every word he saw on the street and then looking them up later in a dictionary. He moved to Calhoun, Georgia, worked two jobs, finished his GED and studied for a certification in accounting.","In 2011, ICE appeared at Garcia’s home and detained him. But an officer told him he could be released if he answered questions about his employer for an investigation into the employer’s hiring practices, and he did. ICE gave him a stay of removal, which is not legal status but allowed him to remain if he checked in periodically.","While President Barack Obama was in office, Garcia felt mostly safe. He started to buy houses, repair them and sell them, and then to buy land and build the houses from the ground up, teaching himself methods on YouTube and employing workers.","But when Trump was elected, Garcia began to worry, and talked to his wife about finding another solution, like moving to Canada. The family talked over the holidays about what was happening with ICE, and knew it was possible he could be detained at his Jan. 23 check-in.","Garcia wants to do the right thing. He pays taxes, employs contractors and has a family in the U.S. he wants to be with. He fears going back to Guatemala, where he is worried he could be targeted for extortion because of his ties to the U.S. He has no pathway to become a citizen. But he also believes he’s already achieved his American dream by helping his daughters succeed.","So Garcia went to the appointment in Atlanta with his two youngest daughters, who weren’t allowed in, even though family members had accompanied him on previous visits.","Inside the ICE facility, Garcia begged the officer to let him stay. But the man said his hands were tied.","Garcia texted his eldest daughter, the doctor-in-training.","“They are going to detain me my child,” he wrote. “Keep going my child, you can do it.”","Then the officers took him away.","This article has been updated with a statement from Immigration and Customs Enforcement."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab906491e00008e0b7afc1c.jpeg?cache=sk9c1Qim0v&ops=crop_12_19_948_586%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Trump Ally Sues Qatar For Hacking His Email","authors":"Jessica Schulberg","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/elliott-broidy-sue-qatar-hack-email_us_5ab94196e4b054d118e5c676","short_description":"GOP fundraiser Elliott Broidy says Qatar leaked his emails to reporters in retaliation for his criticism of the Qatari government.","date":"2018-03-26"},"articleContent":["WASHINGTON — A top GOP fundraiser and his wife sued the government of Qatar, lobbyist and former Republican political adviser Nicolas Muzin, and Muzin’s lobbying firm Stonington Strategies on Monday for allegedly hacking their email accounts and distributing the stolen emails to various media organizations.","The selectively leaked emails appear to show Elliott Broidy, a Los Angeles-based Republican National Committee deputy finance chair, using his proximity to Republican elected officials to influence foreign policy decisions and to boost his defense company’s business prospects. The anonymous leaker, which described itself as a group that exposes wrongdoing in Hollywood, has disseminated different tranches of hacked emails to reporters over the past several weeks, resulting in a trickle of negative news stories scrutinizing Broidy’s business practices and his communications with U.S. politicians and foreign governments.","The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Associated Press, Bloomberg, Al Jazeera, HuffPost and others have published stories that appear to be based on the leaked emails.","Broidy, who has denied any wrongdoing, has for weeks accused Qatar of orchestrating the hack in retaliation for his outspoken criticism of the government there and his support for its regional rivals.","“We believe the evidence is clear that a nation state is waging a sophisticated disinformation campaign against me in order to silence me, including hacking emails, forging documents, and engaging in espionage and numerous other illegal activities,” Broidy said in a statement. “We believe it is also clear that I have been targeted because of my strong political views against Qatar’s state sponsored terrorism and double dealing.”","Qatar denies it was involved in the hack. “Mr. Broidy’s lawsuit is a transparent effort to divert attention from U.S. media reports about his activities,” Jassim Al-Thani, Qatar’s media attache in Washington, said in a statement. “His lawsuit is without merit of fact. It is Mr. Broidy, not Qatar, who orchestrated nefarious activities designed to influence Congress and American foreign policy. It does not matter how many venues Mr. Broidy publishes his false accusations in, they will not become truth.”","The Qatari government has indicated in a past statement to HuffPost that it is considering a counter-lawsuit against Broidy for making “false statements.”","On Monday, Broidy also accused Muzin, a lobbyist hired by Qatar, of helping to carry out the operation.","Muzin dismissed the allegations. “Mr. Broidy’s lawsuit is an obvious attempt to draw attention away from his controversial work, and is as flimsy as the promises he reportedly made to his clients,” Muzin wrote in an email. “I am proud of the work my firm has conducted with Qatar and look forward to continuing to support peaceful dialogue and progress in the Middle East.”","The hacking operation began around Dec. 27, 2017, when Broidy’s wife, Robin Rosenzweig, received a phishing email that appeared to be a Gmail security alert, according to the complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California on Monday. When Rosenzweig entered her login credentials, as prompted by the phishing email, hackers gained access to her account, which included login information for other email accounts, including Broidy’s.","Broidy and Rosenzweig hired forensic analysts to track down the source of the hack. For weeks, Broidy’s team promised to soon release definitive evidence proving Qatar was responsible for stealing the emails. But the complaint filed on Monday offered little proof.","According to the complaint, Broidy’s team initially traced the hacker to IP addresses in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. But they later discovered that the attack originated in Qatar — the European IP addresses were meant to mask the real identity of the hacker, the complaint alleged.","The complaint does not provide forensic evidence that the government of Qatar directed the hack. Instead, it provides a lengthy description of Qatar’s efforts to improve its reputation in Washington by hiring politically savvy lobbyists — and how Broidy worked to crush those efforts.","The complaint pits Muzin and Broidy — two prominent Republican operatives who are active in the pro-Israel advocacy world — against each other.","Muzin is one of several lobbyists Qatar hired to advocate for it in the U.S. as Washington mulled how to respond to a Saudi-led blockade against Qatar. Last September, Muzin’s lobbying firm Stonington Strategies registered as a foreign agent for Qatar. Initially retained at a rate of $50,000 per month, Qatar later increased the rate to $300,000 per month.","As part of his effort to improve Qatar’s image, Muzin tried to get Jewish American leaders to meet with Qatar’s emir in New York during the United Nations General Assembly and to visit Qatar on an all-expense-paid trip, the complaint alleged. Broidy urged Jewish American leaders to turn down the invitation.","As Broidy worked to block Qatar’s efforts to improve its image in the U.S., his defense firm inked lucrative deals with Qatar’s regional rivals. In 2017 he finalized more than $200 million worth of contracts with the United Arab Emirates to develop its defense and counterterrorism ties, the complaint stated. Broidy is in discussions to do similar work with the government of Saudi Arabia.","The complaint provides no conclusive evidence that Muzin was involved in distributing the stolen emails to reporters. According to the complaint, Muzin indicated he was aware of the operation by stating, “I did not cause the Broidy stuff, just because I have information” and “I don’t know all the details, but I know that I am hearing repeatedly that there’s a lot more coming.” It is not clear to whom those comments were directed.","Muzin did not respond to a question about those comments.","Broidy and Rosenzweig are asking the court to order injunctive relief to prevent access to and use of the stolen emails and to award monetary damages.","Broidy made headlines in 2009, when he pleaded guilty to giving New York state officials almost $1 million worth of gifts to help his company win a lucrative contract with the state’s pension fund. But since then, he has largely operated behind the scenes. That changed after reporters started receiving his and his wife’s internal emails, offering a glimpse at how the well-connected fundraiser’s political and business activities intersected.","On Feb. 28, HuffPost received the first batch of Broidy’s emails from a group that called itself L.A. Confidential. The emails appeared to show Rosenzweig, asking for more than $80 million to scuttle a Justice Department investigation into a corruption scandal implicating a Malaysian businessman — and Broidy using his ties to the Trump administration to help.","The next round of emails showed Broidy directly pitching President Donald Trump on a plan to recruit an international army “of Muslim soldiers recruited from Arab and Islamic nations” to fight the Taliban and the Islamic State group in Afghanistan.","The most recent round of emails sent to HuffPost came from a group that called itself Hollywood 2018 and used ProtonMail, an encrypted email service. When HuffPost tried to ask Hollywood 2018 if it was the same group that was behind L.A. Confidential, the email bounced back, indicating the account had been deactivated.","The leaker was strategic, providing different news outlets with different documents, ensuring that each outlet would feel it had newsworthy material.","The New York Times reported that Broidy offered access to Trump as part of an effort to get foreign leaders to sign contracts with his defense firm Circinus. The Times also detailed how George Nader, a political adviser to the UAE who is reportedly now cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller, cultivated Broidy to gain influence with the Trump administration.","The Associated Press reported that Nader wired Broidy millions of dollars to fund an effort to convince U.S. lawmakers to pass legislation that would label Qatar as a state sponsor of terrorism.","Broidy’s team has confirmed the authenticity of several of the leaked emails — but it also accused the Qatari government and Muzin of sending around doctored or forged documents that appeared to show Broidy was involved with a sanctioned Russian bank.","Unlike Russia, Qatar is not known for its cyberattacks. But there are signs that the small, wealthy Gulf state is building up its capabilities. In 2015, an intermediary with ties to Qatar gave the Times internal emails from the UAE’s foreign ministry in which an Emirati official admitted the UAE was violating a United Nations resolution by sending weapons to Libyan militias.","Last year, a group that called itself GlobalLeaks sent reporters damaging emails stolen from Yousef al-Otaiba, the UAE’s ambassador to the U.S. Independent cybersecurity researchers identified a hacker-for-hire group working for several Gulf states that used tactics that resembled those used against Otaiba.","Read the complaint below:","Paul Blumenthal contributed reporting.

He wound up setting a mainstream television precedent.","LGBTQ people have, of course, taken center stage on “Empire,” “How to Get Away with Murder” and even “Andi Mack” as of late. But Feldman felt a queer protagonist with intersectional identities like himself ― someone who would embrace both his sexuality and hearing loss ― was missing from the TV landscape.","“It’s so easy for characters to be just one thing. In real life, people are many things at the same time,” the Los Angeles-based actor and writer told HuffPost. “I never saw myself on TV or in movies, so I never thought I could write about myself. I never wrote about deaf people because I didn’t think people would be receptive or interested.”","Feldman’s reluctance has been proved wrong with “This Close,” the six-episode dramedy he created with pal Shoshannah Stern. The new series, which is available in its entirety on the Sundance Now streaming platform, follows the adventures of two 20-something urbanites, Michael (Feldman) and Kate (Stern), as they navigate life and love in Los Angeles. (Check out the series trailer above.)","Like HBO’s “Girls” and “Looking,” “This Close” boasts a subdued, slice-of-life feel. Each half-hour episode is at once funny, sexy and heartbreaking. The show’s binge-worthiness, however, makes it easy to overlook the fact that it’s the first series written, created by and starring deaf artists for a mainstream audience.","Kate and Michael communicate with each other using sign language, though both are in varying stages of romantic involvement with hearing partners who provide much of the show’s spoken dialogue. As is the case for many straight women and gay men, the pair’s bond is intense and, at times, codependent.","But “Will & Grace” this is not: Michael, a novelist, seeks to escape the deterioration of his engagement to Ryan (Colt Prattes) and a case of writer’s block through drugs, alcohol and casual sex, while Kate feels less than fulfilled in both her public relations career and her relationship with her fiancé, Danny (Zach Gilford).","“This Close,” which debuted on Valentine’s Day, began its life in 2015 as a comic web series called “Fridays,” in which Feldman and Stern played less-developed versions of Michael and Kate. A second, five-episode version of the show called “The Chances” premiered at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival.","To re-adapt “The Chances” as “This Close” for Sundance Now, the pair tapped director Andrew Ahn. No stranger to intersectional storytelling, Ahn drew on his own experiences as a queer Asian-American for 2016’s “Spa Night.” Still, he was surprised to feel “an intense sense of community” on the “This Close” set.","“Whether we’re deaf or hearing, gay or straight, man or woman or somewhere in between, we are connected,” he told HuffPost last month.","While many viewers see Feldman as playing himself on the series, the Maryland native said he and Michael have “zero percent” in common aside from being deaf and gay. In fact, he had no intention of stepping in front of the camera when he began writing the show. Stern, he said, convinced him otherwise, and he’s grateful for her intervention.","As proud as Feldman is to have “full ownership” of Michael as a character, shooting “This Close” was “very difficult,” he said. The show’s third episode, for instance, required him to strip nude for a sex scene involving three other actors.","“I didn’t want people to see Michael as a role model,” he explained. “It took me a few months to recover and find my happy place again, because my character went through so much shit. Michael is a hot mess ― definitely not me! He’s a very dark person, and I’m much lighter than that.”","“This Close” may not have generated the buzz of a primetime series, but has received ample critical acclaim. For Feldman, such praise is encouraging as he and Stern wait to find out if “This Close” will be renewed for a second season; they have their characters’ respective trajectories sketched out over five seasons in total.","“We know exactly how everything is going to end,” he said. As for Michael, he added that the character “is still a child on the inside, and we want to see him go from a boy to a man. He has to take responsibility for his own life.”","Character development aside, Feldman said the deaf community’s reaction is paramount ― and, fortunately, feedback from those viewers has been “fantastic” thus far. Ultimately, he’ll be happy if “This Close” inspires Hollywood to tackle additional projects involving deaf creators, actors and storylines. As for him and Stern, the pair has hopes of one day producing a period drama featuring deaf characters.","“There are so many other types of deaf stories that we’re hoping to add to the mix,” he said. “We want to do right by the deaf community.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab080101e0000fb077af289.jpeg?cache=nT4PYCBcWi&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"WOMEN","headline":"Aly Raisman Is Not OK With Banning Gymnastics Leotards To Prevent Abuse","authors":"Alanna Vagianos","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/aly-raisman-is-not-ok-with-banning-gymnastics-leotards-to-prevent-abuse_us_5ab902dee4b008c9e5f98b62","short_description":"The Olympic gymnast called out victim shaming in a series of tweets.","date":"2018-03-26"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"BLACK VOICES","headline":"MLK's Granddaughter Shares Her Dream Of A 'Gun-Free World' At March For Our Lives","authors":"Taryn Finley","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mlks-granddaughter-shares-her-dream-of-a-gun-free-world-at-march-for-our-lives_us_5ab901e1e4b008c9e5f989cc","short_description":"Nine-year-old Yolanda Renee King says \"enough is enough.\"","date":"2018-03-26"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Trump Expels 60 Russians, Closes Russian Consulate In Seattle After UK Chemical Attack","authors":"","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-expels-60-russians-after-uk-chemical-attack_us_5ab8efbfe4b054d118e4f35c","short_description":"The order reflects concerns that Russian intelligence activities have been increasingly aggressive.","date":"2018-03-26"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"BLACK VOICES","headline":"Tiffany Haddish Says An Anonymous Actress Bit Beyoncé In The Face","authors":"Elyse Wanshel","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tiffany-haddish-says-an-anonymous-actress-bit-beyonc%C3%A9-in-the-face_us_5ab8fc3ae4b008c9e5f98084","short_description":"Haddish spills more tea about what led up to her infamous selfie with Queen B.","date":"2018-03-26"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"WOMEN","headline":"The French Government Is Proposing A Bill To Protect Women.

Finally, there would be tougher sanctions against online group harassment (this means that any person who takes part in harassing someone online, even if they just sent a few tweets, will be considered responsible).","Though the Harvey Weinstein scandal, France’s #BalanceTonPorc movement, and the worldwide Me Too movement have clearly put more attention on sexual assault worldwide, behind each of these pieces of legislation exists a person or a story that began debates in France long before these issues became daily top news stories.","Street Harassment","Sofie Peeters","In 2012, a Belgian woman named Sofie Peeters released a documentary called “Woman of the Street.” Using a hidden camera, she recorded and denounced sexist remarks and behaviors that she heard from men while simply walking down the street.","Insults such as “bitch” and “slut” rained down on her, as well as indecent behavior and propositions. The young woman, then a student, said she was surprised that she experienced this kind of harassment “5 to 10 times a day.”","As the French website Madmoizelle noted, the video’s widespread impact caused politicians around Europe to react. The city of Brussels, for example, decided shortly thereafter that this type of sexual harassment would be punishable by law. Last Wednesday, the French government joined Brussels by proposing the establishment of a fine for street harassment and sexist insults.","Statute Of Limitations","Flavie Flament","In October 2016, French television and radio presenter Flavie Flament revealed in her book The Consolation that she had been raped by a well-known photographer (though she didn’t reveal his name in the book) almost 30 years before.","She explained to the JDD, a French weekly newspaper, that she withheld her aggressor’s identity because of the “justice of the limitation concerning this type of crime.”","“Today this man is legally out of reach, yet that does not make him innocent. I cannot pursue my tormentor and I will live with this for the rest of my days,” she said.","Now her focus is on fighting to extend the limitation period for crimes committed against minors. In France, the period is 20 years if the victim is an adult, and if the victim is a minor at the time of the incident, it is up to 20 years after the victim turns 18. Minors thus have until age 38 to file a case. This is not enough time for some victims, who may suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or go years without realizing a crime they have suffered.","“A victim of rape sometimes ‘wakes up’ many years after. For these people, coming out about what happened can take a long time. They may decide to pursue legal action after seeing a psychologist, which can be a long reconstructive effort,” explained Laure Ignace, a lawyer from the European Association Against Violence Directed at Women in the Workplace (AVWW), to the French paper Le Monde.","Flament was given the task to work on extending the statute of limitations by Laurence Rossignol, the French minister of families, children and women’s rights. She will also create a documentary, “Rape Against Minors,” to highlight the subject.","Since then, nearly 30,000 people have signed a petition to extend the limitation period. In November 2017, Emmanuel Macron reiterated in his anti-violence against women proposal that the government should extend the period to 30 years for minors.","The Age Of Sexual Consent","The trial on the rape of an 11-year-old girl","Concerning the age of consent for minors, the story that has created debates is rather recent, even if the subject itself is not. The acquittal of a man tried for the rape of an 11-year-old girl caused outrage in France in November 2017.","Twenty years old at the time of the trial, the girl accused the man of rape, but the defendant stated it was consensual. He also asserted that she lied about her age, which she disputed.","A similar affair sparked controversy in France two months earlier. A 28-year-old man was put on trial for “sexual abuse” and not “rape” after having sex with an 11-year-old. In France, punishment for the former is much lighter.","These two cases, particularly the one in November, raised numerous voices in favor of establishing an age of sexual consent, to distinguish the difference between children (those deemed unable to consent) and sexually consenting adults.","Emannuel Macron asked for the age to be set to 15 during a speech on Nov. 27, 2017, shortly after the UN’s International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women.","Marlène Schiappa, the Secretary of State for Equality between women and men has announced that, under a certain age, a minor should no longer be considered a consenting sexual adult. “Below a certain age, it should be considered that there can be no debate, ever, on the sexual consent of a child, and that for any child below a certain age, it would be automatically considered rape or sexual assault,” explains Schiappa, adding that this legal age could be somewhere “between 13 and 15.”","Cyberbullying","Marion Seclin","Following a video on harassment published on Madmoizelle in May 2016, actress and YouTube personality Marion Seclin received a wave of insults and hate comments online. More than 40,000, according to Seclin.","What was the reason for this surge of hate? The actress explained that the street was not a place to flirt. “It angered me that a large number of internet users decided not to debate with me, but come at me with insults. (...) I have received nearly 40,000 death and rape threats, people asking me to commit suicide, or threatening to kill my family, or other insults,” she later recounted.","This case of online harassment brought to light the impunity available to harassers, as Seclin found herself destitute and with little possible recourse.","In December 2017, she told her story at a TEDx conference and explained why she was “the French champion of cyberbullying.” “Everything that happens online is happening in real life,” she said.","“It’s not me against 40,000 people, it’s me against one person and one person and one person ... I do not have the time, nor the energy, nor the means to file a suit against 40,000 pseudonyms. Have you ever tried to file a case against someone? Do you know the administrative steps to file a case against someone in France? It is very long. So imagine 40,000 people,” she said during the talk, referring to the difficulty in pursuing legal action in France against cyberbullying.","In February, a report from France’s High Council of Equality between Women and Men (HCE) was submitted to the government with recommendations for ensuring cyberbullying would not go unpunished.","In the bill, presented last Wednesday, a sanction appears that is related to the phenomenon of “mob mentality,” or when several people harass the same person together.","The bill will still need to be voted on by French Parliament before it passes, but members of the French government are clearly trying to make major strides when it comes to protecting girls and women.","This story was originally published by HuffPost France."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab941351f0000260616b82c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Federal Trade Commission Begins Investigating Facebook","authors":"Ryan Grenoble","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/facebook-ftc-investigation-privacy-practices_us_5ab90b20e4b0decad04c493b","short_description":"The probe was sparked by revelations that Cambridge Analytica misused Facebook user data.","date":"2018-03-26"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"QUEER VOICES","headline":"March For Our Lives And Gay Activism: 'They're Definitely Linked For Me,' Says Emma González","authors":"Beth Greenfield, Yahoo Lifestyle","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/march-for-our-lives-and-gay-activism-theyre-definitely-linked-for-me-says-emma-gonz%C3%A1lez_us_5ab90407e4b008c9e5f98e10","short_description":"To longtime activist Evan Wolfson, whose Freedom to Marry campaign won the fight for national marriage equality in 2015 after","date":"2018-03-26"},"articleContent":["As thousands of protesters funneled along Pennsylvania Ave. in Washington, D.C., for the March for Our Lives on Saturday, carrying signs and children and the weight of fear and grief over gun violence, there was another, small revolution taking place at the edge of the march route, in tiny Pershing Park. That’s where about 100 activists from the New York City–based group Gays Against Guns (GAG) had set up camp for the day, transforming the bleak concrete corner with a huge rainbow banner and pink Mylar strips that billowed in the breeze.","Also part of the staging was some much-needed levity: a pink-carpeted runway, with folks in drag encouraging passersby to show the NRA, in RuPaul parlance, how to “sashay away.” Later, a large group struck a more somber tone by wearing all white, having their faces covered with veils, each carrying the photo, name, and short bio of a person who had been lost to gun violence. The silent procession of “human beings” stopped marchgoers in their tracks.","Surrounding the activists throughout the day were colorfully spray-painted signs, declaring “Not in my school,” “Stop trans murder,” “NRA be gone, before we drop the House on you” (a pitch-perfect “Wizard of Oz” reference), and the pièce de résistance: “Skinhead lesbian.”","It was, of course, the reclamation of an insult hurled by a Maine legislative candidate toward a magnetic leader of this movement: Emma González, the buzzed-headed student who emerged onto the national stage just three days after the deadly Feb. 14 shooting at her Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.","That’s when González’s riveting 11-minute “we call BS” speech went viral, energizing a segment of the nation that had had enough of gun violence and catapulting a crew of similarly smart, tenacious Parkland students into an instant media spotlight.","People soon tweeted that González should run for president. The 18-year-old noted that she already is president — of her school’s Gay-Straight Alliance (GSA). She then told the Washington Post that she identifies as bisexual, and suddenly her fierce badassery just made that much more sense for a whole lot of people, particularly fellow LGBTQ folks and queer activists for whom self-identity and a willingness to stand up for justice have long been inextricably linked.“","We have always been on the defensive as a community. So it’s a natural fit. We have been fighting for our rights for decades, likely eons,” Cathy Marino-Thomas, a GAG organizer and longtime activist in the fight for marriage equality, tells Yahoo Lifestyle, referring to battles over AIDS funding, marriage equality, the right to adopt, the right not to be fired from work and to serve in the military, and a range of other hard-won civil rights. “I think that we are a community less afraid to stand up because, in many ways, we have less to lose and everything to gain. Historically, no one has ever stood up for the gays. We’ve had to stand up for ourselves, often against extraordinary opposition.”","Of course, no one would deem this current antigun movement a singly gay issue — not even GAG, for whom the two narratives are tightly entwined. But there are deep and undeniable connections, made both collectively — such as by the Human Rights Campaign (HRC), the largest national LGBTQ-rights organization, which had a massive presence at the D.C. march led in party by Queer Eye co-host Karamo Brown, himself a graduate of Parkland’s Marjory Douglas Stoneman High School — and also made individually.","That goes for González, who tells Yahoo Lifestyle in the days leading up to Saturday’s march that she indeed sees a connection between her sexuality and her drive to lead the movement. “They’re definitely linked for me personally. If I wasn’t so open about who I was, I never would’ve been able to do this,” she says. “In ninth grade, I was in a creative writing class where I could actually really effectively communicate what I was feeling, and it especially helped me come to terms with who I was. That definitely was when I really understood who I am, and when I came to terms with it, and when I told most people.”","Being open, González says, “helped me understand that everybody, no matter who they are and what they look like, is going through a lot of different things.” And being her school’s GSA president for three years has fostered her activist skills.","“It’s really helped me get used to shifting plans very quickly, planning in advance, and also being flexible … understanding that maybe you organize a club meeting with this one person in mind and they just don’t come because they aren’t coming to school, and you can’t get upset,” she says. “Because most of the kids in GSA either have depression or they’re dealing with a lot of stuff at home, and I can understand that. And there are so many people in the country who are dealing with that, in relation to gun violence. You have no idea. You don’t know how many people you talk to on a daily basis that have actually been shot before, or have lost someone through gun violence. With GSA it’s the same. Everything’s incredibly far-reaching and widespread.”","González recalls meeting Gays Against Guns representatives who had come to Parkland to show their support on the day her high school reopened after the shooting. “Yaass!” she says at the mention of the group, noting that she’d felt lucky for the haul of signs, fliers, buttons, and a parasol they gave her that day. But she reaches back further through gay history when she names her latest inspiration: transgender activist Sylvia Rivera, a veteran of the 1969 Stonewall uprising, widely known as the start of the gay-rights movement.","“There’s this clip of her getting up onstage at one of the Stonewall Pride rallies, a couple years [after the uprising], and … everybody boos her because she’s trans. But she’s like, ‘Are you kidding me? You’re gay. I’m trans. We’re part of this. Like, I got you here. How many times have I had to fight for you? And you’re booing me because I’m trans?’” the teen says. “First of all, it was so unfair, unjustified, undignified, like, I was so infuriated by seeing that. But then there’s just knowing that there will always be people that hate you, and that they’re always going to be wrong. So it’s good to use that, and remember that whatever you’re doing, if it’s making people that mad, then it’s probably a good thing.”","***","González, of course, is far from the only power behind the youth-led antigun movement and March for Our Lives; in the week leading up to the marches, she and the rest of the Parkland crew did a whirlwind media tour, landing, among other places, on the cover of Time, in the studio of “The Rachel Maddow Show,” and in a Teen Vogue series that included a story in its sister LGBTQ publication, Them, which announced in its headline, “Queer Teenage Girls are Leading the Gun Control Movement.”","Though it may have been a slight exaggeration (only González and classmate Sarah Chadwick have identified themselves as being part of the LGBTQ family), there is certainly a shared ethos within the youth-led resistance that makes it ring true. And as nonqueer Parkland student Jaclyn Corin noted in that story, “As things get more acceptable in society, like legalizing gay marriage and stuff like that, it shows us that a change from the beginning that seemed so far away can actually happen in the same lifetime. So that gives us hope. We’re kind of modeling this like the LGBT movement because, in retrospect, it’s the same. We’re working towards a common goal as a lot of people and it’s not party-oriented. That’s marriage, and this is lives.”","To longtime activist Evan Wolfson, whose Freedom to Marry campaign won the fight for national marriage equality in 2015 after a decades-long effort, that’s an apt parallel.","“It’s all taken from the Freedom to Marry playbook, where despite people saying that gay people can’t marry — the courts saying that, the culture saying that, even gay people saying that to ourselves — we didn’t take no for an answer, and by not taking no for an answer we turned the answer into yes,” Wolfson tells Yahoo Lifestyle the day before the March for Our Lives, which he had planned to join in New York City. “It’s what’s so inspiring about these young people and what they’re doing. … They believe they can create change and are inspiring millions more with that belief.”","Wolfson now travels around the world to consult with activists on issues from antiviolence and immigration reform to environmental protection and animal rights. He notes that, when it comes to activists finding the fire in their bellies, “You can’t reduce something to just one identity, whether it be black or white or gay or non-gay or Jewish or Christian. Minorities have had an experience of exclusion, oppression, having to form solidarity and work for change … but we all have our something, and we have to draw on that something to make the world better.”","For Gays Against Guns, that something is twofold: queerness and, relatedly, being on the defensive when it comes to violence. As the group states on its website and in literature it passes out at protests, the LGBT community is disproportionately affected by gun violence: first, because most gun deaths in the U.S. are suicides and LGBTQ people are overrepresented among suicide victims (92 percent of transgender adults have attempted suicide by age 25); second, because LGBTQ people are the most likely minority to be the victim of a hate crime.","That really hit home with everyone on June 12, 2016, when the Pulse gay nightclub massacre in Orlando left 49 people dead in what was the most lethal mass shooting ever in America (though it was later surpassed by that of Las Vegas).","Gays Against Guns formed in response to that tragedy, with individuals from a newly outraged generation joining seasoned activists, some of whom were ACT UP organizers in the early days of the AIDS crisis, and who brought to the group their attention-grabbing direct-action skills — “die-ins,” chillingly clever chants, and sit-in-the-streets civil disobedience moves that often came with the goal of getting arrested. A week after its formation, GAG had a huge and heart-stopping presence in the New York City Pride March, with a contingent more than 750 strong chanting “Stop the NRA!” and staging die-ins all along Fifth Avenue; since then it has held direct-action protests and had a continued education-based presence at gun shows around the country.","“I think an intrinsic part of queerness is to have a certain feeling of being outside, and when you harness that, it’s very powerful,” says Kevin Hertzog, a founding member of GAG and someone who lived through the early AIDS crisis, losing many friends in the process. “When you’re dying, you’ll do anything,” he says on Saturday in D.C., referring to the basic connection between the early days of AIDS activism and the urgency behind today’s antigun movement. “It became apparent that no one was going to help us, so we had to help ourselves.”","As for González’s being queer, “It’s not incidental,” he says. “Some people are astonished that these kids were able to start this movement. But when you place it in a queer context? I’m not astonished at all.”","GAG co-founder Hal Moskowitz, who was a co-founder of the early AIDS organization Gay Men’s Health Crisis (GMHC), says, “I see some of me in [the Parkland activists]. I see that drive that says, ’F*** you, you’re going to listen to me, and I’m going to say it until you do.” Student David Hogg, who continuously acknowledges his place of privilege and speaks about the “children and people of color whose voices are not being heard,” has been particularly impressive, he adds.","Indeed, with Parkland, a largely white, affluent community known for its safety, the teens leading this cause have been particularly mindful of doing everything in their power to shift the narrative, from interview talking points to including students of color and from poorer communities in various ways. Nadine Smith, executive director of Equality Florida, a gay rights group, took note of that effort recently.","“I applaud the students for using the enormous platform they have to call out how racism and homophobia impact the response to gun violence. They see clearly the enormous difference in how Tallahassee responded to Parkland compared to Pulse,” Smith noted in a statement. “Legislators who had to be shamed into permitting a moment of silence for the 49 killed in Orlando quickly allocated funds for a memorial and passed legislation, flawed and incomplete though it is. When the GSA students, including Emma, spoke at our Gala in Miami, she made sure to lift up Pulse. [And] the students have gone to Chicago to meet with other students who have been organizing against gun violence for years to combine efforts.”","Brandon Wolf, who led the HRC contingent along with Queer Eye’s Brown in D.C. on Saturday, was at Pulse when the shots rang out; his friends Drew Leinonen and Juan Guerrero were killed. The experience, he says, turned him into an activist overnight. “I think the reason there’s this natural marriage of the LGBTQ community and a fight against this epidemic of gun violence is because there’s a very real fear from a young age as a gay person and specifically gay people of color that you will be targeted, harmed, or even worse because of who you are,” Wolfe, 29, tells Yahoo Lifestyle. “So there’s this natural sense of, we’ve got to protect ourselves and each other from that violence, and I think gay people know better than anyone else what it feels like to live in fear all the time.”","He adds, “I think as a young person, I went through so much, dealing with family and community and the process of coming out and all of that. And I think that makes you an advocate, because you’ve been fighting for your own health and well-being since you were young.”","Now, as a whole new generation of young people grow up having to fight for their health and well-being in regard to gun violence, they are finding their own ways to make their voices heard and their demands met — with techniques both learned and instinctual.","“I think one thing we can learn from older generations of activists, which I’ve shared with the Parkland students, is the power of patience,” Wolf says. “We can let the older generation be a testament to the fact that hard work means we may not get it the first time around, but eventually we’ll get it — so to not get discouraged that the Florida legislature doesn’t care today, because the real change will be made when we vote them out for people who will make a change.”","On the other side, says González, is what her generation might teach the older ones (in addition to the power of social media, of course).","“One of the main things to be learned is that a lot of people kind of get pushed into an agenda, like Republican or Democrat. But the best way to get things done is to appeal to both sides, and listen, which is what we’ve been doing,” she says. “And this is not to knock anyone else, but what we’ve been really focused on is inclusion, and trying to really combine these communities spread around the United States. We’ve been trying to get everyone on the same page, to figure out what everybody’s asking for, and see if we can, as a giant movement, ask for that together.”","Read more from Yahoo Lifestyle:","The best photos from March for Our Lives around the world\nEmma González’s March for Our Lives speech lasted as long as the Parkland Shooting\nTrump administration removes pages on LGBTQ women’s health from government website","This post was originally published on Yahoo Lifestyle."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab905031f00002d0016b78f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Anna Faris Is 'Not Quite Sure' She'd Remarry After Chris Pratt Split","authors":"Carly Ledbetter","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/anna-faris-marriage-chris-pratt_us_5ab91724e4b0decad04c7e0b","short_description":"\"I need to figure out what the purpose [of marriage] is,\" the actress said.","date":"2018-03-26"},"articleContent":["Anna Faris has been married twice, and it doesn’t sound like the actress is eager to tie the knot again anytime soon.","“I need to figure out what the purpose [of marriage] is,” she said during an episode of Dax Shepard’s podcast, “Armchair Expert,” which was released Monday. “Is it safety for your children?

Exposure to vinyl chloride is linked to a rare form of liver cancer, brain and lung cancers, lymphoma and leukemia, according to the National Cancer Institute.","Ford said it didn’t discover the contamination until 2014, when the company began renovating the plant. Last August, more than 100 homeowners in Alden Village, the town east of the Livonia plant, sued the company over the spill. Shawn Collins, the attorney representing the homeowners, faults McIntosh for the company’s failure to discover the contamination sooner and said he plans to “demand” McIntosh’s deposition in the case.","“You can’t ignore these kinds of toxic chemicals in such an enormous quantity on your property, so whoever was in charge of the environmental state of affairs at this plant did not do his job,” Collins told HuffPost on Monday. “That’s McIntosh.”","The EPA declined to comment. Ford said the spill posed no risk to the municipal drinking water. The company added that cleanup efforts began soon after it discovered the contamination and it has “worked quickly and cooperatively with the state and community to keep everyone fully informed of our progress.”","“We remain fully committed to protecting the environment,” John Cangany, a Ford spokesman, told HuffPost.","Collins said his team is combing through more than 500,000 documents that Ford turned over. He said he expects to go to trial within a year.","McIntosh, a chemical engineer and lawyer, spent the first 13 years of his career as an environmental permit compliance inspector in Michigan, according to his public LinkedIn page. In 1991, he joined Republican Gov. John Engler’s administration, serving as an environmental adviser and deputy director of Michigan’s Department of Environmental Quality.","During McIntosh’s seven-year tenure at the agency, the Engler administration spearheaded a historic effort to slash environmental regulations. Engler abolished 19 citizen commissions and oversight boards and split the state agency in two, separating the Department of Natural Resources from the Department of Environmental Quality and reducing the budgets for both.","“It’s not good news for anybody who gives a damn about the environment in this country that McIntosh is going there,” Collins said. “He’s a polluter’s friend, or Trump would never have picked him.”","A 1998 survey by the advocacy group Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility found staffers at the Department of Environmental Quality deeply dissatisfied and demoralized. Fifty-nine percent strongly disagreed when asked if they trusted top management at the agency to protect Michigan’s natural resources and public health. Thirty-eight percent strongly agreed that companies regulated by the agency “excessively” influenced permitting decisions, and 63 percent strongly agreed that agency management viewed individuals and businesses seeking permits as the “primary customer,” as opposed to “the natural resources and the general public.”","“[McIntosh] gleefully participated in undoing many of Michigan’s environmental protections as part of the Engler administration,” Dave Dempsey, a Michigan environmental policy expert at the Great Lakes advocacy group Flow, told HuffPost.","In 1997, Macomb County inspectors found that a developer had violated the state’s 1979 Wetland Protection Act by building new homes on a protected eight-acre wetland. McIntosh gave the developer “an out by touring the site and then overruling his district inspectors” and issuing his own finding that said “what the developer did was perfectly appropriate because it was exempt from the state wetland protection law,” according to a February 2000 report published in the Detroit Free Press. The incident left county officials “wondering why the second in command at the state environmental agency inserted himself into a wetland permit dispute to approve activities they argue were plainly illegal,” the report said.","The Engler administration’s deregulatory onslaught even alienated former supporters. Tom Washington, the late director of the Michigan United Conservation Clubs, voted for Engler in 1990 and 1994. But in a December 2002 cover story, the Lansing City Paper, an alt-weekly, quoted Washington angrily declaring that “the spirit of stewardship ... is gone, replaced by the vision of a man who seems to value only numbers on a ledger.”","“We’ve entered an era when protection of the environment is measured by how many permits you can issue and how fast,” Washington said.","That may help explain McIntosh’s EPA nomination. In January, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt told The Wall Street Journal that his second year would focus on accelerating efforts to remake the federal agency and speeding up the permitting process. Pruitt, who has deep ties to industry and rejects the science behind climate change, has aggressively rolled back environmental regulations during his first year in office, attracting fierce criticism from former EPA chiefs, including Republicans, and potentially setting the agency back decades.","On Friday, Pruitt cited McIntosh’s “unique background” in making him “a valuable asset and well-suited” to lead the EPA office charged with coordinating the permitting process among federal agencies, Native American tribes and regulators in other countries.","“Chad will bring a wealth of experience and expertise to EPA,” Pruitt said in a statement.","Coincidentally, Bloomberg reported Friday that Pruitt plans to agree to Ford’s request to reverse an Obama-era decision to raise fuel efficiency standards for 2022 to 2025 vehicles.","“Governor Engler and William McIntosh’s Department of Environmental Quality spent their entire time in power trying to undermine environmental protection and enforcement,” Anne Woiwode, chair of the Sierra Club’s Michigan chapter, told HuffPost. “His joining EPA after working for the company leading the charge to undermine our clean car standards is nothing less than a direct threat to the future of America’s public health and clean air and water.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab937991e00008e0b7afcb3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Serena Williams Gets Personal In New HBO Documentary Series","authors":"Lauren Moraski","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/serena-williams-hbo-documentary-series_us_5ab56841e4b054d118e2c8ae","short_description":"“I put so much pressure on myself.

She has pleaded not guilty.","In a motion filed late Sunday night, Salman’s lawyers say the government failed to disclose that Seddique Mateen, the father of shooter Omar Mateen, was an FBI informant from 2005 until June 2016, when the Pulse nightclub attack occurred.","When Seddique Mateen’s house was searched on the day of the massacre, law enforcement officials found receipts showing he recently transferred money to Turkey and Afghanistan. As a result, a criminal investigation was opened.","The government also disclosed that in 2012 they got an anonymous tip that Seddique Mateen was seeking to raise up to $100,000 via a donation drive to contribute toward an attack against the government of Pakistan.","On Monday, FBI Special Agent Juvenal Martin testified that he oversaw Seddique Mateen when he was an informant. In 2013, he was asked to interview Seddique Mateen’s son, Omar, after the latter allegedly made suspicious statements to co-workers about terrorist organizations.","He visited Omar Mateen’s home three times to interview him, Martin said. On the first occasion, Seddique Mateen arrived unannounced in the middle of their conversation.","On the third visit, Noor Salman served him homemade cake. “It was very good, by the way,” he said.","The FBI closed the counterterrorism investigation into Omar Mateen in March 2014 after concluding that he was not a threat. Martin added that at the time, he considered developing Omar Mateen as an informant, like his father.","Two years later, Omar Mateen stalked into Pulse nightclub in Orlando with an AR-15 style rifle and killed 49 people.","U.S. District Judge Paul Byron denied the request to dismiss the case at the end of the day.","“This trial is not about Seddique Mateen, it’s about Noor Salman,” he said.","The government’s decision to withhold pertinent information “placed Ms. Salman, the jury, and this Court in a dark wood where the search for truth has been thwarted,” her attorneys wrote, referencing Dante’s “Inferno.” “It is apparent from the Government’s belated disclosure that Ms. Salman has been defending a case without a complete set of facts and evidence that the Government was required to disclose.”","Her attorneys said if they knew about this information, they would have investigated whether Seddique Mateen was involved in or knew about his son’s plans to commit a terror attack.","As part of their case against Salman, prosecutors allege that she texted her husband a “cover story” to tell his parents that night to conceal his plans. It was Ramadan, and the couple had been invited to a dinner at the mosque.","“If ur mom calls say nimo invited you out and noor wants to stay home,” Salman wrote at 5:55 p.m on the evening of the shooting.","Her lawyers, who have characterized this text as Salman simply asking her husband to communicate their plans with his mother, said this new disclosure raises questions about whether a cover story was even necessary.","“If the evidence shows that Seddique had some level of foreknowledge — based on his financial transaction or an affinity for ISIS — such a story would have been completely unnecessary, and Salman’s texting would indicate that she was the dupe and not the provocateur claimed by the Government,” her lawyers wrote.","Salman believed her husband was out with his friend “Nemo” on the night of the shooting, as that’s what he told her, Salman’s lawyers said.","Jurors finally heard from “Nemo” on Monday. He testified that Omar Mateen would often use him as an excuse when he wanted to cheat on his wife.","David Weinstein, a former assistant U.S. Attorney in Florida, said that the defense’s motion to dismiss stands a realistic likelihood of being granted.","“By affirmatively withholding information that Mateen’s father was an active informant for the FBI up until the date of the Pulse Club shooting, the government has compromised the defense’s ability to present their case and cross examine witnesses,” he said. “This has risen to the level of a material violation of Salman’s constitutional right to a fair trial, which could result in not only a mistrial, but an outright dismissal.”","Salman is the only one charged in the crime. Her husband died in a shootout with police at the nightclub after pledging allegiance to ISIS .\n\nSalman’s lawyers have said she was in the dark about his plans, and was a victim of abuse at his hands.\n\n“She was not his partner, she was not his peer, and she certainly was not his confidant,” Salman’s attorney, Linda Moreno, said during opening statements.","This story has been updated to include more details about the case, information from the ongoing trial and comment from Weinstein.

Piper’s definition of traditional gender roles involves women submitting to male leadership, and men accepting their God-given responsibility to protect these “weaker vessels.” This conservative Christian approach to gender relations is known as complementarianism.","In a recent podcast, Piper argued that society’s departure from these traditional roles over the past 50 years has laid the groundwork for sexual abuse.","“Egalitarian assumptions in our culture, and to a huge degree in the church, have muted — silenced, nullified — one of the means that God has designed for the protection and the flourishing of women,” Piper said, according a podcast transcript published on his website March 16.","Complementarianism is not uncommon in conservative Christian circles. And Piper is not an outlier in American evangelicalism. In fact, he’s scheduled to speak alongside some of the country’s top evangelical leaders at a conference for pastors in Louisville, Kentucky, next month.","At the same time, Piper’s claims have elicited strong criticism from some fellow Christians. Advocates for survivors of sexual abuse and their allies don’t believe Piper’s suggestion will bring about positive change. Indeed, they’re worried this traditional way of thinking about women’s roles is part of the problem.","These advocates say Piper needs to do more to acknowledge the ways complementarian theology has been abused, especially in evangelical settings.","Christa Brown, a clergy sex abuse survivor who blogs about abuse cover-ups in church settings, told HuffPost that Piper is endorsing a gender dynamic that can easily lead to exploitation and mistreatment. Many of the survivors she’s worked with have told her they were “groomed” for abuse by a patriarchal theology that taught them to be submissive and obedient toward men.","“Because complementarian theology promotes a power differential between men and women, it fosters the sort of abuse of power that devolves into sexual abuse,” Brown said.","Piper’s remarks were from an episode of his “Ask Pastor John” podcast, in which he fielded a question about the sexual abuse allegations that have emerged against several high-profile men as a result of the Me Too movement.","Asked to share his thoughts on these abuse allegations, Piper responded by bringing up an age-old debate in Christian theology between two perspectives on gender relations ― complementarianism and egalitarianism.","In the complementarian view, men and women are equally treasured by God, but have distinct, divinely ordained roles. As spiritual heads of the household, men have final authority over women in both spiritual and practical matters. They are expected to exercise this authority in a self-sacrificial way ― the way Christians believe Jesus gave his life for the church. Women, meanwhile, are expected to submit to their husbands at home, at church and, sometimes, in society.","According to egalitarianism, however, neither men nor women are automatically granted headship. They are seen as spiritual equals in the eyes of God, and divide responsibilities based on their capabilities, rather than by gender.","In his podcast, Piper claimed that egalitarianism is responsible for a breakdown of the structures that previously kept women safe. As more people embrace the idea that men and women are equal, he said, men have stopped feeling the need to “protect and honor” women.","Piper argued that modern ideas of gender equality are actually partly to blame for the alleged abusive behavior of people like film producer Harvey Weinstein, comedian Louis C.K. and former Senate candidate Roy Moore.","“It’s a firm conviction of most of our egalitarian culture that men as men do not owe women a special kind of care and protection and honor that women do not owe men. I believe they do,” Piper said in the podcast. “I believe 50 years of denying it is one of the seeds bearing very bad fruit, including all those sexual abuses... talked about in [the listener’s] question. There are other seeds in our culture, but this is one of the seeds.”","Advocates for victims of abuse point out that theology emphasizing the authority of men has existed for centuries ― but it’s only since the advent of feminism and the emergence of Christian egalitarianism that Western society has progressed to a point where the abuse of women is understood to be unacceptable.","“Piper references the last 50 years as the age of egalitarianism, and posits that it is the reason we are seeing sexual abuse happen,” Hannah Paasch, an ex-Christian blogger, told HuffPost in an email. “I would counter-point that sexual abuse has been happening for thousands of years, and the past 50 years of imagining alternate frameworks for gender and gender roles is in fact what has brought a centuries-old problem to light.”","Paasch is one of the founders of #ChurchToo, a hashtag inspired by the Me Too movement that focuses on abuse in church settings. Paasch said she grew up immersed in evangelical culture, listening to Piper’s sermons. She said that besides erasing the existence of trans and nonbinary people, complementariansim fails to take women’s agency into account. It encourages men to decide what’s best for women in a paternalistic manner.","Ultimately, she believes, this theology “feeds the rape culture that we see permeating American Christianity today.”","“Perhaps in a perfect world men could protect women in a gentle and selfless manner, but that’s just simply not what we see,” Paasch wrote. “When you hand one person a position of power over someone else ― a position that they did not earn based on competency or merit but simply because of some attribute or descriptor they were assigned at birth ― that power will inevitably be used for the person in power’s benefit.”","Piper has been criticized in the past for appearing to encourage evangelical women to “endure” abusive relationships for a season. He later clarified that he believes abusive husbands are “breaking God’s law” and should be reported to civil authorities.","Piper did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this story.","Ashley Easter is an advocate for victims of sexual abuse in church settings and the founder of the Courage Conference, an annual conference that brings survivors and advocates together. Easter told HuffPost that abuse is “always rooted in a lust for power, domination, and control.”","She said she’s never worked with a victim of abuse who did not experience some type of power asymmetry in the relationship.","“The best way to defuse abuse is to instate an ethic of equality which upsets the power and control imbalance,” Easter told HuffPost in an email. “I have seen over and over again when these survivors found new equality-based relationships they were much safer and happier.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab908331e0000fb077afc29.jpeg?cache=mF8TF5eXm5&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Pam And Jim ’Shippers Are Coming After Jenna Fischer's New On-Screen Love","authors":"Leigh Blickley","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jenna-fischer-oliver-hudson-splitting-up-together_us_5ab7dbc7e4b054d118e40d8f","short_description":"Oliver Hudson says John Krasinski fans will not let up ahead of the \"Splitting Up Together\" premiere.","date":"2018-03-26"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Tom Cruise Jumps Out Of A Plane At 25,000 Feet For Next 'Mission: Impossible'","authors":"Andy McDonald","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tom-cruise-jumps-out-of-a-plane-at-25000-feet-for-next-mission-impossible_us_5ab91222e4b008c9e5f9c3b8","short_description":"The actor broke his ankle seven months ago doing a stunt for the film.","date":"2018-03-26"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Now They're Using A Dog Movie To Appropriate Asian Culture","authors":"Kimberly Yam","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/wes-anderson-isle-of-dogs-appropriation_us_5ab5244ee4b0decad0498f20","short_description":"“The problem is that Isle of Dogs falls into a long history of American art othering or dehumanizing Asians,” critic Angie Han wrote.","date":"2018-03-26"},"articleContent":["Wes Anderson’s film “Isle Of Dogs,” which hit theaters on Friday, has drawn applause from critics, who were captivated by the imagery and heartwarming doggo-centric plot.","But many Asian-Americans argue there’s an ugly side to the film that needs to be discussed.","Anderson’s movie, a work of stop-motion animation set in the fictional Japanese city of Megasaki, has spurred a debate about cultural appropriation, as discussed in a review by Justin Chang for the Los Angeles Times. Chang questioned whether Anderson, who’s white, successfully paid homage to East Asian culture, or whether the movie is “just a clueless failure of sensitivity.”","In “Isle of Dogs,” Megasaki is hit with a canine flu outbreak, and authorities order the area’s pooches sent to an island. With the help of a pack of scrappy canine exiles, a young boy named Atari, voiced by Koyu Rankin, sets out to rescue his own beloved hound. The movie is largely focused on the dogs ― but Chang took issue with the way the humans are portrayed.","The residents of Megasaki speak Japanese, often without subtitles, while the dogs in the movie speak English. Most of the Japanese dialogue is “pared down to simple statements,” Chang writes. And it’s Tracy Walker, an American character voiced by Greta Gerwig, who spearheads the film’s pro-dog movement. Ultimately, the movie reduces “the hapless, unsuspecting people of Megasaki to foreigners in their own city,” Chang argues.","Other Asian-American critics have voiced similar concerns. Though the movie is full of nods to Japanese film masters, including Akira Kurosawa, its handling of Japanese people locates “Isle” within a larger problematic trend, Mashable’s Angie Han said.","“Anderson wants us to see this situation from the perspective of the dogs, and not the humans, and language is a powerful way to steer us toward a side,” Han writes. “The problem is that Isle of Dogs falls into a long history of American art othering or dehumanizing Asians, borrowing their ‘exotic’ cultures and settings while disregarding the people who created those cultures and live in those settings.”","It’s not clear why the story needed to be set in fictional Japan at all, Han notes. And while Tracy is rebellious, persistent and heroic, her strength only highlights the weakness and compliance of the Japanese characters.","“In treating Japanese culture like superficial embellishments, Japanese people like unknowable others, and Japan itself like an endearingly quirky playground for yet another white American narrative, Isle of Dogs’ messaging about protecting the vulnerable falls flat,” Han writes.","Chang and Han’s reviews gained traction among Asian-American social media users, and many added their voices to the group of frustrated viewers, including film critic Inkoo Kang and the L.A. Times’ Jen Yamato.","Anderson, who both wrote and directed “Isle of Dogs,” did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.","CBC Radio points out that Kunichi Nomura, a Japanese actor and writer, served as Anderson’s consultant for the film, helping with issues of authenticity. In a recent interview with the outlet, Nomura ― who also voices Megasaki’s villainous mayor ― addressed the cultural appropriation issue. While the actor had a say in the movie’s elements, he didn’t want to stifle Anderson’s creativity, he said.","“It has a real side but it’s a setting 20 years in the future, and it kind of reminded me of Thunderbirds or how in the ’60s, when they would make a sci-fi movie or a comic, it’s kind of retro-future. So when Wes would ask me, is this really authentic, then I would answer yes or no,” Nomura told CBC Radio. “But at the same time I didn’t want to interfere with his imagination. You know, like you don’t really have to make everything accurate.”","Still, amid the many recent examples of Hollywood films and series that have employed Asian cultural elements in disappointing, insensitive ways ― like this one, and this one, and this one ― it’s no wonder Asian-Americans were hoping for something better."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab937de1f0000270616b81f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"'Walking Dead' Actor Defends Show Over Apparent Plot Hole","authors":"Bill Bradley","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/walking-dead-actor-defends-show-over-apparent-plot-hole_us_5ab32540e4b054d118df952b","short_description":"Jason Douglas explains the reason for that confusing turn of events.","date":"2018-03-26"},"articleContent":["Hole-y hell.","In Sunday’s episode of “The Walking Dead,” “Do Not Send Us Astray,” the Saviors finally carry out their plan to attack the Hilltop with zombie-blood tainted weapons.","Things don’t go exactly as planned; actually, Maggie (Lauren Cohan) and the Hilltop pretty much stomp them, but some characters do get injured with the infected weapons and eventually turn into zombies.","Among the victims, I’m sorry to say, is Tobin (Jason Douglas).","Some peeps might be like, “Tobin? How’s that guy still alive?”","Yeah, I agree. How did Tobin outlast Carl (Chandler Riggs), a kid who survived two gunshot wounds and the potential threat of diabetes after eating an entire supersized can of chocolate pudding?","If you think about it, Tobin is like the best contestant on “Survivor.” He is just kind of around, doesn’t make too big of a splash, but has vital contributions when needed and probably has an immunity idol.","Tobin is a survivor, so it’s a bummer when he gets stabbed by a Savior with an infected knife, eventually turning into one of the undead and attacking people in the Hilltop compound.","But this all raises one question: How?","“The Walking Dead” is in the latter half of its eighth season now and over the years we’ve seen characters repeatedly cover themselves with zombie guts and get cut by weapons that have been contaminated with zombie blood. (Spoiler alert!) Nothing happens to them.","Notably in Season 6, Rick (Andrew Lincoln) cuts his hand on a weapon sticking out of a zombie and just keeps on trekking. The moment started some speculation that his hand was infected and he’d have to cut it off, but nah, dude was OK.","In “The Walking Dead” comics, infected weapons do eventually cause characters to turn into zombies, but with the show having established scenes where people don’t turn, is Tobin’s situation just a blatant plot hole?","Douglas (aka Tobin) himself argues against that.","“I think what we have to accept about the convention of this show ... we’re all infected anyway, but that infection can accelerate if we are really bitten or whatever in a way that really gets that into our system, and so a deep cut versus a scratch is gonna make a difference about how infected we get,” he told HuffPost.","“I’m sort of with you, if you’re going to be completely covered in blood, is there a chance that that infection gets into your system? What about if you already have a cut and then you cover yourself in the blood? … I think there’s so much we don’t know. I mean, we’ve already accepted the convention that the dead can come back to life and eat people, so I think we have to remember that that’s where we are, and I don’t think we can expect everything to be just so.”","Fair enough. But even in a universe where we accept that dead people come back to life and choose to eat humans over something much more accessible and tasty like unlimited soup, salad and breadsticks at Olive Garden, you have to have certain rules, right? Up until now, those rules seemed to include the fact that zombie blood alone wouldn’t turn you and that when you’re at Olive Garden, you’re family.","Douglas says that the way the Saviors used the weapons should also be considered.","“I think we have to accept that this is where we are and, frankly, just the aggressive way that the Saviors are using the walkers’ blood to really get in and infect people.”","I floated the idea that perhaps the walker blood the Saviors used was more potent than regular walker blood thanks to all the toxic waste we’ve seen around the Savior facilities. The actor agrees that could be the case, but adds the show would ultimately have to back it up.","“I think at a certain point you have to justify that by kind of making that connection on screen, so it actually plays out that way. I mean, until then it’s just conjecture. So much of what we do as fans of this genre [is], you know, ‘How could this happen? How could these things lead to those things?’ I just think it’s enough that they’ve dipped bullets, certainly knives, in fresh walkers’ blood, and they’re sort of immediately coming and using them on whoever they can find,” he said. “It’s more than just getting walker blood on them.”","Tobin isn’t the only character who got injured on the show, noted Douglas. Tara (Alanna Masterson) gets clipped by a Savior arrow.","“I guess we’ll have to find in the coming weeks if that becomes an infection or not. I’ll just leave that there,” he said.","Though the actor makes a good point, that Tara only received a small injury and may not turn because of it, it seems more likely that the arrow she was hit with wasn’t even infected.","On the show, Dwight (Austin Amelio) is the one who shoots Tara, and it seemed he only did so to stop another Savior (Steven Ogg’s Simon) from killing her. In the “Walking Dead” comics, Dwight similarly uses a clean arrow to injure Rick but not kill him. It appears this may be the same deal.","For what it’s worth, Douglas is cool with how Tobin went out.","“I’m grateful that he could die with his boots on,” he said, recalling how the character has gone from a somewhat selfish, cowardly guy to dying in a big battle as “someone who became far more selfless.”","Unlike Douglas, I’m still not totally cool with the zombie blood turning people, but, hey, what are you going to do? As my man Ron Weasley would say ..."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab422142000003800eb2b83.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"CRIME","headline":"Two Women Who Broadcast Islamophobic Mosque Visit With Children Are Indicted","authors":"Rowaida Abdelaziz","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/women-children-mosque-felony-video_us_5ab973c7e4b054d118e600f2","short_description":"The women were charged with third-degree burglary and aggravated criminal damage.","date":"2018-03-26"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"CRIME","headline":"Parents Threw Hot Oil On Teen For Refusing Forced Marriage, Cops Say","authors":"Alanna Vagianos","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/parents-threw-hot-oil-on-teen-for-refusing-forced-marriage-cops-say_us_5ab8e6ebe4b0decad04c01d6","short_description":"Parents of the Texas teen have been charged with child abuse, and it's \"highly likely\" a man who offered the family $20,000 to marry her will be arrested.","date":"2018-03-26"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"WEIRD NEWS","headline":"Giant Animatronic T-Rex Bursts Into Flame Because Even Robots Are Done With 2018","authors":"Ed Mazza","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/t-rex-dinosaur-fire_us_5ab890a0e4b008c9e5f8c5a8","short_description":"\"Electrical issue\" blamed for loss of 24-foot-tall T. rex.","date":"2018-03-26"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Kellyanne Conway's Husband Is Going Rogue","authors":"Ashley Feinberg","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/george-conway-twitter-trump_us_5ab553bee4b0decad049d7e0","short_description":"George Conway has been criticizing Trump all month.","date":"2018-03-26"},"articleContent":["George Conway, husband of presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway and onetime candidate to be U.S. solicitor general, has historically not been a very active Twitter user.

In February, however, he tweeted and retweeted a total of 43 times, starting with a retweet in praise of conservative columnist Mona Charen, who had blasted Trump from the stage of the Conservative Political Action Conference.","And this month so far, Conway has sent forth about 200 tweets and retweets, roughly half of which criticize Trump to varying degrees. The tweet below, in which Conway praises a thread questioning the timing of Trump’s ouster of former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, seems to mark the beginning of the great George Conway Twitter reckoning of 2018.","Since then, Mr. Kellyanne Conway has been tweeting and retweeting like a lover scorned. Here’s just a small sampling of his weekslong pro-Robert Mueller, anti-Trump rampage.","And so on.","The March 23 tweet below received the most attention of the bunch, as it refers to a job that Kellyanne had been rumored to be under consideration for.","The Hill even briefly published a short post on the tweet, which can still be found in Google’s cache here. At some point in the hours that followed its publication, however, The Hill removed the story. The original link now takes you to a page reading, “Access denied.”","Whatever additional attention Conway has received over his flurry of Twitter activity certainly hasn’t slowed him down. Is George Conway so fed up with Trump’s assaults on the legal profession — his profession — that he simply can’t hold his feelings inside any longer? Would it be too wild a leap for a Trump Kremlinologist to think this might be a prelude to Kellyanne Conway’s own White House departure? What are dinnertime conversations like at the Conway household, one wonders?","We’ve reached out to George Conway and the White House for comment, but have not heard back.

Conditt and his younger sister would usually attend the activities along with 15 to 20 other kids, according to Schultz.\n\n“A lot of us were very into science; we would discuss chemicals and how to mix them and which ones were dangerous,” said Schultz. “We were into weapons and stuff. A lot of us did role-playing, and RPG [role-playing games]; we’d have foam weapons and act out a battle.”","This seemed irresistibly sinister as it became clear Conditt, 23, was the bomber, and others quickly latched onto the detail.","“Austin bomber Mark Anthony Conditt was part of Christian survivalist group that discussed ‘dangerous’ chemicals,” read a headline on the Independent. Social media went further, with some users claiming that RIOT served as some sort of white supremacist breeding ground or an education center for aspiring chemical weapons experts.","“Austin bomber Mark Conditt was RADICALIZED by a neo-Nazi Christian group that teaches members about dangerous chemicals & guns,” one woman wrote on Twitter, linking to the Independent story. “The group is called RIOT - Righteous Invasion of Truth. No difference between this & ISIS.”","So what exactly goes down at these RIOT events?","“Water balloons, cream pies, frisbee, etc.,” said Pamela Crouch, a parent in the homeschooling community in the Austin suburb of Pflugerville who knows the Conditt family well. “That’s what it is.”","And that “conservative survivalist circle” mentioned in the Buzzfeed article? It was a small group of children “into camping, tying knots in ropes and climbing,” said Crouch, who also knows Schultz. “Very tame stuff.”","Crouch was moved to speak out by what she felt were mischaracterizations of RIOT and of Conditt’s family. She worried the sensational rhetoric surrounding either would “probably continue until the next disaster or the next outrageous” tweet from President Donald Trump.","“I cannot sit idly by while my friends and loved ones are being unjustly accused,” Crouch told HuffPost.","Conditt and his family were part of a tight-knit homeschooling community in Pflugerville, which is home to a variety of Christian camps and other activities for homeschooled kids. If you’re looking to find strains of violent extremism in Conditt’s upbringing, you’ll have a hard time finding any within RIOT, a standard-fare Bible study group.","A RIOT recruiting mailer sent out to parents in 2016 advertises such activities as swimming, potlucks, bowling and “boffer melee,” a popular live-action role-play game in which kids simulate medieval warfare by bonking each other with padded pipes.","The mailer, released to HuffPost in the form of a Facebook posting, reads in part:","Some fun RIOT events in the past included: Game Night, Murder Mystery party, Movie Night w/Pizza, Bowling, Swim Party, Games in the Park, Fun at the Beach (Lake Pflugerville), Skating, Boffer Melee, etc. Food for these events is usually a shared effort - the teens can bring a few dollars each and you can buy it, or everyone can bring snacks/potluck to share. You can also plan an event at Jumpoline, Jumpstreet, Main Event, Spare Time, a movie (in a theatre) followed by dinner nearby, etc. If you can call ahead and get a group rate, that’s best!","Nonetheless, a community of parents in Pflugerville has been upended largely because of a single quote in a single story. The media glare was harsh enough that even the Texas Home School Coalition felt compelled to distance itself from Conditt via a press release.","“Raised by both parents in a Christian home, Conditt reportedly walked away from his faith several years ago,” Tim Lambert, president of the association, said in a statement after Conditt’s death. “Today’s revelations about the Austin bombings provide a stark reminder that we live in a fallen world. Unfortunately, no form of education, public or private, can ensure a tragedy like this will never happen.”","Crouch moved to the area in 1995 and began homeschooling her son in 2004. Her family attended church alongside the Conditts and even went to “home group” ― “which is like Bible study,” she said ― at the Conditt household.","In Crouch’s telling, those services, like other Christian events in the community, were as normal as they come, not to mention “racially and ethnically diverse,” which she appreciated.","Austin “is actually one of the most tolerant cities in the South,” she said. “That is one of the reasons I feel comfortable raising my children here.”","Crouch, like several of her neighbors, was upset about questioning from reporters that seemed to blame Conditt’s parents and the homeschooling community in general for his bombing spree that killed two and injured several others.","Homeschooling, she said, is “a good option for anyone who is not satisfied with the school system. We try to protect our kids from being hurt in the schools, with all the shootings and stabbings and rapes, but we are somehow the dangerous ones?”","As for Conditt’s father and mother, she called them “good folks.”","“Mark is dead ― so everyone wants someone to blame, but I don’t think they should blame the parents,” she said. “They did not teach Mark hate.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab9305c1f0000260616b80d.jpeg?cache=95yO7ieWPp&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"WEIRD NEWS","headline":"MMA Fighter Does Front Flip Off Knocked-Out Opponent, Gets Disqualified","authors":"Ron Dicker","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mma-fighter-back-flip-dq_us_5ab8ee7de4b0decad04c0b5c","short_description":"\"My mother has to see that,\" an ashamed Drew Chatman said.","date":"2018-03-26"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"BUSINESS","headline":"Elon Musk's Estranged Father Has Child With Stepdaughter, Says It's 'God's Plan'","authors":"Jenna Amatulli","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/errol-musk-elon-musk-stepdaughter_us_5ab9113ee4b0decad04c68c3","short_description":"The young woman was only 4 years old when Errol Musk married her mother.","date":"2018-03-26"},"articleContent":["Technology magnate Elon Musk apparently has a good reason for being angry with his estranged father: Errol Musk recently revealed that he had a child with his stepdaughter and he called the baby “God’s plan.”","The elder Musk told The Sunday Times of London this weekend that he fathered a son with 30-year-old Jana Bezuidenhout, the daughter of his former wife Heide.

In her spare time she likes to draw. So it was only natural that she would fuse these interests with “Jetlagged Comic,” a webcomic about life as a flight attendant.","“I get my ideas from real life, from experiences I’ve personally had or have heard about from other flight attendants,” she told HuffPost. “I try to stick to the truth ― that is to say, to things that when people read the cartoon will go, ‘Oh yeah, that’s so true!’”","Although Kincaid always enjoyed drawing as a child and took a few art classes in college, she never seriously pursued this interest until she went through a period of career instability.","In 2008, she was “furloughed,” or temporarily laid off, from her airline. To soften the financial blow, Kincaid started a house-cleaning business. Although her airline re-hired her after four months, she continued cleaning for two years.","“During this time, no new people were hired at my airline. If you know anything about the airline industry, you know it’s all based on seniority. No new hires, no forward movement!” she explained. “It was a shaky two years with a lot of uncertainty about the future of my flying career.”","This career chapter made Kincaid feel introspective, and she started to question her choices and path. Watching the movie “Julie & Julia” sparked a change.","“Julia and I were in the same boat. She didn’t know what she wanted to do! Then her husband asked her, ‘Well, what do you like?’ and she simply said, ‘I like to eat!’ And there you have it,” she recalled. “So what was the difference for me? I loved to draw! How simple!”","With help from her husband Robert, who is also a flight attendant, Kincaid devised a system for coming up with cartoon ideas, taking art classes, practicing drawing, reading cartooning books and then finally, putting what she learned to work.","After winning online cartoon contests and getting into the habit of drawing new creations each week, she decided to focus on a specific theme and audience. For a long time, she resisted the topic she knew best: working as a flight attendant.","Flying has always been a big part of Kincaid’s life. “You could say I grew up in the airline industry. My mom has been a flight attendant for almost 30 years! I’ve been a little standby-er since I was 5 years old. I never once dreamed of becoming a stew like my mom, but once I fell into it, I’ve never looked back.”","Although her flight attendant journey has been “awesome,” she initially hesitated when it came to drawing about her work experience.","“The last thing I wanted to cartoon about was my job. I didn’t think I could make it funny,” she recalled. “It could make me so frustrated sometimes it was the last thing I wanted to think about it, let alone write about!”","During a layover in San Francisco, Kincaid attended a cartooning class taught by artist Hilary Price. “She told us that the best cartoonists write what they know,” she said. “So, I took that to heart. I began poking around in my creativity, trying to come up with silly cartoons about flight crew life.”","In 2012, Kincaid and her husband moved from Anchorage, Alaska, to Seattle, Washington. That same year, she began posting her flight attendant cartoons on Facebook and was pleased to find a strong positive response. She continued to create and post more cartoons around this theme and eventually named her strip “Jetlagged Comic.”","Over time, her fanbase grew. Today, the “Jetlagged Comic” Facebook page has more than 66,000 followers, and Kincaid has released two books, Airplane Mode and Jetway Reunion.","“The journey has been amazing so far. People seem to really like it,” she said. “I get a lot of great feedback from comments on posts, but also in emails, letters and face-to-face.”","Kincaid told HuffPost airlines like Alaska and Emirates have used her work in their training programs, and others like Republic, United and Air New Zealand have published them in their internal magazines for flight crews.","“I’ve worked with various aviation organizations supplying them with cartoon luggage tags and books. I’ve had many interviews with flight crew- and aviation-related websites and businesses,” she explained. “It’s been a really positive response so far. ‘Jetlagged’ gives me a lot of healthy challenges that make me grow as an artist and writer, but also as a businesswoman and entrepreneur.”","She and her husband are saving up to purchase equipment so that they can create more “Jetlagged” products, like luggage tags and hand-drawn art, which they sell online and to airport stores.","Although she primarily focuses on the flight attendant experience, Kincaid has also created cartoons about pilots, agents and frequent flyers. She likes to draw ideas from major topics like sleep struggles, hotel life and in-flight interactions.","“Creativity ebbs and flows, just like the ocean. Sometimes a wave of ideas comes in the middle of the night or when I’m washing my hair or going for a walk. And then there’ll be a dry spell of nothing,” said the artist. “But I never worry. I know it will come back. I just wait for the wave.”","Ultimately, Kincaid hopes her cartoons bring people joy and continue to help her grow as an artist.","“In the beginning, the challenge of writing ‘Jetlagged’ was how to make a frustrating situation into something funny and lighthearted,” she said. “How do I flip something negative on its head and make it into a positive? That is the constant challenge.”","“What I hope people get out of it is to keep a humorous perspective. The best ‘Jetlagged’ cartoons come out of some of my worst experiences. It’s just how you choose to look at it,” she continued. “Someone smart once said life is 10 percent what happens to you and 90 percent how you respond. I hope ‘Jetlagged’ will remind people to response with humor. To laugh at what we can’t control, to laugh at themselves and to laugh with the world.”","Keep scrolling for more of Kincaid’s hilarious and relatable cartoons."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab93f95200000d30ceb30ed.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"RELIGION","headline":"After Children Marched For Their Lives, Pope Francis Urged Young People To ‘Keep Shouting’","authors":"Philip Pullella, Reuters","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pope-francis-palm-sunday-2018-message-for-youth_us_5ab7b18ae4b054d118e3f318","short_description":"At a solemn Palm Sunday service, the pope urged young people to not allow older generations to silence their voices.","date":"2018-03-25"},"articleContent":["VATICAN CITY, March 25 (Reuters) - Pope Francis, starting Holy Week services leading to Easter, urged young people on Sunday to keep shouting and not allow the older generations to silence their voices or anesthetize their idealism.","Francis spoke a day after hundreds of thousands of young Americans and their supporters answered a call to action from survivors of last month’s Florida high school massacre and rallied across the United States to demand tighter gun laws.

Many ways to anesthetize them, to make them keep quiet, ask nothing, question nothing.

Even if others keep quiet, if we older people and leaders, some corrupt, keep quiet, if the whole world keeps quiet and loses its joy, I ask you: Will you cry out?”\n\nThe young people in the crowd shouted, “Yes!”\n\nWhile Francis did not mention Saturday’s marches in the United States, he has often condemned weapons manufacturing and mass shootings.\n\nPalm Sunday marked the start of a hectic week of activities for the pope.\n\nOn Holy Thursday he is due to preside at two services, including one in which he will wash the feet of 12 inmates in a Rome jail to commemorate Jesus’ gesture of humility towards his apostles the night before he died.\n\nOn Good Friday, he is due to lead a Via Crucis (Way of the Cross) procession at Rome’s Colosseum.

Mark Warner (D-Va.), the senior Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, says that social media giant Facebook hasn’t been fully transparent about its previously unreported data leak.","“I don’t think Facebook has been fully forthcoming,” Warner said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet The Press.” “I called out Facebook back in December of ’16. In the Spring of ’17, I questioned micro-targeting and the use of this really sketchy firm Cambridge Analytica. Early on for most of 2017, they blew that off.”","The social media giant recently confirmed that Cambridge Analytica, a British voter-profiling firm with ties to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, harvested private data from millions of Facebook users in 2016. Last week, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg finally apologized for his company’s role in the breach and said it was taking steps to protect user data going forward.","Warner, who is helping probe Russia’s alleged involvement in the 2016 presidential election, said that it may be necessary to regulate large social media companies like Facebook going forward.","“All of these social media companies have said they have no responsibility for any of the content,” Warner said. “I think we have to relook at that. I think in many ways they’re media companies.”","While Democrats have been critical of Facebook and its role in the 2016 election, calling on executives like Zuckerberg to testify before Congress, they do not have the power to compel him to do so.","Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) on Monday invited Zuckerberg to testify at a hearing on April 10 to discuss “Facebook’s past and future policies regarding the protection and monitoring of consumer data.” Grassley also announced he had invited Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to discuss the future of data privacy in the social media industry.","Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) hasn’t called on Zuckerberg to testify.","Zuckerberg took out full-page ads in several American and British newspapers on Sunday to apologize for the “breach of trust” in the scandal.","“This was a breach of trust, and I’m sorry we didn’t do more at the time. We’re now taking steps to ensure this doesn’t happen again,” read the ads.","Warner dismissed Zuckerberg’s gesture on Sunday and reiterated his call for the Facebook founder to testify before Congress.","“I think Mr. Zuckerberg needs to come and testify before Congress, not just put an advertisement in the newspaper,” Warner said. “He said he would if he was the guy, he is the right guy.

Please understand my absence.’”","date":"2018-03-25"},"articleContent":["WASHINGTON — On Feb. 14, Joey Wong was in class at Pace University in New York City when news of a school shooting started to pour in on social media.","“My first, initial reaction was denial,” Wong told HuffPost this week. “‘This can’t be real. This is probably, you know, there’s possibly another school, similar to mine.’”","Wong, who graduated from Stoneman Douglas High School last year, stopped paying attention to class and stayed glued to his phone. He began contacting his friends and former high school classmates, and, soon, “the denial faded away.” The fact that a shooting had occurred at his alma mater “became reality,” he said.","He heard from mutual friends that a teammate on the school’s swim team, Nick Dworet, was missing. Later, he would hear that Dworet, who would have turned 18 on Saturday, was among the 17 confirmed victims of the shooting.","Monet McFarlane, a 2016 Douglas graduate who also now attends Pace, was on her way to shop for a Valentine’s Day outfit, when she checked a group chat from her family in Florida.","“They were all in there saying, ‘Douglas got shot up,’ and I thought it was a mistake because it’s Parkland, Florida. We don’t get ‘shot up,’” she said. Once reality set in, she felt a sense of “helplessness, just being so far away.”","A few days later, they flew back to Parkland, wanting to be near their friends, some of whom were already involved in planning vigils and protests. Unlike Wong and McFarlane, most of their friends stayed in Florida for college. Watching the students mobilize local protests, Wong said that he felt inspired to become active in New York.","“Being that outlier, I was thinking to myself, not many people know what Douglas is or where it was, or what’s it like?” Wong said. “I came back with a mission, basically — a mission to get things organized, to get New York City involved.”","He joined Facebook groups formed for planning events related to the shooting, connecting with organizers and other Douglas alums in the city to plan New York’s version of the March For Our Lives.","But as it became clear that a group of students from New York City were planning to go to D.C., Wong knew he had to go “where, I think, the most impact will be.” He wanted to rejoin his friends and former classmates, like water polo teammate Charles Lambeth, who attends nearby Palm Beach State College.","The day of the shooting, Lambeth immediately got in his car, “speeding back to school,” to find his close friends and a cousin who still attends Douglas — and, according to Lambeth, was spared from the shooting after assistant football coach Aaron Feis heroically shielded her and other students. Feis died in the attack.","Since the shooting, Lambeth has frequently returned to the school.","“All we can do is cry and be there together,” he said. “Eventually, there [aren’t] enough tears to continue going.”","On Saturday, the three traveled together to the March For Our Lives to join the large contingent of Douglas students, teachers and alumni in Washington, D.C.","Moving forward, McFarlane, who said that she still has a hard time processing the shooting, hopes “[to help] the community heal, even though I can’t be there, which is tough.”","Despite her physical distance, she has tried to be a sounding board for her friends in Parkland because “I understand when you’re a little bit removed from the situation, it’s easier to talk,” she said.","Wong, who says that he wasn’t politically active before the shooting, hopes to stay involved in activism, but “not necessarily be as hands-on with organizing marches and events.”","He said that the aftermath of the shooting and his newfound activism made it somewhat difficult to juggle his classes and college life, describing how he had to email his teachers to explain why he had to miss class.","“No student should have to tell their teacher, ‘My school was just shot up. Please understand my absence,’” he said.","But ever since the shooting, he hopes to stay involved in other ways, or at least be “more aware” of political and social issues.","“People I know were killed, and people I know suffer now from PTSD. I can’t have a normal life. It makes me want to be politically active. I can’t not be politically active. In my opinion, I’d be disrespecting all of those people,” he said. “It’s something you can’t really turn off anymore.”","CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that McFarlane participated in water polo."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab6b35d1f00002d0016b5e9.jpeg?cache=25AG61zDRG&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Mnuchin Touts Trump's Call For Unconstitutional Line-Item Veto","authors":"Elise Foley","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mnuchin-line-item-veto-fox-news_us_5ab7bd39e4b0decad04b1546","short_description":"\"Fox News Sunday\" host Chris Wallace had to inform the Treasury secretary that Congress couldn't easily do what the president demanded.","date":"2018-03-25"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"QUEER VOICES","headline":"Queer Eye's Karamo Brown Has A Personal Reason To Support March For Our Lives","authors":"Curtis M.

The fire exits were blocked,” Svetlana Petrenko, a spokeswoman for the committee, said in a statement.","Four people have already been detained, including two employees of the firm that services themall’s fire alarm.","Emergency services said they had extinguished the fire, but later said it had reignited in places, and that rescuers were struggling to recover bodies because the building’s top floor had collapsed.","It was unclear if any people were still unaccounted for.","Health Minister Veronika Skortsova said from the scene that 13 people were in hospital, including an 11-year-old boy in a serious condition. Russian media said the boy had leapt from a window and that both his parents had been killed.","Many of the victims will only be able to be identified via DNA testing, officials said.","An unofficial list of those missing circulating on Russian media included more than 20 children, some as young as five.","Mobile phone messages sent from one of those on the list, 13-year-old Maria Moroz, and published by Russian media, said: “We are burning. I love you all. This is perhaps farewell.”","ANGER","Alexander Lillevyali told online newspaper Meduza that he and his wife Olga had lost all three of their daughters, two aged 11 and one five, in the blaze.","He was cited as saying he had dropped the girls off at the cinema and that one of them had phoned later to say the auditorium was filling with smoke and that they couldn’t get out because the doors were locked.","He described how he had led rescuers up the stairs, but that they had been ordered to go elsewhere and that rescuers, citing regulations, had refused to give him a respiratory mask. “My daughters were left to burn because of their bloody rules,” Lillevyali told Meduza.","Anna Kuznetsova, Russia’s children’s rights commissioner, said the fire had been caused by incompetence and that similar shopping centers across Russia should be urgently checked.","Pro-Kremlin politicians called for anyone found guilty of negligence or worse to be harshly punished.","Witnesses told Russian media the fire alarm and sprinklers had failed to function.","Video footage showed a group of people in a smoke-filled staircase trying to smash a fire exit door, which was jammed.","The cause of the blaze remains unclear.","The Interfax news agency cited an unnamed local official source as saying the main theory being looked at was that the fire had been caused by an electrical short circuit.","However, it quoted Vladimir Chernov, the region’s deputy governor, as saying on Sunday that the blaze may have started when a teenager set fire to the rubber foam on a trampoline in a play area using a lighter.","Other officials were quoted as saying the blaze may have been started by candles used in a children’s celebration.","State TV said the mall opened in 2013.

Former Vice President Al Gore’s 2006 blockbuster, “An Inconvenient Truth,” was basically a movie version of the PowerPoint lecture series he used to describe the dangers of runaway greenhouse gas pollution. Leonardo DiCaprio’s 2016 “Before the Flood” chronicled the actor’s meetings with policymakers and visits to collapsing glaciers in retreat. The fiction is apocalyptic. Movies like 2004’s “The Day After Tomorrow” and 2017’s “Geostorm” depict the changing climate as the “new supervillain.”","Then there is Darren Aronofsky.","The 49-year-old filmmaker, best known for directing psychological dramas “Requiem For a Dream” and “Black Swan,” released “Noah” in 2014, which depicted the great biblical flood in a way meant to serve as a warning about sea level rise. His 2017 thriller “Mother!” was a thinly veiled reflection on humanity’s unabated greenhouse gas emissions as told through an impassioned, praise-hungry poet who caters to the desires of a mob of worshipful guests who destroy their home as his wife watches in horror.","But now Aronofsky is trying something different. On Monday, National Geographic will air the first episode of the 10-part series “One Strange Rock,” narrated by actor Will Smith. The documentary series holds up the same stunning lens to earth science that the BBC’s “Planet Earth” and “Blue Planet” focused on wildlife and marine animals. Episodes document life in acid lakes, chronicle the organisms that cruise the jetstreams on dust blowing from Africa to South America, and show the Earth from the perspective of American and Canadian astronauts in the International Space Station.","“It is a celebration of our home,” Aronofsky told HuffPost in an interview at a New York press screening this month. “This is the great Architectural Digest spread of planet Earth.”","“Mars is a barren wasteland, yet we have tropical islands and polar ice caps and such a variation of wealth and environments that are inspiring and beautiful,” he added. “We’re very, very lucky to have it, so hopefully we can all appreciate it more.”","Aronofsky, who produced the show, said the lush shots, ranging from slowed-down video of the creation of oxygen underwater to panoramic views of the planet from space, are intended to make the complex and fragile processes that make the Earth inhabitable more intimate. At the screening this month, co-producer Jane Root quoted David Attenborough, the legendary naturalist and “Planet Earth” narrator, as saying that, to save the planet, you have to first fall in love with it. This, Aronofsky said, is his love letter to the planet.","But to understand climate change, you’ll have to read between the lines. The show makes no mention of the human-caused emissions warming the planet.","“It’s like what they teach you in art class about negative space,” Aronofsky said. “Negative space is assumed when you start looking at the beauty of the clockwork, the mechanics that are occurring in front of you.”","Confronting viewers with some of the Earth’s most astonishing ecosystems “reveals unconsciously for people, oh my gosh, this is an incredible system that we’re blessed to have, and we need to take care of it,” he said.","“But it’s not a call to arms,” he said.","Aronofsky, who grew up in South Brooklyn, New York, first became enamored of nature in high school. He was accepted into the School for Field Studies, a nonprofit study abroad program focused on environmental sciences, and spent six weeks in the Kenyan bush studying ungulates, counting wildebeest and gazelle populations. The next summer, he went on another trip to Alaska’s Prince William Sound, where he studied harbor seals and monitored icebergs and glaciers. That was in 1987, two years before the Exxon-Valdez tanker spilled 10.8 million gallons of oil into the waterway. After the spill, government scientists used the data Aronofsky helped collect to measure the impact on wildlife.","“Being in those environments and reading Darwin and learning the awe that you experience every day when you wake up in the natural world just blessed me with this lifelong appreciation for it,” Aronofsky said.","Hollywood’s forays into climate change have, at times, backfired. Putting celebrities out front allowed conservative media ― given to parroting the climate change denialism that Republicans have cemented as a platform issue over the past decade ― to discredit warnings about global warming by noting, for example, DiCaprio’s past penchant for fuel-guzzling private jet flights. But the awareness that movie and TV stars raise about climate science still outweighs any narratives of perceived hypocrisy.","“Film has a huge role to play in climate communication,” John Cook, a researcher at George Mason University’s Center for Climate Change Communication, told HuffPost. “Science can communicate facts, but unfortunately, that only gets us so far. We need art to shape the facts of climate change in narratives and frames that resonate with the general public.”","A November 2004 study into how “The Day After Tomorrow” affected viewers’ understanding of the threats posed by climate change found that people who saw the movie had a significantly higher risk perception than those who didn’t. But Hollywood depictions of climate change that focus too much on scientists’ most dire warnings risk alienating viewers, according to Alex de Sherbinin, an associate director at Columbia University’s Center for International Earth Science Information Network.","“In general, I think movies need to be careful about the shock value, which can breed a kind of helplessness or ‘Why bother?’” de Sherbinin told HuffPost. “I have seen art exhibits that create a sort of sadness. That may be a more effective emotion to trigger, as long as it is not completely hopeless.”","Yet Aronofsky’s work, famous for theatrical plots and artful cinematography, is uniquely well-suited to tackling the subject, said Gretchen Goldman, research director at the Center for Science and Democracy at the Washington, D.C.-based Union of Concerned Scientists.","“Aronofsky specifically has the ability to do this through vivid imagery and dramatic scenarios,” she told HuffPost. “This is powerful for people.”","Aronofsky is quick to point out that Republicans alone aren’t the problem. He started working on “Mother!” and “One Strange Rock” during the final year of the Obama administration, after the United States helped broker the Paris climate accord, the first global deal to cut planet-warming carbon dioxide emissions. After the election of President Donald Trump, who has long dismissed climate science, Aronofsky went to the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, where indigenous activists and environmentalists were protesting the construction of the Dakota Access oil pipeline through a sacred water source.","“I found the response from a lot of indigenous friends very neutral on the election, when I was sort of throwing up every night,” he said. “I asked why, and they said, ‘This is a 500-year race war. The pipeline started under Obama.’”","Aronofsky said Democrats should push for 100 percent renewable energy and to divest from fossil fuels. He also said Democratic candidates should refuse donations from fossil fuel companies.","“Right now, it’s really clear how everything is kind of revealed suddenly,” he said. “You have to reveal cancer before you cut it out. For me, that’s the silver lining.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab5626a1f0000280616b53c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Jared Kushner's Younger Brother Had Vowed To #MarchForOurLives.

When shots rang out, elite police stormed the building to kill the assailant. Police sources said Beltrame was shot three times.\n\nPolice arrested two people after the attack, one of them a woman connected to Lakdim, on Friday and a 17-year-old man said to be one of his friends overnight, judicial sources said.\n\nThe Islamic State militant group claimed responsibility for the attack. Macron said security services were checking that claim.\n\nMore than 240 people have been killed in France in attacks since 2015 by assailants who either pledged allegiance to Islamic State or were inspired by the ultra-hardline group.\n\nFrance is part of a group of countries whose warplanes have been bombing Islamic State strongholds in Iraq and Syria, where in recent months IS has lost much of a self-proclaimed “caliphate” of territory it seized in 2014.\n\nOne multiple attack by Islamist gunmen and suicide bombers killed 130 people in Paris in November 2015 while another killed close to 90 when a man ran a truck into partying crowds in the Riviera seaside city of Nice in July 2016.\n\nBeltrame, who is survived by his wife, was a qualified parachutist who served in Iraq in 2005. He also worked as part of the elite Republican Guard that protects the presidential Elysee Place offices and residence in Paris, Macron said.\n\nFriday’s assault was the first deadly Islamist attack in France since October 2017, when a man stabbed two young women to death in the port city of Marseille before soldiers killed him.\n\nSeveral attacks over the past year or more have targeted police and soldiers deployed in big numbers to protect civilians and patrol sensitive spots such as airports and train stations.\n\nMacron said of Beltrame: “In offering himself as a hostage to the terrorist holed up in the Trebes supermarket, lieutenant colonel Beltrame saved the life of a civilian hostage, showing exceptional self-sacrifice and courage.”\n\nThe news of Beltrame’s death was first announced France’s interior minister, who said in a Twitter post: “Dead for his country. France will never forget his heroism, bravery and sacrifice.”\n\n(Additional reporting by Sybille de La Hamaide Editing by Mark Heinrich)"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab62d2d1f0000280616b590.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Marching For Their Students, Teachers Say More Guns In Schools Are Not The Answer","authors":"Marina Fang","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/march-for-our-lives-teachers_us_5ab6a5e6e4b0decad04a8175","short_description":"“I’ve gone to school to provide children with a great education and to give them love ... not to have a gun.\"","date":"2018-03-24"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"It's Time To March For Our Lives.

It’s an all-too-familiar story in a country that has already seen more than a dozen school shootings in 2018 alone.","But this shooting was different. The students who survived the slaughter stood up, demanding that those in power act to stop making it so easy to obtain assault-style rifles.","During the main protest in Washington, D.C., on Saturday, teens carried signs blasting the National Rifle Association and calling for common-sense gun reform. Half a million protesters were expected to be at the D.C. rally alone.","“Our parents didn’t do lockdown drills in schools,” Fiona Coffin, 17, told HuffPost. “We shouldn’t have to grow up with this.”","In New York City, Stoneman Douglas student Megan Bonner spoke to a crowd of thousands about her friend, Alana Petty, who died in the shooting.","“We called her Little Petty,” Bonner said. “She always had a smile on her face.”","Bonner began to cry.","“The adults have failed us,” she said.","Stoneman Douglas high school senior Delaney Tarr gave an impassioned speech in the nation’s capital, calling on Americans to fight against the NRA.","“This is a movement reliant on the persistence and passion of its people,” Tarr said. “We cannot move on. If we move on, the NRA and those against us will win. They want us to forget. They want our voices to be silenced. And they want to retreat into the shadows where they can remain unnoticed.

On March 14, one month after the shooting, thousands of students across the country left their classes ― some facing punishment for the act of civil disobedience ― to demand gun reform.","Through all this, the survivors have been told they’re too young to have opinions.

In 2015, Musgraves held a record release party alongside drag queens at a popular Nashville gay club. And last year, she penned a “love letter” to the LGBTQ community to mark the start of Pride Month, in which she described her own evolution on the issue of equality.","But now, five years after releasing the song that became a “queer country anthem,” Musgraves is ready for someone else to assume her mantle: namely, an artist who, unlike her, is gay.","“I keep dreaming of the day when we have a gay country music icon, that is loud and proud and really, like, a hero for country music fans, especially in these small towns where [LGBTQ people] are terrified of being themselves and feel like they have to hide,” Musgraves, 29, told HuffPost in a recent interview ahead of the release of “Golden Hour,” her latest album set for release March 30.","“If we had someone who could be that voice, a first-person account of that voice in our genre,” she said, “I think it could be a really powerful thing.”","There have been notable country music singers who have come out as gay: in particular, Chely Wright, who came out in 2010, and Ty Herndon, who followed four years later. But while Wright and Herndon still perform and release new music, they were both more than a decade removed from their last major chart successes by the time they came out.","Wright and Herndon received support ― mostly of the quiet variety ― from within country music industry, they both told HuffPost. But their decisions to come out also didn’t fully break down the barriers facing LGBTQ people in country music, an industry with a deserved reputation as a somewhat unfriendly place for gay artists and fans.","“I think that the rap that country music gets for being a bit homophobic, or a lot homophobic, we come by that honestly,” Wright said.","These days, Nashville is moving toward broader acceptance of LGBTQ people, Herndon told HuffPost, especially as more and more people within country have come out, and an increasing number of industry insiders have spoken out in favor of equality.","Shane McAnally, who helped write “Follow Your Arrow” and is one of Nashville’s most accomplished songwriters, came out in 2013. In January 2017, Country Music Television host Cody Alan did, too. And Brandy Clark, a songwriter who co-wrote “Follow Your Arrow,” is now perhaps the closest thing country has to that openly gay star Musgraves is dreaming of.","Earlier this month, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee (R) resigned from the Country Music Association’s board of directors thanks to backlash over his anti-LGBTQ views from country musicians and industry insiders.","But Herndon still isn’t sure the industry is ready to put an openly gay singer center stage, especially because many inside it fear alienating a fan base that skews toward traditional and cultural conservatism.","“Can there be an openly gay guy or girl on the radio singing about their hearts and who they love?” Herndon asked. “I think we’re getting to a place in Nashville where the industry would do it. I just don’t know how the fans would react to it.”","In 2013, when Musgraves released “Follow Your Arrow,” some industry insiders were skittish about a young artist releasing such a politically charged song so early in her career.","“I was told … that it would tank and that it would be terrible for me,” Musgraves said. “But I said, ‘I don’t really care.’ I think it’s a message we need, and I liked the song.”","“Follow Your Arrow” didn’t tank. Instead, it became one of Musgraves’ most successful singles, rising to No. 10 on Billboard’s Hot Country Chart ― which combines radio play with sales and online data ― and earning Song of the Year honors from the Country Music Association.","Still, the song was a relative failure on the radio, peaking only at No. 43 on Billboard’s Country Airplay Chart, which measures radio play exclusively. It was a sign that many country stations were at least a little reticent to play it, and yet another indication of the power country music’s fan base has over radio programmers and producers’ decisions.","“The third rail of country is sexuality,” said Keith Hill, a longtime radio programmer. “Ninety-nine percent of it is guys getting excited about a country girl.”","But with “Follow Your Arrow,” Hill said, country radio “missed an opportunity” to have a true “sea-change moment.”","“Most [radio producers and programmers] are not homophobic, but they know their fan base,” Wright said. “They know who calls in on morning drive, who’s calling in on afternoon drive, who’s showing up at appreciation shows.

McAnally in particular, she noted, has written major hits for nearly every big-time country star, including Sam Hunt, Kenny Chesney and Miranda Lambert, because the stories and topics that form the backbone of country music are universal.","“Country music has always been about real life,” Musgraves said. “If you look back at Hank Williams and Willie Nelson and all them, their songs were all about heartbreak … and divorce and cheating and losing your job, and all these things that are struggles in everyday life.”","“And coming out,” she said, “is no different.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab53f131e0000fb077af96a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"WEIRD NEWS","headline":"RNC Sells Trump-Themed Pet Leash In Honor Of National Puppy Day","authors":"Lee Moran","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-pet-leash-maga-rnc_us_5ab60f4ce4b0decad04a03bb","short_description":"A lot of people made it clear that their pups have no desire to Make America Great Again.","date":"2018-03-24"},"articleContent":["The Republican National Committee attempted to cash in on National Puppy Day on Friday by hawking a “Make America Great Again” pet leash:","The RNC linked to a page on President Donald Trump’s official website, from which visitors could buy the pet accessory for $16.","“Your faithful companion will thank you when you take him or her for a walk with our MAGA Pet leash,” the product listing stated. “Whether it’s a walk in the park or just around the block, you’ll make your walk great again with this functional and fashionable leash.”","But many animal lovers were not enamored with the Trump-themed leash:"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab612b51f0000280616b576.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Donald Trump Sticks With Ban On Most Transgender Troops","authors":"Carla Herreria","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-administration-transgender-military-ban_us_5ab57702e4b054d118e2cb76","short_description":"The Defense Department will continue to \"access and retain transgender individuals,\" due to a court order, despite Trump's ban.","date":"2018-03-24"},"articleContent":["President Donald Trump announced Friday that he’s sticking to his ban on transgender people in the military, even though the Pentagon showed little enthusiasm for the proposal.","In a memo released Friday night, the White House said that transgender individuals are “disqualified from military service except under limited circumstances.” The full ban was set to officially take effect Friday, though a pair of federal courts in December ordered the U.S. military to allow the recruitment of transgender citizens into the armed forces despite Trump’s declaration.","“Transgender persons with a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria ― individuals who the policies state may require substantial medical treatment, including medications and surgery ― are disqualified from military service except under certain limited circumstances,” the memo says.","Trump’s decision to keep the ban comes one month after a Washington Post report suggested that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis would urge Trump to allow transgender citizens to continue serving in the military.","Mattis delivered his recommendations to Trump in late February, but their conversation remained private.","In a statement following the memo, the White House said Friday’s announcement allows Mattis to “implement a new policy developed through extensive study by senior uniformed and civilian leaders, including combat veterans.”","The White House added that Mattis and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen have concluded that the “accession or retention of individuals with a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria ... presents considerable risk to military effectiveness and lethality.”","The Trump administration’s controversial transgender military ban has faced opposition at every corner since Trump announced the policy change in a series of surprising tweets last summer.","In July, Trump said he was banning transgender citizens from the armed forces because of the supposed “burden” of their “tremendous medical costs.” (Transition-related care costs the military only a fraction of its overall budget.

Now a student at Miami Dade College, she recalls walking to high school in the morning and seeing students getting questioned outside about their recent whereabouts. It felt like she was witnessing an interrogation.","In school, the situation felt similarly precarious.","“Even the slightest attitude coming from girls of color. The slightest attitude ... if they see it they’ll threaten to arrest you,” said Byfield, who has been working on these issues for years as a member of the nonprofit activist group S.O.U.L Sisters Leadership Collective.","Byfield will be unable to attend The March For Our Lives this Saturday, but members of her group will be one of many around the country expected to march on Saturday for school safety and gun control. A group based in Florida, they will also be marching against some of the very school safety measures the state’s legislature recently passed. The Florida bill increases funding for school police, and “school hardening” measures, like metal detectors. But students like Byfield ― namely, students of color ― have been living with these measures for years, and say that they help push students out of school and into the criminal justice system.","Public discussion around increasing police presence in schools has been recently centered on cops’ ability to deter school shootings. For Byfield though, having cops in schools has only made her feel less safe. It made school feel like a prison, instead of a safe haven. And while she’s optimistic and excited about the public activism that has been spurred by the shooting in Parkland, she’s worried that the unintended consequences of these policies will fall hardest on students of color.","“I feel like they will do all these different laws, arming teachers with guns and putting more police officers in schools. It won’t fully impact the upper class schools that are in the predominantly white neighborhoods like it would impact those schools in lower-income neighborhoods. We will have to deal with it,” said Byfield.","Around the country, students of color are disproportionately disciplined in school compared to their white counterparts. They are more likely to get arrested at school. Now, the Trump administration is considering cutting some of the guidelines designed to protect these students from overly harsh punishment. Obama-era guidance called on schools to be vigilant in reducing discipline disparities, and explore alternatives to expulsions and suspensions. This guidance has been on the chopping block for months, but its rescission has gained new momentum as the Trump administration pushes harsher school punishments as a potential school safety solution.","Up the coast, in Philadelphia, high school senior Kaila Caffey and high school junior Camryn Cobia will be marching this weekend, as members of the youth-led Philadelphia Student Union. Their group has released a list of school safety demands, which includes a divestment in school police officers and protections for students from ICE arrests around schools.","Caffey and Cobia both attend the same diverse magnet school in the city. Caffey hasn’t had negative experiences with cops in her school, and Cobia says she’s only experienced nonviolent instances of implicit bias. But they’ve spent years helping to advocate for the students who haven’t been so lucky. Caffey specifically mentions an incident in which an 8-year-old student was allegedly assaulted by a school police officer in December.","Through the Philadelphia Student Union’s activism, Philadelphia schools now have an official system where students and families can submit complaints about school police officers.","For students like Caffey, Corbia and Byfield, this weekend is a moment to come together, join forces with other activists and make their voices heard. But it’s also an opportunity to teach others about what they already know about the consequences of highly securitized schools.","“In the school, [cops] treat students like its an actual prison. Like they’re not youth,” said Byfield. “Especially with schools with youth of color.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab52fb01f0000260616b4d8.jpeg?ops=crop_0_93_1497_912%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"WORLD NEWS","headline":"Thousands Protest Against Harsh New 'Stop Abortion' Bill In Poland","authors":"","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/poland-abortion-bill_us_5ab532dfe4b0decad049ac20","short_description":"The bill is the latest attempt by the nationalist government and Catholic church to ban most abortions.","date":"2018-03-23"},"articleContent":["WARSAW, March 23 (Reuters) - Thousands of Poles dressed in black protested across the country on Friday against an attempt by the ruling conservatives and the powerful Catholic Church to ban most abortions.","The “Stop Abortion” draft bill, opposed by numerous rights groups, would remove the main legal recourse Polish women have for getting a termination in a country that already has one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the European Union.","“I am against treating woman as an inferior type of human being,” Malgorzata, 58, a psychologist who joined the “Black Friday” protest in Warsaw told Reuters. “I support women’s rights to decide about their bodies and their lives.”","Under current rules, abortion is allowed under in three circumstances - danger to the mother’s health, rape or incest, and when prenatal tests show serious, irreversible damage to the fetus.","The bill, already approved for further debate by the lower chamber of parliament in January and by a parliamentary committee earlier this week, would remove the third category, which currently covers more than 90 percent of legal abortions.","It is the second bid by the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party to tighten abortion rules.

But the possibility of police involvement in the death has also created skepticism among many Brazilians that Rio officials will actually bring Franco’s killers to justice. The bullets that killed Franco were linked to a cache purchased by the federal police in 2006, and militiamen are said to be key suspects in what appeared to be a professional-style killing.","“Given that Marielle’s murder bears all the hallmarks of a targeted assassination,” the letter states, “we call for the creation of an independent commission comprised of prominent and respected national and international human rights and legal experts and tasked with carrying out an independent investigation of the murder of Marielle Franco with the full cooperation of state judicial and police authorities.”","The letter is the latest and loudest call for an independent investigation instead of the probe Rio police are leading, and it comes from a number of prominent celebrities and activists.","Signers of the letter include filmmakers Ava DuVernay and Oliver Stone; actors Danny Glover, Viggo Mortensen, Wagner Moura and Thandie Newton; singer Janelle Monae; model Naomi Campbell; the Rev. Jesse Jackson; linguist and political theorist Noam Chomsky; writer and author Ta-Nehisi Coates; and Black Lives Matter movement co-founders Patrisse Cullors and Opal Tometi.","Rio state representative Marcelo Freixo, one of Franco’s political mentors, and Franco’s sister, Anielle Silva, also added their signatures.","“We call for justice for Marielle Franco and the daughter and the partner she leaves behind, and for an end to the killings and criminalization of activists, government opponents and low-income people in Brazil,” the letter concludes.","Before taking office, Franco had worked on an official investigation into killings by the informal militias, many of which include current or former police officers, that operate across Rio.","In 2016, she won an improbable election to Rio’s city council as a member of the leftist Socialism and Freedom Party, or PSOL. Her victory made her the only black woman on the 51-member council and a powerful voice for Rio’s favela residents ― for whom she was a staunch advocate and defender.","Franco opposed President Michel Temer’s decision to put the military in charge of public security in Rio de Janeiro, and she had recently been appointed to a commission to oversee military intervention. Just days before her murder, she had called attention to the police killings of two young, black Brazilians.","Her sudden murder ― and her status as a black lesbian from the favelas who fought for racial, gender and LGBTQ equality, for an end to police violence, and against Rio and Brazil’s entrenched political establishment ― quickly brought international attention to her cause.","Protests that broke out in Rio and Sao Paulo immediately after her death soon spread to New York, Paris, Buenos Aires, and other cities across Europe and Latin America. In Washington, more than 40 people ― many of them Brazilian expatriates ― staged a vigil outside the White House last week.","On Wednesday evening, they rallied again outside the Brazilian consulate in a joint protest held with activists from D.C.-based civil rights and anti-police violence organizations at their side.","An unseasonable snowstorm had shut down much of Washington for the day and nearly led the activists to postpone the vigil meant to mark the one-week anniversary of Franco’s death.","“But then we thought, ‘Would Marielle stay inside, or would she come outside and fight?’” said Juliana Moraes, from the D.C.-based group Brazilian Expats For Democracy and Social Justice.","So for more than an hour, they chanted and sang in remembrance of Franco and pledged to continue fighting for the causes she believed in.","They drew links, too, between police violence in the United States ― where police killed nearly 1,000 people in 2016 ― and Brazil ― where police killed more than 4,200 people in 2016. In the United States, black people are more than twice as likely as whites to be killed in encounters with police. More than three-quarters of the people killed by Brazil’s police in 2016, meanwhile, were black. The activists noted, too, that in both the U.S. and Brazil, women and LGBTQ people still face disproportionate levels of violence.","The protesters held signs that said “Black Lives Matter in Brazil.” They called for an end to military intervention. They demanded an answer to the question, “Who killed Marielle?”","As darkness fell and temperatures plunged below freezing, the crowd dispersed. Left behind was one sign taped to the door of the Brazilian consulate.","“End the genocide in Rio,” it said."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab4209e1e0000fb077af77d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Justice Department Moves To Ban Bump Stocks","authors":"","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/justice-department-ban-bump-stocks_us_5ab57fc9e4b054d118e2cc4a","short_description":"The announcement comes as hundreds of thousands of Americans are expected to rally nationwide on Saturday for tighter gun laws.","date":"2018-03-23"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Firefighter Killed In Blaze On Set Of Edward Norton-Bruce Willis Film","authors":"Ron Dicker","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/firefighter-killed-in-blaze-on-set-of-edward-norton-bruce-willis-film_us_5ab4d1b5e4b008c9e5f62dcb","short_description":"Firefighter Michael R.

But he said he had decided against a veto because the bill boosts military spending.","“As a matter of national security, I’ve signed this omnibus spending bill,” Trump said.","“There’s a lot of things I’m unhappy about in this bill. There’s a lot of things we should have in the bill,” he added. “I’ll say to Congress, I will never sign another bill like this again. I’ll never do it again. Nobody read it. It’s only hours old.”","The bill provides $1.6 billion for border security measures including secondary fencing, levee fencing, pedestrian fencing and replacement fencing. Yet that amount falls far short of the $25 billion the White House had requested to construct a full wall along the border between the U.S. and Mexico.","Trump once again blamed Democrats for the delay in finding a solution to DACA, an Obama-era program the president chose to end in September.","The package also provides a 2.4 percent pay bump for the military and a 1.9 percent bump for civilian government employees. It allocates $144 billion for Pentagon spending, along with increases for both U.S. Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.","The bill also includes an effort to strengthen the background check process for gun purchases.","The bill landed on Trump’s desk six months after it was due, and around two days after it was first introduced.","Congress passed five continuing resolutions to keep the government funded while Republicans and Democrats negotiated priorities.

Bourbon, to be exact — Jim Beam. And if we’re being honest here, he’ll also admit he’s not entirely sure he would go back and do it again if given the choice, what with the ulcer and tics that came from everything afterward.","“I don’t know what the fuck I was thinking,” he says now. “But also a part of me was like, ‘Fuck this, fuck them, fuck my commander.’”","The blog, Just Another Soldier, had been identified during Hartley’s deployment training as a problem, albeit one that nobody seemed quite sure how to handle. It was 2004, and blogs in general were still a relatively new concept. That service members stationed on the frontlines of the War on Terror were using them to broadcast their own thoughts to the internet was unsettling to more than a few people within the U.S. military apparatus.","“I think we easily forget it was 10 years ago that the government was like: ‘Can we not have the internet? Can we just shut it down?’ Because there were too many questions,” says Lindy Kyzer, who used to work in online media relations for the U.S. Army. “The government is used to having very tight control over its messaging, and it likes to have that control.”","Like many others stationed in Iraq and Afghanistan, Hartley started his blog — or “milblog,” as soldiers’ blogs came to be known — for the purpose of keeping in touch with his loved ones back home. “I just thought it was a really convenient way to keep my friends and family abreast of just kind of what I was up to,” he said. “I never imagined people would actually read it.”","Danjel Bout created the blog 365 and a Wakeup for similar reasons. “It was just a quick way of communicating,” he says.","What Hartley and Bout hadn’t considered when they first created their websites was that Afghanistan and Iraq had become the first true American wars of the internet age. “You don’t really realize, or at least I didn’t at the time, how there was a new paradigm, how when you put something out in the world it can kind of live on its own and reach a far larger audience than you intended,” Bout says.","Military blogs like Hartley’s and Bout’s gave Americans at home a raw and intimate view of the wars.","“Never before has a war been so immediately documented,” wrote military blogger Chris Missick at the time. “It is amazing, and empowering, and yet the question remains, should I as a lower enlisted soldier have such power to express my opinion and broadcast to the world a singular soldier’s point of view?”","Publicly, the Pentagon would state that the military bloggers should have that power, so long as they obeyed a few ground rules for safety purposes. But in Hartley’s case, the reality felt a bit different. And unlike the war on the ground, this was one battle the the military could win.","The military has never been comfortable with the idea of soldiers speaking freely. During World War I and World War II, the military censored letters sent home to loved ones. At the height of the war in Vietnam, an army broadcaster set off a firestorm when he said on-air that he and others who worked for it were “not free to tell the truth.”","Investigations by the military and a congressman found that not to be the case. But in 1988, The Washington Post reported an investigation by Congress’ General Accounting Office (now the Government Accountability Office) found that military commanders were, in fact, inappropriately censoring some divisions of the Defense Department’s Stars & Stripes newspaper ― a complaint that extended into Iraq as well.","The military has often justified censorship by arguing that it is an unfortunate byproduct of operations security, or OPSEC, defined by the Defense Department as “the process by which we protect unclassified information that can be used against us.”","“Wartime censorship is a seldom-mentioned relative of intelligence,” Robert Hanyok, a retired intelligence analyst and historian who used to work with the Department of Defense, wrote in a review that now appears on the CIA’s website. “Operations Security is the primary method of denying a wartime opponent access to official channels of information or intelligence.","“In time of war, controlling public information that an enemy might exploit to undermine the conduct of military operations, strategic policy, or homeland defense, becomes as important as managing official secrets. The current war on terrorism is no different.”","Even before Hartley arrived in Iraq as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom II, his commander had asked him to take the blog down under the guise that he’d violated operations security. He’d blogged throughout his deployment training, while he prepared in Fort Drum in New York and Fort Polk in Louisiana. His writing started to receive more attention than he expected. He says influential political blogger Andrew Sullivan mentioned Just Another Soldier. So did Glenn Reynolds of libertarian blog Instapundit.","Raised Mormon in Utah, Hartley had been living in Manhattan and working as a member of the New York Army National Guard on the morning of the Sept. 11 attacks. He wasn’t particularly political back then, and he wasn’t quite sure why his country decided to invade Iraq, either. “I kinda crossed my fingers and hoped that whoever’s decision it was to do this, they know what they’re doing,” he says.","But, boy, was he excited. “Pretty much all the guys that I was with, we were just stoked,” Hartley says. “The war in Iraq was still a fresh and exciting and interesting thing, you know?” In one blog post before he flew to the Middle East, Harley explained the many different reasons he couldn’t wait to get out there:","Mostly I want to expand my human experience and this is an easy way to experience some of the most extreme limits of mortality. I want to contribute to something bigger and more meaningful than myself. I want to give back to my country. I want to physically contribute something positive to solving a problem rather than acting like I can solve all the world’s problems from my couch. I love the guys I work with and I love the comraderie [sic]. I want money for school. I want to kill someone just so people will shut up and stop asking me if I have.","But Hartley’s writing was not some sort of grandiose idealization of the U.S. Army. It was an irreverent, ironic take on the “foibles of being in the military,” as Hartley put it. “I thought i was writing the Catcher in the Rye of the Iraq War,” he says, a touch of self-deprecation in his voice. He opened up about how boring “soldiering” could be, took photos of himself and his fellow soldiers on the toilet. He wasn’t above the occasional masturbation joke, either.","When Hartley’s commander discovered the blog just a few short weeks before the unit set out for Iraq, he became enraged with the sergeant. But technically, Hartley had every right to blog. A Defense Department spokesperson stated later that year that the Pentagon had ”no specific guidelines on blogging per se” and that soldiers had “every right under the 1st Amendment to say any darn thing they want to say unless they reveal classified information.”","“I don’t think my commander knew what to do,” says Hartley. “He didn’t know what he was allowed to do.”","Certainly, Hartley couldn’t have given away anything too sensitive at that point ― he hadn’t even left U.S. soil yet. But the military leaves what constitutes an operations security violation vague, Hartley says, which means “you can make anything be an OPSEC issue.”","However, he noticed his commander, a lawyer by trade whom he respected and trusted, didn’t command him to take down the blog. He only asked Hartley to do it voluntarily, Hartley says. If you’re asking me, if it’s my choice, Hartley replied, my choice is no.","Only later, when his commander left the room and asked the platoon sergeant and first sergeant to persuade Hartley to take down the blog, did Hartey decide to do so, he says. “As a personal favor,” he adds now.","Without many official rules in place, troops in the early years of the war often turned to “internal policing” like this to regulate internet activity, according to Bout, the author of 365 and a Wakeup. Still today, however, Hartley contends that the root issue was not operations security, which he understood to be a valid concern, but one of tone.","“Leadership hated my writing mostly because I wasn’t toeing the line of glorifying how we could do no wrong,” he says.","Quietly, Hartley continued to post to the blog after his commander confronted him. He simply set it to private and started to disseminate his posts over email. Once in Iraq, he was surprised by how much fun it was to be a soldier. “It was the easiest year of my life,” he says now. “All I had to do was not die. And not fuck up in a majorly bad way.","“Our image of war was Vietnam movies so we were expecting, you know, really horrible shit, and what we got was pretty horrible shit.”","They called it “combat lite.” On his blog, he dedicated time to civilian deaths and burning dogs, Iraqi children and camel spiders, IEDs and the local Starbucks. He photographed rural landscapes, camels, city streets, Iraqi homes and the cheat sheet of Arabic phrases he noticed on a Marine’s weapon. He documented the effects of IED attacks on his unit and paid tribute to dead soldiers. He titled one blog, “All I Ever Needed to Know About Combat I Learned Playing Doom.”","In another, he admitted, “I’m having a hard time being okay with all the dead civilians” and included a photo of the dead and bloodied body of an Iraqi man. (The photo from that post, called “I ❤︎ Dead Civilians,” is shown below.)","WARNING: Graphic image.","But it nagged at Hartley that he wasn’t allowed to publish his thoughts to the internet like other bloggers were, just because he wasn’t the “rah-rah flag-waving” type.","“A lot of these bloggers who got no pushback from nobody ― it’s because they were writing insipid, trite shit,” he says now. “And that’s an insult, because our experiences were anything but insipid and trite. They were profound in a lot of ways ― and interesting and meaningful and they mattered. It’s a disservice to have some flag-waving circle jerk tell our stories.”","Hartley had always had something of a rebellious streak. In high school, he and his girlfriend had been expelled one week before graduation after they created a satirical newspaper, which they slid into lockers throughout the school with the help of some friends. “It was just like silly stuff. Like a horoscope, how to use the word ‘fuck’— it was a bunch of stupid shit,” he says. But even then, it was Hartley’s tone more than his content that didn’t sit well with the authorities — school administrators, in this case. He didn’t care. He hated the school’s attendance policies, how the children were treated like they were “fucking wearing diapers and sucking our thumbs.”","“I don’t know if i necessarily accomplished anything as far as like policy change, but it felt good to kind of give them the finger,” he says now.","As he neared the end of his deployment in Iraq, Hartley started to get that same itch again. One night, after they had had a bit to drink, Hartley’s friend Matt asked him if he was ever going to put the blog back up. He had planned to do so right at the end of his deployment, or right afterward. But he couldn’t shake the annoying feeling that he had been unfairly silenced. “I wasn’t violating OPSEC and I wasn’t smearing the Army,” he later wrote. “These writings were the things I saw and felt. This was my life, and it was something worth sharing.” He put it back up.","Soon after, he found his most recent blog post printed out and placed on his bed with a note on the back: “I need to talk to you ASAP.”","Hartley was in trouble ― much more trouble than he would’ve guessed. He would never go on another mission. Instead, he’d spend the rest of his time in Iraq on “house arrest” as his commander figured out what to do with him. Day after day with nothing to do, Hartley found the situation started to gnaw at him. “That was fucking hell,” he says. “There are not enough adjectives to describe how unpleasant that was.”","Hartley had been prepared for war, but not this, he says. “I didn’t know what was going to happen next. I didn’t know how much trouble I was going to get in.” He didn’t know when he’d be back home either. His anxiety skyrocketed. He couldn’t concentrate. He developed an ulcer and started gagging and coughing regularly.","Hartley explained to an officer assigned to investigate the blog that he had taken great pains to ensure he didn’t put the people around him in danger ― the stories were weeks or months old by the time he sent them out. He didn’t reveal last names; he didn’t reveal companies or locations, he says. It didn’t matter. The officer determined that Hartley had disobeyed an order “to dismantle the website, which contained numerous OPSEC violations by reestablishing his website in the form of a chain email that was readily available to the public,” as explained in a written report reviewed by HuffPost. Additionally, he found Hartley had “committed violations of the Geneva Conventions when he released a picture of an Iraqi detainee.” The officer also took issue with the photo of Hartley on the toilet.","“The investigation has been completed,” a form signed by his company commander later stated. “The investigating officer has made findings of fact that your web log activities at times violated OPSEC, constituted conduct unbecoming of a non-commissioned officer, and constituted disobedience of a direct order from a commissioned officer.”","His commander considered having him court-martialed, Hartley says, but ultimately decided to go the Article 15 route, which would give the commander more power to make sure Hartley was punished. Hartley considered pushing for the court-martial, where he would stand a better chance of being cleared of wrongdoing, but after a month on house arrest, he felt broken.","“I was basically like a prisoner,” he says. “There was no fight left in me.”","By the time he arrived back in Fort Drum for his Article 15 hearing, Hartley decided to just accept his punishment. He took issue with all of the charges against him, but the one that most bothered him was the charge officials ultimately focused on ― that he had supposedly disobeyed an order by continuing to write. “Which was bullshit,” Hartley says. “I was not given a direct order, but that was what I was punished for.” Nevertheless, wanting it to be over, he had already written a sworn statement saying that he had gone too far.","“I wanted to simply keep my friends and family abreast with my activities on this deployment. The more I wrote the more I learned about myself and the more appreciate people were to gain insight on how it felt to be a soldier going into combat,” he wrote in part. “The mistake I made was in an attempt to express my thoughts and experiences as honestly as possible, I wrote about and photographed things that I now realized may not have been appropriate or legal. For this I am remorseful.”","He was fined and demoted. It would take him two years to make his way back to sergeant, he says.","When reached for comment, a spokesperson for the New York Army National Guard said, “It is our policy not to discuss details or provide statements pertaining to alleged adverse actions taken against our soldiers.”","Hartley was not the only military blogger punished during the war. In 2005, Leonard Clark of the Arizona Army National Guard was also demoted and fined for information he posted on his own blog, which had been critical of the war. “They are finally going to put a stop to me,″ he wrote before the blog’s deactivation. The charges reportedly included failing to obey an order and reckless endangerment.","“They managed to muzzle him,” said one of Clark’s friends at the time, who added that Clark “was always careful about what he said and even stated in some of his e-mails that he had to be careful not to violate any operational security.”","Michael Cohen was a major and doctor who was based in Mosul when he shut down his own blog, 67cshdocs. After a suicide bomber killed 22 people in December 2004, he blogged about how the doctors responded to the crisis. Readers were riveted. He hadn’t used names or given specifics about their operations. But he said at the time that he was told, “There are some people in the chain of command who believe there are things in your blog that violate Army regulations.” His sense was that officials felt that the blog revealed too much about their medical capabilities. He was surprised, but shut it down anyway.","There were, however, many other bloggers officials who felt the military supported their writing. A military blogger who went by “Greyhawk” wrote an email to Fox News in 2005 saying he could point to “a few other blogs that could be called ‘anti-war’ [a misnomer — all soldiers are anti-war] that are still cruising along.”","And over the next few years, the number of military bloggers ballooned. In October 2005, Jean-Paul Borda, who started a blog of his own during his National Guard deployment in Afghanistan, launched MilBlogging.com, which aggregated and organized well over a thousand military blogs. The next year, the military blogging community organized its first-ever conference, and the community soon gained one notable fan ― the commander in chief.","″America’s military bloggers are also an important voice for the cause of freedom,” George W. Bush said in a statement that was played at the 2007 MilBlog Conference. “You understand that defeating the terrorists requires us to defeat their ideology of hatred and of death with a more powerful vision, a vision of human liberty.”","But even as military blogs gained notoriety in the public sphere, the military continued to further monitor the practice. Months after Harley was placed on house arrest, the military started to require all bloggers stationed in Iraq to register as such. The army started something called the Army Web Risk Assessment to help monitor the blogs, and commanders were asked to review them as well every quarter. Wired magazine reported that year that the Pentagon also had begun a review “to better understand the overall implications of blogging and other Internet communications in combat zones.”","“We’re fighting a war here, and insurgents read Web pages,” Col. Bill Buckner, a spokesman for the Multi-National Corps-Iraq, said at the time.","In 2006, The Boston Globe reported that the military had created a National Guard unit dedicated to searching out and identifying potential OPSEC violations on the internet. “A mechanism to ensure soldiers are doing their duty makes sense, but overzealous officers will find violations, real or imagined, and punish soldiers,” wrote Jules Crittenden of the Globe. “So much for trusting soldiers to observe OPSEC, much as civilian reporters have been trusted to do under liberal embedding rules.”","In 2007, days before Bush praised the military bloggers, the Army released Regulation 530-1, which updated operations security policies, angering even the more conservative members of the military blogging community.","“No more military bloggers writing about their experiences in the combat zone. This is the best PR the military has ― its most honest voice out of the war zone. And it’s being silenced,” said Matt Burden, a prominent military blogger, at the time.","The U.S. Army’s website currently states that “Soldiers are held to the standards of the Uniform Code of Military Justice and Army Values when using social media, even when off duty.”","“Commenting, posting and linking to material that violates the UCMJ or basic rules of Soldier conduct are prohibited, along with talking negatively about supervisors or releasing sensitive information,” it reads.","In retrospect, military blogging peaked in 2007, according to Ward Carroll, who used to edit Military.com. Bush not only praised military bloggers, but invited some of them to the White House, too. Even still, when Lindy Kyzer joined the U.S. Army’s media relations team near the end of that year, she noticed there was still some trepidation about the bloggers. “The Pentagon really didn’t know how to interact with these folks as communicators at all,” says Kyzer.","But where the Pentagon saw a potential problem, Kyzer saw an opportunity. “Major news outlets, they’re going to cover it every time somebody screws up. You know, they’re not going to show the great everyday stories ― and bloggers were doing that,” she says. “So, for me, this is great messaging that we don’t have to channel, that we don’t have to pay for the ads for ― these are soldiers communicating on our behalf.”","Over time, military bloggers with Hartley’s irreverent tone became harder to find, and the military embraced the remaining ones. But by the end of the 2000s, concern in the war had also started to wane. “Public interest in the war ended,” says Jonn Lilyea, who still blogs at This Ain’t Hell. “There’s just not the interest that there used to be.” Some military bloggers traded in their blogs for other pursuits. Service members started to opt for Facebook posts over blog posts. In a 2011 interview, Kyzer said, “Milbloggers are among the few that actually seem to realize that we’re still at war.”","After Hartley returned to the U.S., he decided he wanted to give it a go as writer. He had received some interest from publishers during his deployment, and signed a deal with HarperCollins once he was back ― complete with a $50,000 advance, he says. “I really had these delusions of grandeur ― how I was going to be, you know, a new big thing,” he says.","In the fall of 2005, Hartley released a book based on his blog. It was called Just Another Soldier: A Year on the Ground in Iraq. To promote it, he started speaking with the media ― a lot of radio, some television, but mostly a lot of talking. He found that journalists wanted to know his thoughts on how the war was going, something he realized he felt unequipped to discuss. “The whole time that we were deployed, I was super not aware of anything that was really going on,” he says. “What you, people in America, heard about Iraq ― you consumed media in a way that I didn’t.”","Never particularly political, Hartley for the first time really started to research the war he had just participated in. “I just kind of had this realization, ‘Holy shit, I think I’ve been a bleeding heart liberal my whole life,’” he says. “I became politically connected to things in a way that I’ve never been.”","He came to regret a lot of the things he wrote on his blog and in his book. Asked for specifics, he says, “Dude, everything, everything ― the whole fucking book.” In particular, he is embarrassed that he wrote that women didn’t belong in the infantry, by some of his descriptions of Iraqi children, by the fact that his country ever entered the war at all. “We should have never invaded Iraq,” he says now. “It’s such an enormous travesty. And what have we gotten? A few thousand dead service members and hundreds of thousands of dead civilians.”","The book was far from the runaway success he and his publisher had hoped. “It sold maybe 10,000 copies,” he says. When he received his advance, he had felt beyond rich. When it ran out, he felt like an idiot. “That number in my head was absolutely no different than a billion,” he says. “I’m like, ‘My money’s never going to run out.’ The money fucking ran out.”","With no money and no real job, he was left humiliated, and he entered a dark period. “I was drunk every night for five years straight. I mean, like, legit, unexaggerated ― every single night, five straight years,” he says. He kept his gig in the New York Army National Guard, and one night he noticed he wasn’t even able to fall asleep during a drill in the woods because he was sober. “That’s when it first started hitting me, like, I might be drinking too much,” he says.","Hartley says more of his friends have committed suicide since the war than were killed during it ― something he attributes to the culture of the military and soldiers inability to discuss their mental health. He himself eventually decided to discuss his own by entering therapy. Admitting that still embarrasses him. But it’s helped. “If you asked my therapist, she’d say yes, I have PTSD,” he says. Hartley struggles with what can be debilitating anxiety. It was something he dealt with as a child a bit, he now realizes, but “Iraq exacerbated it in a lot of ways.” When I ask him which part of his deployment he was talking about, he answers without hesitation, “That last month.”","Hartley, now 44, eventually turned things around. He gave up on writing and moved back into computer programming, which had been an interest of his before the war. He also retired from the New York Army National Guard about five years ago. During his final formation, someone asked if he wanted to say anything to his troops before he left.","“So I kind of thought and I thought: ‘What’s the one thing, what’s my parting message to my troops? What’s my one thing that I want them to know or to have drawn from me and my experiences,’” he says. He thought it over for a minute, then delivered his valediction.","“Whatever it is you choose to do in life,” he told them, “if you aren’t pissing somebody off, what you’re doing is not worthwhile.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab1549b1e000008087af3fe.png?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"This Is What John Bolton Will Be Responsible For As National Security Adviser","authors":"Willa Frej and Matt Ferner","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-bolton-responsibilities-national-security-adviser_us_5ab4c465e4b0decad048cc7a","short_description":"Bolton has a long history of supporting military, rather than diplomatic, answers to foreign policy questions.","date":"2018-03-23"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"So Mooch For That: Anthony Scaramucci's Game-Changing Media Outlet Is A Dud","authors":"Eliot Nelson","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/anthony-scaramucci-post-lance-laifer_us_5ab40a73e4b008c9e5f56754","short_description":"The guy running it is best known as actor Taye Diggs' tireless social media manager.","date":"2018-03-23"},"articleContent":["In October, the media world was put on notice: Anthony Scaramucci, the hedge fund adviser and blink-and-you-missed-it White House communications director, would be launching an organization that would upend the way people got their news.","“The Scaramucci Post is going to be the center lane in a two-way highway,” Scaramucci declared in a metaphor salad posted to his eponymous news outlet’s Twitter feed. “We sort of feel that the pendulum on the clock split and went two ways. One part of the pendulum is sitting way far on the right, and the other part of the pendulum is sitting way far on the left.”","His outlet, Scaramucci said, would serve as the town square for moderate politics and also a platform for solving major issues. “Everything in moderation, including moderation,” he summarized.","If that sounds both ill-focused and wildly ambitious, it’s because it was.","In the months since, the Scaramucci Post has resembled less a game-changing media outlet and more the web footprint of a (mostly) lovable but digitally naive elderly relative. Its website has a scant five entries and hasn’t been updated since November.","Its Twitter account, which is very active, is a manic gumbo of emojis and half-baked attempts at feel-goodery, as if Michael Scott just discovered the emoji keyboard on his phone and was made editor-in-chief of Upworthy.","These are the good days.","On its bad days, the Scaramucci Post’s Twitter account is a perplexing mix of head-scratching gaffes, ill-advised attempts at political reconciliation and the downright offensive, most famously when it tweeted out a poll asking readers how many Jews were killed in the Holocaust.","That poll prompted widespread condemnation, an apology from Scaramucci, the tweet’s removal and then, perplexingly, its re-posting and subsequent rebuke of the “mob-like” criticism it had received.","The Scaramucci Post’s haphazard state raises the question: Was it merely an impulsive grab at publicity to distract from its founder’s turbulent 10-day tenure as White House communications director? Was it a sleight of hand by the man who had just been fired by President Donald Trump over an expletive-laden New Yorker interview in which he compared himself to then-senior strategist Steve Bannon by declaring, “I’m not Steve Bannon, I’m not trying to suck my own cock”?","Lance Laifer, the outlet’s social media manager and Scaramucci’s right-hand man in the venture, disputes the idea that the project is languishing. In an email to HuffPost, he claimed that everything was going to plan. Cultivating the Scaramucci Post’s Twitter account, Laifer said, has been their priority for the last six months and it has been “extremely active and successful.”","You may not know Laifer, but there’s a chance you’ve interacted with him. He’s best known for being the guy who has set the Twitter account of another of his clients, actor Taye Diggs, to follow hundreds of thousands of people, one by one by one. It was a digital undertaking of such herculean proportions that GQ interviewed Laifer about it and Diggs was asked about it during an appearance on “The Today Show.” Diggs said he had retained the services of a “social network dude.” That dude is now running social media for the Scaramucci Post.","As of late March, @ScaramucciPost sported over 24,000 followers, an impressive number, but not necessarily one that can anchor an entire business strategy that, in Laifer’s words, should “generate high returns on assets and equity.” If a Twitter account with followers in the low five figures were a lucrative business enterprise, many reporters would be a lot richer than they are. Taye Diggs, for what it’s worth, has over 650,000 followers.","Laifer, who pivoted from hedge fund manager to his current role as Twitter proselytizer, is not exactly who’d you expect to be championing questionable social media strategies and running a frankly underwhelming Twitter account for a figure most prominently associated with the country’s ultra-nationalist president.","For one thing, Laifer describes himself as “pretty far to the left politically.” He told HuffPost that longtime consumer advocate and former Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader is his favorite politician (Nader has actually written about Laifer’s charitable work). In this context, Laifer said he serves as the Scaramucci Post’s liberal counterweight to its founder’s more conservative politics ― the left pendulum to Scaramucci’s right pendulum, as it were (although Scaramucci supported President Barack Obama’s two campaigns for the White House and originally backed Hillary Clinton’s bid as well).","It’s also worth noting that Laifer is Jewish and has previously commented on using the lessons of the Holocaust to prevent or mitigate other catastrophes. That’s an interesting background for the creator of a tweet poll that seemed to play to the ascendant anti-Semitism and Holocaust denialism of Trump’s alt-right supporters and prompted condemnation from the Anti-Defamation League.","“I posted a Holocaust Awareness Poll because I believe far too many people do not know that more than 35% of the Jewish population was systematically murdered by the Nazis,” Laifer wrote HuffPost. “It is our responsibility to the 6,000,000 Jews ― including members of my family ― who were murdered by the Nazis that we do everything we can to make sure that every generation remembers, understands and internalizes the lessons of the Holocaust.”","What’s perhaps most perplexing about Laifer’s current station is that he has proved to be a far savvier operator than the Scaramucci Post’s rinky-dink Twitter account would suggest. He previously leveraged his connections in the financial world to start Hedge Funds vs. Malaria, which raised millions to combat the disease in developing countries and which The New York Times once described as an “it” charity. From there, he founded World Pneumonia Day, which received the blessing of no less a charitable tastemaker than Times op-ed columnist Nicholas Kristof.","Laifer said he hopes to use the Scaramucci Post to combat the opioid epidemic. To this end, he is marshaling his platform to support the Trump administration’s opioid efforts and trying to make a Scaramucci Post tweet about the epidemic the most retweeted in Twitter’s 12-year history. The Nov. 27 tweet currently has over 7,500 retweets, leaving it somewhat shy of the 3.6 million retweets given to a high school student trying to get free chicken nuggets from Wendy’s.","The likeliest explanation for Scaramucci and Laifer’s half-baked web presence is that they expected to use the endeavor as a flimsy but acceptable reason to keep themselves in front of decision-makers and well-off hedge fund types. Like Laifer and his charities, Scaramucci had made a name for himself and his financial work among high-flying elites. His arrival in the Trump administration was seen as an attempt to bridge the gap between the beleaguered White House and the types of moneyed wonks one finds at the annual conclave in Davos, Switzerland, the Aspen Ideas Festival and other gatherings of the world’s intellectual leisure class.","Laifer said Scaramucci Post-hosted events are in the pipeline. They’re also gearing up to roll out “@moochpost,” a nod to Scaramucci’s nickname, which Laifer said will serve as a hub for cultural news and discussion the way the Scaramucci Post acts as one for politics.","Given that Scaramucci himself recently inked a book deal with Hachette to write The Blue Collar President: How Trump Is Reinventing the Aspirational Working Class and judging from discussions with those in Scaramucci’s orbit, it’s unclear just how much more time or resources he intends to put into the venture.","HuffPost sought comment from Scaramucci, but representatives at his investment firm, SkyBridge Capital, said he was out of the country and unable to speak on the record.","Laura Goldman, a close friend of and ad hoc spokeswoman for Scaramucci as well as a freelance journalist who has previously written for HuffPost, implied that circumstances have prevented him from devoting as much time to his media endeavor as he would have liked.","“Anthony is an American success story as an entrepreneur. With that track record, he started the Scaramucci Post,” Goldman told HuffPost in an email. “He was soon engulfed in many other interviews and projects. Some soon to be announced including a book about President Trump as an entrepreneur.”","Yet it was pretty clear from the get-go that there was no real plan for the Scaramucci Post.","“We have absolutely no idea what the Scaramucci Post is, and neither do you,” Scaramucci told The Hill last October when asked for a concise overview of his new venture. He added, “We’ll have to see how the whole thing unfolds.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab40aa22000007d06eb2b68.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"BLACK VOICES","headline":"Black Teens Affected By Gun Violence Speak Out Ahead Of March For Our Lives","authors":"Sarah Ruiz-Grossman","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/black-teens-speak-out-gun-violence-march-for-our-lives_us_5ab45676e4b008c9e5f5c6fe","short_description":"“Parkland, it was a tragedy. But we have the same situation going on in our hood every day. And we don’t get the same response.”","date":"2018-03-23"},"articleContent":["At a Thursday event on gun violence in Atlanta, young students of color spoke out about how often the issue affects their communities ― and how little the country pays attention.","“Parkland, it was a tragedy,” 18-year-old Shatony Rivers, a senior at Turner Tech High School in Miami’s Liberty City neighborhood, said at the Urban Gun Violence Town Hall. “But we have the same situation going on in our hood every day. And we don’t get the same response from media, officials or government.”","The town hall, which was held at Atlanta’s historic Ebenezer Baptist Church and live-streamed on Facebook, was organized by anti-gun violence groups from across the country as part of a new National Black and Brown Gun Violence Prevention Consortium. Held two days before the March for Our Lives ― a protest organized by student survivors of the high school massacre in Parkland, Florida, last month ― it was meant to “center children of color in gun violence post-Parkland,” according to a release.","Over 100 attendees came from as far New York, California, Illinois and Minnesota, an organizer told HuffPost. A panel of young gun violence activists and students, from communities affected by gun violence in Miami and Chicago, spoke. The teens from Miami had arrived on buses as they headed to the March for Our Lives in Washington, D.C., which will be Saturday.","“I live right down the street from the hood. I hear police sirens every day,” said Rivers. “We don’t have the same response from political leaders.”","In the aftermath of the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High in Parkland ― and the wave of student-led activism that has followed ― some have remarked on the comparatively little attention paid to routine gun homicides in the U.S, which disproportionately affect communities of color, specifically black communities.","“Every day we have enough of our loved ones dying in our communities to equal a mass shooting,” Rev. Michael McBride, director of Live Free, said at the event. “It’s because our communities have been disinvested from. It’s because we’d rather spend more money on police, prisons and jails, rather than schools, jobs and housing.”","Activists and public figures have also noted the overwhelmingly positive public response to the student activists from Parkland ― who attended school in a largely white, relatively affluent Florida suburb ― compared to the frequent vilification of young black activists protesting gun violence.","“Nobody comes to Liberty City unless they want sirens ― that’s not the Miami you see on websites,” 15-year-old Janai Altenor, a student at Miami Norland Senior High School, said at the town hall. “The children who make it out every day, those are our real heroes. Y’all just have to give us the pedestal.”","“We got a voice,” she added. “We could really change the world.”","Georgia state Rep. Erica Thomas (D-Austell) echoed what the students expressed.","“When they’re talking about gun violence, at the end of the day, the most important thing you can say is, ‘If I am old enough to get shot at, then I am old enough to speak out against being shot at,’” Thomas said at the town hall. “Your voice is more important than the voices down at Congress.”","Student activists from Parkland have recently spoken out about the disparity in treatment given to white victims of mass shootings compared with black victims of gun homicides.","“If this happened in a place of a lower socioeconomic status or ... a black community, no matter how well those people spoke, I don’t think the media would cover it the same,” Parkland survivor and activist David Hogg said in a Twitter Q&A earlier this week.","“We have to use our white privilege now to make sure that all of the people that have died as a result of [gun violence] and haven’t been covered the same can now be heard,” Hogg added.","Several of the speakers at Thursday’s event noted how communities of color often lack the investment and resources from policymakers to help prevent gun violence in the first place.","“Chicago had a campaign to put down the guns ― but [they] didn’t talk about what you’re going to pick up,” said Ronnie Mosley, founder of Chicago-based “youth think tank” Millennials Movement. “You put down a gun, but you can’t pick up a job, you can’t pick up a book at your school.”","“Parkland students have this right: The people in office now, their time is up,” he added. “And the people we have to replace them with: It’s us.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab4580c2000002d00eb2bc0.png?cache=5M6lveLoYI&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Teens Call Out The NRA, Gun Makers And Politicians In Powerful New March Promo","authors":"Ed Mazza","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/we-see-you-march-video_us_5ab45401e4b0decad048746e","short_description":"\"We see you.\"","date":"2018-03-23"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"‘Locker Room Talk’: Trump Fans Charged In Anti-Muslim Terror Plot Say It Was Just Bluster","authors":"Ryan J.

The government says the men plotted to bomb an apartment complex in Garden City, Kansas, that housed Somali refugees they called “cockroaches.” The domestic terrorism investigation involved an informant who had infiltrated the so-called Crusaders militia group as well as undercover FBI agents, all of whom are expected to testify at the federal trial now unfolding in Wichita.","Rich Federico, a federal public defender who previously represented Guantanamo detainees as a JAG Corps officer, told the nearly all-white jury on Thursday that the government exploited Allen’s beliefs and his need for companionship. He described Allen as a “very politically conservative man” who viewed the 2016 presidential campaign as critical to the country’s future. Allen, his lawyer said, thought that President Barack Obama would declare martial law if Donald Trump captured the presidency.","“Hatred is not a crime in this country,” Federico told jurors. He called the violent language used by the defendants ― and recorded by the FBI informant ― mere chatter and bluster.","“Locker room talk,” Federico said, echoing the phrase then-candidate Trump used to describe the “Access Hollywood” tape in which he discussed how he could sexually assault women and get away with it because he was famous.","Building a bomb, Federico told the jury, requires money, material and knowledge. “Curtis Allen lacked all three,” he said. “The FBI created and directed all of this. You will see no evidence in this case that was not planned and directed other than by the FBI.”","James Pratt, the attorney representing Stein, said he wouldn’t deny that his client had expressed great hatred for Muslims, especially when he was egged on or faced no pushback. He said Stein was a man who loved his country and his freedoms, which he feared he’d lose through terrorism and an “out of control” government.","But the government, Pratt said, saw Stein’s extreme views as an “opportunity” to create “chargeable offenses,” taking advantage of “chaos news” that had people like Stein believing a civil war was coming.","The country was sharply divided during the 2016 election, Pratt argued, and the media fed into the division by reporting on it non-stop. If you read conservative news, the lawyer said, you thought Hillary Clinton was a criminal, Obama was letting in hordes of Muslim immigrants, and the federal government was coming to get your guns. If you read liberal news, he said, you thought Trump was a racist unqualified to be president who planned to kick out Mexican immigrants and impose a Muslim ban.","“Hate ruled the day and the ratings. Left hating right, right hating left. And it was into this mix that we land,” Pratt said.","“At the end of this trial, chances are that you will not like Patrick Stein,” Pratt told jurors. But he said they would need more than dislike to find him guilty.","Kari Schmidt, the lawyer defending Wright, described him to jurors as a “very lonely man” who returned to southwest Kansas because his father had died and he was looking for new social circles. Wright often had to travel for business, she said, which made it difficult for him to connect with people.","“Gavin was having a hard time making friends,” Schmidt told jurors. “He was very lonely.”","At the beginning of their acquaintance, Wright didn’t care very much for Stein and thought his rants were over the top, Schmidt said. He did like Dan Day, the FBI informant in the case. Wright hosted “bull sessions” at his business where the group would rant and rave and complain, Schmidt said, but it didn’t amount to much.","His lawyer called Wright a bad judge of character. “He talked like them to try to fit in,” Schmidt said.","The government, in their own opening statement, said the defendants did a lot more than talk.","“This wasn’t just words. The defendants took action,” said Risa Berkower, a prosecutor with the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.","Berkower said that the group did extensive research and developed a specific plan, that they actually made explosives, and that they went to a bomb maker they thought could help them out.","“They wanted to slaughter Muslims” in order to send a message that such people were “not welcome in Garden City, not welcome in Kansas, not welcome in America,” she said.","Berkower tried to head off criticisms of Day, the FBI’s paid informant. She described him as a guy who was big on the Second Amendment and thought radical Islamic terrorism was a threat to America. But he wasn’t totally comfortable with a lot of the extremist rhetoric coming from militiamen he encountered. And she said he couldn’t stand the thought of walking away with “the blood of innocents on his hands” when he realized how much flat-out hatred of Muslims some of those he encountered had.","Working as an informant was the hardest, scariest thing Day had ever done, Berkower said, but he agreed to pretend to go along with the plan and record the defendants’ conversations. The prosecutor called Day a “regular Joe” and said that being an informant wasn’t like it looked in the movies. There were no agents waiting outside in a van. Often, she said, it was just Day with a recording device.","“Dan was on his own,” she said.","The trial, expected to last six weeks, will be a test of the federal government’s ability to prosecute people charged in a sting operation that targeted non-Muslim domestic extremists. The tactic has been successfully used against Islamic extremists, but they are easier to prosecute because federal law makes it illegal to give any kind of support to a designated foreign terrorist organization.","Prosecuting domestic terrorists is harder, as the First Amendment protects a wide range of hateful rhetoric, and judges and juries are often more open to constitutional arguments when the defendants aren’t Muslim or otherwise viewed as somehow less than American. The government will have to prove that the defendants’ speech went beyond any First Amendment protections.","The United States lacks a federal statute broadly criminalizing domestic terrorism. The FBI Agents Association has been pushing for a law that would make such cases easier to prosecute.","Ryan Reilly is HuffPost’s senior justice reporter, covering the Justice Department, federal law enforcement, criminal justice and legal affairs.

They’ll be on trial in a quiet federal courthouse in downtown Wichita over the next six weeks.","The federal government says they intended to slaughter Muslim refugees living in an apartment complex in Garden City, Kansas, whom they considered “cockroaches” and a threat to the United States. The trio allegedly planned their attack for the day after the election because they didn’t want to hurt President Donald Trump’s chances of victory.","There were only a handful of African-Americans in the jury pool called to the federal courthouse. Just one black individual, the daughter of refugees from Eritrea, made the final panel of 40 potential jurors. But she was ultimately struck from the jury ― almost certainly by the defense attorneys, who had questioned the woman about whether she could be fair to a group of defendants who thought refugees needed to be exterminated and referred to President Barack Obama as the “nigger in the White House.”","Gebilet, whom HuffPost agreed to identify by her first name only, said in an interview afterward that she considered it a blessing that she had been summoned in the first place.","“The immigrant community here is so small, to even have been selected is an honor,” she said.","She suggested that the defense attorneys probably decided just from her name and her appearance that they didn’t want her as a juror. And she wasn’t surprised by the ultimate makeup of the jury.","“Generally, minorities are not picked,” Gebilet said. “It’s a real shame that that happened,” she said, but she still has faith in the jury process in this case.","The lack of black representation on the jury is especially stark because it adds to the probable dearth of black voices in the courtroom. The judge has ruled that none of the potential victims of the plot will be allowed to testify during the trial, since they only knew about the planned attack because the government told them about it. The apartment complex the trio allegedly targeted is more than 200 miles away, so it’s unlikely many members of that community will be present in the courtroom either.","The final jury, including four alternates, is made up of eight men and eight women. It includes one woman who described herself as half-native American. That group was narrowed down from an initial 600 people who received jury questionnaires. The attorneys on both sides ultimately qualified just over 100 potential jurors after probing them extensively about their views on a wide range of issues over the course of two days.","African-American jurors faced questions about their ability to give three racists a fair trial, especially given the fact that the defendants had repeatedly used the n-word.","“It’s a part of life, it always has been,” one woman, a customer services manager, said of the slur. “It’s something that you have to move past.”","“I’m almost 60 years old, I’ve been hearing that all my life,” said another woman.","Yet another woman said she wouldn’t be able to get past the language and she was dismissed from the panel.","A number of potential jurors were excused for other reasons, including a former deputy sheriff dismissed because his ex-girlfriend used to date one of the defendants, Patrick Stein. Also, a man who said that the allegations made his “blood boil” and that the defendants were “guilty until proven innocent.” A woman who, upon hearing the term “weapon of mass destruction,” thought of her uncle who was killed in the 1995 bombing of the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. A woman who used to live in the apartment complex targeted and got to know the families there.","One man described himself on his jury questionnaire as a “Western chauvinist” and complained about refugees moving into neighborhoods. He said he’d seen a lot of the world and was convinced that America was the best and he didn’t want to live anywhere else.","“I am 100 percent for America all the time,” he told the attorneys. “I’m very unapologetic about it.” He later said he wasn’t offended by those who called another human being a cockroach or a whole group of people an infestation. It was just a way of describing a group of people who have “overrun” an area, he said.","He also objected to labeling Trump’s travel ban as a “Muslim ban.”","“It’s not a Muslim ban, that’s just what they put out there,” he said, but he insisted religion wasn’t really the focus of Trump’s effort. He didn’t make the final jury.","Assistant U.S. Attorney Anthony Mattivi, a Kansas-based prosecutor with a high-and-tight haircut and an affinity for American flag socks, is leading the prosecution of the case alongside two attorneys from the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division based out of the nation’s capital. Mattivi made sure the potential jurors knew he wasn’t an out-of-towner. “My office is in Topeka, and I live in Topeka with my family,” he told one group.","Mattivi also told the jurors that it was his job to make sure the trial was fair. He asked whether there was anyone who believed the government had no role in protecting civil rights. He asked if anyone had been bullied before. He asked them about their views on immigration and whether they thought the government should take religion into account when deciding who was admitted to the U.S. He asked what American values meant to them.","Many of the potential jurors with the most interesting views didn’t make the cut.

But the headlining accessory this time around is a pair of knit gloves with “evil eyes” sewn into the palms.","Krista Suh, who created the Pussyhat Project, spearheaded this initiative for the upcoming gun control march, inspired by the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. Her goal is to collect 438 pairs of gloves, to represent the 438 people killed or injured in school shootings from 2014 through today.","“Individually, to show the eye on the palm, you can put out your hand in a ‘stop’ gesture — as in we must stop gun violence; enough is enough. In a group, you can raise your hands above your head to show the eyes — this is the universal gesture of ‘hands up don’t shoot’ and a reminder of how vulnerable our children are in a country with weak gun control,” Suh’s website reads.","She says it’s in perfect in alignment with women’s issues, a cause she felt passionately about after the 2016 presidential election. “Women’s rights are human rights, and there are a lot of issues specific to women — elder care, health care, and yes, gun control. We are mothers, students, and teachers, so I don’t think that there’s any issue that is off limits for women to advocate for,” she tells Yahoo Lifestyle.","While the meaning behind the “pussy hat” is more easily deconstructed — both a nod to President Trump’s comments about grabbing women and to the cat ears knitted into the headwear — the evil eye gloves are perhaps less obvious in their symbolism.","“The evil eye is the symbol of protection, just like the pussy hat was a symbol of protection for women who went to [Washington] D.C. to march,” Suh explains. “These eyes are meant to show that people are watching — history is watching — what Congress will do next. I think it’s really powerful.”","Of course, not everyone offered glowing endorsements of those pink hats. They were called vulgar, pointless, and gender normative. As of yet, the evil eye gloves haven’t caused as loud a stir, likely because they’ve been a recurring motif in fashion for years. On Fall 2016 runways, for instance, Givenchy and Alexander McQueen both showed collections with evil eyes and the Eye of Horus on garments and accessories. There are entire sections on retailers’ websites devoted to evil eye jewelry.","“If you’re going to talk about the evil eye, you’ve also got to talk about hands,” wrote Racked in 2016. “The hamsa hand may be the most popular — and ancient — protective symbol against the evil eye. An open hand with an eye in the palm, this design has origins in the Babylonian Empire as an emblem of its goddess, Inanna. … Cultures the world over agreed on one thing: This amulet embodied female power.” So maybe those knit gloves do make sense.","As for whether protest fashion encourages “slacktivism” — the idea that throwing on a T-shirt with the slogan of any given cause célèbre replaces measurable political action — Suh, for obvious reasons, isn’t so harsh to those who aren’t ready to run for office but might be ready to knit a pair of gloves.","“Clothing items are symbolic, but they’re also a gateway to larger action,” Suh says. “Also, it’s important to let people know they’re not alone — that they don’t have to work in a vacuum when other people are visible and brave enough to show themselves.”","Read more from Yahoo Lifestyle:","10-year-old drag kid ‘Desmond the Amazing’ stars in major fashion runway show, plus more inclusive moments at NYFW\nA spaceship, a robot, and Irina Shayk in a catsuit: All the details from Philipp Plein’s outer-space vision for NYFW\nFierce and for the people: Christian Siriano presented the best fashion show of NYFW so far","This post was originally published on Yahoo Lifestyle."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab53aa92000002d00eb2d7a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"QUEER VOICES","headline":"High School Student Organizes First Pride Celebration In Mike Pence’s Hometown","authors":"Philip Lewis","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/high-school-student-organizes-first-pride-celebration-in-mike-pences-hometown_us_5ab39cf2e4b008c9e5f4a354","short_description":"“We are so much more than just a small town that he grew up in.\"","date":"2018-03-23"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Trump Threatens To Veto Spending Bill Over Border Wall Funding, Then Signs It","authors":"Marina Fang","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-threatens-veto-of-spending-bill-over-border-wall-funding_us_5ab4f979e4b008c9e5f676aa","short_description":"“I will never sign another bill like this again.”","date":"2018-03-23"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"BLACK VOICES","headline":"Protests Shut Down Sacramento Kings Game, Freeways Over Stephon Clark's Death","authors":"Carla Herreria","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sacramento-protests-stephen-clark_us_5ab44925e4b008c9e5f5c0c0","short_description":"Black Lives Matter activists linked arms and blocked the Golden 1 Center while chanting: \"Stephon Clark!\"","date":"2018-03-23"},"articleContent":["Outraged over the latest police shooting of an unarmed black man, hundreds of protesters flooded the streets of Sacramento, California, on Thursday, even forcing an events center into lockdown minutes before an NBA game.","The daylong demonstration was held in response to Sacramento police officers killing 22-year-old Stephon Clark in his grandparents’ backyard on Sunday night while responding to reports of car break-ins. The Sacramento Police Department said officers believed Clark had advanced toward them while holding a gun, though police only found a cellphone on him after an exhaustive search.","Demonstrators on Thursday first stormed the buildings of Sacramento City Hall before moving out to the streets and marching down Interstate 5, the Sacramento Bee reported. They also gathered in front of the Golden 1 Center and, with linked arms, blocked ticket holders from entering the arena for a game between the Sacramento Kings and the Atlanta Hawks.","Protesters carried signs that demanded justice and criticized police officers for shootings of unarmed people, especially black men.","Some in the crowd carried signs that read, “Stop killing us” and “Black lives matter,” along with other messages demanding justice.","During the game, Sacramento Kings owner and chairman Vivek Ranadivé took to the court and called for everyone in the community to work together to prevent this kind of tragedy from happening again:","At City Hall, protesters chanted, “It’s a phone, not a gun,” according to Ezra David Romero of Sacramento’s Capital Public Radio News.","Protesters also chanted, “Say his name. Stephon Clark!”","Police on Wednesday released footage showing the moments before and after officers shot and killed Clark while responding to reports of car break-ins. The videos were filmed from a sheriff’s helicopter and several body cameras.","While following Clark’s movements, deputies in the helicopter said they witnessed Clark shattering a sliding glass door before he encountered police, according to a department press release.","In aerial footage of the incident, thermal images show Clark running through a yard and hopping a fence. He stops at the home he shares with his two young children and grandparents. It is there that he’s confronted by two police officers.","The body camera footage shows officers running into Clark’s grandparents’ backyard. From around a corner, one officer yells at Clark to show them his hands. Then an officer can be heard yelling “gun,” prompting both officers to open fire.","The officers, who fired 10 rounds each at Clark, said they believed he was holding a gun. The police department also said officers thought Clark was carrying a toolbar used to smash windows.","The only thing officers found on Clark was a cellphone.","After protesters blocked the entrance to Golden 1 Center, the Sacramento Kings were forced to keep the arena’s doors closed to ticket holders.","The game started after a delay, with many seats remaining empty in the arena.","“Due to law enforcement being unable to ensure ticketed fans could safely enter the arena, the arena remains closed and we ask fans outside to travel home,” the Kings said in an official statement. “We will issue further information soon regarding a refund.”","Outside of the Golden 1 Center, some protesters told ABC 10′s Frances Wang that they weren’t sorry for the ticket holders who weren’t able to enter the Kings game, “because as black people, they have been inconvenienced their whole lives,” Wang tweeted.","Stephon’s brother Stevante Clark spoke to the crowds outside of the Kings’ game, saying that the police “killed and murdered” his brother.","“They think we’re animals,” he said. “They’re killing us like animals.”","Stevante Clark encouraged the activists to focus on their community while calling for justice. He also hugged Stephon Clark’s girlfriend and mother of his two children while asking the crowd to chant Stephon’s name.","According to The Sacramento Bee, protesters repeated a chant that is becoming all too familiar in the ongoing fight against police brutality: “Hands up! Don’t shoot!”","In the first three months of 2018, police in the U.S. have killed at least seven unarmed people, according to The Washington Post’s database.

Half a year. Still waiting.","Getting paid can be a job unto itself for contributors to Paste Magazine, a sort of catch-all culture publication, with music and arts coverage mixed in with lefty politics.","“I kept writing and submitting every two weeks, submitting invoices at the end of each month,” former columnist Katie MacBride said. “After a month or so, I started emailing my editors regularly and he would assure me he was looking into it, it was coming, etc.”","Like a lot of websites of its generation that survived into the next, HuffPost very much included, Paste was successful in large part thanks to the work of under- and occasionally uncompensated writers. It was founded in 1998 as a music-focused website, then expanded with a print edition from 2002 to 2010 before reverting back to being solely a web publication. That latter shift created some ripples; as Gawker’s Hamilton Nolan put it at the time, freelancers said they were “having trouble finding out about what will become of their unpaid debts” when the print edition folded. One anonymous writer claimed he or she was owed $2,700, with invoices going back a year and a half.","By the next year, those financial worries seemed over. The site was bought in 2011 by Minnesota businessman William Sagan’s music streaming company, Wolfgang’s, then named Wolfgang’s Vault. Founder Joshua Jackson stayed on as editor-in-chief.","While the site has widened its remit, contributors are asking the same question freelancers were asking eight years ago: Where’s our money? There’s MacBride, for instance. She wrote a column, beginning in April 2016, called “Ask an Addict.” The recovery advice column was published bi-weekly, MacBride said, and she followed instructions on billing, dutifully sending in invoices every month.","But the checks didn’t come.","Despite the lack of compensation, MacBride said that she continued her work because of the platform Paste offered and the promises of payment. “I thought about not writing any more columns until I got paid but I thought (or at least hoped) that my column was helpful to people and I didn’t want to just shut that down,” she said in an email, “especially since I kept getting assurances that I would be paid.”","By July, the magazine had paid her for only two of five invoices, and unpaid work was piling up. MacBride said that after threatening legal action, she was paid in September. Some of the work was backlogged from May.","That’s not how things are supposed to work, per Paste’s writer contract. The language in Annex A-1 clearly states that contractors should expect payment “upon publication,” yet MacBride waited through the summer for her paychecks. Her story is far from unique: Many freelancers from Paste dealt with long wait times on payment, vague promises and a lack of communication from the company in 2017.","The problems are partly due to an expansion in coverage at the magazine. Paste’s politics vertical became popular in late 2016, at the height of the election. Health, business, media — all those sections opened and closed in the last year and a half. Freelance opportunities dried up for writers, and the payment logjam began in earnest for Paste’s army of freelance writers.","I was one of them. Though my issue was resolved — I was compensated for my work, albeit after almost six months — I can relate to the stress of waiting for a check that is frequently promised but never arrives.","“It’s true that we sometimes experienced longer-than-usual delays in making freelancer payments last summer,” editor-in-chief Joshua Jackson said in an email. “But we’ve always lived within the terms and limits of our freelance agreements.”","Jackson added: “We improved our payment system late last year, and I believe we’re as quick as any other publication at getting freelancers paid now.”","Not everyone recalls the delay as just “longer than usual,” however. Marie Myung-Ok Lee, an adjunct professor in Columbia University’s Undergraduate Creative Writing Program, waited almost a year before being paid in late January for work she had done for Paste in the winter and spring of 2017. And it cost her money — her assistant handles the invoices and the frequent follow-ups.","Ultimately it took threats from her agent to force Paste to pay.","“My agent basically called them and calmly threatened or whatever she does and they squirted out the check for ALL MY MONEY in a day,” Lee said in an email.","For Paul Blest, a journalist from North Carolina who is now a writer for Splinter, Paste’s willingness to publish his work at first outweighed the low pay.","“The money wasn’t much but I liked writing for the site so I was fine with it,” Blest told HuffPost.","After months of nonpayment, though, the outlet’s behavior left a sour taste in his mouth. Blest’s story follows a familiar pattern: He wrote pieces for Paste, was promised payment upon invoice and was subject to a long wait period that ended only when he implied he might take action against the company.","“I’m getting DMs and emails from people I don’t even know (who don’t even write for the politics section) asking if I’ve ever gotten paid by Paste because they haven’t gotten paid yet, either,” Blest had written to his editor in an email. “I can imagine at least a few people are considering legal action.”","Yet even when Blest was paid, it was for only three of the four pieces he had written for Paste. He decided to drop it, he told HuffPost, for his own peace of mind. While Blest still isn’t sure why he wasn’t paid for all four pieces, the reason may lie in the way the company handles invoices. They “must be submitted within 30 days of the story being published,” according to a July email from politics editor Shane Ryan to contributors.","“I emailed my editor the day I got my check and said, ‘Hey, this is only for $375, should I put in for another $125?’ and never got a response,” Blest said. “I never followed up because at that point I was over it, and wasn’t going to send like nine emails harassing different people for $125.”","Jackson said that despite the contract’s language stating a 30-day deadline for invoices, the magazine had extended a grace period to a number of freelancers. “Of the more 900 writer invoices we’ve paid in the last six months, there have only been a handful of extremely late examples (a couple of which included stories published more than one year prior to being invoiced) that we’ve refused payment on,” Jackson told HuffPost.","But that’s not the story told by former editors Emily Ray and Mack Hayden. Ray posted a fiery attack on the company’s ownership and editorial and business practices to LinkedIn in late December. Ray claimed that Paste management had stifled creativity and continually denied payment to staffers — especially women.","In fact, when I mentioned to Ray that HuffPost had been contacted by men whom Paste hadn’t paid, she expressed surprise and said she had never heard of any men who’d experienced such treatment.","Ray pursued litigation to pry her payment out of the company, she said, and “agreed to accept half” of the money she was owed “in exchange for striking the gag/nondisclosure terms within Paste’s proposed settlement agreement.”","“Haven’t been paid or heard a word,” Ray told HuffPost in an email on March 20.","Ray wasn’t the only editor to leave the company last year. Hayden, former assistant editor for politics at Paste, was laid off in August. He’d gotten the job after writing for Paste for a number of years, “first in music, then mostly in books, then eventually in politics.”","Once he was brought onto the editorial team, working on a contracting basis, Hayden said, he spent much of his time “fielding pitches, editing pieces, getting them all set to [go] live, etc.” But working as an editor, Hayden told HuffPost, didn’t mean Paste was any more responsive.","“I experienced a lot of the same frustrations as an editor as I did as a freelancer: checks showing up at unspecified dates, sometimes taking close to four months, unresponsive staff on top of that, promises to rectify the situation that proved fruitless,” Hayden said.","Compounding the bad feelings was the fact that Hayden was subject to emails and communications from freelancers on a regular basis complaining about nonpayment — that the money they weren’t being paid was needed for basic necessities. That was “pretty heartbreaking to me,” Hayden said.","“We did raise the issue multiple times to higher-ups, but it seemed like most of the biggest issues were still not repaired by the time I got let go,” said Hayden. “I don’t know what it’s like now.”","According to Hayden, he and Ryan, his immediate superior, raised the issue of nonpayment to management many times, but the accounting department was generally unresponsive to their concerns. Hayden said that editor-in-chief Jackson and news editor Scott Russell were receptive to the feedback — but nothing changed.","“Aloof seems more the case” than Paste intentionally not paying writers, Hayden said.","Whatever the case, the website’s management wields power over those still waiting for their checks. Three people, two of them women, reached out to HuffPost anonymously to share their stories of delays in payment — and, in one case, months of nonpayment. The latter said she wanted to keep her identity secret out of fear that Paste might not pay her at all if she spoke out under her own name.","There may be options for those still awaiting payment from the magazine if Paste continues to delay or refuse payment on invoices. Larry Goldletter of the National Writers Union said his organization has been aware of Paste’s freelance issues since the summer — but no writers have yet come forward to take advantage of the union’s services.","“We know it’s out there,” said Goldletter. “And we can get people paid; it’s a pretty cut-and-dried breach of contract.”","Blest, the North Carolina writer who was paid for three of the four articles in September, recalled an email from Ryan, the politics editor, indicating that the slow payment wasn’t just a glitch in the system; it was simply the way things were done.","“If you’re in a place where you need to be paid quickly for future articles, and it’s going to be a source of stress for you if it doesn’t happen,” wrote Ryan, “I would recommend that you take a break from Paste for a while until I can guarantee you that we have a streamlined system that won’t leave you in the lurch.”","That, said Blest, sums up the problem.","“Paste isn’t making millions, but they’re keeping the lights on due to the pieces we’re writing for them,” he said, “so the least they can do is pay us on time.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab543c11e00003b137af97a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"If The Law Says Scott Walker Has To Call Early Elections, The GOP Will Rewrite It","authors":"Sam Levine","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/scott-walker-special-elections-special-legislative-session_us_5ab55df7e4b008c9e5f73366","short_description":"Wisconsin Republicans announce they'll call a special legislative session to avoid special elections.","date":"2018-03-23"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Amber Rose Takes Down Trolls Who Called Her 5-Year-Old Son 'Gay'","authors":"Jenna Amatulli","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/amber-rose-son-gay-taylor-swift-trolls_us_5ab4ff30e4b008c9e5f68782","short_description":"“Do better for the next generation,\" the model and activist tells haters.","date":"2018-03-23"},"articleContent":["Model Amber Rose angrily answered Instagram trolls who trash-talked her 5-year-old son as “gay” for being an enthusiastic fan of Taylor Swift.","“Shout out out to all the hyper masculine men and ignorant dumb ass women that will call a five-year-old gay for liking Taylor Swift,” Rose wrote in her Instagram story on Wednesday, a day after she posted videos of her son Sebastian delightedly opening a gift from Swift.","“This is why young kids kill themselves.

According to Daryl Hannah, who plays Angelica Turing on the show, viewers will be satisfied with how series creator Lana Wachowski wraps up the story.","“I think Lana did an incredible job writing this and does give some closure to some of the storylines and keeps the message and connectivity in there,” Hannah told HuffPost.","The short-lived sci-fi series, praised for its inclusiveness, follows a group of psychically linked characters from around the world who are being hunted by a mysterious and well-funded multi-government research group.","When Netflix said over the summer that “Sense8” would not be getting another season, fans spoke up all over social media. Shortly afterward, Wachowski announced that “Sense8” would return in the form a finale.","“The passionate letters, the petitions, the collective voice that rose up like the fist of Sun to fight for this show was beyond what anyone was expecting,” she wrote on Twitter, adding, “Improbably, unforeseeably, your love has brought ‘Sense8’ back to life.”","Hannah said she’s glad to see “Sense8” returning, even if it’s just for a one-off finale.

It was a huge, huge undertaking for Lana and for Netflix,” Hannah said. “We had to shoot in 16 different cities ... and countries — Africa, India, everywhere all over the world. I think it was a great experience and it would have been great if would have gone on longer. But it had its moment.”","The two-hour series finale episode is expected to air later this year.","Clarification: Language in this story has been amended to clarify that while Sense8 was recently finishing up work on the finale, the episode was filmed last fall."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab401181f0000280616b30a.jpeg?cache=1mcUh9pcFP&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"COMEDY","headline":"Seth Meyers' Spoof Ad Shows How Teenagers Are Actually Saving The Country","authors":"Lee Moran","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/seth-meyers-teenagers-will-save-us-all_us_5ab4bec6e4b054d118e1aa2d","short_description":"\"Once considered a menace to society, teenagers are now cleaning up the political catastrophe left by older generations.\"","date":"2018-03-23"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Federal Ban On Methadone Vans Seen As Barrier To Treatment","authors":"Stateline, Editorial Partner","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/federal-ban-methadone-vans_us_5ab50dcfe4b0cde6b4f23c65","short_description":"States and treatment companies want to offer methadone clinics on wheels to reach more people with opioid addictions in remote and underserved areas. But the federal government is standing in their way.","date":"2018-03-23"},"articleContent":["By Christine Vestal","From California to Vermont, mobile methadone vans have served people with opioid addiction in rural towns and underserved inner-city neighborhoods for nearly three decades.","But the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, which regulates dispensing of the FDA-approved addiction medicine, has refused to license any new methadone vans since 2007 over concerns about potential diversion of the medication.","Now, in an unrelenting opioid epidemic that is killing more than a hundred Americans every day, some state and local addiction agencies are asking the federal government to lift its moratorium as quickly as possible.","In Seattle and surrounding King County, for example, federal grant money has been set aside to deploy four new mobile methadone vans to provide treatment on demand in addiction hotspots around the city and county. But the project is on hold until the DEA lifts the ban.","“Mobile treatment vans are critical to addressing the opioid epidemic,” said King County behavioral health official Brad Finegood. “As this epidemic grows and changes, concentrations of people who are affected by it can be found in shifting locations within the city and county. If we’re going to be effective, we need to be nimble and bring the medication to them instead of asking everybody to trudge across town to get their daily dose at a fixed facility.”","Joining the chorus of state and local behavioral health agencies is another federal agency, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, which provides grants to King County and other locations to make it easier for people with dangerous opioid addictions to receive treatment with methadone and other evidence-based medications.","According to a spokesperson at SAMHSA, agency officials are urging the DEA to remove the ban.","At a recent New York City gathering of the methadone industry’s professional organization, the American Association for the Treatment of Opioid Dependence, DEA official James Arnold said a proposal for a new set of regulations that would permit new methadone vans to be licensed was months away from completion.","Mark Parrino, who heads the industry group, said no security breach in any of the mobile vans licensed before the moratorium has ever been reported, leading industry experts to question why the ban persists.","Treatment officials in Connecticut, Maryland, New Jersey, New York and Washington state have expressed interest in deploying new methadone vans to fight the epidemic but have been stymied by the DEA moratorium, Parrino said. The most urgent need for mobile methadone, he said, is in Puerto Rico, where Hurricane Maria destroyed much of the territory’s transportation infrastructure and medical facilities last year.","Logistical Constraints","More than 2 million Americans are addicted to opioid painkillers or heroin, but only 1 in 5 is receiving treatment for their disorder, according to SAMHSA. Of those, most are not receiving methadone or one of the two other approved medications considered by addiction specialists to be the standard of care.","That’s partly because many people who use opioids and other drugs are in denial that they have a problem. But among those who decide they need treatment, many report they can’t afford it or are unable to find a program within commuting distance.","Only about a third of all treatment facilities offer all three medications, according to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, and Medicaid and private insurance coverage of the medications varies widely from state to state.","Of the three available medications for opioid addiction, methadone is the oldest, most researched and most widely used. But it is also the most tightly regulated.","Taken daily under supervision as required by federal regulations, methadone is out of reach for many who do not live within a reasonable distance of the nation’s roughly 1,500 methadone dispensing locations. The two newer approved medications — buprenorphine and a time-release form of naltrexone called Vivitrol — can be prescribed by a physician and taken at home.","Similar to patients with other chronic diseases, people addicted to opioids typically respond better to one medication than to another. For many, methadone is the only addiction medicine that successfully reduces drug cravings and wards off relapse. But many people live far away from brick-and-mortar methadone clinics.","Although relapse is common in all types of drug treatment, research indicates that people who take any of the three approved medications have a greater shot at remaining sober compared to those who receive therapies without medication. But to remain in recovery, people with opioid addictions often must stay on what is known as maintenance therapy for years, or for life.","Expanding Treatment","In Washington state, Seattle-based Evergreen Treatment Services, which operates the only methadone van in the state, just received an $11 million grant from SAMHSA, part of which has been set aside to buy four new customized vans for about $200,000 each.","The vans — designed to provide space for counseling, urine drug screens and methadone dispensing — are slated to make daily visits to one or more hard-hit Seattle neighborhoods, as well as the city of Renton in surrounding King County, and two other underserved cities with high addiction rates outside of the county — Olympia and Hoquiam.","According to Evergreen director Molly Carney, Washington state’s substance abuse agency is working with SAMHSA to get DEA permission to purchase and outfit the vans. “We’re told they’re actively working on it,” she said, “but there’s no timeline and no promise of when it will get released.”","In New York, Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo has dedicated millions in state dollars to expanding access to treatment using all three medications — methadone, buprenorphine and naltrexone — and officials at the state’s alcohol and substance abuse agency are talking to the DEA about lifting the ban, a spokesperson said.","According to the agency, mobile addiction treatment and transportation services are a critical part of New York’s strategy to offer treatment to more people with addiction. “Location and access to transportation should never be a barrier for someone to receive the services they need to fight this disease,” said New York’s drug and alcohol commissioner Arlene González-Sánchez.","Working Vans","In Mays Landing, New Jersey, one of a handful of grandfathered methadone vans licensed prior to the DEA’s moratorium is parked outside the Atlantic County Jail and serves as a dispensing clinic for inmates. The program has proven so successful at keeping inmates in recovery from opioid addiction that another methadone program about 80 miles up the coast in Neptune City wants to do the same thing.","According to JSAS HealthCare’s administrative director Margaret Rizzo, incarcerated pregnant women on methadone maintenance who come into the nearby jail in Monmouth County are given daily “guest doses” of the addiction medication while they’re inside because of federal requirements. “But if you’re a male on medication assisted treatment when you come into the same jail, you’re out of luck,” she said.","If the DEA lifts its moratorium on mobile methadone, Rizzo said, her treatment facility plans to buy a van to provide methadone to up to 50 inmates at the county jail.","In 1990, opioid treatment centers in Baltimore and Boston became the first in the nation to expand their urban drug treatment operations by outfitting vans to serve high-demand neighborhoods.","The drug treatment program in Baltimore, the Institutes for Behavior Resources, operated a DEA-licensed van and a backup van to dispense methadone to hundreds of patients for about 10 years, and then purchased new vans and used them for another 10 years before parking the vehicles and letting their licenses expire.","Two years ago, Behavior Resources leased one of those vans to another nonprofit program, the Behavioral Health Leadership Institute, which is using the vehicle to provide buprenorphine instead of methadone. Although the DEA also has authority over buprenorphine, it has not banned licensed prescribers of the medication from working out of a van.","Equipped with a bathroom and private counseling rooms, the van allows Behavioral Health Leadership to offer low-income residents drug screenings, addiction assessments, counseling and pre-paid prescriptions for buprenorphine.","Parked outside the Baltimore Central Booking and Intake Center, the repurposed van recently offered an opportunity for Terrance Washington, 44, to start turning his life around. A heroin user for almost 20 years, he was released from the Baltimore jail in January.","“When I got out, I kept on going right past the van,” Washington said. “But later my friend told me he’d been going for treatment there, so I went back to check it out.”","Washington got counseling, a prescription for buprenorphine, and a makeshift ID to take to a nearby drugstore. Since then, he said, he’s been taking his addiction medication and stopping by the van every few days to talk to a nurse or doctor about his progress.","On a sunny March morning, Washington stepped into the van and shimmied sideways to sit in a tiny counseling booth and talk to the nurse on duty about his recovery.","As he left, Washington said finding the van and getting on medication for his drug cravings has been “a big relief.” Instead of breaking the law to pay for heroin again, he said, it’s allowed him to try to get caught up on his rent and take care of some outstanding legal issues."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab50e732000001811eb2ceb.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Here Are 6 Of John Bolton's Most Belligerent Op-Eds In Recent Years","authors":"Antonia Blumberg","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-bolton-op-eds_us_5ab443fce4b054d118e14d32","short_description":"A taste of what's to come?","date":"2018-03-23"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Alabama To Put Ten Commandments Displays On November Ballot","authors":"Carol Kuruvilla","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/alabama-ten-commandments-ballot_us_5ab506bae4b054d118e22785","short_description":"Nearly 15 years after a federal judge ordered the biblical laws out of a state building, voters may allow them back.","date":"2018-03-23"},"articleContent":["Alabama’s voters will decide in November whether the Ten Commandments can be displayed on state property.","The state’s House of Representatives voted 66-19 on Thursday to advance a ballot provision that would amend Alabama’s constitution to allow the monuments.

They also worry public schools may have to pay attorneys’ fees if they face lawsuits over the displays.","Critics also said the legislation was a part of a GOP push to get conservative voters to the polls during a state election year.","The Alabama chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union claimed the bill did nothing to expand or limit religious freedom protections that are already guaranteed under the First Amendment.","“This is absolutely a waste of the state’s time and potentially money,” Executive Director Randall Marshall said in a statement. “Particularly when Alabama is facing so many other problems like failing public schools and overcrowded prisons.”","Republican supporters of the bill said it is an affirmation of the right to religious liberty.

Berry Forte said it’s not important to display the Ten Commandments, but to live by them.","“The devil can display the Ten Commandments,” Forte told AL.com.","Ten Commandments displays have remained a contentious issue in many states. Last June, a privately funded monument to the biblical laws went up outside the Arkansas State Capitol with the state Legislature’s approval. Less than 24 hours later, a man drove a car into the display.

She wrote, took acting classes, waited tables and seized every available opportunity to perform when she moved to New York. She eventually got a job as an artist in residence at the University of Richmond before moving to Los Angeles to write for TV One’s “Love That Girl.” While in LA, she wrote a web series loosely based on her own life, “First Gen.”","It took nearly a decade of consistent grinding, but Orji finally got her break in October 2016, after auditioning for what’s now one of the biggest shows for black millennials. She’s also toured with Chris Rock and has a forthcoming project with Kevin Hart and Tiffany Haddish.","She shared that the recipe to her success has been preparedness and faith.","“‘Stay ready’ has been like my mantra before ‘Insecure’ and all. A lot of people hustle differently, and I was like, you know what, let me hustle and create and let me have something to show, cuz my hustle led to opportunity,” she shared.","Orji spreads this message in her latest campaign with Colgate Total, in which she advises folks to “stay ready and you don’t have to get ready,” because opportunity is likely to knock when you least expect it.","“For me, staying ready has always been like the preparations, do the behind the scenes or do what you think that’s not sexy that nobody will see, but when they do see it, it’s like, ‘Oh, snap … what she’s doing on her own, we’ll add to that and it’ll blow up.’”","The other side of the formula, Orji’s Christian faith, is what keeps her going when the path to the finish line isn’t always as clear.","“I let [my faith] guide me, because if I try to take the wheel, it’s about to be a mess,” she said. “I can only see what’s in front of me, but God can see what’s behind, what’s ahead of me, what’s beside me, and it just makes it so much easier to release control, cuz at the end of the day, if He brought me to it, He’s gonna have to bring me through it.”","It’s only up for Orji, who’s currently filming Season 3 of “Insecure.” She takes the space she occupies seriously, championing the complexity and diversity of black people that should be celebrated on screen.","“I learned so much about black friendships, black experiences, through the show.

The opening scene, in which the two drive down a country road and almost hit a wild pig, is a clear reference to the beginning of “Get Out.” In fact, the entire episode gives off horror film vibes, but with enough jokes about white people that the satire is evident. Festivalgoers are wearing creepy masks and costumes that you think only white folks would wear, and Van takes a trip into a dark alley alone ― something a lot of black people frequently make known we just don’t do.","In the middle of it all is the matter of Van’s mental and emotional well-being. She has run-ins with her close childhood friend and her man, and then, due to a traditional German “demon thief” at the fasnacht festival in Helen, her iPhone is snatched. As she’s strolling alongside an unnamed bartender during the phone hunt, Van discusses her broken relationship with Earn. “We can be good together, but only when we really have to be,” she says in fluent German. “And I’m slowly figuring out that maybe we don’t have to.” She reveals the true meaning of an episode laced with references to the hostility directed at black people in white spaces: Women everywhere who have put up far too long with an undeserving hostile man should get out of the situation.","In the episode’s climax, Van tells Earn that she wants to be in a committed relationship with someone who treats her with respect. Earn likes things as they are. And, in a move similar to Monica’s in “Love and Basketball,” Van invites Earn to a game of Ping-Pong in which the back-and-forth of their tattered relationship becomes literal. But in a departure from one of the culture’s favorite movies, they’re done if she wins.","On this week’s “Run That Back,” Taryn Finley and Julia Craven discuss how men are trash, white people are trash and black people who uphold anti-blackness are, yup, trash.","The episode begins with Earn performing oral sex on Van before they embark on their trip to an Oktoberfest in Helen, Georgia. On the way there, the two are happily discussing their weekend plans. Van is preparing him for the events ahead. She knows that Earn doesn’t do well in white spaces and she wants to coach him on how to survive. As she’s letting him know what’s up, the pair almost hits a wild pig standing in the middle of the road eating some sort of melon. They joke that it made them hungry because anything can make you hungry when that loud hits.","Taryn: OK, let’s talk about “Atlanta: ‘Get Out’ Edition.”\n","Julia: Good morning to no one else but Vanessa Keefer.\n","Taryn: So I was already a Van stan but this episode really cemented my adoration for her. Van is really the GOAT, not only of this episode but of this entire series. But that first scene tho ... LORDT.\n","Julia: Why on God’s sweet green earth is Earn’s broke ass trying to have another baby?","Taryn: WHO KNEW EARN COULD THROW THAT NECK LIKE THAT? That took me aback but I was here for it.","Julia: I was here for it last night but after watching the entire episode it just made me angry. Like, this is something else Van has to give up. She has to give up good, consistent dick because Earn is a jerk.","Taryn: Yea, that really makes me feel for Van but she deserves sooo much more. Also, did you peep what she said in the car on the way to Helen? Apparently it wasn’t as good as it looked cause she lowkey played him and said he has more “tongue confidence” when he’s high. I died.\n","Julia: fghhnjadnfgfuujghvgh. Aight — the road trip to Helen. Let’s rewind a bit. It reminded me of “Get Out” only instead of a buck it was a wild pig. It’s obviously because they’re about to go into a hostile white space. And weren’t Chris and Rose in bed in the opening of “Get Out,” too?\n","Taryn: Shit, I don’t remember. I just know Rose can kiss my ass and go to hell.\n","Julia:","Taryn: But yea, very much “Get Out” vibes. I’m also pissed that they almost hit the hog before we could get into Van’s high-ass question: Are black girls considered brunettes? I can’t say I haven’t wondered the same thing.\n","Julia: That’s a serious question though! Are we considered brunettes? I guess so but I don’t know. I wanted to hear them figure it out. The streets need answers. I’m still thinking about this lmao. And it the opener really made me think about their safety. I was like, clearly it’s gonna be hostile but how hostile? Are they gonna die? It put me on edge in a good way. It was suspenseful but also, knowing Donald Glover, I was wondering what lesson Van (and we) would learn. And the moral is that Van deserves MUCH BETTER THAN EARN. Such a fucking lame.\n","Taryn: Same thing so many black people have to think about when going into predominantly white spaces. So Van is prepping him on what to expect when they finally make it to Helen, where she grew up. You know it’s about to be some shit because she’s telling him that it’s a tradition for some white man to run around in blackface (which, gtfo) and gives him a taste of how she’s treated in town. She likens herself to the Serena Williams of Helen, which I think is brilliant: a black woman being undeniably great in a white space while still getting criticized because of her race/appearance. She’s saying this while two old white ladies are staring at Earn and Van through a window like they’ve seen a fucking ghost.\n","Julia: YES ― SO MUCH YES! I loved that. With Van, we really do stan a legend. And, even still, she doesn’t seem to be as concerned about how Earn will be treated as she is about how Earn will treat them. She was obviously right because Earn is seriously trash and he refuses to not be.","BUT ― and I’m not caping for Earn. Let me preface this with that statement. I understand how out of place he felt and how Van kinda did leave him to fend for himself a few times. HOWEVER, that doesn’t excuse him shitting on her culture and making a mess of something that makes her happy.","When you love someone, you compromise. My nigga don’t like doing everything I ask of him ― and vice versa ― but if it means a lot to me and it’s within reason, he does it. Making your partner happy is part of being with someone. Period. But Earn cares about only himself and that’s one of his many failings. (Side note: I loved how Van, like Zazie Beetz, the actress who plays her, is also half-German.)","Taryn: The way this episode is formatted is purposeful. We get a more tangible taste of Earn’s perspective and uncomfortableness in the first half because we ALWAYS see the black man’s view before the black woman’s — that’s how it’s always prioritized. We really feel Earn’s discomfort with the woman who comes up and rubs his cheek, thinking he’s in blackface. Then again during hootzkootz when he makes a basket on his first go ’round and everyone’s stunned (he becomes the new Serena Williams at this point). And also when the presumably flirty white guy was speaking in German with Van in his face. We feel his discomfort without realizing that Van has had to grow up and come of age in this discomfort ― which we get into later in the episode.","Earn pulls Van to the side during a dance competition. He wants to play Ping-Pong because he’s uncomfortable and having a tough time meshing into the festivities. Van, however, really wants to dance. She beats him at Ping-Pong and asks to return to the dance floor. This bruises Earn’s ego and sends him into a tirade where he ignores her genuine concerns about their relationship and she always compromising for him before throwing the fact that he pays her bills in her face.","Julia: Now let’s only talk about Van. Because OK, Earn is uncomfortable. Great, I get it. And I don’t care. Fuck him. Van’s interaction with her “friend” Christina BLEW ME.\n","Taryn: I wanted to yoke up Earn’s ol’ fragile-ass masculinity talmbout Paper Boi’s shows are “paying your fucking bills.” Ugh. I wanna fight him. I digress though ― cause Christina can get these hands, too.\n","Julia: Oh we can go into Earn’s masculinity. Let’s address it before we get to #her because I have a lot of thoughts about Earn saying that shit to Van.\n","Taryn: LMAO #her. Get it off your chest, sis. Cause the fact that a game of Love and Ping-Pong got his sensitive ass worked up like that made me hot in the face.","Julia: Earn is homeless and he was living with Van. I get that he pulled her off to the side in hopes to find something familiar — Ping-Pong since “it’s the only white game” he knew. However, after she beats him, he gets real froggy. He starts being really cruel to her. He calls the festival — and her culture — stupid. She lets him know that she deals with his plans and his shit ALL THE TIME! And how she really only wants to spend time with him and be considered his equal — like going to the strip club and Paper Boi’s concerts. But then, this piece of shit is gonna have the AUDACITY to say: “I wouldn’t shit on that. That’s paying your fucking bills.”\n","You’re homeless, Earn. And let us not forgot that he was homeless and using the mother of his child, playing upon her love for him, to get a place to live for next to nothing. He is so so so so so trash. It is insane how horrible of a person Earn is. Then he gets mad at the bartender, a man who showed Van more affection than he ever has and this dude don’t even know her. Earn is pathetic and has such shitty relationships with women. He has no emotional IQ and an odd desire to be perceived as hypermasculine, but he isn’t, so he overcompensates by being cruel to the one person who actually cares about him. But I guess that’s what makes him a black man.","Earn is every shitty man I’ve ever dated so I’m triggered but I also get how Van feels. You put all this emotional labor into a man and this is what you get back. You can’t even get respected and treated like a human. You’re treated like an incubator or, as she so beautifully put it, “an accessory.” And I think that this season we’re gonna see Earn lose Van and his position as Paper Boi’s manager and other things he holds dear to him. And, at the end of it all, ain’t nobody rob Earn. He robbed himself.","Fin. I’m done. Fuck Earn always. Now onto Christina, or #her.","Taryn: Earn robbed himself. Earn robbed Van. I feel like Earn robbed me. Fuck his broke ass forreal.\n","Julia: I’m so mad.","After Van walks away from Earn, she tries to confide in her friend Christina, another half-German, half-black woman. A white couple walks up and Christina immediately brushes Van off to talk to them before introducing her as “Lotte’s mom.” When Van addresses it privately with Christina, she condescendingly explains that it’s OK for her to treat Van that way since Van “chose black” and she “chose white.”\n","Taryn: Christina ain’t a real friend. She caters to anti-blackness and anti-womanhood. You can get a glimpse of that when that when Van is trying to confide in her about her argument with Earn. She pushed her to the side to cater to whatever her white friend and her boyfriend needed. THEN had the audacity to introduce Van as Lotte’s mommy. Then the white guy whose name I don’t care to look up identified her as Earn’s girlfriend. I’m sick at this point because everyone is trying Van by tying her to her relationships as if she hasn’t been a full person with her own identity her entire Black-German ass life. That shit happens to black women so much, yo. I was even more pissed that it came from Christina, your “friend” who you knew most of your damn life. Before motherhood, before Earn.\n","Julia: When Christina said Van “chose black” and that she “chose white,” my initial reaction was “what the fuck is this nigga talking about?” You’re still black, Christina. And you’re right, this happens all the time. Black women are relegated to some sort of secondary role. Our personhood only matters if it’s connected to whiteness, a man or a child that is “well-behaved.” (Yeah, I peeped that from ol’ girl’s white friend.)\n","Taryn: Christina really needs to get her head out her ass. She’s had this delusional view of race her entire life. She’s presumably treated Van like shit her entire life based off their argument. Christina think’s she’s better than Van because she’s aligned herself with white people. What she can’t seem to get through her thick-ass skull is that she’ll never be white. Just because Christina’s boyfriend is white and Earn is black doesn’t mean Van “chose” black and she “chose” white. Girl, get over yourself. Under that heat damage is a similar grade of curly, coily hair that you’ve judged Van for for so long. Your man probably trash too, Christina. Don’t be so fucking judgy. Just loud and wrong. Ugh!\n","Julia: Very strong and wrong. And whyyy did I think about heat damage when Van said Christina straighten her hair? Because that blow out was #laid. So eye know that heat damage is ..... yikeeeeessssssssssss. Or it could be creamy cracked down. Who knows? All I know is Van needs better friends. She doesn’t need a man but my God if she’s gonna have one I want her to have a better one than Earn.","Taryn: “Creamy cracked down!” I’M HOLLERING!\n","Julia: Listen, I have scalp burn PTSD. And we still pretending we not black in 2018? Wow. GET OUT, SIS!","Taryn: And if everything else wasn’t falling apart, Van’s phone goes missing because of the witching-hour ritual that I didn’t totally understand. She’s walking outside among a big group speaking German with the flirty white guy as Earn’s scary ass is in the back smoking with some random guy. I’m not sure if Van knew he was there or not, but Earn, walking around with this stupid ass mask still on his face, knew Van was right in front of him. Idk why he didn’t speak up then. Or even better, follow Van into the dark-ass alley when she went to pee by herself since you wanna be so damn manly all of a sudden.","Julia: His masculinity is contingent upon her needing him and taking care of her. He doesn’t care to actually fix things or be of any true service. He only cares about him, which is pathetic. He showed us that when he said, “This works for me.” Which, how many of us have heard that?!","Woman: I want something real.","Man: That’s valid, but I like just fucking you and using you at my discretion.","Taryn: Whatever, I’m glad she finally found her phone. Of course, he texts her and they meet up back at the Ping-Pong table. For the umpteenth time this episode, I was ready to fight Earn when he initially didn’t have an answer when Van asked him, “What do you want?”","Julia: When he said the question felt like a trap??? I lost it. It’s not a trap! She wants to know where y’all stand and she deserves to!!!","Taryn: Kudos to Van for telling him straight up that she wanted a committed relationship “where I’m valued as a human being and not an accessory you can fuck.” She took so much power back when she said that. Then his sorry ass response was their “arrangement” works for him ... GTFO witcho sorry ass, Earn.","Van was like oh word? BET!","Julia: “We can be good together, but only when we really have to be. And I’m slowly figuring out that maybe we don’t have to” was a BOPPPPP.","Taryn: It really was. She reclaimed her time via a Ping-Pong rematch and whooped his ass (a second time). Van is tired of not being appreciated for the emotional labor she’s been putting into their relationship. Van is every woman who’s ever been with a fuck nigga for way too long, treating him better than his trash ass deserves.","Julia: Her beating him in Ping-Pong was so symbolic of how she is in fact better than him. Earn doesn’t deserve that woman and I’m glad she sees that.","Taryn: Ugh. Van and women like her deserve so much better. They don’t deserve to be constantly tired. I think this time she’s truly over his shit. You could tell because she didn’t take the blunt from him on the car ride back lol. I know it hurts because she has a big heart and cares for Earn, but she sees her value and it’s gonna get her further than ever she would’ve gotten with him. So, this take on “Get Out” was really for underappreciated women with trash ass partners.

Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) had asked the FBI director about the “counterintelligence risk posed to U.S. national security from Chinese students, particularly those in advanced programs in science and mathematics.”","Wray responded by accusing Chinese individuals in academia, from professors to scientists to students, of “taking advantage” of and “exploiting the very open research and development environment” in the U.S.","“One of the things we’re trying to do is view the China threat as not just a whole-of-government threat, but a whole-of-society threat on their end,” Wray said during the hearing. “And I think it’s going to take a whole-of-society response by us.”","Wray’s initial statement had garnered immense criticism from Asian-American civil rights groups, who wrote a letter demanding a meeting with the FBI chief. The coalition of 14 organizations who signed the note described the Chinese community’s anger at being labeled a threat and warned that “well-intentioned public policies might nonetheless lead to troubling issues of potential bias, racial profiling, and wrongful prosecution.”","But in speaking with NBC News, Wray only doubled down on his remarks.","“To be clear, we do not open investigations based on race, or ethnicity, or national origin,” he told the outlet. “But when we open investigations into economic espionage, time and time again, they keep leading back to China.”","He added that both the Chinese government and Chinese companies have been searching for trade secrets and have targeted U.S. companies across industries to acquire them.","While Wray touched on his comments during the interview with NBC, he has yet to respond to the civil rights coalition’s request for a meeting, John C. Yang, president and executive director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice – AAJC told HuffPost. HuffPost reached out to the FBI, but the agency has yet to comment on the status of the meeting.","Yang mentioned that Wray’s rejection of race-based open investigations was a “useful clarification, but it is inadequate.”","Wray’s initial statement suggests that Americans should be concerned about Chinese academics and students, Yang said ― a sentiment he labeled as “inflammatory and offensive.” Given the FBI chief’s concerns, Yang believes Wray should consult Asian-American civil rights groups on how best to conduct investigations of national security threats to ensure the efforts aren’t biased or based on stereotypes.","Stereotypes have reportedly already affected Asians and Asian-Americans in espionage cases. A white paper published by the nonpartisan Chinese-American organization Committee of 100 in June revealed that Asians were more likely to be charged with economic espionage than any other group. They were also found innocent at a rate two times higher than individuals of any other race. But when they were convicted, those with Asian-sounding names were given sentences twice as long than those with Western-sounding names.","Xiaoxing Xi, a Chinese-American professor, sued FBI agents who stormed his house in 2015, rounded up his family at gunpoint and arrested him. Xi was threatened with up to 80 years in prison and a fine of up to $1 million. Though the charges were abruptly dropped with little explanation, the professor had already lost his position as the interim chairman of the physics department at Temple University and was put on administrative leave for a period of time.","Hydrologist Sherry Chen, who’s also Chinese-American, was also prosecuted on espionage-related charges. However, just a week before her March 2015 trial, the case collapsed. A slew of other scientists of Asian descent have been wrongfully accused of espionage-related crimes.","Considering racist policies like the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which put an absolute moratorium on Chinese labor immigration, and the forced incarceration of Japanese-Americans during World War II, the wrongful accusations against Asian-American academics reflect a disturbing tradition, Christina Sinha, who leads the National Security & Civil Rights Program at civil rights organization Asian-Americans Advancing Justice-Asian Law Caucus, previously told HuffPost.","“Since the 1800s, Asians and Asian-Americans have been characterized as inherently disloyal by the U.S. government; that trend continues to this day,” Sinha said. “Our government has been stuck in a pattern of repeatedly scapegoating immigrant communities and treating them as threats to our nation’s security.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab3e9592000002d00eb2b39.jpeg?cache=QkVy3rzIXk&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Federal Lawsuit Against Daily Stormer Publisher Andrew Anglin Moves Forward","authors":"Luke O'Brien","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/federal-lawsuit-against-daily-stormer-publisher-andrew-anglin-moves-forward_us_5ab42758e4b0decad0484c95","short_description":"The Nazi hoped to duck justice. A judge said no. Now Anglin’s world is crumbling.","date":"2018-03-23"},"articleContent":["Andrew Anglin, America’s most notorious neo-Nazi troll, can no longer hide from a lawsuit in Montana after the judge in the case determined on Tuesday that a federal court has jurisdiction in the matter.","U.S. Magistrate Judge Jeremiah Lynch found that sufficient evidence exists that Anglin, the publisher of the neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer, had a legal presence in Ohio last April when the lawsuit was filed, and that his court therefore has the authority to hear the case. Lynch’s recommendation can still be reviewed by a district court judge.","For almost a year, Anglin has been on the lam in an attempt to avoid responsibility for urging his readers to direct a “troll storm” of abuse at Tanya Gersh, a Jewish real estate agent in Whitefish, Montana, who had become embroiled in a feud with the mother of Richard Spencer, a prominent white nationalist. Gersh and her family ultimately received more than 700 threatening and harassing communications. With the help of the Southern Poverty Law Center, she sued Anglin last April for invasion of privacy, intentional infliction of “emotional distress” and violating a Montana anti-intimidation law.","Anglin went into hiding and evaded process servers trying to give him notice of the litigation. On his website and through his lawyer, Marc Randazza, he threw out feints about his location. First, it was Nigeria. Then Russia, the Philippines, Greece and Cambodia. Randazza, who also represents far-right propagandist and smear artist Mike Cernovich, used the misdirection to argue that Anglin had permanently established himself overseas in an undisclosed location and, therefore, existed beyond the reach of the federal courts as a “stateless” person, an unusual legal category that applies to American citizens who live abroad with the intent to remain there indefinitely. For that reason, the lawsuit should be dismissed, Randazza contended.","But he and Anglin offered no real evidence to support this argument. In January, Anglin submitted a sworn declaration that included photos of his passport adorned with tourist visa stamps. He claimed to have worked as a tour guide in Athens without offering any proof. He said he lived in a hotel in Cambodia and bought a motorcycle there. Again, he offered no proof. He stated that he’d left Ohio and the United States in July 2013 “for the last time,” never to return, despite having admitted on his website to being in his hometown of Columbus as recently as February 2017 for a court hearing in another matter.","Lynch on Wednesday found Anglin’s domicile argument unpersuasive and recommended it be denied. The judge described Anglin’s declaration as mostly a “series of subjective statements” that were insufficient to demonstrate, for legal purposes, that Anglin had set himself up abroad permanently.","“Can’t win em all,” Anglin’s lawyer Randazza tweeted late Tuesday night.","The judge also determined that Gersh had presented ample evidence to establish a legal presence for Anglin in Ohio, where the neo-Nazi is registered to vote and maintains a mailing address. Both of Anglin’s active businesses ― Moonbase Holdings, LLC and Daily Stormer — are registered with the Ohio Secretary of State. He collects money in Ohio.","“Mr. Anglin’s travels around the globe do not absolve him of responsibility for the harm he caused in the United States,” said David Dinielli, one of Gersh’s attorneys from the SPLC.","Dinielli added that Gersh’s legal team is seeking to do discovery in the case to ”see if there were additional parties who may have played a role in the planning and implementation of the troll storm against our client” and whether the complaint needs to be amended with the names of other defendants. Gersh’s lawyers want to know, for example, if Richard Spencer had a hand in the harassment.","Anglin’s legal predicament should come into better focus on April 3 during a hearing in Missoula on a second argument Anglin put forward in his motion to dismiss Gersh’s suit. That argument asserts that the case should be tossed on First Amendment grounds. Essentially, Anglin is arguing that anything he writes on a website that stops short of “fighting words,” a true threat or incitement ― even when his intent might be to incite an online mob to cyberbully a target ― is protected speech.","A serial harasser and slanderer, Anglin has advocated violence against minorities, women, journalists and other groups. Last week, he bragged on The Daily Stormer about his influence on Dylann Roof, who killed nine people in a Charleston, South Carolina, church in 2015.","Lynch’s determination this week is just one of several developments that puts Anglin in an increasingly precarious position, both legally and personally.","In the past months, Anglin has lost support in the “alt-right” white supremacist movement, for which he has served as an important ringleader and its chief propagandist. His writings about beating and caging women revolt even deeply misogynistic members of the white power scene.","A keyboard warrior, Anglin has also alienated alt-right extremists who endorse real-world activism. This rift widened after anti-fascists delivered a humiliating beatdown to the Traditionalist Worker Party, a prominent neo-Nazi group, in Lansing, Michigan, in early March, prompting Anglin to slam the organizers for being ineffective. They fiercely attacked him back, accusing him of being a “race-mixer” who targets young girls for sex and is too cowardly to show his face at far-right rallies.","On Gab, a far-right social media platform popular with racists and fascists, alt-right members tore into Anglin.","Anglin even caught flak on his own website’s forum and had to ban several mouthy dissenters. It was an embarrassing twist of fate for a troll whose sense of self-worth has long depended on how many racist simpletons he can delude.","Meanwhile, Anglin’s old foes have only drawn closer. Jeff Cremeans, a process server hired by the SPLC to find Anglin in Columbus, is still on the hunt and told HuffPost that his colleagues around the country have called to offer assistance.","“We all stick together, we’re all in this together,” Cremeans said. “When they heard about my situation, they said if you ever need help, send us the papers and we’ll get him for you. I’ve got complete backing not just locally but nationally.”","What might that mean for Anglin?","“I think he becomes even more paranoid, if that’s even possible,” Cremeans said.","Do you have information on the whereabouts of Anglin?

Since the mummy had 10 pairs of ribs instead of 12 and an elongated head, some believed it could be an alien.","But DNA tests confirmed that the skeleton, nicknamed “Ata” as it was discovered in Chile’s Atacama Desert in 2003, was human.","“I had heard about this specimen through a friend of mine, and I managed to get a picture of it,” Garry Nolan, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Stanford University, said in a news release. “You can’t look at this specimen and not think it’s interesting; it’s quite dramatic.”","The analysis by Nolan and a team of other researchers confirmed that the skeleton was not an alien, nor a non-human primate as some had speculated. It was the fetus of a girl who had suffered from a host of severe genetic mutations. Some of those mutations had never been linked to bone or developmental problems.","Nolan told the Guardian that Ata was either stillborn or died right after birth.","“She was so badly malformed as to be unable to feed,” he said. “In her condition, she would have ended up in the neonatal ICU, but given where the specimen was found, such things were simply not available.”","The tests also showed that the remains weren’t ancient, as some had theorized, but only about 40 years old.","Nolan said:","“While this started as a story about aliens, and went international, it’s really a story of a human tragedy. A woman had a malformed baby, it was preserved in a manner and then ‘hocked’ or sold as a strange artefact. It turns out to be human, with a fascinating genetic story from which we might learn something important to help others.

He grudgingly signed it anyway.","date":"2018-03-23"},"articleContent":["WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump on Friday signed a government spending bill that fails to fund his long-promised border wall, notwithstanding a threat just hours earlier to veto the legislation.","“As a matter of national security I’ve signed this omnibus budget bill. There are a lot of things I’m unhappy about in this bill,” the president said in a rambling, 20-minute explanation of why he approved the spending plan despite his misgivings. “I say to Congress: I will never sign another bill like this again.”","Trump’s explanation, though, may not be enough to mollify his base of supporters, many of whom expected Trump to follow through on his often-repeated promise of a border wall.","“This will crush the spirit of ‘the deplorables,’ as this is exactly what they voted against,” said one Republican adviser close to Trump who spoke on the condition of anonymity.","Earlier Friday, Trump said he was considering a veto because of the lack of wall money, as well as the failure to fix the DACA immigration program ― even though his own White House last month sabotaged legislation accomplishing precisely those two items.","The veto threat of the $1.3 trillion spending bill came after fierce lobbying from a group of conservative House members, which included a pointed accusation that House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) had lied to Trump about how much money was included for his wall along the Mexican border, according to the Republican adviser.","Key members of the House Freedom Caucus, including Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), began urging Trump to veto the bill almost immediately after Ryan returned from a White House visit on Wednesday to win Trump’s support for the spending plan, the Republican adviser said.","That plan wound up clearing both chambers Thursday. Had Trump failed to sign the measure, the government would have run out of spending authority and partially shut down at midnight Friday.","Meadows declined to comment.","Freedom Caucus members explained to Trump that the spending plan does not actually allocate money to start construction of a modern wall along any stretch of the border that does not already have some form of barrier, the adviser said. Rather, it includes $641 million to build levees and fencing for 33 miles that currently lack a barrier.","What doubts that Freedom Caucus members planted in Trump’s mind, the adviser said, Fox News nurtured to fuition, with highly critical Thursday night programming about the spending deal.","“There’s a 50-50 shot he vetoes this,” the adviser predicted earlier Friday.","Trump’s veto threat came in a Twitter statement issued at 8:55 a.m. “I am considering a VETO of the Omnibus Spending Bill based on the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded,” he wrote.","Yet those demands would have been met in a bipartisan proposal that received 54 votes on the Senate floor last month – six short of the threshold needed to proceed. That came after a furious lobbying effort against the proposal by Trump’s White House, including an extraordinary conference call in which a senior administration official attacked South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham by name.","“He has been an obstacle to immigration reform. He has been an obstacle in the way of getting relief for Dreamers,” said the official, who spoke on the condition he not be identified.","Trump’s Department of Homeland Security put out a similarly strident statement opposing the plan: “The changes proposed by Senators Schumer-Rounds-Collins would effectively make the United States a Sanctuary Nation where ignoring the rule of law is encouraged.”","“Dreamers” is the colloquial term for undocumented immigrants who were brought into this country as children. About 700,000 received work permits and formal reprieves from deportation under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program during former President Barack Obama’s administration. Trump rescinded the program in September.","Under the proposal sponsored by senators, including Republicans Mike Rounds of South Dakota and Susan Collins of Maine, as well as Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, the DACA-eligible population would have been allowed to stay permanently and be given a lengthy path toward eventual citizenship. In exchange, Trump would have been given the authorization to build his wall in full.","The White House instead pushed its own plan, which included the DACA fix and wall funding, but also limits on legal immigration and asylum seekers. That proposal received only 39 votes in the Senate – the fewest of any of the competing plans voted on that day.","Ali Noorani, executive director of the pro-reform group National Immigration Forum, said he believes the Rounds-King bill would have succeeded with 60 votes had the White House not come out against it.","“There is a deal that includes the protection of Dreamers and the protection of our border if the president is serious,” Noorani said. “Up to this point, he’s missed every opportunity to take that deal.”","Democratic lawmakers offered Trump that same swap in recent days: $25 billion for his border wall in exchange for a path to citizenship for 1.8 million DACA-eligible undocumented immigrants.","“The White House proposal gave them everything they asked for while leaving Dreamers in limbo,” a senior Democratic aide said. “Our counteroffer lined up perfectly with what the president had proposed, but of course, he said no to his own deal. Again.”","Trump’s Friday morning veto threat came less than 24 hours after top White House officials said definitively that Trump would sign the spending plan when it reached his desk. “Let’s cut right to the chase: Is the president to sign the bill? The answer is yes,” budget director Mick Mulvaney said Thursday.","And those assurances of Trump approval came the day after Ryan trekked through a snowstorm to explain to Trump why he should sign the spending bill. The meeting took place in the White House residence and included Vice President Mike Pence. Ryan told Trump this was the best deal he was likely to get, and emphasized the large increase in military spending that Trump had sought and could claim as a victory, according to an official familiar with the meeting.","Ryan apparently succeeded in his sales pitch. Trump signaled support for the plan in a Twitter statement at 11 p.m. that night: “Got $1.6 Billion to start Wall on Southern Border, rest will be forthcoming. Most importantly, got $700 Billion to rebuild our Military, $716 Billion next year...most ever. Had to waste money on Dem giveaways in order to take care of military pay increase and new equipment.”","In the end it was the increase in military spending that Trump cited Friday, too. “My highest duty is to keep America safe. Nothing more important,” he said, adding that he had “very seriously” considered vetoing the measure.","Trump has spoken about his “great wall” on the Mexican border since his campaign announcement speech at Trump Tower in June 2015. For the 17 months of his campaign, Trump promised many hundreds of times that he would build a 30-foot-tall wall to keep out illegal immigrants.","Trump also promised that the wall would be built at no cost to U.S. taxpayers, and that he would force Mexico to foot the bill. “Mark my words,” he said during his announcement speech.","That promise, however, has proven elusive. A planned meeting between Trump and Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto was recently canceled because Peña Nieto would not back away from his refusal to pay.","Matt Fuller contributed reporting.","This article has been updated to note that Trump signed the legislation."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab521c71e00008e0b7af900.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Emma Gonzalez: 'One Of The Biggest Threats' To Teens Today 'Is Being Shot'","authors":"Alanna Vagianos","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/emma-gonzalez-teen-vogue-essay_us_5ab500c6e4b054d118e21933","short_description":"The Parkland shooting survivor wrote an essay for Teen Vogue ahead of the March for Our Lives protest.","date":"2018-03-23"},"articleContent":["Emma Gonzalez is not budging in her fight against gun violence.","Gonzalez, 18, has become one of America’s most prominent advocates for gun control since a shooter opened fire in her high school in Parkland, Florida, on Valentine’s Day, killing 17 people. This Friday, a day before the scheduled March for Our Lives protest for stronger gun laws, Gonzalez published a powerful essay at Teen Vogue laying out what needs to happen for U.S. gun violence to end.","“Any way you cut it, one of the biggest threats to life as a teen in the U.S. today is being shot,” Gonzalez wrote. “People have been shot to death en masse in grocery stores, movie theaters, nightclubs, and libraries, on school campuses and front porches, and at concerts ― anywhere and everywhere, regardless of socioeconomic background, skin color, age, ethnicity, religion, gender, geographical location.”","Gonzalez is right. Guns are the third leading cause of child deaths in the U.S., according to a June 2017 analysis published in Pediatrics, a medical journal. Every day, an average of 19 children are treated in emergency rooms or die from gunshot wounds around the country. Gun violence affects boys more heavily than girls, teens more heavily than younger children, and black children more heavily than children of any other race.","In her essay for Teen Vogue, Gonzalez notes that school shootings have happened regularly all her life ― the Columbine High School shooting in April 1999 was only a few months before she was born. Cameron Kasky, another Parkland survivor turned student activist, recently described himself and his fellow teens as “the mass shooting generation.”","“After all of this pain and all of this death caused by gun violence, it seems as if the kids are the only ones who still have the energy to make this change,” Gonzalez wrote. “Fed up with the apathy pervading this country, we realized that we don’t need to wait around to have our voices heard or for someone else to make a change — we have to be the change we need to see.”","Gonzalez broke down what needs to happen if our country is to combat gun violence: More companies need to cut ties with the National Rifle Association, gun sale records need to be digitized to make them more accessible, universal background checks need to be implemented, and high-capacity magazines need to be outlawed.","She also cast a skeptical eye on President Donald Trump’s claims that arming teachers would prevent future school shootings.","“This doesn’t make any rational or logical sense,” Gonzalez wrote. “How would arming teachers work, logistically?”","She went on:","Would they have to buy their own guns, or would there be armories in schools? Would students be able to break into armories?\n\nWhile teaching, would a teacher keep their weapon on their person or in a lock box?\n\nIf it was in a lock box on the other side of the room when a threatening person walked in, would the teacher be able to get to their gun in time?\n\nIf the threat and the teacher were in close proximity, would the threat not be able to disarm the teacher and turn the pistol on them and in turn the students?\n\n... And since there was a resource or police officer on campus to help protect students and teachers, why didn’t that stop 17 people from getting killed and 15 from getting injured on February 14?","Gonzalez is one of several Marjory Stoneman Douglas students who have been pushing for gun law reform since the massacre. Their social media campaign, #NeverAgain, has galvanized a movement and garnered support from public figures like Oprah Winfrey, Steven Spielberg and George Clooney.","The teens organized a 17-minute walkout at high schools across the country this month, and even pressured Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) to enact the state’s first gun control measure in over two decades.\n\nHead over to Teen Vogue to read Gonzalez’s full essay."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab501ad1f00002d0016b43c.jpeg?cache=UD4JAGWbOS&ops=crop_0_410_3120_2079%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"TRAVEL","headline":"The Most Popular Destinations In The World, According To TripAdvisor","authors":"Amanda Pena","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tripadvisor-most-popular-destinations-2018_us_5ab3f3c9e4b0decad047fd83","short_description":"And where to stay in these spots when you visit.","date":"2018-03-23"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"73 Teens Shot To Death In The 37 Days Since The Parkland Massacre","authors":"Nick Wing","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/teens-killed-since-parkland_us_5ab54cd5e4b0decad049d34c","short_description":"As young people around the world rally against gun violence, this should serve as a reminder that the problem affects them far beyond school shootings.","date":"2018-03-23"},"articleContent":["Life was only just beginning for Daekwon Tobar. At 17, the South Bend, Indiana, teen was starting to figure out some of the keys to success in the adult world: good eye contact, a firm handshake and a confident tone of voice.","Daekwon was still in school, but he wanted to be a welder when he completed his education, his family said. With a mentor teaching him how to write a cover letter and fill out a résumé to help him stand out from the pack, people who knew Daekwon had high hopes for a young man coming into his own.","But on Feb. 17, Daekwon was gunned down in broad daylight as he walked home from the store with his grandmother. He suffered gunshot wounds to the leg, hip and head.","Daekwon was one of three 17-year-olds who have been fatally shot in South Bend this year. A fourth teenager, just 13 years old, was also killed in the city in late December.","“A lot of people are just a hair-trigger away from snapping, I really think, and if you happen to have a gun in your hand, you can’t put that bullet back in once it leaves,” said Michael Elliott, organizer of South Bend’s On Site Prayer Ministry, in an interview with WNDU at a recent vigil for Daekwon.","Daekwon’s story is painfully familiar not just in South Bend but in many places across a nation that is publicly grappling with the effects of gun violence following the Feb. 14 school shooting in Parkland, Florida.","At least 73 teens have been shot to death in the 37 days since that massacre, according to HuffPost’s review of a database compiled by Gun Violence Archive, a not-for-profit organization that tracks shootings across the country. (Because Gun Violence Archive culls its data from media reports, there may be cases that haven’t been included.)","That’s a rate of nearly two teens each day. Among them were Kaiden Vague, a California student who died on his 16th birthday after accidentally killing himself at a shooting range, and 15-year-old Jay Diaz in El Paso, Texas, who survived a childhood fight with cancer only to be killed when a family member fired his shotgun while cleaning it.","The deaths include Eileen Viveros-Vargas, a pregnant 18-year-old allegedly killed by her boyfriend in Minnesota; Courtlin Arrington, a 17-year-old fatally shot at her high school by a fellow student; Christopher Ruckman, a 14-year-old slain by his father, who also shot his 12-year-old brother in what police say was a double murder-suicide; An unnamed 17-year-old who took his own life in the bathroom of a Missouri high school.","There are too many incidents to document each of them here, but the dozens of cases are disproportionately centered in urban areas. They include teens gunned down by other teens or slain by parents or relatives, young people killed in public and at home, in murders, accidents and suicides. The tally doesn’t include victims younger than 13, nor does it count any of the many teens who suffered only gunshot injuries over that period.","The slaughter of 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School has sparked a national awakening on gun violence. But as throngs of young people prepare to gather in Washington, D.C., and cities across the world on Saturday for the March for Our Lives, the nascent youth-led movement still seems to be figuring out how best to communicate the breadth of the issue. Each of these lives cut short is a reminder of the relentlessness of gun violence in America.","Much of the conversation around guns has focused on school safety and attacks carried out with military-style semiautomatic rifles, such as the AR-15 used at Stoneman Douglas. Those may be the most pressing concerns in well-to-do suburban communities like Parkland, but in communities of color, and specifically in black communities, gun violence is more of an everyday reality.","The Parkland students have themselves sought to use their platform to remind the nation that this bloodshed extends far beyond the sort of tragic mass shooting that they experienced, and which reliably attracts the national spotlight.","The Stoneman Douglas survivors who have become the face of the “Never Again” movement met with students from Chicago schools this month to discuss ways to address the shootings that tear through neighborhoods on a routine basis. And earlier this week, they criticized the media for the “racial disparity” in its coverage of gun violence, which serves to silence victims from less affluent communities and from communities of color.","“We have to use our white privilege now to make sure that all of the people that have died as a result of [gun violence] and haven’t been covered the same can now be heard,” said David Hogg, a Stoneman Douglas senior.","As this movement evolves beyond the marches, rallies and media appearances and into more concrete advocacy, it will be on young leaders like Hogg to make sure that it encompasses the voices and experiences of people like Daekwon Tobar as well."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab5715c1e000008087af9b5.jpeg?cache=yVY3RdVSuZ&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Hawaii Democrat Resigns In Response To Sexual Harassment Claims He Still Denies","authors":"Carla Herreria","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hawaii-joe-souki-resign-sexual-harassment_us_5ab2e77ce4b054d118df7c82","short_description":"State Rep.

At least two other women have filed complaints against Souki, according to Honolulu Civil Beat, but they declined to comment to the news site because they said they feared retaliation.","Wong has told the Star-Advertiser that Souki’s actions made her “unable to do my job,” but she has refused to reveal further details to the media.","“There were constraints after that experience where I could no longer do my job,” she added, “which means paying visits to, speaking with, the key people involved in government.”","While Souki has agreed to resign as part of the State Ethics Commission agreement, he continues to deny that he intentionally misbehaved and maintains that his actions were simply “misunderstood.”","In his official resignation statement, Souki said, “I have absolutely no memory of ever acting inappropriately with any women at any time, as a member of the House or in a private setting.”","“I am greatly saddened that something I did was misunderstood and believed to be inappropriate conduct,” he added.","In a February interview with the Star-Advertiser, Souki’s attorney Michael Green said Wong was accusing Souki of acting inappropriately during a meeting with the speaker and another representative three years ago. “She just decided now three years later that that must have been sexual harassment? It’s nuts,” Green told the paper.","During that interview, Green also said that Wong is claiming that Souki stood up and “adjusted his pants.”","“I don’t see anything she said that would rise to the level of sexual harassment in normal conversation,” Green told the Star-Advertiser. “I mean, today it’s kind of crazy. You can’t say anything to anyone.”","Speaking to reporters during a Wednesday news conference, Souki appeared to recall the meeting Green was referring to during the February interview. Souki then insisted that he merely stood up and gave Wong a customary aloha kiss after she told him she was retiring and leaving the state.","During that same conference, Green said all the accusations made against him were made three to eight years ago.","The State Ethics Commission said in its report that Souki’s power “over legislation and budgeting questions” as House speaker made his accusers hesitant to come forward. At the time of the incident, the commission said, Wong led a state department that had a budget of $3.3 billion.","“Challenging then-Speaker Souki’s conduct could have jeopardized her agency’s budget and legislation,” the commission’s report read. “She, like others, felt she had no choice but to remain silent in the face of Respondent Souki’s behavior.”","As part of the state agreement, Souki was required to issue a public apology, pay a penalty of $5,000 and not seek or accept any public office for two years."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab32e321f0000260616b1a6.png?cache=ocPqiGZ7rg&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"CRIME","headline":"Police Struggle To Find Possible Motives For Austin Bombings","authors":"Willa Frej","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/police-struggle-to-find-possible-motives-for-austin-bombings_us_5ab37a2ae4b0decad046ea54","short_description":"Mark Anthony Conditt, the suspected bomber who died in a police confrontation Wednesday, didn't drop many hints about his intentions.","date":"2018-03-22"},"articleContent":["Authorities have found frustratingly few leads to uncover why Mark Anthony Conditt, 23, was compelled to plant seven homemade bombs around the Austin area that killed two people in recent weeks.","The FBI and police wasted no time going through Conditt’s home and interviewing his roommates and relatives, following a confrontation with police early Wednesday that left Conditt dead in his car.

But his description of its contents didn’t provide any clues.","“He does not at all mention anything about terrorism, nor does he mention anything about hate,” Manley said. “This is an outcry by a very challenged young man.”","Authorities tend to shy away from linking acts of mass violence perpetrated by white non-Muslim men to terrorism because the U.S. has no federal law criminalizing acts of domestic terrorism.","“Call it what it is. If you have an incident that takes place, and the person uses a firearm, a car, a knife ― if that crime of force or violence is done to forward a social or political agenda, then that person fits the elements of domestic terrorism,” urged Thomas O’Connor, head of the FBI Agents Association, in an interview with HuffPost.","Conditt’s family was reportedly blindsided by his actions as well.","“We had no idea of the darkness that Mark must have been in. Our family is a normal family in every way,” an aunt, Shanee, told CNN in a statement. She last saw her nephew over Christmas, she said, which she described as “wonderful.”","“We played cards. We laughed, we went to shows together,” she said.","His grandmother, Mary Conditt, echoed the shock, characterizing him in an interview with Fox 31 as “a great kid” who was “smart, loving, kind.”","“I have no idea who this person is,” she said. “He’s from a family that is so tight, that works so hard to raise their children correctly. It’s just horrible.”","Neighbors said they saw no red flags either, besides remembering him as quiet and slightly standoffish.","“It just makes no sense whatsoever, he was a nice kid,” neighbor Jeff Reeb, 75, told HuffPost Wednesday. “He was quiet, sure, and young.

But critics say the rest of the rule is still bad for workers.","date":"2018-03-22"},"articleContent":["WASHINGTON ― Tucked into the $1.3 trillion spending bill unveiled by congressional leaders Wednesday night is a provision designed to prevent restaurants from pocketing their servers’ tips.","The measure inserted by Democrats would put some limits on the regulatory changes being pursued by the Labor Department under President Donald Trump. The department has tried to reform wage regulations so that employers can require tipped workers to “pool” gratuities and share them with other non-tipped workers, like cooks and dishwashers, under certain circumstances.","But the way Trump’s Labor Department rewrote the rules, there would be nothing to legally prevent the employer from keeping some or all of the tips, so long as the tipped worker earned the full minimum wage before gratuities. That prospect made the proposal extremely contentious in Washington, and highly unpopular among those who submitted public comments on it.","The provision included in the tentative spending deal would make such “tip theft” illegal. Democrats hailed it as a victory for the local bartender. Congress, however, still needs to pass the bill by Friday night in order to avoid a government shutdown.","Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), ranking member of the Senate’s labor committee, said she worked on the change with Trump’s labor secretary, Alexander Acosta, who oversaw the controversial rewrite of the tipping rules. Murray hammered Acosta for months over the proposal, but praised him Wednesday for working out a compromise.","“I’m pleased that Secretary Acosta listened, reversed course, and worked with me on legislation to make sure that big businesses can’t steal their workers’ tips,” Murray said in a statement. “For the millions of workers who rely on their tips to pay their bills and support their families, most of whom are women, this change comes as a sigh of relief.”","The language inserted in the spending bill would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act to forbid employers from steering tip money toward owners, managers or supervisors, requiring that it stay among non-management employees. It would also allow workers to sue to recover stolen tips and win added damages.","Still, not all Democrats are pleased with the arrangement.","While the deal arranged by Murray would nix the most controversial piece of the tip rule proposal, it would leave the rest of it more or less intact. If implemented, the rule would allow employers to force front-of-the-house employees to share their gratuities with workers in the back, so long as the employer paid the full minimum wage, rather than the reduced, “tipped minimum wage.” President Barack Obama’s administration had banned the practice under any circumstances.","Critics of the Trump administration’s proposal ― including many workers interviewed by HuffPost ― say that servers and bartenders shouldn’t be subsidizing the pay of non-tipped workers, even when everyone is earning the full minimum wage before tips. Rep. Bobby Scott (Va.), ranking Democrat on the House labor committee, agrees with that sentiment. He signaled Wednesday that he would oppose a deal like the one hashed out by Murray.","“I am opposed to language that would allow employers to confiscate half or more of the workers’ tips” to redistribute them, Scott said in a statement to HuffPost. Scott’s opposition to the deal was first reported by Politico.","Democratic Rep. Mark Takano (Calif.) is “not thrilled” with the arrangement either, said spokesman Josh Weisz. “It does prevent outright wage theft, but it still undermines the basic principle that tips are the property of the worker who earns them,” Weisz said.","Critics of the tip rule had been expected to file legal challenges if the Trump administration moved forward with it. But by clarifying that employers can’t keep tips for themselves, the provision in the spending bill would take a lot of political heat off the rule, making it more likely it would be finalized and implemented. Murray may view the deal as much better than nothing, since the Labor Department could have moved forward with what it originally proposed.","Heidi Shierholz, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a think tank that was highly critical of the original proposal, said the deal reached Wednesday is “not perfect,” as it could still lead to some servers’ earnings being shifted to other workers. But with the added protections, “It is clearly better for workers than if the Department of Labor’s proposed rule had been finalized. There’s no question,” she said.","Some of the tip rule’s fiercest critics were backing off Wednesday once the arrangement became clear. Restaurant Opportunities Center United, an influential worker center, said it would be satisfied with the rule, so long as management couldn’t take a cut of the tips.","″We’re very, very happy with the language,” Saru Jayaraman, the group’s co-director, told HuffPost. “It’s a total win for workers.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab3b6cf1f0000270616b259.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Donald Trump Taunts Joe Biden: 'He Would Go Down Fast And Hard, Crying All The Way'","authors":"Lee Moran","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-joe-biden-hits-back_us_5ab38404e4b0decad046fcda","short_description":"Trump was responding to Biden's boast that he'd have \"beat the hell out of\" the president in high school.","date":"2018-03-22"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"House Passes 2,232-Page Omnibus Spending Bill That No One Read","authors":"Matt Fuller","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/house-passes-omnibus-spending-bill_us_5ab3d43ce4b0decad047c736","short_description":"Lawmakers only got the full text of the massive bill a little after 8 p.m. on Wednesday.","date":"2018-03-22"},"articleContent":["WASHINGTON ― Six months late and about 17 hours after they first introduced the bill, House lawmakers on Thursday approved a 2,232-page spending bill that will fund the federal government until October and prevent an imminent shutdown.","The massive omnibus spending deal was the culmination of months of negotiations between Republicans and Democrats. Congress has passed five continuing resolutions since September to extend government operations and allow lawmakers more time to negotiate this deal.","The House passed the bill 256-167, with 145 Republicans and 111 Democrats voting yes, and 90 Republicans and 77 Democrats voting no.","Under a previous agreement to lift spending caps, the $1.3 trillion deal increases defense spending by $80 billion and non-defense spending by $63 billion for this fiscal year. The military gets a 2.4 percent pay raise, while civilian personnel get a 1.9 percent bump.","President Donald Trump gets some $1.6 billion for border security measures, although not necessarily for the “wall” he has long promised. Instead, the bill provides $251 million for secondary fencing, $445 million for levee fencing, $196 million for “primary pedestrian fencing” and $445 million for the replacement of existing fencing, according to The Washington Post. The legislation specifically prohibits Trump from making any of the wall prototypes designed last year.","The bill provides funding for a number of infrastructure projects ― including the New York-New Jersey Gateway program, a rail project for the New York City area. Trump fought hard not to simply fund that project, believing he could negotiate money for his wall with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) in exchange for Gateway spending. But ultimately the New York-area lawmakers who wanted the project won.","The legislation also includes the so-called Fix NICS measure, which tightens up the system for reporting criminal records to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. And the bill corrects a “grain glitch” in the GOP tax law that gave farmer-owned cooperatives a significant tax benefit over other agricultural corporations. In exchange for that adjustment, Democrats got an expansion of a low-income housing credit.","The process that produced the spending bill was the exact sort of backroom dealing that Trump railed against in his election. Key lawmakers kept details of the legislation private for months, and then they sprung the text of the measure on other members a little after 8 p.m. on Wednesday. Shortly before 1 p.m. Thursday, the House was voting on the legislation, meaning it was impossible for any of those other lawmakers to have read the bill in its entirety before the vote.","Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, said he tried to stay up all night to read the bill. “As fast as I was reading it, there’s no way they read it,” Meadows said, noting that he reached the 700s pages of the 2,232-page bill.","House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) also made a theatrical show of the bill, holding up the massive stack of pages and saying he was waiting for “the tea party who harangued me and my party” about reading the bill.","“Is there no shame?” Hoyer asked. “Is there no realization of the hypocrisy that is being displayed?”","House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) accused her GOP colleagues of attempting to speed through the process and get out of town before the big march for gun control in Washington on Saturday.","Rep. Raul Labrador (R-Idaho), another Freedom Caucus member, also criticized the process, claiming that congressional leaders had planned a two-week recess just before this vote so they could pressure other lawmakers into supporting the bill.","“It’s why I’m leaving Congress,” Labrador said, who is instead running for governor of Idaho. “These people have no shame. And they’ll say whatever to get elected. But I think the American people deserve better than this.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab3d4a6200000d30ceb2b04.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"A Fake Facebook Ad Killed Off William Shatner.

In November, after further questioning from the Center for Public Integrity, Commerce Department spokesman James Rockas declared that Ross “has fully divested of his interest in Diamond S. Shipping.”","Yet more than four months after Rockas’ announcement, there is still no public record indicating that Ross has actually divested from the company. None of the 27 filings he has made with the Office of Government Ethics since joining the administration have mentioned Diamond S or any of the financial intermediaries through which Ross owns his stake in the shipping firm ― including WLR Recovery Associates IV DSS AIV LP, WLR Recovery Associates V DSS AIV LP, and DSS Holdings LP. In December, Rockas said that Ross had already made the filings, which would be released “in due course.”","Administration officials are legally required to disclose transactions of personal assets valued at more than $1,000, and Ross has detailed the progress of his divestments in other companies ― including Sun Bancorp, BankUnited, Ocwen mortgage servicing, Chevron, Merck and Apple. But there are no filings on the shipping giant.","In 2011, Ross’ private equity firm led a consortium of investors taking a $1 billion stake in Diamond S, making him non-executive chairman of the Diamond S board. (The size of his current investment is not entirely clear.) The Greenwich, Connecticut-headquartered company operates 45 oil tankers, of which 32 are officially registered in Hong Kong. That means they sail under the Chinese flag rather than the American flag, a distinction that allows them to avoid key U.S. regulations and pay workers lower wages. Diamond S vessels have made more than 100 stops in China since 2012, according to data compiled by the Center for Public Integrity.","Since he became commerce secretary, Ross has been closely involved in U.S. trade policy with China, meeting with the head of that country’s largest sovereign wealth fund in July. In November, Ross and Trump announced a series of agreements with Chinese government firms to develop natural gas resources in Alaska, although it’s unclear which, if any, will come to fruition.","As it happens, Navigator Holdings, a separate shipping business in which Ross owns a major stake, specializes in transoceanic shipment of natural gas. Rockas insisted in December that Ross had also divested his interest in Navigator, but public government filings show only one sale of up to $50,000 in Navigator stock.","As of Dec. 31, 2016, a Ross-controlled private equity group owned 39.4 percent of Navigator. He was the company’s chairman, although Navigator said in 2017 that he would not participate in company decisions as a member of the Trump Cabinet.","After this story was first published Thursday, Rockas told HuffPost, “The Secretary’s interest in these companies was divested through a transfer to an irrevocable trust, and because such transfers are not considered transactions under federal regulations, they are not reported through the public financial disclosure report system.”","The Commerce Department would not initially identify the beneficiary of this trust other than to say it was not Ross himself. The Department declined to explain why Ross has never disclosed or detailed the arrangement. The Office of Government Ethics requires public officials to disclose irrevocable trusts that benefit an official’s spouse or dependent child on an official’s initial public disclosure form. Several hours after this story was updated, the Department told HuffPost that Ross had not designated his wife as the beneficiary, but would not answer further questions. Ross has two children.","Irrevocable trusts are used in estate planning by wealthy people to shield assets from personal creditors by passing them on to their heirs. A deeply indebted rich man who owns a lot of stock can put the stock in an irrevocable trust for his children, preventing the rich man’s creditors from seizing the stock as payment for his debts.","The discrepancy between the Commerce Department’s public statements about Ross and the official financial history of the commerce secretary was the most troubling item in a new report from the consumer watchdog group Public Citizen that details connections between Trump administration officials and Chinese businesses, including failed talks between presidential adviser Jared Kushner and a Chinese government-linked investment group involving his disastrous real estate investment at 666 Fifth Avenue, New York.","Trump has talked tough on trade policy throughout his administration. Earlier this month, he alarmed free trade enthusiasts by declaring new tariffs on steel and aluminum. But the ultimate impact of those tariffs is likely to be small, and other Trump efforts to reduce the trade deficit have had almost no effect. The U.S. trade deficit has, in fact, steadily increased during his time in office, including the deficit with China.","This article has been updated to include comment from the Commerce Department, which initially did not respond to a HuffPost inquiry."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab2976a200000d30ceb2961.jpeg?cache=569wc795Rt&ops=crop_18_27_4016_2729%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Judd Apatow Reads Garry Shandling's Hilarious Diary On 'Conan'","authors":"Ron Dicker","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/judd-apatow-garry-shandling-diary-conan_us_5ab395cbe4b054d118e01ef2","short_description":"The late comedian's entry after a movie flop may be his best material.","date":"2018-03-22"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Budget Deal Lifts Ban On Federal Research Of Gun Violence","authors":"Igor Bobic","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dickey-amendment-budget-deal_us_5ab2c67fe4b008c9e5f3cbfe","short_description":"Gun rights advocates have for years opposed focusing on firearms as a public health issue.","date":"2018-03-22"},"articleContent":["WASHINGTON ―The federal government would finally be authorized to study gun violence under a provision included in a two-year $1.3 trillion spending package released by congressional leaders Wednesday night.","Collecting data about gun violence is difficult in the United States because of a 1996 law that restricts federal funding to research the issue.

Dan Burke (D); Ram Villivilam’s defeat of state Sen. Ira Silverstein (D); and Brandon Johnson’s narrow defeat of Cook County Commissioner Richard Boykin.","In addition, Alma Anaya was elected to fill the Cook County Board of Commissioners seat vacated by Jesús “Chuy” García, who won his congressional race. Delia Ramirez picked up an open Illinois House seat and Beatriz Frausto-Sandoval won her race for 14th Subcircuit judge.","“The Chicago machine today is licking its wounds,” said Clem Balanoff, a longtime progressive strategist and former state lawmaker who’s now executive director of Our Revolution Illinois, a local chapter of the legacy group of Sen. Bernie Sanders’ 2016 campaign. “They could be the fatal wounds.”","“There’s no doubt that change is in the air,” he added.","On the surface, the issues that dominated these down-ballot races were often far removed from the national discussion. But upon closer examination, they track closely with the intra-Democratic debates taking place across the country, where progressive newcomers are challenging incumbents to do more to curb growing economic and racial inequality.","In the case of the Cook County assessor’s race, there was also the factor of seemingly brazen corruption in Chicago. Berrios, who has spoken unapologetically about securing government jobs for family members, was under fire after an investigation revealed that he had systematically been over-assessing the property taxes of less valuable homes and under-assessing the homes of wealthier individuals. Between October and February, Berrios received $276,000 in campaign contributions from property tax appeals attorneys who represent wealthy clients in cases Berrios oversees.","Balanoff was initially skeptical of getting behind a “financial guy” like Kaegi, a former mutual fund manager, but concluded that there was a “real genuineness” in his commitment to a more transparent and less regressive property tax assessment system.","With the help of Our Revolution Illinois and other grassroots groups, Kaegi prevailed Tuesday by promising a fairer system for the city’s middle-class homeowners. He defeated the two-term incumbent and Cook County party chairman by 15 percentage points.","Victories like Kaegi’s did not come about in a vaccum. Chicago’s progressive movement has been growing steadily in recent years, beginning with a successful strike launched by the left-leaning Chicago Teachers Union in 2012.","The strike humiliated Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel (D), whose business-friendly policies had already put him on a collision course with grassroots activists. He has presided over massive public school and mental health clinic closings, as well as upscale urban development that has pushed out some members of the city’s longtime black and Latino communities.","Efforts to check Emanuel and the coalition of politicians with whom he makes common cause have gradually matured since then.","Chuy García came up short in his attempt to unseat Emanuel in 2015. But with the backing of the teachers union and other progressive groups, he shocked the Chicago Democratic machine by forcing an unprecedented runoff.","“What you’ve seen since then is a steady stream of movement in the electoral realm that this city hasn’t seen before,” Stacy Davis Gates, the political director of the Chicago Teachers Union, said of the 2015 race.","Sanders’ 2016 presidential run gave the region’s progressives another jolt of energy. In Hillary Clinton’s home state of Illinois, she defeated Sanders by just 1.8 percentage points thanks in part to the enthusiasm Sanders inspired in Chicago’s young people and restive activists.","By the time the 2018 primaries rolled around, there were several significant loci of progressive power in Chicago with the resources to recruit and elect a new crop of candidates. García’s mayoral run made him a household name throughout the city and expanded his political organization in the predominantly Latino parts of western Chicago; Our Revolution Illinois was flush with energized activists; and the Chicago Teachers Union was spoiling for another fight.","United Working Families, a local branch of the labor-backed Working Families Party, had also made key inroads into the city’s black and Latino communities.","Together, these groups provided the financing and field organizing operations that younger or lesser-known candidates needed to challenge entrenched incumbents and compete in contentious open seats.","García, who was virtually assured of victory in Illinois’ 4th Congressional District from the moment he stepped into the race, leveraged his political operation to ensure the election of younger progressive Latinos. The clearest beneficiaries from his reach in west and southwest Chicago were Alma Anaya, one of his former aides; Aaron Ortiz, a 26-year-old college counselor and member of the Chicago Teachers Union; labor activist Delia Ramirez; and immigration lawyer Beatriz Frausto-Sandoval.","Ortiz’s win was especially notable because he unseated Dan Burke, 66, who had represented the state House district since before Ortiz was born. Ortiz criticized Burke for the ties of his brother, Chicago Alderman Ed Burke, to President Donald Trump. Ed Burke’s law firm has saved Trump millions of dollars in taxes on Chicago’s Trump Tower.","Brandon Johnson’s Cook County Board Of Commissioners win, by a few hundred votes, also carried special significance.","Johnson, a Chicago Teachers Union member and organizer on the West Side, is now one of the Chicago area’s most progressive black elected officials. One reason García lost in 2015 was because of his inability to peel black voters away from Emanuel.","Ensuring that Chicago’s progressive leadership adequately represents the city’s formidable black population is essential to electing a progressive mayor and other powerful leaders, according to Davis Gates. It also provides a road map for national progressives like Sanders, whose struggle to gain traction among African-American voters likely cost him the Democratic nomination, Davis Gates said.","“There is no progressive movement anywhere in this country if it not does not underscore black, left progressive men and women winning elected office,” Davis Gates said. “It just doesn’t happen.”","“Bernie Sanders alone is not gonna be enough to compel black people to turn out and vote,” she added.","At the same time, the teachers union’s decision to go all in for Johnson reflected its disdain for Richard Boykin, an African-American corporate lobbyist and former chief of staff to Rep. Danny Davis (D). Boykin opposed Johnson’s ideas to raise progressive revenue for the county that would enable it to save public jobs. He also responded to the city’s epidemic of gang violence by calling for alleged shooters to be tried as “domestic terrorists” and inviting United Nations peacekeepers to occupy his district.","“People like Brandon Johnson are critical as we move ahead in this movement,” Davis Gates said. “If the national scene is Joe Biden and Donald Trump, and Illinois has J.B. Pritzker and Bruce Rauner, we’re gonna be in trouble.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab2f0151e00008e0b7af5dd.jpeg?cache=RRYtenPcAU&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Chrissy Teigen Hilariously Explains Why She Didn't Take John Legend's Last Name","authors":"Carly Ledbetter","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chrissy-teigen-explains-why-she-didnt-take-john-legends-last-name_us_5ab3a529e4b0decad04760c2","short_description":"That settles that.","date":"2018-03-22"},"articleContent":["Christine Diane Tiegen, better known to most of us as Chrissy Teigen, is a model, cookbook author, TV host and one of the funniest people on Twitter.","She’s been married to John Legend, whose real name is actually John Roger Stephens, since 2013.

An organization for FBI agents would like to see that change.","date":"2018-03-22"},"articleContent":["WICHITA, Kan. ― Whenever a white non-Muslim man commits an act of mass violence ― not an infrequent occurrence in recent history ― the online debate begins. Why aren’t authorities calling this terrorism?","The debate broke out once again Wednesday morning after the news broke that the bomber behind a string of deadly attacks in Austin, Texas, was a 23-year-old white Christian male.","Media coverage often grants white non-Muslim perpetrators a level of humanity not typically seen in coverage of other attackers, and “terrorism” can often be used simply as a stand-in for “Muslim.” But it’s more than just politics and privilege that makes authorities ― and in turn, the media ― shy about calling terrorism by its name.","The United States has no federal law criminalizing acts of domestic terrorism. That’s something the FBI Agents Association, an organization that represents more than 14,000 current and former FBI special agents, would like to see changed.","“Calling it what it is is something that I believe is important,” Thomas O’Connor, a current FBI agent who has worked on domestic terrorism investigations, said in an interview earlier this year. O’Connor, speaking to HuffPost in his capacity as head of the FBI Agents Association, said that the lack of a federal charge has broad implications for how the American public thinks about the threat of domestic terrorism.\n","“It’s easy for people to wrap their heads around someone coming in with an internationally based ideology and committing a crime,” O’Connor said. “But when it’s a domestic terrorist, because there’s no charge, we can’t get our head wrapped around it.”","While the U.S. code defines domestic terrorism, there’s no broad criminal statute that outlaws such acts. As HuffPost previously explained, the lack of a criminal domestic terrorism statute makes the federal government extremely cautious about using the term “terrorism” when there’s no link to a group the United States has officially designated as an international terrorist organization. In practical terms, that means the government doesn’t call white, non-Muslim terrorists what they are.","That’s not really an excuse in the case of Mark Conditt, the young man behind the Austin attacks. Because Conditt is dead, there’s no future trial to be concerned about.","Conditt’s precise motive is not entirely clear. Austin Police Chief Brian Manley received a lot of backlash Wednesday evening for describing a 25-minute tape Conditt recorded as an “outcry by a very challenged young man” and noting that it “does not at all mention anything about terrorism, nor does he mention anything about hate.” Nevertheless, the federal government would have been able to charge Conditt with a terrorism-related crime had he lived: His package bombs would count as weapons of mass destruction.","O’Connor says that doesn’t make much sense and that the federal government needs to be able to charge domestic terrorists with domestic terrorism regardless of their weapon of choice.","“The weapon itself shouldn’t be the determining factor on when someone is committing an act of domestic terror,” O’Connor said. “Call it what it is. If you have an incident that takes place, and the person uses a firearm, a car, a knife ― if that crime of force or violence is done to forward a social or political agenda, then that person fits the elements of domestic terrorism.”","O’Connor points to the Family Research Council shooting in Washington, D.C., in 2012, when a man shot a security guard because of the organization’s opposition to gay marriage. It was clearly an act of terrorism. But because the terrorist used a gun, there was no federal terrorism-related federal statute under which he could’ve been charged. The only reason he faced a terrorism charge was that the District of Columbia has its own terrorism statute, which federal prosecutors were able to use because they handle criminal cases in the nation’s capital.\n","This week here in Wichita, three white men from rural Kansas are facing trial, accused of plotting to bomb an apartment complex occupied by Muslim refugees they considered “cockroaches.” If the defendants did what the government says they did, they’re domestic terrorists. But the only reason they’re facing terrorism-related charges is because their alleged plot involved bombs. Had they decided to go door to door shooting Muslims living in an apartment complex in Garden City, as they are accused of discussing on audiotapes, there would be no basis for a terrorism-related charge and they’d likely be facing only civil rights charges.","As HuffPost first reported last summer, there has been an internal debate at the Justice Department about whether the executive branch should lobby Congress to create an actual criminal statute that would outlaw acts of domestic terrorism. Thomas Brzozowski, the Justice Department’s top authority on domestic terrorism, said in January that the Justice Department was “continuing to look at that very closely” and getting input from multiple agencies. O’Connor’s group has been lobbying for such a plan, but the effort hasn’t gained much traction on Capitol Hill.","It’s not only a question of fairness, says O’Connor. It’s also about measuring the extent of the problem of domestic terrorism in the United States. Since there’s no central domestic terrorism charge, the federal government doesn’t keep track of cases that qualify as domestic terrorism.","“If you look up domestic terrorism in general and try to figure out the numbers of domestic terrorism incidents that have taken place in the United States over the past 20 years, you’re never going to come up with an accurate number because people haven’t been charged with domestic terrorism,” O’Connor said.","“It comes down to transparency,” O’Connor said. “When there is an incident and it’s not called that, then it gets lost.”\n","Ryan Reilly is HuffPost’s senior justice reporter, covering the Justice Department, federal law enforcement, criminal justice and legal affairs.

Scott Walker (R) to call the special elections for two legislative seats that he has refused to call since December, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.","Democrats sued Walker over his refusal to schedule quick elections and said he wouldn’t do so because he was afraid of losing the contests to Democrats.","Dane County Circuit Court Judge Josann Reynolds, a Walker appointee, ordered the governor to call the elections within a week. An appeal of that order is expected.","Amy Hasenberg, a Walker spokeswoman, told HuffPost that the governor was consulting with the state’s attorneys to “determine the next steps in this case.”","The dispute involves two seats ― one in the Wisconsin State Assembly and one in the Wisconsin Senate ― that became vacant in December 2017 when the Republican incumbents resigned to take jobs in Walker’s administration. Walker said he wouldn’t hold a special election for the open seats, but would instead allow them to be filled by the regularly scheduled elections in November 2018. The winners of those elections wouldn’t be seated until January 2019.","Walker insisted that he had no legal obligation to call the special election sooner and that he was saving the state money by not doing so. But Democrats argued that his decision was motivated by the fact that Republicans lost a special election this January in a Wisconsin district that President Donald Trump had carried by more than 20 points in 2016. Walker labeled that election a “wake-up call.”","Wisconsin law says that a special election must be held as promptly as possible for any vacancy in the state legislature that occurs before the second Tuesday in May in a regularly scheduled election year. Walker’s team contended that he was not obligated to call a special election because the vacancies occurred in 2017, not the regularly scheduled election year of 2018, according to the Journal Sentinel.","In a bench ruling Thursday, Reynolds accused state Attorney General Brad Schimel’s office of reading the law in an absurd way and not following “basic rules of grammar.” She also accused his office of being hypocritical in advocating generally for a strict reading of laws while interpreting the relevant statute in this case in a way that undermined “the most basic constitutional guarantee.”","The judge alluded to the fact that Walker’s decision had left 175,000 people without a voice in the state legislature.

Almost exactly 17 hours later, at 1 p.m. Thursday, House lawmakers passed the bill 256-167.","As Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) asked on the House floor Thursday: What happened to the tea party that “harangued” Democrats about having time to read bills?","“Is there no shame?” Hoyer asked. “Is there no realization of the hypocrisy that is being displayed?”","In interviews with more than 20 GOP lawmakers Thursday, the answer was, largely, no.","Time and again, Republicans who came to Congress using hashtags like #ReadTheBill were happy to vote for a beginning-of-the-year bipartisan spending deal ― a fiscal year that was supposed to have begun on Oct. 1, mind you ― and they dismissed arguments that lawmakers and the public ought to have time to read the legislation before it gets a vote.","Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) was asked about the broken procedural promises of his speakership Thursday ― there hasn’t been an open rule vote, where any member could offer an amendment to a bill on the floor, in two years; Republicans have routinely stripped provisions from legislation using rules (so-called “legislating on the rule”); and leadership has broken the three-day rule often. Ryan claimed, “By and large, we’ve done a phenomenal job.”","Ryan said lawmakers were working against a hard deadline and that Republicans had passed much of this legislation in September when they advanced two spending bills encompassing the 12 appropriations bills, so it wasn’t as if there were any “big surprises.”","But those bills were passed under different spending numbers, and scores of provisions were added to this final legislation in the past few months. Lawmakers and the public don’t know what they don’t know about the bill until they’ve actually read it ― or, more likely, a news organization or member discovers a controversial provision and it becomes an issue.","Just don’t tell Republicans that.","“Everyone knows what’s in this,” Rep. Lynn Jenkins (R-Kan.) told HuffPost.","When we challenged that claim, noting that the public had hardly any time to review the bill, Jenkins said the public “can go through it just like we are.”","When we raised the point that it would be impossible for someone to have read the bill in the time before the vote, Jenkins said the bill was being drafted by the Appropriations Committee since December. And when HuffPost noted that the public still wouldn’t have had an opportunity to read the bill when it was being negotiated behind closed doors, Jenkins said the public could “visit with their member of Congress. Their member of Congress can communicate to them what’s in it.”","Time and again Thursday, Republicans acted as if they weren’t violating the promises they made when they took over the majority and issued the “Pledge to America” ― a 45-page document that promises, among many other things, that the text of a bill will be online for at least three days before lawmakers votes on it.","When we asked Rep. Peter Roskam (R-Ill.) what happened to the “Read the Bill” sentiment in Congress, Roskam said, “The ‘Read the Bill’ sentiment is in full bloom and on full display.”","When we asked Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) about reading the bill, he told us, “We don’t live in a perfect world.”","“I’d like it to be better, but again, you have to do what you have to do. Democracy isn’t pretty but it works,” King said, mentioning that he relies on staff and legislation summaries from leadership to make up his mind.","Rep. Joe Wilson (R-S.C.) was sympathetic to concerns about reading the bill, but he noted that Congress was coming up against a funding deadline. When we raised the possibility of passing, say, a five-day continuing resolution to keep the government open while giving lawmakers more time to read the bill, Wilson said he would have supported that.","Other Republicans responded to questions about reading the bill by pointing out frustrations with the Senate and the 60-vote threshold for cloture, while some argued that it was perhaps immaterial that the public didn’t have time to read the bill.","“As you know, the bills are written in legalese,” Rep. Glenn Grothman (R-Wis.) told HuffPost. “Very few people can understand the bill.”","But there were some Republicans who did speak out against GOP leaders quickly scheduling a vote on the omnibus.","“I think it’s disgusting,” Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) said. “Totally irresponsible. Totally violates our duty to our constituents.”","When we asked Amash about whatever happened to the GOP promises of “Read the Bill,” he was straight-forward. “Yeah, they lied,” he said. “Flat out.”","Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) was also disgusted by the broken promises, saying there was not a single member who had read the bill. “You know why I know that? Because I stayed up all night trying to read it, and as fast as I was reading, there’s no way they read it,” Meadows said, mentioning that he got to pages numbered somewhere in the 700s.","Other members also pointed out that, despite claims from some Republicans that everyone has known what this bill would look like, the omnibus was kept under wraps.","“This has been the best-kept secret in Washington,” Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.) said. “We can’t even keep our military and intelligence secrets, but we can sure keep a secret from members of Congress on what is being negotiated on a spending bill.”","Loudermilk and Rep. Jim Renacci (R-Ohio) both said they were voting against the bill because of their procedural concerns.","Some Republicans did seem to sense that voting for a 2,232-page bill hours after it was introduced could be politically toxic. (Renacci is currently in a tough Senate election in Ohio.)","But National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Steve Stivers (Ohio) doesn’t think this vote will come back to bite Republicans.","“If they want to attack something they voted for,” Stivers said of Democrats, “I think that’s hard to justify.”","Never mind that the Democrats who would be attacking incumbent Republicans for their votes on the omnibus aren’t currently in Congress. GOP leaders were celebrating the passage of the omnibus as a big win.","In the words of Rep. Raul Labrador (R-Idaho): “These people have no shame. And they’ll say whatever to get elected.

And, of course, Trump responded.","“Crazy Joe Biden is trying to act like a tough guy. Actually, he is weak, both mentally and physically, and yet he threatens me, for the second time, with physical assault,” Trump tweeted Thursday morning. “He doesn’t know me, but he would go down fast and hard, crying all the way. Don’t threaten people Joe!”","As most things on the internet do, the feud ― between two grown men over 70 years old, might I add ― was retweeted, turned into a meme and quickly went viral. People on both sides of the aisle defended their party’s politician and dragged his opponent.","While I welcome any non-lady feud, there’s something troubling about the root of Biden’s and Trump’s comments. Biden boasted about beating up the president while he was at a rally against sexual violence for his organization It’s On Us. He later bizarrely suggested that men who treat women poorly are likely to be physically unattractive, essentially fat-shaming Trump.","Biden declined to comment further on his remarks through a spokesman.","Trump’s response ― specifically pointing out that Biden is “weak” both “mentally and physically” ― is a clear sign that Trump felt his masculinity was threatened by Biden’s remarks.","Both comments are peak toxic masculinity: Biden attempted to defend the honor of women with his brawny man strength and Trump responded to violence with more violence.","This macho rhetoric is, in fact, the root cause of the very issue Biden is campaigning against with It’s On Us. Responding to violence against women with more violence is wildly problematic. This feud, but specifically Biden’s initial comments, are exemplary of how men feel they need to prove themselves through violent or sexual acts to be seen as “real men.”","Toxic masculinity ― the concept that men are confined to strict gender roles that perpetuate violent and overly sexualized behavior ― is often the very reason for rampant sexual violence on college campuses and around the country.","When Biden essentially challenges Trump to a duel, he perpetuates the myth that women need good guys to protect them from the bad guys. In fact, what all sexual assault survivors need, but especially women, is to be seen as humans. Once women are seen as equals, they can no longer be used as objects men can consume haphazardly to make them look more manly to other men.","It’s safe to say that Trump’s track record with women is much worse than Biden’s. The president, who once bragged about grabbing women “by the pussy,” has been accused of sexual misconduct, ranging from harassment to assault and rape, by 21 women. Trump regularly denies allegations of sexual and domestic abuse against not only him but also his former staffers as “fake news.”","Biden has a somewhat storied history with his treatment of women. The former vice president, who launched It’s On Us with President Barack Obama in 2014, has long advocated for women’s rights, including drafting the Violence Against Women Act of 1994.","He has, however, been widely criticized for how he handled professor Anita Hill’s accusations of sexual harassment against Clarence Thomas during the latter’s 1991 Supreme Court confirmation hearings. Many people believe that Biden, who was then chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, didn’t do enough to ensure those allegations were given full consideration. More recently, Biden has taken on the good old “Uncle Joe” persona, during which time he has been caught on camera being creepy and borderline inappropriate toward women.","While Biden’s behavior toward women is nowhere near that of Trump’s, his recent actions call into question his understanding of rape culture and the root cause of sexual violence on college campuses.","I think I can speak for most women when I say: Please, men, don’t use women and our bodies as a pawn to boost your ego."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab3b54e1f0000260616b256.jpeg?cache=moEraRCYbp&ops=crop_0_19_1200_734%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Retired 4-Star General: 'Simply Outrageous' That Jared Kushner Represents America","authors":"Lee Moran","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/barry-mccaffrey-jared-kushner_us_5ab360dce4b0decad046c78a","short_description":"“This is the personalization of a family business dealing with U.S. policy,\" said Barry McCaffrey.","date":"2018-03-22"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"After Years Of Deficit Doomsaying, Republicans Go On Massive Spending Spree","authors":"Igor Bobic","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republicans-deficits-spending_us_5ab3b942e4b0decad0478d51","short_description":"When they're in power, they spend.

The spending spree follows another budget buster ― their $1.5 trillion unpaid tax cut.","The splurge sets a drastically different tone for a party that not long ago professed to be extremely worried about the budget deficit, whose members screamed about a looming fiscal apocalypse and demanded dollar-for-dollar cuts in exchange for proposed spending increases by former President Barack Obama.","“If we don’t begin to deal with our debt and deficit in a serious way, we’re not going to have many options,” then-House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) warned in 2012, during one debt ceiling showdown. “I’m not going to apologize for leading. The real issue here is, will the president lead?”","Boehner’s successor as speaker, Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), became the poster boy for fiscal conservatism at the time. As chairman of the powerful House Budget Committee, Ryan crusaded around Washington with charts and PowerPoint presentations, saying the nation was at a “tipping point” because of its debt.","“The debt will soon eclipse our entire economy, and grow to catastrophic levels in the years ahead,” Ryan said in a 2011 response to Obama’s State of the Union speech. “On this current path, when my three children ― who are now 6, 7, and 8 years old ― are raising their own children, the federal government will double in size, and so will the taxes they pay. The next generation will inherit a stagnant economy and a diminished country.”","When Republicans are in power, they spend. When they are out of power, they harp about deficits and debt. It’s a strategy they have shamelessly executed with success over the course of several presidencies. During George W. Bush’s administration, for example, Republicans ran up the national credit card with two unpaid wars, two tax cuts, and a huge expansion of Medicare. And, it’s a tactic they’ll likely use in the future if Democrats succeed in clawing their way back into power ― by claiming the need to cut spending on entitlements and welfare programs.","The Club for Growth, a fiscally conservative group focused on cutting spending and taxes that has gone largely ignored during Trump’s presidency, urged lawmakers not to support the spending bill.","“It’s hard to see how any member of Congress ― liberal or conservative ― can vote on this 2,232-page deal less than 24 hours after the contents were made public,” the group said in a statement. “On top of that, this monster proposal simply fulfills the budget-busting deal that GOP leaders made with the Democrats last month.

The woman claims Bishop raped her at the center, according to a Brigham Young University police report obtained by HuffPost. The woman’s name has not been disclosed in the press or in the police report.","Bishop was the president at the Missionary Training Center (MTC) in Provo from 1983 to 1986. An MTC is where the LDS church trains thousands of young men and women before they are sent out as missionaries to countries across the world.","“If the allegations of sexual assault are true, it would be a tragic betrayal of our standards and would result in action by the Church to formally discipline any member who was guilty of such behavior, especially someone in a position of trust,” the church said in its statement.","The church’s statement came days after a taped conversation between Bishop and the woman was posted to MormonLeaks, a website started by ex-Mormons seeking to increase transparency within the LDS church.","Last December, the woman posed as a reporter and secretly recorded an interview she had with Bishop in Arizona. During the wide-ranging conversation, she asked Bishop questions about the alleged assault and about other women he may have harassed. The Mormon leader, who is now 85 years old, can be heard saying he doesn’t remember assaulting the woman and muses that maybe it’s “because my mind doesn’t want me to remember that.”","At one point in the interview, the woman asked if Bishop molested another Mormon woman at the MTC. He admits that he gave one woman a back rub that got too “frisky.”","He apologizes repeatedly in the recording and says that for years he has struggled with a “sexual addiction.”","“I am very, very sorry and I am so sorry. I don’t know if I can even be forgiven on your side,” Bishop tells the woman in the recording.","The woman also contacted Brigham Young University police in November to report her alleged assault. According to that police report, Bishop denied the rape allegations but told detectives that he’d gone with the woman to a small “preparation room” and while talking with her “asked her to show him her breasts, which she did.”","BYU police relayed the facts of the case to the Utah County attorney’s office. Deputy attorney David Sturgill replied that he could not pursue criminal charges against Bishop because the statute of limitations had expired four years after the alleged assault.","“I have no reason to doubt the victim’s disclosure, and would have likely prosecuted Mr. Bishop, but for the expiration of the statute of limitations,” Sturgill informed BYU police, according to the police report.","BYU police closed their investigation into the assault on Dec. 23.","The woman told the LDS church-owned Deseret News that she first reported the assault to church officials around 1988. The church’s official statement on Tuesday claimed officials became aware of the alleged assault in 2010, when the woman informed leaders of a Mormon congregation in Pleasant Grove, Utah, where she was living.","The LDS church claims the leaders “listened carefully to the claims being made” and then relayed them to the Pleasant Grove Police Department. The church claims it received no further communication from the police about the matter. Church leaders also contacted Bishop, who denied the allegations. Unable to verify the woman’s claims, the church said it decided not to discipline Bishop at the time.","According to The Salt Lake Tribune, the woman made a threat about killing Bishop in 2010. Pleasant Grove police interviewed the woman and decided not to make an arrest.","In January, the woman’s lawyer forwarded the recorded conversation to the LDS church. The church claims both the woman and Bishop were then interviewed about the allegations. Both parties reaffirmed their positions and appeared to have “dramatically” different recollections of what happened in 1984.","Bishop’s family claims that the woman who made the accusations is untrustworthy and has falsely accused other men of sexual assault. His son, Greg Bishop, said his father was confused during the woman’s interview, since he was recovering from a heart surgery that took place two days earlier.","The son added that when his father admitted to having a “sexual addiction,” he was referring to a lifelong battle with “controlling” his “sexual thoughts.”","“Those people who know dad don’t put much credence in these allegations,” Greg Bishop told the AP.","The church cautioned in its statement that it does not have the “investigative tools” available to law enforcement agencies to conduct a thorough review of the matter, but pledged to keep Bishop accountable for any misconduct.","“The Church is continuing its investigation of this individual’s claims and will act consistent with its long-standing policy of no tolerance for abuse.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab4229c1e00008e0b7af77e.jpeg?cache=ATaGsKbUy8&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"IMPACT","headline":"Area Of Plastic In The Great Pacific Garbage Patch Is Three Times The Size Of France","authors":"Laura Paddison","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/great-pacific-garbage-patch-plastic_us_5ab3bba5e4b008c9e5f4e5b7","short_description":"And there's up to 16 times more trash than scientists had thought.","date":"2018-03-22"},"articleContent":["The Great Pacific Garbage Patch, an enormous area of floating garbage halfway between California and Hawaii, is already recognized as the largest accumulation zone of ocean plastic on Earth. Now, it turns out that researchers may have been vastly underestimating its scale.","The results of a three year mapping effort by international scientists, published Thursday in the journal Scientific Reports, reveals that the amount of plastic this garbage patch contains is up to 16 times greater than initially thought.","According to the study, the patch takes up 1.6 million square kilometers (618,000 square miles), an area about three times the size of France. It contains 1.8 trillion pieces of plastic weighing in at 80,000 metric tons – equivalent to 500 jumbo jets.","Previous attempts to measure the Great Pacific Garbage Patch have mostly been done by single boats with trawls.","“We wanted to paint the entire picture,” said Joost Dubois, communications director of The Ocean Cleanup, the Dutch foundation which led the study. Their analysis was undertaken by a fleet of 30 boats crossing the patch and two planes fitted with sensors to measure larger items the vessels were unable to capture.","Around 8 million tons of plastic enter the oceans each year – the equivalent of dumping a garbage truck’s worth into the seas every minute for a year. Once in the ocean, much of this waste is pulled into huge areas known as the five “gyres” – one of which is the Great Pacific Garbage Patch – where circular currents allow the trash to accumulate, circulate and slowly break down.","As well as containing larger items, the garbage patch is also made up of microplastics (pieces of plastic smaller than 5 millimeters in size) that comprise around 8 percent of its total mass. Microplastics have increasingly come under the spotlight as these tiny fragments are thought to damage sea life. They are also entering the human food chain through fish and water ― impacting both tap water and bottled water. While the health implications aren’t fully understood, studies suggest that consuming microplastics could introduce toxic chemicals into the body.","Laurent Lebreton, lead author of the new study, said that while it wasn’t possible to draw firm conclusions on the persistency of the plastic problem in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, the plastic accumulation rate “indicates that the inflow of plastic into the patch continues to exceed the outflow.”","George Leonard, chief scientist at Ocean Conservancy, an environmental nonprofit in Washington D.C. which wasn’t involved in the study, said that he was impressed with the extensive sampling and use of new techniques to try to quantify the problem.","“The one thing that really jumps out at me here is the fact that fishing gear makes up about half of the macro debris in the Pacific gyre,” he said. While microplastics pollution has been known for a while, bigger material in the ocean has been difficult to quantify, he said.","The debate about the global use of plastics is currently “largely focused on aspects of consumer plastic ― plastic bags and plastic straws and that kind of stuff,” Leonard added. “It’s pretty clear that if we really want to tackle this problem writ large, a focused effort on fishing gear and the loss of fishing gear in the global ocean has got to be a critical part of that strategy.”","The Ocean Cleanup has a bold plan to tackle plastic waste. “People expect [the garbage patch] to be like an island, or islands, of trash floating in this big area,” said Dubois. “The plastic is still spread out quite a lot over this big area so there is a lot of material but it’s also a very large surface.”","In an attempt to make collection economically feasible, The Ocean Cleanup is trying out a new technology involving autonomous booms like giant horseshoes, which float around the oceans powered by wind and currents.","“They basically follow the same pattern as the plastic does,” said Dubois, “but at a different speed, and because of the shape of the booms the plastic is being concentrated.” The plastic accumulates to a level “that it becomes economic to sail out, pick it up, bring it back to shore for recycling,” he added.","The first trial for the booms will happen in the next few weeks near San Francisco, before a planned trial in deeper water in May. The Ocean Cleanup hopes the system will be towed out to the Great Pacific Garbage Patch in the summer.","The organization estimates it can remove half of the area’s trash in five years, but admits microplastics will be too small for the new method to catch. “Although we won’t be able to collect the really bad stuff, we will collect an enormous amount of the stuff that will turn into bad stuff over time,” said Dubois.","The new study came out the day after another report predicted the amount of plastic in the ocean could triple by 2025.","That report, produced for the U.K. government, stressed that there are opportunities to be gained from the “ocean economy” if the seas are managed properly.","“The ocean is critical to our economic future,” Prof. Edward Hill, from the U.K. National Oceanography Center, told the BBC. “Nine billion people will be looking to the ocean for more food.

He was granted a stay on his deportation last August but was told in February that he had one month to prepare to leave the country. ICE officials placed an ankle bracelet on him, and he showed up at the ICE office in Reno, Nevada, last Friday to turn himself in. He was on a plane later that day, Sull said.","His wife, who is currently petitioning for U.S. citizenship, and four children, all of whom are beneficiaries of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, will remain in the U.S.","Sull, who began representing Chavez-Macias last spring, hoped that she’d be able to appeal his deportation on humanitarian grounds, given the severity of his condition and the difficulty he may face in finding treatment near his hometown of Aguascalientes, Mexico. The closest urban medical center, she added, is three to four hours away.","Chavez-Macias suffers from Marfan syndrome, a genetic disorder that has caused him severe heart complications for many years. Following an examination earlier this month, his doctors recommended he undergo heart surgery, Sull said. She even had his doctors explain to ICE just how dire the situation was.","“Unfortunately, ICE did not value their opinion,” Sull said.","She believes that their determination to carry out the deportation stems from Chavez-Macias’ decision to seek sanctuary in a church last April, an attempt to evade deportation. He lived at the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship until the deportation order was lifted several months later.","“I believe that penalized him,” she said. “ICE does have this jurisdiction and they chose to exercise it. But that’s not what America is about.”","ICE didn’t comment on the humanitarian situation, merely pointing out that the six-month stay he was granted had expired.","“He was ordered removed by an immigration judge in November 1996,” ICE spokeswoman Lori K. Haley said in a statement. “A request for a stay of removal was granted for six months, which concluded Feb. 12.”","But people in Chavez-Macias’ community are concerned for his life.","“Despite my repeated efforts to prevent this tragedy, the Department of Homeland Security refused to keep David with his family where he can receive the medical support he needs,” Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) wrote in a Facebook post Monday.","“Did our government just put a timeline on his life?” asked local activist Alejandra Hernandez-Chavez at a protest at ICE’s Reno office last Friday against Chavez-Macias’ deportation.","His prospects of being able to return to the U.S. aren’t favorable, Sull said. Because none of his family members are U.S. citizens, he isn’t able to petition for citizenship. His two brothers are lawful permanent residents who are currently petitioning for citizenship, but even if it’s granted to them, the process for Chavez-Macias to then petition for citizenship could take as much as 20 years.","“We’re very concerned,” she said."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab39ca71f00002d0016b224.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"COMEDY","headline":"Colbert Nails CNN Over Steamy Stormy Coverage: It’s Now 'Anderson Cooper 36DD'","authors":"Ed Mazza","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/stephen-colbert-cnn-stormy-daniels_us_5ab31167e4b008c9e5f3fbc2","short_description":"The \"Late Show\" host also has a porn name for Wolf Blitzer.","date":"2018-03-22"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Rural Counties Are Making A Comeback, Census Data Shows","authors":"Stateline, Editorial Partner","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rural-counties-are-making-a-comeback-census-data-shows_us_5ab3bb5ce4b004fe24699854","short_description":"It’s the bigger rural counties, those with a town of at least 10,000 people, which have turned the corner fastest.","date":"2018-03-22"},"articleContent":["By Tim Henderson","Some long-declining small towns and farming and manufacturing counties are adding people as population growth in large cities cools, according to a Stateline analysis of census estimates released Thursday.","“This seems to be the beginning of a return to population dispersal after a decade or so of clustering into cities and the biggest metropolitan areas,” said William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution. Steady improvement in the economy and recovering housing markets may be prompting employers and job seekers to look again at areas that were growing before the Great Recession — suburbs, exurbs and small towns, Frey said.","Rural areas, defined by the U.S. Department of Agriculture as counties outside cities and their suburbs, gained population between 2016 and 2017 for the first time since 2010. They grew by about 33,000 residents nationwide, after losing more than 15,000 residents the year before.","One of those growing areas is Jackson County, Georgia, a rural county that is convenient to Atlanta and Athens, where farm-equipment manufacturing and distribution center jobs have helped fuel a population increase of more than 2,500, almost 4 percent, after a population loss as recently as 2012. In the years since, the county’s population growth has been on a steady upward trend. The county added 428 people in 2013 and 1,603 people in 2016, leading up to this year’s larger boost.","“There’s a good bit of growth here. Things are finally starting to heat up,” said Jackson County Commissioner Tom Crow, who has a family farm where he raises catfish and evergreen trees. Foreclosures caused most of the population loss earlier in the decade, Crow said, but now those homes are occupied again, and hundreds of new homes are being built every year.","Heavily agricultural areas also have started growing in the last two years after years of declines. Those areas likely still have fewer jobs, but may be attractive to people looking for low-cost areas to retire or cut costs, said Doug Farquhar, program director for rural development at the National Conference of State Legislatures.","Population decline has hit most rural areas hard since 2010. States such as Nebraska and Kansas have tried tax incentives to attract movers. Many small towns have had to cut back services or deliver them in combination with neighboring towns as the number of taxpayers has dwindled.","John Cromartie, a USDA geographer, said he had expected the census numbers to show that rural population loss had slowed, but he was surprised at the increase. Cromartie has documented the six-year trend of population loss in rural areas.","It’s the bigger rural counties, those with a town of at least 10,000 people, which have turned the corner fastest.","Those counties as a group grew by almost 40,000 or about 0.1 percent, while smaller counties continued to lose population, though at a much lower rate than last year. The smallest counties as a group lost about 6,100 people, down from annual losses of more than 50,000 between 2012 and 2015.","At the same time, growth is beginning to moderate in the most urban counties. After leading the nation’s population growth for a decade, with annual growth of more than a million, growth in those counties dropped back to about 900,000 between 2015 and 2016 and to a little more than 700,000 for the period covered in today’s release of census data.","Some urban counties lost population between 2016 and 2017. Cook County, which includes Chicago, lost more than 20,000 residents, its largest loss since 2010. The counties that include Baltimore, Cleveland, St. Louis, Pittsburgh, Milwaukee, Detroit and Brooklyn also shed residents between 2016 and 2017.","Cook County, where population has dropped for three straight years, is actually undergoing a boom in apartment construction, up 61 percent between 2015 and 2017, said Ed Zotti, an urban planning consultant at the Chicago Central Area Committee, a coalition of businesses and nonprofits.","“Downtown Chicago housing has been experiencing an extended boom, driven by rising downtown employment,” Zotti said. But the city’s black population is in long-term decline, he said, which is likely to offset gains in population.","Alameda County, home of Oakland, Berkeley and other communities across the bay from San Francisco, had the nation’s biggest increase last year in multifamily housing, according to census building permit data.","The booming regional economy in the Bay Area is driving more demand for housing in Oakland and other Alameda County cities, said Darin Ranelletti, Oakland’s deputy director for planning and building.","According to the Stateline analysis, counties such as Alameda that are on the fringes of large metro areas added about 825,000 new residents between 2016 and 2017.","Stateline home page","Sign up for exclusive state policy reporting and research"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab3bc0b1f00001a0316b267.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Jennifer Garner Went Full Band Geek For Reese Witherspoon's Birthday","authors":"Cole Delbyck","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jennifer-garner-went-full-band-geek-for-reese-witherspoons-birthday_us_5ab3bd18e4b054d118e075c6","short_description":"Best.

If he should die before those 10 years, either his wife or his estate will be eligible to collect the following monthly payments, the Tennessean reported.","The $1 million compensation is the highest permitted by the state, as well as the highest it has ever granted due to the length of time McKinney served. That’s not to say that everyone is calling the amount sufficient.","“The board of claims at the hearing said that they thought it was an inadequate award,” Raybin said.","He pointed out that the $1 million maximum was set about 10 years ago and doesn’t consider adjustments for rising costs of living.","Still, if you ask McKinney, he might say that the closure of this chapter of his life is a blessing enough, Raybin said.","After being released from prison nine years ago, he endured a yearslong legal battle for both monetary compensation and exoneration.","The parole board twice refused to formally exonerate him, even though the Shelby County Criminal Court and district attorney general found that DNA evidence failed to link McKinney to the crime he was convicted of. Former Gov. Phil Bredesen (D) also declined to clear his name when given the chance, Raybin said.","It wasn’t until December 2017 that current Gov. Bill Haslam (R) completed the task for McKinney, an act that then made him eligible to seek compensation from the state.","“In the eyes of the judicial system, Mr. McKinney is innocent,” Haslam said in a statement at the time. “While I appreciate the hard work and recommendations of the Board of Parole, in this case, I defer to the finding of the court charged with determining Mr. McKinney’s guilt or innocence.”","Raybin shared McKinney’s gratitude to the board and the governor.","“He was obviously very moved by all of this,” Raybin said of McKinney’s reactions, saying he expected the exoneration would come sooner or later. “He has infinite patience, and he is also a very religious person and has extreme faith in God.”","As for that $1 million maximum, Raybin said some of the board members told him that they will revisit the cap next year.","“Many other states have much higher amounts,” he said.","According to the Innocence Project, a nonprofit legal organization that fights to exonerate those who have been found wrongly convicted through DNA evidence, 18 states do not have laws that would grant compensation to individuals incarcerated for a crime they did not commit","Those states are Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, and Wyoming.","The Innocence Project stresses the need for adequate compensation to those who are wrongfully convicted.

For more than 200 years, there has been a run on Bay Area real estate — a relentless wave of colonization, then suburbanization and now gentrification that left the Ohlone, the Bay Area’s first people, landless.","“Nobody knew about us,” said Corrina Gould, a Chochenyo and Karkin Ohlone leader and activist. “There was this process of colonization that erased the memory of us from the Bay Area.”","Gould and her partner in crime Johnella LaRose, who is Shoshone-Bannock and Carrizo, founded the Sogorea Te Land Trust in 2012 to reclaim Ohlone land in the Bay Area.","“It’s about decolonizing our own minds and taking back what is ours,” Gould said of their grassroots, woman-led organization. “We are going to be extinct if we do not take care of all of these things.”","In January in East Oakland, on a small urban farm tucked between the Southern Pacific Railroad and the Nimitz Freeway, the food justice organization Planting Justice gifted a quarter-acre of its 2-acre property to Sogorea Te. “We have always believed that reparations are necessary,” said Gavin Raders, Planting Justice’s executive director. “One way we wanted to do that is to put the land in the Sogorea Te Land Trust.”","Four generations of Ohlone shared prayers and songs in a ceremony attended by about 100 community members. Gould and LaRose lit a sacred fire, the first on Ohlone-owned land in over a century.","“It may not look like much or look like it means much, but it’s so important to us,” LaRose said. “Even if it’s a postage stamp, it doesn’t matter. We are getting the land back.”","Attendees led a prayer walk 7 miles down International Boulevard, East Oakland’s main artery, to the Intertribal Friendship House, the community center that is the heart and lifeblood for the Bay Area’s urban Native community. There, supporters shared a meal, discussed future possibilities for the Sogorea Te Land Trust, and celebrated their first experience of liberated Ohlone land.","“We are just trying to say to the universe that we are here,” LaRose said. “We are going to look for these plots of land, and we are going to transform them.”","The group is planting community gardens and creating ceremonial spaces on the repatriated land. Someday, group leaders want to build a traditional roundhouse to bring back Ohlone songs, dances and ceremonies.","Once Planting Justice clears the plot of all debt — about $600,000 in mortgage payments — the organization will transfer the full 2 acres of its East Oakland urban farm to the land trust.","“We want to make sure that the land stays in indigenous stewardship until the waters rise up and make it something else,” Raders said.","Raders is not alone. Word of Sogorea Te has spread, and Gould and LaRose are fielding calls from parties interested in repatriating their lands to the group. Nonprofits, community-based organizations, faith groups, LGBTQ groups and affluent citizens are lending support. Sogorea Te created a Shuumi Land Tax (shuumi means “gift” in Ohlone) as a way for non-indigenous residents on Ohlone territory to contribute to paying down moral debt to the land’s first people with tax-deductible donations — an indigenous twist on the nonprofit model.","In the land of the San Francisco liberal, Berkeley hippy and Oakland radical, support for this indigenous cause is perhaps unsurprising. “In general, it’s beautiful that we are in the Bay Area because we get all of this support,” Gould remarked.","But against a deeper backdrop of land theft, genocide, patriarchy and skyrocketing land prices that make justice more expensive, Gould and LaRose’s woman-led project feels cutting-edge, even transformative.","Beth Rose Middleton, a professor at the University of California, Davis, and board member of Sogorea Te, said land trusts — typically used by private conservationists — can serve as tools for decolonization. For tribes like the Ohlone, which do not benefit from federal recognition and have no reservation lands, land trusts can be especially powerful. Gould and LaRose are using the master’s tools to dismantle the master’s house.","“These tools can be used in ways never imagined in the colonial time they were created,” Middleton said. “You are almost taking [land] out of this capitalist regime to bring it into indigenous ownership.”","The Bay Area first showed up on European maps amid an imperial scramble to control the Americas’ indigenous lands, lives and resources. Between 1776 and 1833, the Spanish built 21 Catholic missions in California to claim Native lands and convert Native souls. By the end of their reign, Franciscan missionaries had baptized 81,586 California Indians and buried some 62,600, who perished from disease, displacement and starvation. Gould’s ancestors were among them.","Under Spanish, Russian and Mexican rule, California’s Indian population fell by more than half, from 310,000 in 1776 to 150,000 when the United States annexed California in 1848. Coastal populations like the Ohlone were particularly devastated.","As indigenous humanity was denied so too were indigenous land rights. California was the only part of the United States declared terra nullius, a legal term meaning “nobody’s land.” All up and down the Golden State, Native communities were left without title to their lands. By 1910, the Bay Area’s Native population numbered just 184. Survivors went into hiding, adopting Hispanic identities to avoid persecution.","Still, indigenous people persisted. A few dozen Ohlone and Miwok, Gould’s ancestors among them, established a small settlement in the 1870s called “Indian Town” in present-day Pleasanton. There, on the outskirts of the Bay Area, they survived in silence. But by the start of the 20th century, the people of Indian Town had dispersed into anonymity.","Gould grew up knowing that she was Ohlone, but her mother’s generation rarely talked about what that inheritance meant. “It’s this historical trauma that still sits with us,” Gould said. “It’s really fresh.”","Since the 1970s, however, Ohlone people have worked to revitalize the language and culture and to reassert their rights to ancestral lands. In the effort to pull themselves and their people out of the historical abyss, they have rediscovered their power.","Gould and LaRose established Indian People Organizing for Change in the 1990s, a grassroots Bay Area Native organization. During the Bay Area’s first dot-com boom, they were contacted by construction workers finding Ohlone burial grounds, known as shellmounds, beneath development projects across the region. IPOC led a series of campaigns and prayer walks to protect their ancestors’ graves and raise awareness about enduring Ohlone presence. “Because of the work that we’ve done with IPOC, we made it cool to be Ohlone again in the Bay Area,” Gould said with a laugh.","In 2011, IPOC led the 109-day occupation of Glen Cove, a sacred gathering place and burial ground known as Sogorea Te in Karkin Ohlone language, slated for redevelopment. Gould, LaRose and the Protect Sogorea Te coalition prevailed, and the city of Vallejo negotiated a cultural easement empowering the federally recognized Yocha Dehe and Kletsel Dehe bands of Wintun to protect these sacred ancestral sites. That was the first indigenous rights agreement signed in an American city.","“Standing Rock and Sogorea Te took a lot of fear away and opened our mind up to what could be next, what could be possible,” LaRose said.","Lessons learned during the occupation of Glen Cove led Gould and LaRose to establish the Sogorea Te Land Trust. This month, the group closed on its second piece of land, a small garden at 30th and Linden streets in West Oakland. The group is also working to build a ceremonial space on its East Oakland property ― a process that entails erecting an arbor and re-creating Ohlone laws and protocols that define what is sacred. “We are transforming the land and the land is transforming us, making us behave, so to speak,” LaRose said.","They have invited the surrounding community to participate in a collective process of discovering what it might mean to be free on Ohlone land.","“We are all human beings on this land,” Gould said. “We need to learn how to live in reciprocity together.”","For more content and to be part of the “This New World” community, join our Facebook Group.","HuffPost’s “This New World” series is funded by Partners for a New Economy and the Kendeda Fund.

Simpson retelling. Simpson’s scandal was familiar to almost anyone who watched the show, but the saga of Gianni Versace, the designer murdered at the gates of his Miami mansion in July 1997, had faded from our cultural discourse, perhaps because the fashion scene doesn’t attract the significance granted to something as macho as football.","So when “Crime Story” graduated from Simpson to Versace, it felt like the perfect fodder for Ryan Murphy, master of sophisticated schlock. Murphy could again explore a nuanced tragedy, but this time he had less preconceived mythology to address.","Does “The Assassination of Gianni Versace” indeed top “The People v. O.J. Simpson”? Not quite, but that doesn’t matter. In both seasons, Murphy and his company of writers, namely Tom Rob Smith, who is credited on every episode, pushed past exploitable headlines to tackle race, sexuality, class and the media.","“Versace” came to an end on Wednesday, and we count ourselves ― reporters Matthew Jacobs and Cole Delbyck ― as massive fans. Instead of revolving around the titular couturier, this was really the story of Andrew Cunanan (played by Darren Criss), the spree killer who executed at least five men ― four of whom were gay, including Versace ― before committing suicide. The cross-stitched narrative turned out to be a smart tactic, even for those of us who expected a show with Versace in the title to fixate more on the Versace empire. Gianni and his sister, Donatella, were background players in a seedy pageant that resulted in an FBI manhunt and a stirring case of internalized homophobia writ large.","Time to discuss!","Matthew Jacobs: All right, Cole, let’s delve into the nine episodes of “The Assassination of Gianni Versace,” a show that not enough people watched, probably because it was very dark and very gay. But those should be selling points, and now that the season is over, I think it’s among Ryan Murphy’s best, most complicated works. Even in its disjointed moments, “Versace” felt haunted by demons literal (Andrew Cunanan) and figurative (class envy, crippling homophobia). Every bit built toward the finale’s unapologetic bleakness ― nothing left but a mausoleum and its entombed tragedy. What’d you make of the whole thing?","Cole Delbyck: Having watched Ryan Murphy productions in good times (early seasons of “American Horror Story,” anything Mary Cherry, “Feud,” that “Rumor Has It”/“Someone Like You” mashup on “Glee”) and bad (“AHS: Cult,” the “Glee” puppet episode, Julia Roberts not fitting into her “Eat Pray Love” jeans), I feel confident saying that “The Assassination of Gianni Versace” is the crown jewel of his career.","The show featured classic elements of his storytelling, e.g. truly batshit moments like that duct-tape asphyxiation sex scene. But it also managed to comment on all too relevant issues facing the gay community today, filtered through the lens of the very troubled and often shirtless Andrew Cunanan. Experiencing the killer’s mental breakdown in reverse was a true exercise in empathy that left us with a portrait of a man who just wanted to be remembered. Now, of course, Murphy has granted his greatest wish, which also feels somewhat troubling.","Matt: The show’s troubling mien that you mention is a fierce and valid observation (as is Darren Criss’ bare chest). Murphy has long adopted a two-steps-forward, one-step-back quality to the progressive television he makes. He gives actresses of a certain age dynamic roles and tells unabashedly queer stories, then he has Emma Roberts call a character “white mammy” and liken her to a “house slave” in the “Scream Queens” pilot. Ryan Murphy is complicated!","In this case, though, I found the whole affair a bit ― what’s the word? ― cathartic. In the age of “Carol” and “Call Me by Your Name” and “Love, Simon,” there’s a poignancy in witnessing a gay man, living in the shadow of the AIDS crisis, wrecked by society’s chauvinism. I’m not sure “antihero” is an apt label, but the series was wise enough not to villainize him too much.","Cole: Greenlighting the “Love, Simon” and “Assassination of Gianni Versace” crossover in 3, 2, 1.","Murphy is for sure a problematic fave who’s had his fair share of cringeworthy moments. “Versace,” however, felt squarely within his wheelhouse. That’s why I’m a little nervous about the next “American Crime Story” installment, about Hurricane Katrina, because he’s at his best when deconstructing the various facets of masculinity and how it can either ensnare or liberate his characters.","Here, Andrew Cunanan became a sponge for the worst society has to offer, soaking up lessons of power, abuse and deceit at an early age from his father, played by Jon Jon Briones, who had some of my favorite scenes in the series. While Criss’ performance deserves all the acclaim and the Emmy Award he will eventually be nominated for, I even more so appreciated the smaller performances from Judith Light, Cody Fern, Finn Wittrock and Mike Farrell. Here is where “The Assassination of Gianni Versace” soared when dealing with figures we don’t know so well, in contrast to the Versace family moments, which were well-acted but clunky.","Matt: Judith Light! MVP. The sympathy that character feels for her husband, whose affair with Andrew resulted in his death, gave the show its most powerful moments. Her refusal to let the police talk her into hiding from Andrew in the finale ― “How many more are going to die?” she demands ― signals a woman who understands how troubled her partner’s existence must have been. As for the Versaces, well, yep. That’s what I was getting at earlier with regard to the series’ disjointedness.","As Donatella (Penélope Cruz) rose to her brother’s perch, the show drifted away from its twin stories of ambition and self-discovery; at some point, the politics of a lucrative fashion house diverge from those of a sociopathic twentysomething. But in another way, the parallel became all too glaring. Gianni Versace (Édgar Ramírez), who rejected Andrew’s kiss and pleas for mentorship, represented everything Andrew couldn’t obtain. Fame, wealth and love helped Gianni to embrace his sexuality. But Andrew failed to secure any of those, and it drilled such a hole in his heart that he picked up a gun and didn’t put it down again until he himself was dead.","Cole: The finale, better than any other episode, brought the show’s disparate strands together in a mostly satisfying way. Instead of ending with Andrew’s self-inflicting gunshot wound, the show lingered for another 10 minutes to examine how all of his victims otherwise would be impacted by his death. Aside from the Versace portion of the story, the other plot they completely dropped was how the investigation into these murders was hindered by homophobia in the police department. Like, raise your hand if you completely forgot that Dascha Polanco and Will Chase were even on this show. Total waste.","But Max Greenfield, who played an HIV-positive junkie who befriends Andrew, has this long-overdue hero’s speech in the interrogation room after Versace is shot that makes it all worth it. “You were disgusted by him long before he became disgusting,” he sneers at the cops after they press him for information about his friend. It reminded me how this show has gifted us with so many compelling insights into what it was like to be gay at that time, whether it be the experience of a drifter in Miami Beach, a closeted and elderly businessman, the world’s most famous fashion designer or a Navy officer struggling with his sexuality. We so rarely get to see such compassionate depictions of gay men on television.","Matt: Oh, precious Max Greenfield ― I don’t like seeing our strapping charmer so disheveled and sickly. But Greenfield got the defining line of the season, spoon-feeding us the overriding theme in typical Ryan Murphy fashion: “Andrew is not hiding; he’s trying to be seen,” he tells Polanco and Chase’s police officers after berating them for only accelerating the hunt now that Cunanan has murdered a celebrity. Everyday gay men don’t matter, just as they didn’t when the federal government ignored AIDS a few years prior. Glitz and glamour rule the day, so it’s no wonder Andrew sought renown.","But that’s also the concept that best served the show’s nonlinear narrative: Hope and despair came hand in hand. One door opened ― romance, tolerance, success, health ― and then another quickly closed, for both Gianni and Andrew. And that’s the real “crime” in this season of “American Crime Story.” Any chance Andrew had of escaping his dastardly father and unstable mother was stymied by a world that failed to teach him how to love himself.","Cole: Taking every gay fiber of my being not to quote RuPaul right now, but I will resist. Unlike Gianni, Andrew absolutely never learned those lessons, and therein lies the power of the effective, albeit obvious, final sequence. The designer is enshrined in eternal glory in his chicest mausoleum you’ve ever seen as his sister weeps over his remains, while Andrew is laid to rest among a seemingly never-ending hallway of no-name corpses before the camera cuts to black.","Matt: And what a stark cut it is, as if every ounce of hopefulness has dissipated along with Andrew’s life. He couldn’t overcome his demons, and he wasn’t clever enough to outwit law enforcement on the path toward a redemption that would never come anyway. How fitting that Andrew is last seen bloody and shirtless, sprawled out on a bed that should have been his haven. Even when the show’s theses become too heavy-handed to bear, there’s a knotty brilliance at its center ― one that’s depressingly acquainted with the stratification of gay tragedy.","CORRECTION: A previous version of this story indicated Wittrock played a Marine. In fact, he played a Navy officer."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab262ce1f00002d0016b09f.jpeg?cache=tT1LxuYfwU&ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"QUEER VOICES","headline":"How 'To Wong Foo' Paved The Way For The 'Drag Race' Phenomenon","authors":"Zeba Blay","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-to-wong-foo-paved-the-way-for-drag-race_us_5aa9f67fe4b0600b830004e0","short_description":"Both became pop culture legend by infiltrating the mainstream with camp and complexity.","date":"2018-03-22"},"articleContent":["There’s a scene early on in the 1995 comedy “To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar,” in which our three protagonists ― Vida Boheme, Noxeema Jackson and Chi-Chi Rodriguez ― find themselves pulled over on a lonely backwood road by a small-town cop. It’s the middle of the night, and they are in full drag.","In an effort to avoid handing over a license that lists her non-drag name (Eugene), Vida (played by Patrick Swayze) tries to placate the obviously bigoted cop who’s stopped them. But their encounter soon escalates when the officer, Sheriff Dollard, asks Vida to exit the car, throws around a few racial slurs and attempts to sexually assault her, to which he receives the iconic reply: “Get your hand off my dick, buddy!”","Vida ends up knocking Dollard to the ground, and as the queens quickly flee the scene, you can’t help but breathlessly root for them to get away.","The scene sets the stage for the rest of the movie, a farcical romp that follows three characters stranded in a small town en route to a drag competition ― and now on the run from the cops. A decade before the premiere of “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” “To Wong Foo” (which happened to feature RuPaul as a character named Rachel Tensions) presented a story that prompted mainstream audiences to cheer for queens on screen rather than simply laugh at them ― a seminal, if complicated feat.","Imperfections abound, but just as “Drag Race” ― which launches its milestone 10th season on Thursday ― has done, “To Wong Foo” triggered a small yet palpable shift in the pop culture landscape by providing a reluctant audience with what it needed at the time: a campy, glamorous lens through which to process its own transphobia. Long before “Drag Race” could exist and thrive as a critically acclaimed commercial television hit, there was this film, infiltrating movie theaters and challenging people’s stereotypical perceptions of queer people.","In the early 1990s, mainstream familiarity with drag as an art form was nearly nonexistent. Sure, RuPaul was already a well-known drag queen with a Billboard hit (“Supermodel” in ’93). But when “To Wong Foo” came out, theatergoers had yet to see “The Birdcage” or “The RuPaul Show” on VH1, both of which debuted in ’96.","It was in ’95 when “To Wong Foo” introduced the world to its queens: Swayze, Wesley Snipes and John Leguizamo. Swayze was the heartthrob, Snipes the macho action star, and Leguizamo the professional goofball. The trio hardly seemed likely, but it was purposeful: the image of the three famous men in full drag on the movie posters appealed to unsuspecting, straight fans comfortable with the kind of “man in a dress” humor they’d seen in older movies like “Some Like It Hot” and “Tootsie.”","An early trailer highlighted the “manly” status of its leads, declaring, “These tough guys are about to tackle the most physically challenging roles of their careers,” cutting to a shot of all three in head-to-toe red ensembles.","While the marketing communicated one thing, the story of “To Wong Foo” was something different ― one that humanized its characters and paid real homage to drag as a culture. Comedic spectacle often took precedence over nuance in the film (the three main characters unfortunately never appear out of drag), but just beneath the movie’s sugary coating lay a new way of engaging with queer stories in the mainstream.","What’s so key about this is that “To Wong Foo” didn’t ask the audience to cackle at the main characters’ expense. Instead, the idea was to side with the queens and boo Dollard, the transphobic police officer who becomes obsessed with tracking them down.","In one of the most subtly disruptive scenes in the film, Dollard sits alone at a bar, muttering to himself, “Men wanting to be with one another ... men touching each other ... their stubbly chins rubbing up against one another.” It’s a soliloquy that’s comical on one level, but also incredibly revealing of the absurdity and fragility of heteronormative masculinity and gender norms.","Still, “To Wong Foo,” as with many beloved movies of pop culture past, is fraught with problematic language and concepts. Written by white, gay screenwriter Douglas Beane, it is chock full of racist quips (especially about Leguizamo’s Latinx character), it paints its gay characters as largely sexless and it perpetuates a trope in which gay men are worth empathizing with only when they “fabulously” fix the lives of tragic straight people.","Indeed, for better or worse, the townspeople who are won over by Vida, Noxeema and Chi-Chi by the end of the movie operate much in the way that the straight “Drag Race” fanbase has. For drag to become cool to straight people, it had to, at first, be stripped entirely of its context, and presented as a colorful and entertaining spectacle. Only eventually could the complexity, nuance and commonality shine through. Acceptance came gradually.","This approach makes sense, and it was seemingly effective. “To Wong Foo” was actually a surprise hit. On the weekend of its release, it debuted at No. 1 at the box office, earning $36,474,193 domestically during its run. Later, Leguizamo and Swayze would both receive Golden Globe nominations for their performances.","“To Wong Foo” was, in many ways, a progenitor of “Drag Race,” a show that now garners a viewership just shy of 1 million. But while “To Wong Foo” succeeded in infiltrating the mainstream by playing on the expectations of straight people, “Drag Race” has transcended those expectations by crossing over to a new VH1 audience without watering itself down.","“Drag Race,” which first debuted on Logo in 2009, has been able to do much more than “To Wong Foo” ever could. Particularly in later seasons, which have included some of the most powerful, patently queer moments in television history. Over the years, we’ve seen the entertaining competition format encompass moments of real vulnerability ― when Roxxxy Andrews revealed on the catwalk that she was abandoned by her mother at a bus stop at 2 years old, when Peppermint revealed her identity as a trans woman, when Trinity K. Bonet came out as HIV positive. Suddenly, “Drag Race” was broaching real, vital conversations about queer life ― everything from grappling with acceptance and rejection to the concept of a “chosen” drag family.","In just under a decade, the reality competition show, still pitting drag queens from all over the country against each other in the search for America’s Next Drag Superstar, has gone from a cult favorite to a VH1 hit and one of the most-watched and most-discussed reality shows on television today.","And judging by the legacy of “To Wong Foo,” it’s entirely possible that whatever its faults, “Drag Race” is carving out an even bigger space for the next generation.","CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article stated that “RuPaul’s Drag Race” premiered 2001.

Bernie Sanders’ (I-Vt.) presidential campaign.","He praised Garcia’s “long-term, true progressive history.”","García, 61, is due to succeed Rep. Luis Gutiérrez (D), who announced his retirement in December. He immediately endorsed García, who was challenged by nonprofit leader Sol Flores and police officer Richard Gonzalez.","Although Gutiérrez is one of Congress’ most outspoken immigration reform advocates, he backed Emanuel’s re-election bid and is viewed by activists as less independent from Democratic leaders than García.","Likewise, while Gutiérrez was a bitter critic of Sanders during the 2016 presidential campaign, García was one of the first elected officials to endorse the Vermont senator. Sanders, who backed García’s mayoral bid, endorsed him again this time.","“Chuy will not only be good on immigration issues, but he will be essentially a young Bernie Sanders,” said Dick Simpson, a political science professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago. “He will be articulate on many issues that are very important, and he is seasoned enough ... to be a major spokesman.”","García, who immigrated with his family to Chicago from Mexico as a child, supports the breadth of progressive policy priorities, including a $15 federal minimum wage, single-payer health care and free college tuition.","Perhaps more important for García’s supporters, however, he has managed to develop an independent base of political power in a city and state where few major politicians operate outside the orbit of Illinois’ famed Democratic machine.","In a career that spans three decades in city, state and county government posts, García has found himself opposite the machine on more than one occasion. Prior to his long-shot challenge against Emanuel, he backed the historic 1983 candidacy of Harold Washington, Chicago’s first and only black mayor.","“There has been a constant struggle in Chicago between the machine Latinos and the progressive Latinos,” Simpson, a former Chicago alderman, said. Of those in the latter camp, he added, “Chuy has gotten the farthest along.”","Chicago Alderman Carlos Ramirez-Rosa, 28, initially challenged García’s status as the most progressive contender for the seat. Ramirez-Rosa is a dues-paying member of the Democratic Socialists of America and one of Emanuel’s fiercest adversaries on the city council.","But concluding that he was unable to mount a serious bid against García, Ramirez-Rosa withdrew from the race in January and endorsed him.","Flores, a founder of La Casa Norte, a nonprofit that addresses homelessness, made national news with a video advertisement describing her experience enduring sexual abuse as a child.

The legislation, enacted during a time of fierce anti-Chinese sentiment across the country, essentially banned all forms of Chinese immigration and wasn’t repealed for more than two decades.","Kwong, whose parents ran a grocery store, quickly became aware of the racism in the country. Chinese-Canadians were denied the right to vote, Kwong couldn’t find a job in his hometown, and barbers even refused to cut his hair because of his ethnicity.","“When I was a young boy, I couldn’t just go to any barber shop. They won’t take me because I was Chinese. It didn’t make me feel good,” Kwong recalled, according to CHBC. “It made me feel that I can’t just go to a certain place or restaurant. I would have to make sure they don’t mind and let me go in.”","Hockey became an escape for Kwong, The New York Times mentioned. And he joined his first organized team, the Vernon Hydrophones, in the late 1930s. He later moved up to the Trail Smoke Eaters, a team that promised its players a high-paying gig at a local smelter. The Chinese-Canadian player, however, was denied the job due to his heritage and was instead given work as a hotel bellhop.","Kwong was drafted into the military during World War II, playing hockey to entertain the troops while also building minesweepers in the shipyard. Later on, a scout finally noticed Kwong’s talent for the sport at a Rangers tryout camp and Kwong landed a spot on the Rovers.","Though Kwong became the team’s top scorer in his second year with the team, he witnessed many other players get called up to the Rangers before him, The Globe and Mail noted. When he finally got the chance to play for the major league team, he was given just one minute on the ice.","“Just a minute. So what can you do in a minute? Unless you’re a real magician, what can you do in a minute?” he told the Multicultural History Society of Ontario.","Kwong left the NHL at the end of the season but continued playing several successful years in the Quebec Senior Hockey League and later overseas.","After his sports career, he returned to his family’s grocery business, retiring in 1996.","Kwong’s legacy in the sports world was solidified by his 2010 induction into the B.C.

He has a passion for the history of military aircraft, but he can’t quite keep up a conversation with new people. When he meets someone, he’ll quote from movies or ask them about their favorite Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle.","His mother, Linda Demer, worried that he wouldn’t be able to make complicated decisions about his finances and health care once he turned 18. So, in 2005, a judge in Los Angeles, where they live, granted her conservatorship over Greg.","“I wanted to protect him,” she said of her son, who is now 31.","But in the conservatorship process, the judge also stripped away Greg’s right to vote. He was not only unfit to make decisions about his health care and finances, the judge ruled, but he also was unfit to participate in the democratic process.","In being declared “mentally incapacitated,” he joined tens of thousands of Americans with disabilities who every year lose their right to vote during guardianship proceedings, according to the California-based Spectrum Institute, an advocacy group for people with disabilities.","Laws in 39 states and Washington, D.C., allow judges to strip voting rights from people with mental disorders ranging from schizophrenia to Down syndrome who are deemed “incapacitated” or “incompetent.” Some of those states use archaic language like “idiots” or “insane persons” in their statutes.","The states that do not have similar restrictions are Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Vermont.","Not only is there no agreement among legal and psychological experts over whether certain people with disabilities should be disenfranchised, but there is also no set standard for measuring the mental capacity needed to vote. There is a tension between protecting the integrity of the electoral process and the civil rights of a person under guardianship, said Dan Marson, a professor emeritus at the University of Alabama at Birmingham’s department of neurology.","“What should we require as a minimal standard?” he said. “There is not a clear answer.”","Should There Be Limits?","Fear of voter fraud is a primary reason why certain people with cognitive impairments are kept from the polls.","Alzheimer’s patients, for example, could be given a ballot while awake but only partially alert, and their caretaker or family member could cast it for them. Or a staff member at an assisted living facility could fill out or influence the ballots for dozens of people with severe cognitive issues.","“You would have people essentially voting twice,” said Pamela Karlan, the co-director of the Supreme Court Litigation Clinic at the Stanford University Law School. “Some people’s cognitive abilities are so impaired, they shouldn’t vote. They have no idea what’s going on.”","Karlan said people should not only express an interest in voting, but also understand what voting means.","A very small number of votes, and in some cases potentially “tainted” votes by people who don’t have the “mental capacity of understanding an election,” can make a big difference in a close race, said Paul Appelbaum, the director of the division of law, ethics and psychiatry at Columbia University’s department of psychiatry.","That sort of situation is not so farfetched, he said. A congressional race in Pennsylvania this month was decided by around 600 votes.","“Imagine if it became known that all the residents of a nursing home in the district voted in the election,” he said, “and many of them were so impaired that they didn’t know what the election was about or didn’t know what filling in a bubble on a form was.”","But in those examples of voter fraud, it’s not the person with a disability committing the crime — it’s the caretaker or family member, said Michelle Bishop, an advocacy specialist at the National Disability Rights Network based in Washington.","“We don’t strip someone of their rights in the name of protecting their rights,” Bishop said. “They are literally the last people in the U.S. who can get their right to vote stripped because of their identity. Having a disability does not mean you are not competent to vote.”","While some may not be able to make sound choices about their health care or finances, they can still understand and participate in the electoral process, Bishop said. The capacity to make choices depends on the situation.","Why a Standard Is Needed","Most states lack a clear legal definition of mental incapacitation, so it’s often up to a judge to make that determination, according to Jennifer Mathis, the director of policy and legal advocacy at the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law. Limiting the vote to people who have the mental capacity “sounds reasonable,” Mathis said, “but it is applied indiscriminately.”","Some judges take away the right from every person who comes before them in a guardianship case, she said. Other judges won’t preserve the right unless the person with a disability can name the mayor or president — something many people without disabilities can’t do, Mathis said.","Without a standard for measuring capacity, people with mental disabilities need to be properly represented in court, said Tom Coleman, the legal director of the Spectrum Institute. Coleman analyzed six months of court records and found that 90 percent of people with developmental disabilities placed under conservatorship in Los Angeles County were losing their right to vote. Statewide, 32,000 Californians have lost their right to vote in the past decade, he said.","“They were being pushed through the system as a matter of routine.”","Coleman lobbied for the California law, which took effect in 2016 and says the right to vote can be taken away only if a court finds “clear and convincing evidence” the person can’t express a desire to vote.","Voting ‘Capacity’","California, in its new law, joined Maryland, Nevada and New Mexico in adopting a standard promoted by the Bazelon Center and the American Bar Association. The standard is simple, Mathis said: Can a person communicate, with or without accommodations, a desire to vote?","“Can you make a choice?” she said. “It’s self-selecting. If someone with dementia can’t make a choice, yeah, that person doesn’t have the capacity to vote.”","However, a 2001 decision from the U.S. District Court for the District of Maine offered a stricter standard: Does a person understand the “nature and effect” of voting? Washington state uses that language in its statutes.","Appelbaum from Columbia University helped create that standard. He argued that people should know what they’re doing when they’re voting — both the process of casting a ballot and the consequence of that vote. If people don’t understand, it could “cast a shadow on the legitimacy of the process.”","The groups of people who are at the greatest risk of lacking capacity are those with moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease, his research shows. People with mild Alzheimer’s and nearly all people with a serious mental illness have the capacity to vote, his studies show.","Vague responses about candidates, like, “I just think he’s good,” are insufficient, according to the stricter standard. But Americans often vote for candidates for vague reasons, such as liking someone’s hair or thinking the candidate would be nice to have a beer with, said Jason Karlawish, a professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. People with disabilities shouldn’t have a tougher standard, he said.","The reason for wanting to vote for someone is sometimes as simple as, “She made me happy,” which was why Daniel Holm, a Nebraska man with Down syndrome, said he voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016.","Mary McHale, his mother and legal guardian, sat down with the then-18-year-old and helped him fill out his absentee ballot, going candidate by candidate, consulting a chart she made about the candidates and their positions.","“I framed it in a way that he could understand,” she said. He reads at a fourth-grade level, and is making his way through the Harry Potter books.","When they finished, he signed his name and they mailed in the ballot. He was proud of his vote, his mother said, joining his cousins and other “typical people” who got to participate in the democratic process.","Getting the Right to Vote Back","An estimated 1.5 million adults are under legal guardianship nationwide, according to the AARP, but there is no data indicating how many have lost their right to vote. There is little movement in state legislatures to eliminate restrictions on voting for people with mental disabilities, Mathis said.","So, in places such as California, Coleman is hoping to restore the right to vote for many others who had them taken away. He’s helped Greg Demer get his back.","A decade after a judge stripped Demer of his right to vote, he had it restored by a different judge bending to pressure from Coleman. He missed 10 years of presidential, gubernatorial and mayoral races, but at the age of 28, Demer could finally vote.","“It was a way for my son to be proud of himself,” Linda Demer said, “and return some of his self-esteem.”","Greg Demer now works at the Santa Monica Museum of Flying — one of his three part-time jobs — working to restore military aircraft, fulfilling his passion for aviation.","After he filled out his absentee ballot for the 2016 presidential election, the first election he could participate in, he put on an “I Voted” sticker. He then gave his mom a high-five.","Stateline home page","Sign up for exclusive state policy reporting and research"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab25fae1f0000380016b092.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Henry Cavill Shaved Off His Mustache And Made This Epic Video In Tribute","authors":"Lee Moran","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/henry-cavill-moustache-shaved-tribute_us_5ab24ab7e4b0decad045b586","short_description":"\"It’s hard for me to admit, this is not CGI.

This weekend brought another stunning example. A bombshell report revealed that political research firm Cambridge Analytica, which worked for President Donald Trump’s campaign, secretly exploited the personal data of 50 million Facebook users.","Zuckerberg has been silent about the scandal. That comes as no surprise. He founded Facebook on a betrayal and, from the start, has self-servingly preached openness, transparency and “connection” while growing his secretive company into a massive data-mining business that now functions as a social engineering and surveillance system without precedent. He zealously guarded his own privacy the whole time.","I know this firsthand. In 2007, Facebook came after me in Massachusetts federal court after I wrote an investigative story about the company’s founding for 02138, an independent magazine geared toward Harvard alumni. During my reporting, I unearthed documents about Zuckerberg and his company. One was Zuckerberg’s Harvard application. Another was an online diary he kept in which he called a woman a “bitch” and described hacking into Harvard’s online “facebooks” to grab student photos for “Facemash,” a website he created that let users rank students by attractiveness. (Some media outlets erroneously latched on to Facemash as the inspiration for Facebook, a misapprehension that Zuckerberg promoted because it gave him legal cover in his battle against three other Harvard students who accused him of stealing their idea for the social media platform and eventually reached a settlement agreement with Facebook.)","Zuckerberg didn’t like that we published these documents. His lawyers sought an injunction to censor us. A judge told Facebook to screw, in more elegant terms.","U.S. District Judge Douglas Woodlock said that when “core journalism,” as he described my reporting, gains access to information, legally or illegally “as a result of negligence or as a result of some improper disclosure,” there’s no basis “for a court to restrain it” without a very compelling reason.","We’ve republished the documents below because we believe that transparency and openness and, yes, privacy are more than mere buzzwords to be used in product rollouts and marketing material. Zuckerberg became a billionaire many times over by harvesting and ruthlessly exploiting our personal information.","There was a time, though, when he was just a callow 17-year-old at Phillips Exeter Academy, rhapsodizing about fencing:","Every Tuesday evening, the bell over the Academy Building rings out and invites students on campus to convene at the Love Gymnasium.

Doug Jones (D-Ala.) used his first Senate floor speech on Wednesday to offer several proposals Congress should pass to help stem gun violence.","“I believe we’ve finally reached a tipping point on gun violence,” Jones said, after stressing that he enjoyed using firearms as an “avid hunter.”","“For too long, gridlock and partisanship have stood in the way of compromise. But I didn’t come here to do nothing. And I don’t think any of you did, either,” he said.","With a handful of Republicans and Democrats listening to him in the chamber, Jones laid out his vision for how best to tackle the controversial issue. The surprise winner of a December special election called for banning bump stocks, the devices used to simulate automatic fire; increasing the age at which one can purchase a semi-automatic weapon to 21; toughening the criminal background check system; allowing the government to study gun violence, and requiring a three-day waiting period for pistol and semiautomatic purchases.","He also proposed instituting universal background checks, with some exceptions.","“We have to require background checks on all gun sales, whether it is at a gun show or over the internet or between individuals,” Jones said. “It may be an inconvenience, but it will save lives.”","Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), who broke party ranks and gave money to help Jones defeat controversial Republican Roy Moore, tweeted praise for his new colleague.","The push for stricter gun laws has largely stalled in Congress after seeming to gain momentum after the Feb. 14 deadly shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida. Lawmakers this week are struggling to include even incremental measures ―such as a plan to boost the FBI’s beleaguered background-check system ― in a must-pass government funding bill.","President Donald Trump has done little to help in the process. He talked a good game in the wake of the school massacre, endorsing several Democratic-supported proposals like universal background checks and an increase in the minimum age for buying an assault weapon. But he has not endorsed any legislation that would do so, nor has he called on Republican leaders to bring those measures up for a vote.","But survivors of the school shooting have helped organize a push for tougher gun laws that will come to Washington at the end of this week. Hundreds of thousands of people are expected to attend Saturday’s March for Our Lives, with similar gatherings planned in many other cities in the United States and abroad."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab2a30a1f00002d0016b150.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"WORLD NEWS","headline":"France Targets Sexual Harassment With On-The-Spot Fines","authors":"Ingrid Melander, Marine Pennetier, Reuters","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/france-sexual-harassment-fines-bill_us_5ab2870de4b0decad0462d2e","short_description":"The proposed legislation will also raise the age of consent, and increase the statute of limitations for rape victims to report crimes.","date":"2018-03-21"},"articleContent":["PARIS (Reuters) - France announced a series of measures against sexual violence on Wednesday, including on-the-spot fines for sexual harassment on the street and extended deadlines for filing rape complaints.","President Emmanuel Macron has said the bill is meant to ensure “women are not afraid to be outside”, after a wave of sexual assault allegations leveled against men in the public eye around the world triggered a protest movement online.","Under the legislation, which still needs to be approved by parliament, under-age victims of rape will have until they are aged 48 to file a complaint, taking the deadline to 30 years after they turn 18, from 20 now.","The law will also set an age - 15 - under which one will be presumed not to have agreed to having sex with someone aged 18 or more. This age of consent will facilitate rape prosecutions, Gender Equality Minister Marlene Schiappa said.","Together with the age of consent, one of the most eye-catching aspects of the bill, whose main points have been publicly debated over the past few months, has been the plan to punish sexual harassment on the street with fines.","Schiappa said the fines, to be paid on the spot by offenders, would range from 90 euros to 750 euros ($110 to $920). They could reach 1,500 euros in the case of aggravating circumstances and 3,000 euros for repeat offenders.","“It is crucial that the laws of the republic make it clear that it is not allowed to harass or intimidate women ... whether in the public space, on public transport or online,” Schiappa told a news conference. “There can be no lawless zones.”","The law has wide popular backing, an Ifop opinion poll showed.","Ninety-two percent of those surveyed agreed with extending the statute of limitations, 90 percent backed punishing harassment on the streets and 69 percent supported setting at 15 the age for sexual consent, the poll carried out on March 1 and 2 for viehealthy.com website showed.","However, critics, including actress Catherine Deneuve, have either questioned how the law could be applied or mocked it as an end to French romance.","Responding to such criticism, Schiappa told Reuters last year: “There is some reluctance, some say we will kill the culture of the ‘French lover’ if we punish street harassment.”","“But it’s the opposite. We want to preserve seduction, chivalry and ‘l’amour à la francaise’ by saying what is key is consent. Between consenting adults everything is allowed, we can seduce, talk, but if someone says ‘no’, it’s ‘no’ and it’s final,” she said.","Schiappa has said street harassment would cover situations such as asking a woman for her phone number a dozen times when she has made clear she is not interested.","The bill will also introduce tougher sanctions for group harassment online by making clear that every single person that is taking part will have to answer for it, even if they just sent a few tweets, Schiappa said.","(Writing by Ingrid Melander; Editing by Alison Williams)"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab28d7c1f0000270616b109.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"WORLD NEWS","headline":"Man Dies After Getting Head Stuck In Movie Theater Seat","authors":"David Moye","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ateeq-rafiq-freak-theater-accident_us_5ab28d2ae4b0decad04634a0","short_description":"The footrest on the electrically-powered seat clamped down on the victim's head.","date":"2018-03-21"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"WORLD NEWS","headline":"Trump Tweets Strange Warning Of 'Coming Arms Race,' Suggests Russia Can Help","authors":"Jesselyn Cook","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-vladimir-putin_us_5ab2b281e4b008c9e5f3b963","short_description":"He also said Moscow can \"help solve problems\" in Ukraine and Syria. 🤔","date":"2018-03-21"},"articleContent":["President Donald Trump on Wednesday tweeted a bizarre and ominous defense of his widely criticized decision to congratulate Russian leader Vladimir Putin, who was re-elected on Sunday.","Despite an explicit, all-caps warning from his advisers to “NOT CONGRATULATE” Putin ― likely because Trump’s campaign aides are under investigation for alleged collusion with Moscow ― Trump called him up and the pair had what he described as “a very good call.”","“Getting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thing,” Trump tweeted. “They can help solve problems with North Korea, Syria, Ukraine, ISIS, Iran and even the coming Arms Race ... PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH!”","It’s not clear what “coming arms race” he’s referring to ― rising tensions between Washington and Pyongyang have started to simmer since Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un arranged a meeting to be held in May to negotiate the isolated nation’s denuclearization.","Meanwhile, Putin unveiled his country’s new, “invincible” nuclear weapons earlier this month and claimed they could reach “anywhere in the world.” He used visual presentations to show off their purported strength, including one that appeared to show missiles raining down over Florida. The U.S. State Department responded by saying the veiled threat did not represent “the behavior of a responsible international player.”","It’s also unclear how, exactly, Trump expects Russia to “help solve problems” in Ukraine. Under Putin’s rule, Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, which sparked a violent political crisis. Putin visited Crimea this month to rally additional support ahead of his election, which Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko decried as “a dangerous provocation.”","And Trump’s suggestion that Russia can “help” with Syria is equally puzzling. Moscow continues to back the Syrian regime’s slaughter and besiegement of its own citizens. Russian airstrikes, including indiscriminate attacks on hospitals and school buildings, have demolished Syrian neighborhoods and killed thousands of civilians in the war-torn country with impunity. Experts say Russia avoided targeting areas controlled by the Islamic State group for much of its intervention in Syria, instead focusing on rebel-held areas in an effort to prop up Syrian President Bashar Assad.","MSNBC national security analyst Clint Watts described Trump’s assertion that Russia can “help” the U.S. as simply “ridiculous.”","″[Trump] says they could help us? What we’re doing is helping [Putin],” Watts said. “The Russians are laughing at us that we are moving back from the world stage, and they are moving forward ― taking whatever they want without any resistance.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab2c2271f00002d0016b181.jpeg?cache=A33w2JIF26&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"COMEDY","headline":"Conan O’Brien Zings Donald Trump In Spoof Barack Obama Netflix Trailer","authors":"Lee Moran","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/conan-barack-obama-netflix-spoof-stand-up-special_us_5ab22b23e4b008c9e5f2ce5a","short_description":"Fake Obama brings the gags.","date":"2018-03-21"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Darren Criss Responds To Fans Who Want His Butt To Nab An Emmy","authors":"Curtis M.

Several of the girls said some of their friends had died in captivity and one was still being held.","The fighters from the Boko Haram group, some shouting “God is greatest,” drove the girls back into the northeast town of Dapchi in a line of trucks in the morning, dropped them off then left, witnesses told Reuters.","“I don’t know why they brought us back but they said because we are children of Muslims,” one of the freed girls, Khadija Grema, told Reuters.","Aliyu Maina, reunited with his 13-year-old daughter, said the fighters “stopped and blocked the road, they didn’t talk to anybody, they didn’t greet anybody.”","“They said people should make space for people to recognise their children and I got my child.”","Boko Haram has waged a nine-year insurgency in northeast Nigeria and neighbouring states that has seen tens of thousands of people killed, more than 2 million displaced and thousands abducted. A 2015 military campaign drove the group from most territory it controlled, but much of the area remains beyond government rule, and insurgents still stage attacks from strongholds near Lake Chad.","The kidnapping of 110 girls aged 11-19 on Feb. 19 from Dapchi was the biggest mass abduction since Boko Haram took more than 270 schoolgirls from the town of Chibok in 2014 ― a case that triggered international outrage.","Dapchi residents said more than 100 girls had returned on Wednesday.","“One is still with them because she is a Christian,” said Grema, the freed girl. “About five are dead but it was not as if they killed them ― it was because of the stress and trauma that made them tired and weak.”","“They didn’t harm us,” Grema added. “They were giving us food, very good food. We didn’t have any problem.”","Muhammad Bursari said his niece Hadiza Muhammed, another of the freed girls, told him the remaining student was still in captivity because she had refused to convert to Islam.","No Ransom","Nigeria’s information minister, Lai Mohammed, told Reuters 76 released girls had been registered so far, while “others went straight home to their parents, but they will come for documentation later.”","“No ransom was paid to them to effect this release. The only condition they gave us is not to release [the girls] to the military but release them in the town of Dapchi without the military presence.”","Nigeria had secured the release “through back-channel efforts and with the help of some friends of the country,” Mohammed said in a separate statement.","“For the release to work, the government had a clear understanding that violence and confrontation would not be the way out as it could endanger the lives of the girls, hence a non-violent approach was the preferred option,” it said.","Boko Haram never explained why the girls were taken, but many Nigerians speculated that the goal was ransom.

Will they?","date":"2018-03-21"},"articleContent":["WASHINGTON ― Democrats find themselves in a conspicuous position on the nomination of Gina Haspel to lead the Central Intelligence Agency. For once, they may have the power and the moral high ground to derail one of President Donald Trump’s high-level appointments.","The question is whether they can stick together long enough to do so.","Trump last week nominated Haspel to replace Mike Pompeo, who the president in turn tapped to be his next secretary of state. Haspel, a 30-year CIA veteran widely respected by her colleagues as deputy director, would be the first woman to lead the agency if the Senate confirms her.","The nominations of both Pompeo and Haspel are expected to encounter trouble in the Senate. But Haspel is likely to face more scrutiny due to bipartisan concern over her ties to the CIA’s use of brutal interrogation measures on terrorism suspects. It’s a fight where progressive groups and human rights activists estimate they have the best chance of success.","As the head of a clandestine base in Thailand in 2002, Haspel oversaw the interrogation of one terror suspect that reportedly included techniques like waterboarding. Another suspect, Abu Zubaydah, was waterboarded 83 times in one month at the same facility, although Haspel had not been put in charge of the base yet when he was questioned.","The torture sessions were videotaped, and Haspel also reportedly played a part in the tapes’ destruction in 2005. The CIA has disputed this, saying her superior was responsible for the decision to do so.","Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, a libertarian-leaning critic of military intervention, is the only Republican to have publicly stated his opposition to her nomination so far. “There’s no evidence that she was protesting against torture. There’s every evidence that she was covering it up,” he said Sunday on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”","Paul’s opposition could imperil Haspel’s nomination if all Democrats join him. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), a victim of torture during the Vietnam War who has called on Haspel to explain her involvement in the CIA’s interrogation program, remains in his home state after being diagnosed with cancer, leaving her nomination with as few as 49 GOP votes in the Senate ― one short of the overall number she needs for confirmation.","If McCain can’t make it to Washington to vote on Haspel ― or if he decides to oppose her ― that scenario would give a united Democratic caucus substantial leverage over her nomination.","So far, however, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) is not publicly urging his caucus to oppose either Haspel or Pompeo.","Republicans succeeded in peeling off Democrats on several votes in recent weeks, giving activists some reason to be nervous about party unity on the Haspel nomination.","Seventeen members of the Democratic caucus joined Republicans in passing a bill last week that would exempt 25 of America’s biggest banks from regulations created in response to the financial crisis that spurred the Great Recession a decade ago. The bill’s supporters say it would simply provide relief to regional and community banks, but the Congressional Budget Office warned that the risk of another financial crisis “would be slightly greater under the legislation.”","Ten Democrats on Tuesday also joined Republicans in defeating a motion to end U.S. military support for a Saudi-led coalition that has killed thousands of civilians in Yemen.","“Maybe it’s too much to ask certain Democrats to be loud and proud against torture,” Faiz Shakir, the national political director for the American Civil Liberties Union, said of Haspel’s nomination. “But at the very least, why not let John McCain do the speaking and leading for you on this?”","Haspel’s critics also want the CIA to declassify documents detailing the role she played in overseeing the practice and alleged attempts to destroy evidence of it.","Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, blocked Haspel’s promotion to acting head of the agency’s clandestine service in 2013 for her involvement in the torture program. Feinstein wrote in a letter last week that the American public deserves to know “the actual role the person nominated to be the director of the CIA played in what I consider to be one of the darkest chapters in American history.”","But she has also praised Haspel as a “good deputy director of the CIA.”","Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), another member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said that he had seen the relevant documents and that he, too, was urging the agency to release them.","“I’m going to the mat to make sure that members have a chance to carry out our constitutional obligations, which is to review nominees on the basis of information that they have a right to have and I believe it ought to be declassified so the public could have it,” Wyden told HuffPost.","It’s unclear, however, when or whether the documents will be released. Wyden made a nearly identical request to the CIA about Haspel’s record regarding torture over a year ago.","Last week, a coalition of 27 groups, including the ACLU, the Brennan Center for Justice, Human Rights Watch, and the Project On Government Oversight, urged all senators in a letter to call on the CIA to declassify Haspel’s record.","“Based on already available records and public reporting, it is clear by her wrongdoing that she demonstrated disregard for the rule of law and fundamental human rights,” the groups wrote in the letter.","The ACLU singled out a number of Republicans it sees as possible “no” votes on Haspel’s nomination, including Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Jeff Flake of Arizona, and Jerry Moran of Kansas. Collins and Flake have shown a willingness to buck Trump and are both close to McCain, while Moran has often sided with libertarians in the chamber.","“I need to do a lot of work on her nomination,” Collins told HuffPost. “I believe that there will be a lot of tough questions that we will ask her at her hearing, and I look forward to seeing what she has to say.”","The CIA signaled its intention to fiercely defend Haspel during the process. In an unprecedented move, the agency on Monday released a bipartisan list of former employees and appointees who showered their former colleague with praise as an “extraordinary” leader.","The list notably included several who served under President Barack Obama ― former CIA Directors Leon Panetta and John Brennan, former National Security Director Michael Hayden and former National Director of National Intelligence James Clapper.","While the Senate has not yet scheduled a hearing for Haspel, her nomination has already set off a round of sharp infighting among her critics and supporters.","Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, a main architect of the Iraq War, last week accused Paul of “defending and sympathizing with terrorists” for opposing Haspel to lead the agency.","The congresswoman, a fierce defender of Bush administration policies, then tweeted at McCain that the CIA interrogation program “saved lives, prevented attacks, & produced intel that led to Osama bin Laden.”","“No one should slander the brave men & women who carried out this crucial program,” Cheney added.","The comment drew a quick rebuke from McCain’s daughter in what amounted to a second-generation debate over interrogation tactics during the Iraq War, which began 15 years ago this week:"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab28c3c2000003800eb293e.jpeg?ops=crop_10_237_2870_2222%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Biden Would've 'Beat The Hell Out Of' Trump In High School For His Abuse Of Women","authors":"Alanna Vagianos","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/joe-biden-trump-abuse-women_us_5ab26996e4b008c9e5f347e3","short_description":"The former vice president spoke at a University of Miami anti-sexual violence rally on Tuesday.","date":"2018-03-21"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"BLACK VOICES","headline":"Michael B.

Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) has been excoriated on social media for suggesting that March 31, Cesar Chavez’s birthday, be declared “National Border Control Day.”","Gohmert announced on Twitter on Tuesday that he’d filed a resolution on the issue. He was promptly skewered by netizens for “twisting” the legacy of the civil rights icon for his own purposes.","In a sharp-worded rebuke, Rep. Mark Takano (D-Calif.) urged his colleague to apologize.","Gohmert, first elected to the House in 2004, has a reputation for inflammatory rhetoric and conspiracy theories. In 2010, he warned on the House floor about “terror babies” ― children he said were being born in the U.S. but then raised elsewhere by terrorist cells. These babies would then return one day to the U.S. as citizens, making it easier for then to commit terrorist acts, he said.","In a statement on his proposed Chavez resolution, Gohmert described the co-founder of the United Farm Workers union as a staunch advocate of keeping “illegal aliens out of the country.”","“Therefore, it only seems appropriate to deem his birthday as ‘National Border Control Day’ ― seeing that Chavez spent his life addressing the harmful effects that illegal migration might have on this country and advocating for a legal immigration process,” the congressman said.","Chavez, who was born in Arizona to Mexican-American parents, did have a complicated track record when it came to illegal immigration, but his stance was not as clear-cut as Gohmert — and other anti-immigrant advocates — have suggested.","In the 1960s and ’70s, Chavez took a hard line against unauthorized immigration and even pushed a campaign urging UFW members to report undocumented immigrants to the government. He reportedly also used terms like “wetback” and “illegals” to describe undocumented workers.","Chavez, who died in 1993, was worried that undocumented workers would push down the wages of American workers, according to historians. He was also concerned about companies hiring undocumented immigrants as scabs in efforts to break union strikes.","His supporters say, however, that Chavez sought to promote and protect the rights of undocumented immigrants working on farms in those earlier years.

Mallory to professor Wornie Reed, who marched with King in the 1963 March on Washington ― on how people can really do justice to King’s legacy now.","1. Don’t whitewash King’s words","“I think we have done a very poor job of honoring King’s legacy. In fact, it has been seriously mischaracterized…. One of the things they teach to the children is King is a man of peace. I’ve heard him speak or preach 35 or 40 times. He only mentioned peace once. He did not advocate for peace but for justice. He used to advocate [that] until there was justice there would be no peace.”","― Wornie Reed, professor on race at Virginia Tech and civil rights activist, who marched with King in the 1963 March on Washington","“Our history books lionize Dr. King as a visionary leader, but in the 1960s he was publicly labeled a terrorist by those in power. Things are not different today with the current generation of civil rights visionaries.... Dr. King knew that he would sacrifice everything, including his life, for the liberation of black people from the system of white supremacy. Yet today many remember him only [as] a vision of black children and white children playing side by side, and nothing more.”","― Tamika D. Mallory, Women’s March co-leader and activist","“Usually individuals fall into what I like to call the ‘three word’ rhetoric we apply to black leaders ― we remember Malcolm X as ‘by any means necessary’ and King as ‘I have a dream’ ... I would just say let’s not render King as the same sound bite we always hear of ‘I have a dream.’”","― Charles Woods, educator with the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute","“The radical Dr. King is less comfortable and less conforming to popular ideas about leadership in the ongoing black liberation movement.”","― Charlene A. Carruthers, activist and national director for Black Youth Project 100","“Just like Birmingham’s firehoses wouldn’t stop King and those who marched alongside him, attempts to water down King’s radical roots won’t turn us around.”","― Ash-Lee Woodard Henderson, activist with the Movement for Black Lives and co-executive director of the Highlander Research and Education Center","2. Fight poverty and economic injustice","“When King was killed in Memphis, he was there to help sanitation workers protest the fact they weren’t getting equal pay. Nowadays you’d have to stand up against women and black people not getting equal pay in a lot of professions. He would be a big proponent of why the unemployment rate for black people is higher than for any other race in this country.”","― Charles Woods","“What would he be doing here now? He would be pointing out that the poverty rate is higher now than when he gave his life for it. What he was working on was the Poor People’s Campaign. His main thing was to go to Washington and to close it down if they did not respond to the demands to reduce poverty in this rich country.”","― Professor Wornie Reed","“A lot of the reasons he was assassinated were his critique of capitalism, militarism and racism. Those intersections are at the core of the American empire today ― the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, how much money is going to militarizing police, how black folks still crying out about violence are not getting resources. I think a lot of his legacy is very relevant in terms of the types of conversations we have to be having about racism, capitalism, militarism and how we move forward.”","― Dante Barry, co-founder Million Hoodies","“Dr. King supported efforts for reproductive and economic justice, he was anti-war and believed in the power of organizing everyday people.”","― Charlene A. Carruthers","3. Stand up against mass incarceration","“What’s the one thing he would be pushing for? I think more than anything else by far it would be attention to the criminal justice system. The criminal justice system has always been used to manage and control blacks ― and it’s doing the same thing right now.”","― Professor Wornie Reed","“His lasting legacy should include the injustice of mass incarceration, and how black people are more highly incarcerated than other races. Someone who’d want to honor his legacy would stand against the school-to-prison pipeline and mass incarceration ― those would be dear to heart.”","― Charles Woods","4. Step off the sidelines and take action ― especially if you’re white","“[King] started speaking a lot about how it’s liberal whites who are the problem. We know how racist folks stand ― but it’s individuals on the fence, who think the issues don’t affect them and pick and choose what they want to tackle. And he was getting really frustrated with those individuals, who would keep the status quo going by not fully standing up against something.”","― Charles Woods","“The work is not glamorous, it requires great sacrifice. It’s easy for many to say they would have marched against segregation in the 1960s, but many have not seen today’s marches against the unjust killing of black people as for them.”","― Tamika D. Mallory","“There’s a performative activism that has emerged in the last years ― it became a fad to be considered an activist, like ‘I’m taking pictures in front of a march.’ I don’t think that would live up to King’s legacy, as someone who was uncompromising, radical and strategic.”","― Dante Barry","“King was dangerous in part because of his ability to call to our attention the evils of society and to shine a light on those who were standing on the sidelines. We are hard at work calling people off the sidelines. King told us why we couldn’t wait, and our job is to wake people up to the fact that we still can’t. Today, we invite you into a radical vision as imagined by black women, as implemented by thousands of black youth; a vision that shifts power away from white supremacists and away from the stall tactics of white moderates.”","― Ash-Lee Woodard Henderson","5. Support Black Lives Matter","“There’s nothing the Black Lives Matter people do that [King] wouldn’t, and that he didn’t. They protest and demonstrate, that’s what he did. He didn’t ask for permission to do it. So if some of them break the law in their protest ― that’s what he did. It doesn’t hold water for five seconds that he wouldn’t support Black Lives Matter.”","― Wornie Reed","“I personally think he would have backed Black Lives Matter. They’re nonviolent, they’re standing up against police brutality ― one of the issues King talked about in his ‘I have a dream’ speech ― and people don’t pick up on that. The things we are dealing with is nothing new ― it’s been going on since King’s era and previously. I think he would have backed Black Lives Matter as a movement bringing light to an issue disproportionately targeting black people.”\n― Charles Woods"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab00a46200000d30ceb25cf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Mila Kunis And Kate McKinnon Are The World's Worst Action Heroes In New Trailer","authors":"Alanna Vagianos","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mila-kunis-kate-mckinnon-spy-who-dumped-me-trailer_us_5ab2aeaae4b054d118df445a","short_description":"\"The Spy Who Dumped Me\" really can't come soon enough. 😂","date":"2018-03-21"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Laura Benanti Reveals The Sad Truth Of Our Bond With Donald Trump","authors":"Ron Dicker","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/laura-benanti-melania-trump-seth-meyers_us_5ab2775be4b008c9e5f36ba6","short_description":"The \"Late Show\" Melania Trump impersonator got real with Seth Meyers.","date":"2018-03-21"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"QUEER VOICES","headline":"Teens Who Hide Their Sexuality Have Higher Suicide Risk, Study Finds","authors":"Carolyn Crist, Reuters","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lgbtq-teen-suicide-study_us_5ab264a9e4b008c9e5f33951","short_description":"The study is significant as suicides have been increasing across the U.S.","date":"2018-03-21"},"articleContent":["(Reuters Health) - Teens who hide their true sexual orientation are at higher risk for suicidal behaviors, a new study suggests.","The study focused on teens who either identified as gay or lesbian but had sexual contact with only the opposite sex or with both sexes, or who identified as heterosexual but had sexual contact with only the same sex or with both sexes.","These teens – who are experiencing what researchers call sexual orientation discordance - have a significantly elevated risk for suicide, investigators warn in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine.","Researchers surveyed nearly 7,000 high school students from across the U.S., asking 99 questions about health and risk behaviors. Two of the questions focused on sexual orientation.","About 4 percent of the teens had experienced sexual orientation discordance, responses showed. This was true for 32 percent of gay and lesbian students, compared to 3 percent of heterosexual students.","The survey also asked if respondents had seriously considered attempting suicide, made a plan about how they would attempt suicide or previously attempted suicide in the past year.","Nearly half of the kids who had experienced sexual orientation discordance – 46 percent – reported suicidal thoughts or behaviors, compared to 22 percent of students who didn’t feel a mismatch between their sexual identities and actions.","Nonfatal suicidal behaviors were also more common in females, those who were bullied on school property, those who drank alcohol or used marijuana, and those who had been physically forced to have sexual intercourse.","These findings among U.S. teens are similar to previous studies in adults, which also found links between sexual identity discordance, depression, drug and alcohol use, and suicidal ideation, the study authors wrote.","“Discrimination, stigma, prejudice, rejection, and societal norms may put pressure on sexual minorities to present a sexual identity inconsistent with their true sexual identity or to act in a manner inconsistent with their sexual identity,” they said.","“Understanding . . . the challenges that adolescents experiencing discordance may encounter will help strengthen overall suicide prevention approaches in youth,” coauthor Dr. Francis Annor of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia told Reuters Health.","“It’s important to know that suicide is preventable,” Annor told Reuters Health by email. A CDC guide to help communities decide on best policies, programs and practices to help youth is available at bit.ly/2IBUNtZ.","The new findings are important “because suicide has been the tenth leading cause of death in the general U.S. population for at least a decade and the third leading cause of death among teenagers - and suicide deaths have been increasing in the U.S.,” said Dr. John Blosnich of the West Virginia University in Morgantown. Blosnich, who wasn’t involved with this study, studies interpersonal and self-directed violence among LGBT groups and U.S. military veterans.","“You can imagine that a huge concern for teenagers who experience conflict with their sexual identity is whether they will be rejected by their family and friends,” Blosnich said in an email. He noted that a recently released major motion picture focuses on this very issue.

Only 20 percent disagree.","Majorities across political lines are in favor of the idea, although levels of support vary. More than 80 percent of voters who backed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election support restoring voting rights, as do 58 percent of those who chose Donald Trump and 54 percent of nonvoters.","In 2016, over six million people couldn’t vote because of a felony conviction.","Even among proponents, there’s less consensus about what a program to restore voting rights should look like. States vary in how they go about it. Some automatically restore voting rights once someone is released from prison, while others require people to complete probation and parole as well. Four states ― Iowa, Kentucky, Florida and Virginia ― require the governor to act to restore voting rights.","The poll found that 53 percent of those who support restoring voting rights at the end of a sentence think that should happen automatically, while 40 percent say the felons should have to go through some sort of process. And Americans who favor restoring voting rights are split almost evenly on whether the option should be open to anyone who’s committed a felony (41 percent) or whether those who commit certain crimes, such as murder or sexual offenses, should be ineligible (43 percent).","There’s also less support for allowing felons still serving their sentences to vote, something that just two states ― Maine and Vermont ― currently permit. (There is pending legislation in New Jersey that would make it the third such state.) Just 24 percent of Americans think those in prison for a felony should be able to vote, and only 38 percent favor restoring voting rights for those on probation or parole.","The idea of disenfranchising criminals dates back to ancient Greece and Rome and has been practiced in the United States since its founding. Supporters say it preserves the sanctity of the ballot box and prevents those who have violated society’s laws from having a role in making them.","But critics say such laws were twisted to target African-Americans around the Civil War. In 2016, the Sentencing Project found that 1 in 13 black Americans was disenfranchised, a rate more than four times that of white Americans.","Voting rights activists have started to look at striking down felon disenfranchisement laws as a way to expand access to the ballot box. Then-Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) restored voting rights on a case-by-case basis to over 172,000 felons who had done their time. Activists in Florida got a measure on the upcoming November ballot that would automatically restore voting rights to felons after they completed their sentences, a change that could affect over 1.5 million people in that state.","In February, a federal judge also found that Florida’s current system of restoring voting rights to felons was unconstitutional.

The pope nominated the Italian priest’s deputy, Monsignor Lucio Adrian Ruiz, to take over the Vatican communications department.","The resignation followed the Vatican’s admission last week that it digitally altered a photograph of a Feb. 7 letter written Benedict commenting on a new 11-volume book series about Pope Francis’ theology. Vigano had asked Benedict to write a review of the series. The photo was released by the Vatican communications department on March 12, one day before the five-year anniversary of Pope Francis’ election.","Vigano reportedly read parts of the letter at a news conference about the book series, and used it to repudiate conservative critics of Pope Francis, who say the pope’s style is a stark departure from that of his predecessor, according to the AP.","Vigano cited a portion of the letter in which Benedict writes that the books show the “interior continuity between the two pontificates, with all the differences in style and temperament.” But he failed to read the letter’s harsh criticism of one of the volume’s authors for “anti-papist” views about Benedict and his predecessor, St. John Paul II.","Benedict’s letter also admits he didn’t have time to read the entire book series, and can’t offer a sound theological review of the project.","The Vatican photograph of the letter, however, blurs the portion where the retired pope begins to explain this.","Most major news media have strict policies that prohibit editors from digitally adding or subtracting from photographs, especially when it alters the meaning of the image.","“Benedict’s full caveat about his refusal to comment on the volume was never made public in Vigano’s presentation, press release or accompanying photo,” the AP writes. “That omission left the impression that the 91-year-old retired pope had read the volume and fully endorsed it, when in fact he hadn’t.”","On Saturday, the Vatican bowed to pressure from the media and from Catholic conservatives to release Benedict’s complete letter. The Secretariat for Communications said it initially withheld part of the letter because of a desire for reserve ― “not because of any desire to censor.”","Vigano referred to the controversy in his resignation letter dated March 19, according to the Vatican News. He said he was stepping aside out of respect for co-workers, and didn’t want to “delay, damage or block” Francis’ reform of Vatican communications operations.","The scandal comes just weeks after Francis condemned the spread of fake news. Francis released a message in January that compared fake news with the “evil” that destroyed the Biblical figures Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. He identified fake news as “false information based on non-existent or distorted data meant to deceive and manipulate the reader.”","The pope wrote that “spreading fake news can serve to advance specific goals, influence political decisions, and serve economic interests.” He added that it was the personal responsibility of journalists to communicate the truth.","“Ensuring the accuracy of sources and protecting communication are real means of promoting goodness, generating trust, and opening the way to communion and peace,” Francis wrote."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab25ebd1e00008e0b7af506.jpeg?cache=gif1XPGO7p&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"CRIME","headline":"'Incendiary Device' In Austin Injures Worker.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) introduced a bill Wednesday aimed at dramatically increasing the affordability and reliability of health insurance plans available on the Affordable Care Act marketplaces.","The legislation, called the Consumer Health Insurance Protection Act, would offer people buying health insurance on their own more financial assistance ― and allow more people to qualify for that assistance. Nobody would have to pay more than 8.5 percent of income on premiums.","Warren does not envision this new plan as an alternative to more ambitious proposals. She remains a co-sponsor of the single-payer legislation introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).","But as Warren made clear in a January speech before the consumer group Families USA, she understands that enacting a single-payer plan would be difficult ― and that, as a result, private insurance probably won’t disappear overnight. And so she also wants to focus on what can be done right away to subject the industry to the type of stringent consumer protections she has already successfully championed in the financial sector.","“So long as private health insurance exists, we should require these companies to provide coverage that is at least as good and priced as reasonably as the coverage offered by our public health care programs,” Warren said in January.","Sanders is actually a co-sponsor of the Warren bill, as are Democratic Sens. Kamala Harris (Calif.), Maggie Hassan (N.H.), Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.) and Tammy Baldwin (Wis.).","Baldwin’s presence is particularly noteworthy as she faces a tough re-election battle this November in a state that Donald Trump won.","The consumer advocacy organizations Families USA, Public Citizen, Consumers Union and Community Catalyst have also endorsed Warren’s bill.","The legislation consists of policies that try to achieve four major goals: increase insurance affordability; provide consumers with new protections; safeguard the ACA from Trump administration attempts to unravel it; and ensure private insurers’ participation in the ACA marketplaces. Some of the provisions apply to all private insurance plans, including employer-sponsored coverage, while others fall on ACA plans alone.","In the affordability category, which features the biggest changes to the health care system, Warren would increase the subsidies available to Americans buying health insurance plans on the ACA’s marketplaces. Currently, low- and middle-income individuals buying ACA plans for themselves and their families are entitled to subsidies offsetting their premiums that are based on the cost of the “silver,” or second-least expensive plans.","The subsidies get steadily smaller as a person’s household income approaches 400 percent of the federal poverty level. Above that income threshold, which is $48,560 for an individual and $100,400 for a family of four, ACA marketplace consumers are not entitled to any federal help.","As a result, some middle-class consumers buying their coverage on the ACA marketplaces have taken a major financial hit from rising monthly premiums in the ACA plans.","By switching to a system where premiums are capped as a percentage of income, Warren would insure that no household is without protection from premium increases. Basing the subsidies on the cost of the more expensive “gold” plans would also allow families to buy more generous coverage at the same cost or stick with a less generous plan and pocket the savings.","Another feature of Warren’s bill aimed at enhancing affordability is a provision capping out-of-pocket costs on prescription drugs at $250 per month that would apply to all private plans. Since the clause targets a small subset of consumers with exceptionally high drug costs, and ACA consumers are already protected with an annual cap on out-of-pocket spending, the number of people who would save money from the provision is likely minor but still significant.","The legislation would also introduce new rules designed to protect consumers from insurance plans that prove unreliable and inadequate. All private insurance plans would be required to spend 85 percent of their premium dollars on paying out insurance claims ― subjecting them to a tighter standard than the one that already applies to ACA plans. They would also be barred from changing the kinds of drugs that they cover in the middle of the year, as well as how much of those drugs’ costs are born by consumers.","Consumers would also be shielded from the effects of an insurer dropping a plan during their course of treatment. And insurers would have to notify consumers if a plan no longer covered a particular doctor.","The bill’s provisions protecting the ACA from Trump administration sabotage include increased funding for outreach and education about enrollment in ACA plans, and tightening rules requiring coverage of “essential” health benefits, which the administration is trying to water down. Like other legislation under serious consideration in Congress, Warren’s bill would also reinstate the federal government’s cost-sharing reduction payments to insurers, which subsidize limitations on out-of-pocket costs for low- and middle-income consumers. (Trump discontinued them in October.)","Finally, Warren would “call [the insurers’] bluff” by requiring insurance companies that bid on Medicare Advantage and Medicaid contracts to offer plans on the ACA marketplaces in parts of the country with limited insurance industry competition. New York already has a similar regulation in place.","Since Warren’s bill has not yet been scored by the Congressional Budget Office, it is not clear how much it would cost. The most expensive part of the legislation is the component increasing subsidies for ACA marketplace plans.","A 2015 Urban Institute study that assessed the cost of a plan with several similar features, including switching to a gold plan benchmark for subsidies, found that it would cost $221 billion over a 10-year period."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab248392000002d00eb2890.jpeg?cache=esrICrwp8H&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"WOMEN","headline":"In 'Margaritaville,' Broadway's Lisa Howard Finds Strength And Self-Worth","authors":"Curtis M.

True to Broadway musical tradition, Tammy’s inevitable self-discovery features a great dress, a high-flying solo number and, of course, a happy ending.","“She really ends up finding her self-worth,” Howard told HuffPost. “You see her go on that journey. I think it’s important to be telling stories that empower women, especially nowadays, because it hasn’t always been the case. The more examples we, as artists, can show in the world, and the women see that reflected in art, the more empowered they’ll feel to speak out, say something, make a statement and stand up for themselves.”","Buffett, Howard said, was a “great presence” throughout the development of the show. “It’s been a pleasure to get to know him,” she explained. “He’s kind of like you’d think he’d be.

She said opportunities for plus-sized stars have expanded in both film and theater in the 18 years since she made her Broadway debut in “The 25 Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee.” (Witness, for example, Keala Settle’s breakout turn in the movie musical “The Greatest Showman,” which turned out to be a surprise hit this winter.)","“I’ve just been blessed to have been a part of projects where my looks or my size don’t matter,” Howard, who also is a plus-size fashion model, said. “These are lead roles I’m playing. I’m not just the funny sidekick or the character actor. … The diversity of the actual population, I feel, is being more represented. I’m glad that I’m a part of that.”","Howard is best known for the 2015 Broadway musical, “It Shoulda Been You,” in which she played a wallflower bridesmaid who takes her romantic fate into her own hands as her sister’s wedding plans unravel.","Many critics saw the comedy, directed by “Frasier” veteran David Hyde Pierce, as a breakout moment for Howard. Her sultry song, “Jenny’s Blues,” was one of the show’s highlights, and has become popular on the cabaret circuit.","Watch Howard perform “Jenny’s Blues” on the 2015 Tony Awards below.","“It Shoulda Been You” gave Howard a signature tune, but the musical struggled to find an audience and closed after just 135 performances. That experience, however, forced her to explore new, less-heralded realms. She was invited to read for a workshop version of “Escape to Margaritaville” soon afterward.","“I don’t fit into anyone else’s mold,” said Howard, who names Mama Rose in “Gypsy” as a dream role. “Sometimes it’s just a matter of persistence. You say yes to every opportunity, and keep putting yourself out there, so that people recognize what you have to offer, and where you fit in.”","Regardless of how “Escape to Margaritaville” fares with critics, Howard hopes Buffett fans, or “Parrot Heads,” will take the time to check out the musical.","“In spite of the craziness in the world right now, I hope they come [to the show] to escape, relax and enjoy a good love story,” she said. “You can take with you no matter what you do.”","Lisa Howard stars in “Escape to Margaritaville,” now playing in New York.","CORRECTION: The original version of this article misspelled Ian Michael Stuart’s surname."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aa986952000002d00eb1ebf.jpeg?cache=NccGCXSSFh&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Melania Trump Mocked For 'Teach Kids To Be Responsible Digital Citizens' Tweet","authors":"Lee Moran","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/melania-trump-cyberbullying-tweet-reaction_us_5ab20b52e4b0decad0454739","short_description":"\"You always tweet as though you've never met your husband.\"","date":"2018-03-21"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"TECH","headline":"WhatsApp Co-Founder Says People Should Delete Facebook","authors":"Josh Butler","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/whatsapp-founder-brian-acton-delete-facebook_us_5ab1c2fbe4b008c9e5f287ee","short_description":"Facebook bought WhatsApp for $19 billion in 2014.","date":"2018-03-21"},"articleContent":["A high-profile tech industry billionaire has lent his voice to the #deleteFacebook hashtag in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica data scandal ― Brian Acton, the co-founder of messaging platform WhatsApp, which was bought by Facebook for $19 billion in 2014.","Acton and business partner Jan Koum, former Yahoo employees, founded WhatsApp in 2009. The messaging app, one of the most popular apps in the world, allows users to place phone calls, and send and receive messages free over the internet. Facebook purchased the app in 2014 in a deal of cash and stock worth $19 billion, Facebook’s largest acquisition. Koum remains with the company, but Acton left WhatsApp in 2017 to start his own nonprofit foundation “focused at the intersection of nonprofit, technology and communications.”","On Tuesday, Acton published a short message on his Twitter account:","It was unclear whether he was advocating for others to delete their own accounts or if he was announcing that he would delete his account.

Far-right militia groups in the U.S. had new targets: Muslims. They were watching and plotting attacks against mosques. One group in Mississippi had discussed kidnapping and beheading a Muslim, then posting a video of the murder online. The increasing Islamophobia of these domestic extremists, the bulletin warned, could lead to “additional harassment of or violence against Muslims” in the years to come.","The FBI was right.","Earlier this month, 29-year-old Thomas McWhorter explained to the FBI why he and two fellow militia members bombed a Minnesota mosque last August. The attack, he said, according to an affidavit, was meant to send a message to Muslims: “Hey, you’re not welcome here, get the fuck out.”","Jury selection started this week in the trial of three other men, all members of a militia group called the Crusaders, charged in a foiled 2016 plot to detonate car bombs at a Kansas apartment complex occupied by Somali Muslim immigrants.","“The only good Muslim is a dead Muslim,” one of the Crusaders allegedly said in a recorded conversation. “If you’re a Muslim, I’m going to enjoy shooting you in the head.”","YouTube removed a horrifying video earlier this month that showed members of the militia group called North Dakota Security Force III% firing guns at a miniature model of a mosque until it explodes.","And last month a Muslim mayoral candidate in Minnesota contacted police after finding a disturbing message posted to her Google+ profile. An account called “Militia Movement” had threatened to “EXECUTE all muslims in America.”","Not only was the 2015 FBI intelligence assessment correct, it also appeared to be eerily prescient. Members of the growing anti-government “Patriot” movement, as it’s often called, repeatedly harass, threaten and plot attacks against Muslims.","The Southern Poverty Law Center identified 689 active anti-government extremist groups in the U.S. in 2017. Of those groups, 273 are militias, heavily armed organizations that train their members in paramilitary techniques.","These groups’ shift toward anti-Muslim violence is especially concerning given wider trends of Islamophobia in America, where the vilest ideas about Islam are lent legitimacy by a White House staffed with anti-Muslim conspiracy theorists and headed by a president who has said “Islam hates us.” Hate crimes targeting Muslims rose sharply in 2015 and 2016, according to the latest FBI statistics.","Which is all to say: Anti-Muslim violence by militias has the potential to get worse.","J.J. MacNab, a fellow at George Washington University’s Program on Extremism and one of the country’s foremost experts on anti-government extremism, said she’s “surprised” there haven’t been more attacks against Muslims already. It’s been frustrating, she said, to see what relatively sparse media attention the anti-government extremist movement has received in recent years.","“I don’t think [the media] give anti-government extremism the same amount of attention as neo-Nazis,” MacNab said. “But it’s more dangerous — guns, plots, shootings, murders ― you name it. White supremacists are more about getting camera time.”","Radicalized Against Muslims","The anti-government extremist movement has existed for decades and has been connected to a slew of high-profile crimes, including bombings, occupations of federal land, armed standoffs with police and murders of law enforcement officers. Militia members generally believe that they must prepare for an armed revolt against a totalitarian and globalist federal government.","These militias saw a surge in membership after the election of President Barack Obama in 2008 — a growth propelled by fears that the nation’s first black president was weak on immigration, anti-Second Amendment and a threat to land rights in the West.","The 2015 FBI bulletin stated that many militia members also felt that Obama “not only sympathizes with Islamic extremists but directs US Government policy to align with their goals.”","Many also subscribed to the racist conspiracy theory that Obama himself was a secret Muslim. John Martin Roos, a fanatical Donald Trump supporter, was arrested in 2016 for repeatedly threatening to kill Obama and federal agents. Roos was a member of a Three Percenter militia group in Oregon. Three Percenters are a loosely organized movement of anti-government extremists with chapters across the U.S. It takes its name from the false notion that only 3 percent of Colonists challenged the British in the Revolutionary War.","“Obama is nothing less than than a vile muslim trash,” Roos wrote in a Facebook post. A search of his home uncovered four pipe bombs, an AK-47-like firearm, a rifle and shotgun, a .45-caliber Glock, and hundreds of rounds of ammunition. In another Facebook post, he wrote of wanting “to incite Patriots to wholesale cleanse our country of the muslim disease.”","“Good muslim = dead muslim,” he wrote in another.","The “general consensus” among militia groups these days, said MacNab, “is that the government isn’t doing anything about Islamic terror so they have to do it for them.”","The 2015 FBI intelligence bulletin concluded that militia groups’ fear and hatred of Muslims was fueled in part by “unfounded claims” and “conspiracy theories” that there were Muslim terrorist training camps in the U.S. (There were not.) The FBI pointed the finger at “self-appointed watchdogs of Islamic extremism,” including blogger Pamela Geller and some right-wing news media, including Fox News, for spreading these fake stories.","This kind of anti-Muslim propaganda led directly to at least one terrorism plot. In 2015, police arrested 63-year-old Robert Doggart, a Tennessee minister, for plotting a massacre in Islamberg — a New York hamlet that was often the focus of the terrorist training camp conspiracy theories. Doggart was convicted in 2017 of solicitation to commit a civil rights violation, solicitation to commit arson of a building and making a threat in interstate commerce.","Doggart had collaborated with a South Carolina militia group for the attack, which he planned to carry out with a “battle-tested” military-style assault rifle and multiple other weapons, including a machete. The people of Islamberg, Doggart said in a recorded phone call, “have to be killed .... If we can get in there and do that not losing a man, even the better.”","“We will be cruel to them,” he added. “And we will burn down their buildings ... And if it gets down to the machete, we will cut them to shreds.”","Later that same year, a militia extremist named John Ritzheimer announced in a video that he was driving from Arizona to Islamberg to confront editors of a Muslim newspaper there. “Fuck you Muslims!” he said. “Fuck all of you! We’re going to stop at virtually every mosque on the way, take a picture flipping them off, telling them to get fucked!”","“We’re fucking ready for them!” he added, brandishing a gun on camera. “Bring it on you Muslim fucks!” The FBI eventually scared off Ritzheimer from visiting Islamberg.","Ritzheimer had been known to authorities previously for organizing an armed anti-Muslim protest outside a mosque in Phoenix, one of many such militia-led protests that have struck fear in Muslim communities.","In 2017, when the anti-Muslim hate group Act for America held nationwide “March Against Sharia” rallies, armed militia members turned up in multiple cities.","In 2016, armed militia members stood outside a Georgia courthouse to protest plans for a new mosque. A Kansas mosque canceled a fundraising event and sent kids home early from Islamic school after learning that an armed militia group was planning a protest outside.","And in 2015, a group called the Bureau of American Islamic Relations (BAIR) — a play on the name of the prominent Muslim civil rights group, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) — organized an armed protest outside a mosque in Texas.","A disturbing AJ+ video at the time showed BAIR conducting paramilitary training in the Texas countryside. “A lot of us here are either using pig’s blood or bacon grease on our bullets … so when you shoot a Muslim, they go straight to hell,” BAIR’s founder, David Wright, said on camera. “That’s what they believe in their religion.” (That’s not what Muslims believe.)","A Double Standard?","Alia Salem, former executive director of CAIR’s Dallas chapter, thinks there’s a double standard in how right-wing extremist militia groups get covered by the media.","She pointed to government studies showing that right-wing terrorists kill more people than Muslim terrorists in the U.S. And yet right-wing attacks or plots barely register a “blip on the radar” when they occur, Salem said. “They bomb a mosque and the coverage is over in a day.” But when a terrorist is Muslim, there’s wall-to-wall coverage, she said.","A Georgia State University study published last year found that from 2011 to 2015, a terrorist attack received 449 percent more media coverage if the perpetrator were Muslim. However, Muslims were responsible for just 12.5 percent of terrorist attacks during that time.","“Given the disproportionate quantity of news coverage for these attacks, it is no wonder that people are afraid of the Muslim terrorist,” the study said. “More representative media coverage could help to bring public perception of terrorism in line with reality.”","Salem knows what it means to be terrorized by right-wing militias. In early 2016, militia members protested outside the CAIR-Dallas office carrying AR-15s, she said.","Around the same time, CAIR-Dallas’ outreach coordinator, Omair Siddiqi, was nearly driven off the road by a man in a pickup with a Three Percenter militia bumper sticker. “Take your rag ass back to your country!” the driver screamed at Siddiqi, who is American. “I’m gonna fucking kill you.”","And on the Friday after Trump was elected president, armed Three Percenter militia members wearing masks circled CAIR’s office “five or six times,” on motorcycles and pickup trucks, revving their engines, Salem said.","“It was really scary,” Salem said, to have “people with military-grade weaponry circling our building.”","CAIR decided to move offices afterward, Alem added, and one staff member suffered a nervous breakdown.","America does not do a good job of tracking incidents of hate and bias. We need your help to create a database of such incidents across the country, so we all know what’s going on.

It’s the first time either one of us has presented anything on a platform.”","“Paradox,” written and directed by Hannah, is a Western-inspired, music-rich film about a band of outlaws hiding out in the mountains. It stars Young as The Man in the Black Hat, along with the band Promise of the Real, which features Willie Nelson’s sons: Micah Nelson, who plays Particle Kid, and Lukas Nelson, who portrays Jail Time. Willie Nelson also makes an appearance in the film, which debuted at South by Southwest last week and premieres Friday on Netflix.","“I made characters that were all jokes on aspects of their personalities … and they all got really into it,” Hannah told HuffPost. “And they got so into it that they began improvising and doing other things. We just went for it and made it. It’s so goofy. Most movies, they talk about having so much footage on the cutting room floor. We basically used everything we shot.”","Young said working alongside Hannah (also his romantic partner) was a breeze. He called her a “real artist.”","“I respect her totally,” he said. “She’s a real professional and I love her work ethic. She works around the clock. She went out herself and bought all of the wardrobe. Everything that everybody’s wearing she bought at thrift stores. … The whole thing was a labor of love for her.”","Meanwhile, Hannah said Young was extremely supportive and even worked as her de facto assistant director at times on the set in Colorado.","“We didn’t have a crew. I had 11 guys to wrangle so every once and a while, he’d be like, ‘Quiet on the set!’ … But he was incredible. He couldn’t have been easier and better,” she said.","Hannah also had Young take on some interesting scenes in the film.","“Imagine, I’m sending him out in the snow with a rug tied around his neck. … He was a very good sport. He had never been on a dogsled before and he was an expert on his first take. There was no stunt double.”","Throughout “Paradox,” Young and the Promise of the Real’s music sets the tone for the journey. They created enough music that there’s also an accompanying soundtrack due out Friday to coincide with the movie release.","“It’s just real music. It’s just people playing. And not to say there’s not a lot of people playing great music out there, it’s just that by the time that it gets to be a record it doesn’t sound that good anymore. We like to have real performances. So everything in the film is spontaneous. There are no overdubs,” he said. “They’re all take one.”","Hannah has created short films in the past, but this marks her feature-length debut behind the camera.","“This is a spitting vinegar, homespun thing. This isn’t something I had to go out and ask anyone for permission,” she said. “We didn’t have any budget or anything. We just did it ourselves. We didn’t have a crew. We didn’t have anything.”","She was able to turn nothing into something that she now says she’s extremely proud of. Young says he’s proud, too, even if he’s a little scared about the Netflix release.","“It’s great that people are accepting it in this age of film,” he said. “Things are so different.

A majority of Americans continue to say gun laws should be made more strict, and a 47 percent plurality still say that Congress should take action to reduce mass shootings ― a slight downtick from 51 percent in the previous survey, but up from 41 percent late last year. Sixty percent say it’s possible to enact new gun controls without violating the right to bear arms, down from late February’s high of 65 percent, but still above the 53-to-55 percent range it spanned last fall.","Nearly a quarter of the public choose gun policies as among the two issues most important to them. Among those who want Congress to act, that rises to 34 percent, ranking it only narrowly behind their top issue, health care, at 37 percent.","Other surveys this month also suggest that for now, Americans are still both paying attention to the gun control debate and more open to the idea than they’ve been in years. A March Gallup poll put backing for stricter gun laws at the highest level since 1993, thanks to rising support across partisan lines over the past two years. As The Washington Post notes, polling has found stronger, more consistent support for gun control now than in the aftermath of the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting. Specific proposals, such as increasing the minimum age to buy guns, appear popular even among Republicans, relatively few of whom appear concerned that this administration will overreach on guns.","Gun control is likely to remain in the news for at least a while longer, as students and other advocates converge on Washington, D.C., this weekend for the March For Our Lives. What remains to be seen is whether the current increase in support for stricter laws represents a bounce or a turning point ― and, even if it’s the latter, whether supporters will continue to prioritize demanding political action.","Use the widget below to further explore the results of the HuffPost/YouGov survey, using the menu at the top to select survey questions and the buttons at the bottom to filter the data by subgroups:","The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted March 14-15 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.","HuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

But many cybersecurity experts say these measures aren’t particularly effective when it comes to powerful companies like Facebook, nor do they believe individual Facebook users have much power over their personal data at all.","But can everyday users do anything to protect their privacy on Facebook?","“The short answer is no,” Bradley Shear, a Maryland lawyer who specializes in social media and privacy, told HuffPost. “Facebook sells your personal information to data brokers, political consultants and corporations, so if you really want to maximize your privacy, you need to limit your Facebook use or not even have an account.”","Mark Weinstein, a cybersecurity and privacy expert, echoed Shear. “People forget or don’t understand that Facebook is a data company, and that is their true business,” he said, noting that marketers pay Facebook for data to create targeted ads. “You as a Facebook user are not the customer. You are the product they sell.”","Many companies collecting Facebook user data are likely doing nothing more sinister than targeting specific audiences with ads for products they might want to buy ― a concept which creeps people out to varying degrees.","“Advertisement, whether for political or commercial purposes, has always been about persuading people. There’s not necessarily something wrong with that. We’re counting on people to be rational consumers and citizens,” Jef Ausloos, a legal researcher at the KU Leuven Centre for IT & IP Law in Belgium, told HuffPost.","“The problem we are facing today is that the predominant internet business-model, combined with massive advancements in ad tech and data science, shifts persuasion into manipulation,” he added. “The basis of democracy and free market (i.e. informed/rational and autonomous individuals) is basically short circuited.”","Facebook has landed in hot water in the past for its handling of user data. In 2017, Dutch and French watchdogs ruled that the company had broken their countries’ data protection rules by tracking users and non-users on third party websites without their knowledge and failing to to provide people with sufficient controls over how their information is used. Courts throughout Europe have since made similar rulings about its privacy and data policies.","Back in 2011, the Federal Trade Commission charged Facebook with deceiving consumers “by telling them they could keep their information on Facebook private, and then repeatedly allowing it to be shared and made public.”","A 2016 report from the ACLU revealed that social media platforms including Facebook and Instagram (which is owned by Facebook) provided access to user data to a controversial software company that helped police monitor Black Lives Matter activists.","The company also faced criticism last year after leaked documents showed Facebook executives telling advertisers they could identify teens feeling “insecure,” “worthless” and “in need of a confidence boost.”","Facebook insisted this psychological information was not incorporated into any ad targeting tools and has cut ties with controversial developers tracking Black Lives Matter activists. Still, many people are troubled by the possibility for such dealings.","Shear emphasized that it’s not just advertisers and corporations that can use your personal information. It’s also discoverable in litigation, as courts can permit relevant social media posts to serve as evidence and law enforcement frequently request data from Facebook. Insurance companies could even use Facebook data to price insurance premiums, and employers and college admissions officers already admit to making decisions based on social media.","And while Facebook has platform policies dictating how app creators should use data obtained from the site, the revelation about Cambridge Analytica’s actions suggest there’s little accountability. Experts also complain there’s not enough transparency around what Facebook itself is doing with the data it collects.","“People don’t know what exactly is going on behind the scenes. That’s the big challenge here. We don’t know who exactly Facebook is selling our information to,” Shear said.","For many people, the obvious answer to these issues is simply to get off Facebook ― a move which may not be guaranteed to protect your personal information but can serve as a point of leverage to prompt change within the company. Weinstein also recommends installing a privacy browser like Tor, using search engines that don’t track consumers like DuckDuckGo and using social media sites like his platform, MeWe, which emphasizes strong privacy features.","But Jennifer Grygiel, a professor of communications and social media at Syracuse University, says getting off Facebook is not necessarily the most realistic option.","“As our lives become more and more intertwined with the digital world through sharing economy apps like Uber and Airbnb to social media like Snapchat and Facebook, the ability for the user to opt out of things is very limited,” Grygiel told HuffPost “And at this point, a lot of users have even been on Facebook for more than 10 years. What are we going to do ― boycott it? It’s not really a reality.”","If you want to keep using Facebook, there are some best practices when it comes to privacy. As the Cambridge Analytica scheme involved a personality quiz app, it’s worth looking at the third-party apps you signed up for on Facebook.","The National Cyber Security Alliance’s executive director, Russ Schrader, recommends doing a sort of tech “spring cleaning.”","“Keep your caches up to date, go through your apps and figure out which ones you don’t use anymore, go through your location data and see who has access to it. Who have you given permission to collect your data?” Schrader said.","To manage the apps that have your data, click the little arrow at the top right of the screen on desktop and select “Settings.” Then click on “Apps” on the left side of the screen. You’ll see a list of apps you’ve authorized and can remove them by clicking the little “x” that appears when you hover over each one.","Schrader’s other recommendations include “owning your online presence” by being mindful about what you share and who you share it with, enabling two-factor authentication and creating longer, more difficult passwords.","“Your personal information is like money. You wouldn’t walk around with $20 bills hanging out of your pocket. You need to value it and protect it. You need to be thoughtful about it,” he said.","Given that Cambridge Analytica’s data collection also targeted friends of users (through a feature which Facebook removed in 2015), it may also be worth taking a look at your list of Facebook friends. Limiting the information you give Facebook can also mean “liking” fewer things, as “likes” help shape data profiles and essentially provide targeted insights to advertisers.","Facebook ― which was unable to provide a comment on its data and privacy standards ahead of publication ― has various privacy settings for users to tinker with, but multiple experts who spoke to HuffPost called these safeguards a “facade” of sorts.","“Facebook provides an effective privacy checkup tool, but it does nothing to limit the data that Facebook sees, or that Facebook decides to share with organizations willing to buy it, or even that hackers decide to target,” cybersecurity expert John Sileo told HuffPost, adding that anything you put on Facebook is “public, permanent and exploitable.”","“The data you’ve already shared on Facebook, from your profile to your posts and pictures is already lost. There is nothing you can do to protect it now,” he continued. “The only data you can protect is your future data that you choose to not share on Facebook. Most of my basic profile data is a white lie.”","Grygiel believes the real answer to the concerns about Facebook and privacy comes via legislation.","“We need these platforms to be held to higher standards, to be brought into regulatory environment that’s effective,” they said, adding that regulators need to take a deep dive into this issue and create more accountability.","There is a precedent for more stringent privacy legislation. In 2016, the European Parliament adopted the General Data Protection Regulation ― a set of data privacy rules set to go into effect on May 25.

Savage had been on a leave of absence from the megachurch since January while an investigation was conducted into his ministry.","Jules Woodson, the woman who went public with allegations of sexual abuse against the pastor in early January, had criticized Savage for calling it a “sexual incident.” Highpoint Church also faced backlash after members were seen giving Savage a standing ovation after he read out an apology letter during a church service that month.","“When Jules cried out for justice, I carelessly turned the topic to my own story of moral change, as if getting my own life in order should help to make up for what she went through and continues to go through,” Savage wrote in Tuesday’s statement. “I agree with Jules that, of all places, we as the Church should be getting this right.”","Woodson says she was abused in 1998 when she was 17 years old, after an event at Woodlands Parkway Baptist Church in Texas, where Savage was serving as a youth pastor. She said the pastor, who was 22 at the time, drove her to a private location and forced her to perform sexual acts.","Afterwards, leaders at the Texas church urged Woodson to keep quiet about what had happened to her and promised to address the matter internally. Savage resigned from his position at the church and moved to Memphis, where he was later hired by Highpoint.","Highpoint Church said its leadership was aware of Savage’s past with Woodson before hiring him.","The Woodlands Parkway church in Texas later changed its name to StoneBridge Church. Larry Cotton, a former pastor at the church, was involved in the initial investigation into Savage’s actions 20 years ago. Cotton resigned from his position at an Austin church in February.","Savage wrote that during his recent leave of absence, he’s come to see that “many wrongs occurred” in Woodson’s case ― the first being his “inappropriate relationship,” which he said could not have come from “mutual consent.” Savage wrote that the relationship was “not only immoral, but meets the definition of abuse of power since I was her youth pastor.”","He wrote that there was also a “failure to follow due process” and give Woodson the investigation and proper response she deserved.","“Admittedly, at 22 and in my first job, I truly believed that I was being guided through proper steps for restitution, which included resigning my position and moving from Houston to Memphis,” Savage wrote. “Those steps seemed significant at the time, and I trusted in the process assigned to me. Only through my recent time of reflection have I realized that more should have been done.”","Texas has a law against clergy sexual assault, but the case against Savage is beyond the statute of limitations, according to The New York Times.","Savage said he is stepping away from ministry now to “do everything I can to right the wrongs of the past.”","Highpoint also announced on Tuesday that an investigation into Savage’s ministry has been completed. Scott Fredricks, a lawyer with the Texas-based firm Cantey Hanger, led the investigation. Fredricks told HuffPost in January that he would study “the church’s actions with respect to Andy Savage’s ministry at Highpoint.”","“This will include both past and current actions of the church and its leadership concerning his ministry, the impact of those actions, and advising Highpoint as it makes decisions about the future of ministry at Highpoint,” Fredricks wrote in an email.","Highpoint reported Tuesday that Fredricks found no other instances of abuse in Savage’s ministry. The investigation’s final findings were communicated to the elders and trustees of the church.","“Highpoint leadership has come to recognize that it was defensive rather than empathetic in its initial reaction to Ms. Jules Woodson’s communication concerning the abuse she experienced, and humbly commits to develop a deeper understanding of an appropriate, more compassionate response to victims of abuse,” the church said in a separate statement.","The megachurch has also asked MinistrySafe, a Texas-based legal team that seeks to help churches set up sexual abuse prevention protocols, to conduct an audit of the church’s current child safety protocols.","Need help?

The suspect then pulled over and detonated the explosive device.","Officials were able to track down the suspect thanks to video footage and witness testimony, Manley said. But police still don’t have any understanding of the man’s motive, or whether he had help. They also don’t know whether he was on his way to deliver the bomb that eventually exploded in his car.","The suspect had been on the police’s radar for weeks but only became the primary person of interest in the 36 hours leading up to his death, Manley said.","Authorities said Wednesday they found a 25-minute “confession” from the Conditt, although they didn’t release the contents of the recording.","Late Tuesday night, just before law enforcement closed in on the suspect at a hotel, authorities said they filed a federal criminal complaint and arrest warrant for Conditt. The complaint, which remained sealed as of Wednesday, charged him with one count of unlawful possession and transfer of a destructive device.","A motive for the deadly attacks is currently unknown.","The suspect’s family has expressed surprise over his alleged ties to the bombings.","“He’s from a family that is so tight, that works so hard to raise their children correctly. It’s just horrible,” Conditt’s grandmother, Mary Conditt, told CNN.","In a statement released through a family friend, the Conditt family said they were shocked by “these heinous actions” and said they were cooperating with the police.","“The family is grieved not only for their loss but also for the loss of those affected by these heinous actions,” the friend, Eddie Harp, read from a statement outside the Conditts’ home on Wednesday.","An aunt of his, who only supplied her first name of Shanee, told the network that her family was “grieving” and “in shock.”","“We had no idea of the darkness that Mark must have been in. Our family is a normal family in every way,” she said. “We love, we pray, and we try to inspire and serve others. Right now our prayers are for those families that have lost loved ones, for those impacted in any way, and for the soul of our Mark.”","Neighbors of Conditt’s parents have echoed that surprise and disbelief.","“It just makes no sense whatsoever, he was a nice kid,” neighbor Jeff Reeb, 75, told HuffPost. “He was quiet, sure, and young. But he was nice, normal as I could tell.”","Reeb said Conditt moved out of his parents’ home a few years ago and got his own place. But he visited regularly and had contact with his family. He was the oldest of four kids, with three younger sisters.","Reeb said he hadn’t spoken to Conditt’s parents yet.","“I wouldn’t know what to say,” he said.","Reeb found out about the death when news cameras came to his quiet street in Pflugerville. “This is super unexpected,” he said. “I can’t believe it.”","Jeremiah Jensen, 24, who said he was close friends with Conditt during their high school years, described him to the Austin American-Statesman as a devout Christian who was athletic and liked to argue, making him appear “really rough around the edges.” Jensen said he and the suspect had attended church and Bible study together.","“I know faith was a serious thing for him,” he said.","“I don’t know if he held onto his faith or not,” Jensen added. “The kind of anger that he expressed and the kind of hate that he succumbed to — that’s not what he believed in in high school.”","On Wednesday morning, about a half mile away from Conditt’s parents’ home, Texas state troopers blocked the streets leading to the suspect’s house, also in Pflugerville. The property was surrounded by police, paramedic vehicles and agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.","Two of Conditt’s roommates were taken into custody by police for questioning. One of them has since been released. The other was still being questioned as of Wednesday afternoon, according to the Austin Police Department.","The individuals have not been publicly identified because they have not been arrested, authorities said.","Pflugerville residents were eventually ordered to evacuate the surrounding area, including parts of downtown. Authorities at the scene told HuffPost the evacuation was “out of an abundance of caution.”","Law enforcement worked to remove homemade explosives from the suspect’s home on Wednesday afternoon, according to a tweet from the FBI.","Mark Roessler, who lives across from Conditt’s house, told HuffPost that around 9 a.m., he saw 10 agents with rifles appear to arrest a man outside of the property.","Roessler, who said he had spoken several times with Conditt and his father and toured the house, said he had never seen the man before.","It’s not immediately clear whether that man was one of Conditt’s roommates. Local police and FBI officials could not be immediately reached for comment.","Few of Conditt’s immediate neighbors said they knew him personally, including people who had lived in the area for years.","“No one here knows him,” said neighbor Jay Schulze, 42, who has lived in the area for 12 years.","“I’ve seen him out there, just judging from the picture from the FedEx office,” Schulze added, referencing a surveillance video that authorities said captured the suspect mailing a package while wearing a wig and baseball cap.","Conditt moved into a dilapidated house on the block more than a year ago, according to two neighbors. The only time they saw him was when he was outside renovating it with his father.","“They were treating it like a father-and-son bonding thing,” Roessler said of the project.","“It was barely standing,” Hector Del Valle, a neighbor who had to leave his house so authorities could proceed with the investigation, told HuffPost of the property. “It was kind of an eyesore when I first moved here. ... I would see them working late into the night. ... Tall, lanky, white kid. But quiet, he kept to himself.”","Debbie Alexander, who has lived in the area almost 20 years, said she had seen Conditt maybe a dozen times. She said she never spoke to him, even though she takes pride in meeting her neighbors. “We would wave,” she said. “He was kind of standoffish.”","Conditt’s Google search history showed that he had been looking up other addresses in Austin and the surrounding area, the Austin American-Statesman reported Tuesday, citing a law enforcement official.","Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) told Fox News on Wednesday morning that authorities were still sifting through the evidence to determine why and how this all happened.","“We’re trying to piece together why is it that someone like this would go on this effort,” Abbott said. “We don’t know if it was a political manifesto, or some other anger about some people or whether he really just wanted to stoke terrorism.”","Abbott said Conditt was unemployed, and didn’t have a criminal history or a military background.","“We don’t know how he gained the skill set to build these bombs,” he said.","Conditt had worked in sales and purchasing for Crux Manufacturing, a small engineering shop located in Austin, until August. He was let go at the time for not meeting expectations, an employee told local station KVUE.","Conditt was described by the employee there as “quiet, introverted and reserved.”","Six bombing incidents in March ― five in Austin and another at a FedEx center near San Antonio ― have kept officials and locals on high alert. Two people were killed and five others were injured in the blasts.","The explosives were reportedly homemade pipe bombs with batteries and smokeless powder, and were created from materials found in a hardware or sporting goods store, an unnamed source in law enforcement told CNN.","Two local television stations, citing anonymous sources, reported that Conditt used the alias “Kelly Killmore” to ship two of the packages containing explosive devices.","Austin police have fielded more than 1,200 reports of suspicious packages in recent weeks.","“We believe that this individual is responsible for all incidents that have taken place in Austin, beginning March 2,” Manley said. He urged people in the area to remain cautious and did not rule out the possibility that the suspect had mailed or planted further bombs before his death.","False alarms have also kept people on edge in recent days. On Tuesday night, a throng of police, reporters and residents raced to the scene of a reported explosion at a Goodwill on the city’s south side. “Someone donated a bomb to us today,” Jerry Davis, CEO of Goodwill Central Texas, told HuffPost at the time. He said that one of the employees there had picked up a device that detonated in his hands.","Minutes later, Austin police confirmed that an odd “incendiary device” had indeed injured the employee, but didn’t bear any connection to the recent bombings and instead resembled “some type of military ordinance or memento” that caught fire.","Reacting to the news of Conditt’s death Wednesday morning, President Donald Trump tweeted, “AUSTIN BOMBING SUSPECT IS DEAD.

Among many queer selling points is Simon and his classmates’ deliciously disastrous rendition of “Cabaret,” rife with the subpar vocal talent, ditzy choreography and infinite passion seen in many an adolescent theater spectacle.","Just as Saoirse Ronan and Lucas Hedges schlepped through “Merrily We Roll Along” in last year’s “Lady Bird,” Robinson, Alexandra Shipp, Logan Miller and other young actors of “Love, Simon” welcome us to “Cabaret” with all of their characters’ amateurish might. It’s only fitting that their exhausted theater teacher, played by “Insecure” scene-stealer Natasha Rothwell, has to remind them that the musical’s setting ― 1931 Germany ― wasn’t as affable a place as their school auditorium. “You’re Nazis! More anger,” she barks in a line Rothwell improvised, breaking up two cast members caught smooching during rehearsal.","The headiness of “Cabaret” makes it the perfect choice for a high school staging, largely because the kids underestimate just how much they don’t understand about their wonky rendering. But, like the Becky Albertalli novel on which it’s based, “Love, Simon” initially had another musical at its center: “Oliver!,” the Dickensian classic about a British orphan who runs away and befriends a gang of pickpockets.","Berlanti couldn’t land the rights to “Oliver!,” so his next idea was to concoct an original show based on the John Cusack movie “Say Anything...,” one of those Hughesian rom-coms that “Love, Simon” evokes. After “Oliver!” fell through, the screenwriters ― “This Is Us” scribes Elizabeth Berger and Isaac Aptaker ― wrote a couple of Cusack-inspired bits.","“The idea was that the drama teacher had penned this musical herself over many years ― ‘Say Anything...’ fan fiction, basically — and putting it up onstage with a bunch of high schoolers was the culmination of her life’s work,” Berger and Aptaker told HuffPost. “There was gonna be a big ‘In Your Eyes’ musical number with a bunch of backup dancers holding up the boomboxes and everything. Eventually, it felt like it was taking up too much screen time and was too big of a notion for the movie to bear, so we decided to go in a different, simpler direction.”","Berlanti felt the “Say Anything...” concept was “too meta,” so he thought back to his own college production of “Cabaret.” The play’s narrative about sexual identity provided a convenient parallel with “Love, Simon,” in which Simon gradually accepts his own sexuality while exchanging anonymous emails with a closeted classmate. Securing the rights to “Cabaret” was a cinch, according to Berlanti. There was only one precept: He couldn’t use imagery unique to the 1972 movie, including the famous top hat Liza Minnelli wore as Sally Bowles.","From there, Berlanti and production designer Aaron Osborne scouted out schools whose auditoriums would provide ample backstage space, where the prototypical theater kid could make himself at home and develop an innocent crush or two. Landing on an Atlanta campus, Osborne borrowed a scaffolding platform the school had already constructed for a production of “Grease.” He built a model of the stage, hanging illuminated red “CABARET” letters in the center ― though Osborne and Berlanti debated whether the sign should instead say “Kit Kat Club,” the seedy nightclub where much of the action takes place. They decided that reference was too obscure for anyone unfamiliar with John Kander, Fred Ebb and Joe Masteroff’s work.","Throughout the rehearsal scenes seen in “Love, Simon,” Rothwell establishes herself as a mama lion who has gone from experienced theater actress to directing youngsters with little hope of stage careers. At first, she’s optimistic, saying, “When we get done, it’s gonna look like a real German sex club. Don’t ask me how I know.” But her hope for an exemplary play is dashed by the end: “I was an extra in ‘The Lion King,’ and this is where I am? They don’t pay me enough for this crap.” Rothwell’s brassy reactions and jaded quips earn the movie’s biggest laughs. In fact, Berlanti captured so many golden moments from Rothwell that he says he could make a “half-hour comedy” from the material left on the cutting-room floor.","As for that German sex club, the 3D letters suspended from the ceiling on Osborne’s model fell one day, inspiring a gag that made its way into the movie: During the big opening-night performance, the “Cabaret” sign comes crashing down, nearly hitting a student in the head and capping off a comically disastrous venture with electrical sparks that were added in post-production.","To get to the scene with the descending sign, Berlanti worked with choreographer Zach Woodlee, his former collaborator on the ABC legal dramedy “Eli Stone” and the Katherine Heigl movie “Life as We Know It.” They staged the kind of imperfect dance routines familiar to any high school troupe. Shepherding teen ensembles ― or, rather, adults portraying teens ― was familiar territory for Woodlee, who choreographed five seasons of “Glee.” One crucial difference: The numbers on “Glee” were meant to look polished, whereas this needed to be scrappy and unrefined.","Even the music Woodlee was working with had a crude feel. A “Love, Simon” producer commissioned a pre-recorded soundtrack featuring first-rate singers, but Berlanti thought it sounded too professional. Instead, he had the cast record individual voice tracks, no matter their aptitude, which is what we now hear the students singing in the movie. Robinson only agreed to participate if Berlanti sang alongside him, so Berlanti counts “Love, Simon” as the first time he has appeared in a project he helmed. (Berlanti previously wrote and directed the lovely gay friendship dramedy “The Broken Hearts Club,” and he has written for numerous TV series including “Dawson’s Creek,” “Everwood,” “The Flash” and “Supergirl.”)","Woodlee spent only a day rehearsing the cast’s opening-night dance scene ― the one with the tumbling sign.","“With the choreography cues, there were different times when, with singing or dancing, they would mess up and say, ‘Oh, I want to try it again,’ and I would be like, ‘Oh no, that’s perfect,’” Berlanti said, again emphasizing that glitches were paramount.","Still, by premiere time, we’re meant to glean that most of the hiccups are out of the way, even if that sign threatens to take a few dancers down with it.","“High school productions are the one thing that can be inherently campy,” Berlanti said. “They can be gloriously bad and gloriously wonderful, all at the same time. I think that’s the true magic behind how we choreographed it and talked about it. You’re showing how awful it can be, but at the same time their exuberance is more pure than any performers in the world because they love that they’re getting to do this.”","And fear not: There’s still hope for that “Say Anything...” adaptation. “Perhaps one day we will partner up with Greg again and bring the world ‘Say Anything...: The Musical,’” Berger and Aptaker said. “Or maybe ‘Say Anything...’ on ice?”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab157f71f0000150316af7d.jpeg?cache=4LtioHAAd2&ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"IMPACT","headline":"Farmworkers Call Out Wendy’s For Failure To Act On Sexual Abuse And Harassment","authors":"Kari Lydersen, On assignment for HuffPost","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/wendys-farmworkers-times-up_us_5aafd0eee4b0697dfe18da99","short_description":"The fast food chain maintains that its own \"rigorous\" internal auditing system protects workers from abuse.","date":"2018-03-21"},"articleContent":["NEW YORK — Marching through Manhattan waving a yellow flag, amid people carrying colorful cardboard bushels of tomatoes, Antonia Martinez raised her voice. She was demanding decent working conditions and an end to sexual harassment and violence in farm fields.","The message came through loud and clear as the group of farmworkers and their allies took over streets during rush hour on March 15, reminding passersby that female farmworkers are especially vulnerable to sexual harassment and violence, and deserve to be part of the reckoning sweeping other industries in the Me Too era.","For years, Martinez said, she and other women who picked tomatoes in Florida were unable to fight against sexual harassment they experienced because “we had no support, we had nowhere to turn.”","“The managers — Americans — wanted to have rights over the women who worked there. They asked for sexual favors, and if women didn’t comply they wouldn’t have a job the next day,” Martinez, 48, said in Spanish. She has worked in Florida fields for 15 years.","The Coalition of Immokalee Workers, a farmworker-led organization, has been transforming the tomato industry in Florida and other Southern states. It has convinced major corporations — the likes of McDonald’s, Walmart, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, and KFC — to sign binding agreements to participate in the Fair Food Program, an independent monitoring and enforcement operation run through a partnership between farm owners, farmworkers and retail food companies.","One fast food behemoth has remained outside, however: Wendy’s. For two years, the Coalition has been calling for a boycott of the company. Together with its allies, it is demanding that the Ohio-headquartered burger chain sign on to the Fair Food Program to address sexual harassment and other abuses it says workers likely endure while picking tomatoes destined for Wendy’s salads and hamburgers.","Wendy’s used to buy its tomatoes from Florida growers, but a few years ago shifted to buying from Mexico in winter, said company spokesperson Heidi Schauer. Schauer said the change was made because Mexico provides higher-quality vine-ripened tomatoes in the winter, the prime time for Florida tomatoes. In warmer months, she said, Wendy’s buys tomatoes from states including California, Georgia, South Carolina and Virginia. (Several growers in Georgia, South Carolina and Virginia are part of the Fair Food Program.)","But Coalition leaders point to reports including a 2014 Los Angeles Times series exposing child labor, forced labor, sexual harassment, horrific living conditions and other abuses in Mexican fields. They say Wendy’s needs to buy tomatoes from operations where it can be sure workers are treated justly.","The New York City march this month focused specifically on the sexual abuse faced by female farmworkers that the Coalition says often goes unchecked. The demonstration followed a five-day fast by farmworkers and supporters, who spent the time camped outside the offices of Wendy’s board chairman and hedge fund investor Nelson Peltz.","During discussions and speeches on the busy Park Avenue sidewalk, workers described how the Fair Food Program, which includes worker protections like the ability to take breaks and take days off without losing a job, has become a model for various industries to give workers a genuine way to address injustices and unsafe conditions without fear of retaliation.","“We’ve seen more respect for workers. Now we’re treated like people, not machines,” said Nelly Rodriguez, 43, a coalition member who has worked in Florida fields for 12 years.","Wendy’s, one of the world’s largest fast food chains, has long maintained that its own “rigorous” internal auditing system protects workers from abuse, and that a comprehensive Supplier Code of Conduct upholds standards for suppliers.","“There’s no new news here, aside from the CIW trying to exploit the positive momentum that has been generated by and for women in the #MeToo and Time’s Up movement to advance their interests,” said Schauer.","The Coalition of Immokalee Workers was born 25 years ago in central Florida as a way to fight against rampant abuses of immigrant farmworkers — including cases of modern-day slavery, which the coalition worked with the FBI to prosecute.","The group gained national prominence and support with its campaign to pressure Taco Bell’s parent company, Yum! Brands, to pay one cent more per pound of tomatoes which succeeded in 2005. The raise — amounting to a 20 to 35 percent weekly pay increase — was passed on to farmworkers, and used to protect them from wage theft and abuse.","Prominent fast food and grocery chains buy produce from an array of little-known farmers across the U.S. Since the grocery and fast food companies have a public face and image to uphold, the Coalition appeals to their sense of corporate responsibility to demand they ensure their suppliers treat workers fairly.","After Taco Bell, the Coalition convinced one company after another to sign agreements ensuring wage increases and protections, with the Fair Food Program eventually providing a vehicle for monitoring and enforcement.","In the six years since the Fair Food Program’s inception, the Fair Food Standards Council, the third party which monitors and enforces the program, says 1,600 worker complaints have been successfully resolved, workers have recovered $250,000 in unpaid wages, 36 supervisors have been disciplined for sexual harassment and 12 of those supervisors have been terminated from their jobs.","Workers are guaranteed breaks, access to shade, and can take days off without losing their jobs. In those years, workers have also received $26 million through the increased pay rate mandated through the program. Farms growing tomatoes, strawberries and peppers in seven states, including the vast majority of tomato operations in Florida, are now part of the Fair Food Program.","Speaking at the camp outside Peltz’s offices, Coalition leaders demanded Wendy’s share data showing how many complaints they have received and investigated under their system, and the outcome. Schauer, the chain’s spokesperson, didn’t respond to a question about such data.","At the “Freedom Fast” camp, Immokalee workers were joined by leaders of other worker organizations demanding justice and protections. The Coalition of Immokalee Workers is part of the larger Food Chain Workers Alliance, which brings together workers in farming, warehousing, shipping, restaurant, grocery and other industries — every step of the food chain.","Gerardo Reyes-Chavez, a Coalition of Immokalee Workers organizer, told the crowd in New York that the Coalition is meeting with workers from other industries, including cleaning and chicken processing, to help translate the model to those sectors.","The Coalition is part of the Worker-Driven Social Responsibility Network, which facilitates such efforts. Sean Sellers, director of strategic partnerships for that organization, pointed to the Bangladesh Accord on Fire and Building Safety, a legally binding agreement between clothing brands and labor unions created in the wake of a deadly garment factory fire and building collapse which killed more than 1,000 people. He said network members have been collaborating with Bangladeshi and other international labor rights organizers to promote similar legally binding contracts between brands and workers.","Sellers noted that clothing or electronic brands’ attempts to distance themselves from conditions in the plants where their products are made mirror the response of restaurants and grocery stores on farming conditions.","“The corporations’ response is the same, to say, ‘trust us, we’ve got this under control,’” Sellers said. “So you’re seeing a battle between two different models, one designed by the workers involving enforceable contracts with brands, and on the other hand, corporations’ model where compliance is voluntary, workers have no role and there’s no transparency ... This isn’t just a fight between the CIW and a fast food restaurant. This is at the very heart of what corporate responsibility looks like in the 21st century.”","For more content and to be part of the ‘This New World’ community, join our Facebook Group.","HuffPost’s ‘This New World’ series is funded by Partners for a New Economy and the Kendeda Fund.

This was ― and still is ―“ Father’s Kingdom,” and a new documentary tells this amazing though largely forgotten story.","Currently on the festival circuit, the documentary explores the International Peace Mission, a movement that reached heights in the 1930s and slowly began to dwindle after the 1965 death of its controversial founder, “Father Divine” ― a man who called himself god.","“It was like being in another world,” said the film’s director Lenny Feinberg, whose other work includes documentaries like “The Art of the Steal,” “Black and White” and “Dead All Over.”","“[The Mission] lives in a very secluded, isolated venue and they have no focus other than being a follower of Father Divine. Just learning about his impact was amazing,” he said.","Father Divine was also an advocate for anti-lynching laws and desegregation, using both of these campaigns to influence the Mission’s core beliefs. He had both black and white supporters and often held rallies that inspired his followers to take part in the civil rights movement.","Researchers believe Father Divine’s given name was George Baker, but he refuted the name as blasphemous hearsay, saying infamously that “God has no mother” and therefore has no origin. No one has verified Father Divine’s real name. In a major victory for the movement, in 1973, eight years after Father’s passing, the Peace Mission requested the Library of Congress remove the name “George Baker” from its records altogether.","“[Father] was empowering people in their lives in a way that some people, of course, are afraid of, you know, because of the enormous pull of a religion like this in terms of attracting people and keeping them,” said Dr. Leonard Primiano, a professor of religious studies at Philadelphia’s Cabrini University.","The voices of Father’s longtime followers ― many of whom still live on the Philadelphia estate in the Main Line ― drive the narrative in “Father’s Kingdom.” Now advancing in age, they tell the complicated history of the mission and explain their sometimes controversial beliefs.","In a broad sense, they can be categorized as a communal religion based on Christian ideology. Like some Christian churches, they forbid alcohol and drugs, promote modesty laws and practice celibacy.","But they also heavily differ from the Christian norm. They prefer to say “peace” instead of “hello” because the latter has the word “hell” in it. Father also required followers to cut ties with their families because, as stated in Matthew 16:24, “Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me.”","And unlike other Christian sects, the Mission doesn’t believe in heaven. Instead, as follower Dr. Christopher Stewart said, heaven is something here on Earth.","“The kingdom is a tangible thing and the followers have taken that so seriously and have really manifested extraordinary things,” he said in an interview with HuffPost.","The documentary, in its examination of the mission’s history, follows the history of a man and mission who fought against segregation, fed and empowered the poor and believed that God was here on Earth. Through this film the movement’s impact is tangible.","“Father’s Kingdom” has been scheduled at multiple festivals including: The Cleveland International Film Festival, The Salem Film Fest, The Charlotte Black Film Festival, Big Sky Film Festival in Montana, and Doc NYC."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aafd6b01e00008e0b7af1c6.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Luke Bryan Defends Katy Perry Over 'Uncomfortable' American Idol Kiss","authors":"Carly Ledbetter","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/luke-bryan-defends-katy-perry-over-uncomfortable-american-idol-kiss_us_5ab2a4a8e4b008c9e5f3ab44","short_description":"“It’s unfortunate that stuff like that turns into a story that big.\"","date":"2018-03-21"},"articleContent":["Luke Bryan thinks it’s “unfortunate” that Katy Perry’s controversial kiss on “American Idol” last week turned into such a big deal.","The “Chained to the Rhythm” singer faced backlash after she kissed a 19-year-old Idol contestant, Benjamin Glaze, who said he’d never been kissed.

The government launched an operation to retake rebel-held areas of Ghouta in February, ramping up a bombing campaign and blocking medical help and food from entering the region.","Amnesty International claims more than 500 civilians have been killed in recent months in a “catastrophic humanitarian situation,” while thousands more have been injured. The Syrian Network for Human Rights, based in Britain, claimed in a February report that nearly 13,000 people had been killed in the region since 2011. Hospitals, schools and places of worship are among the buildings that have been damaged by bombings.","United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said last month that the 400,000 people trapped in eastern Ghouta were living “in hell on earth,” as the U.N. unanimously voted in support of a 30-day ceasefire in Syria and the lifting of the siege on Ghouta. However, calls for a cease-fire have been ignored ― indeed, reports claimed more than 100 were killed in the week following the resolution.","Abdelkarim Ibrahim, an aid worker partnered with Save the Children, is working in eastern Ghouta to distribute winter kits to civilians. Through a translator, he told HuffPost of the “hysterical panic” experienced by people trapped in the region in the face of “constant airstrikes, barrel bombs and artillery bombardment.”","“There has been a devastating deterioration in quality of life for Ghouta’s population,” he said from Syria.","“The civilians of eastern Ghouta have never witnessed such a battering campaign where ... more than 4,200 airstrikes over the city of eastern Ghouta were launched. A city with a total area of 107 square kilometers [about 41 square miles] and 400,000 inhabitants has been battered by more than 4,200 airstrikes.”","Ibrahim says the cease-fire conditions have effectively been trimmed back to just a two-hour window each day before military action resumes. He said this was not enough time for aid workers to enter and bring medical help or food. Civilians are sheltering from bombs in inadequate, overcrowded and unsanitary basements.","“The internal refugees lack the minimal essentials of human life ― food, medicine and clothes. Currently, all the people of Ghouta live in basements unequipped with the basics needed for living,” he said.","“The basements are prisons for the masses ... . Such abject lack of cleanliness and health care facilities, such as water and personal hygiene equipment, have led to the spread of epidemics and other related issues, such as lice among children. The shortage of medicine for people with chronic diseases, such as diabetes and high blood pressure, has led to deaths. People with kidney disease are unable to have lifesaving dialysis sessions in Ghouta.","“There is difficulty in burying dead bodies. The city’s graveyards are among the targeted areas by the bombardment, which makes it impossible for people to bury the bodies of the dead. In Douma people had to bury the dead in public parks and in the backyards of houses because it was not possible for them to make it to the city’s graveyard.”","Ibrahim claimed people around the world had ignored the situation in Syria, saying the aid being pledged to, and reaching, eastern Ghouta was “an embarrassment to the world.” He claimed assistance reaching those in Ghouta was enough for only 6 percent of the city’s population.","“There is a growing inability of local aid agencies to provide aid to civilians. Food and medicine stores have been bombarded, and the work locations of humanitarian organisations have been targeted by attacking forces,” he said, adding that food stores and medical facilities had been damaged.","“It is an option for people in other countries of the world to pressure their governments and the human rights organizations into taking a collaborative stand against the mass killing of civilians in Eastern Ghouta. Their success would save hundreds of thousands of people from the wholesale slaughter witnessed by a motionless world.","“They are just like any other people around the world.

In 1984, as a rookie reporter in Trenton, New Jersey, I convinced my editors to send me to Rancho Rajneesh on assignment. At the time, the Rajneeshees were slipping into Trenton and other cities and enticing hundreds of homeless men and women to move across the country to Bhagwan’s Oregon paradise. With promises of free food, free beer and a life free of crime, the Rajneeshees explained that they were just humanitarians helping to address America’s shameful homeless epidemic. In reality, as later reporting and the Netflix series revealed, the cult was simply importing the homeless to pack local voting rolls and control local elections.","In the winter of 1984, Rancho Rajneesh was bustling, with a private airport, a teeming shopping center, the 145-room Hotel Rajneesh and enough heated A-frame cabins to accommodate thousands of red-clad sannyasins. The Rajneeshees had selected this spot carefully, purchasing 100 square miles of rugged Oregon rangeland for the privacy and protection the former “Big Muddy Ranch” provided. Everywhere, the propaganda and groupthink was overwhelming. The Rajneeshees celebrated the coming of dawn and dusk by bowing to Bhagwan and singing for him, as he slowly cruised by in one of his 90+ Rolls-Royces. In the evenings, thousands gathered in rapt attention to watch two-hour-long videotapes of Bhagwan’s hypnotic discourses. His photos were plastered everywhere, and, in the commune bookstore, only one author’s works were on sale.","I was escorted around the well-armed property by an outgoing spokeswoman, Ma Dhyan Rosalie, formerly Rosalie Rosenberg of Scottsdale, and allowed to interview formerly homeless New Jersey transplants. Soon after, I set out to locate Dara Burrows, the one-time Bennington College co-ed.","Just before my reporting trip, Dara’s mother, Sandra, sat with me in her historic home outside Princeton. Her story was devastating. First, her husband, David Burrows, left her. He had been a tenured literature professor at Rutgers University, and the couple had four children together. David met Rajneesh on a trip to India in 1978, and the experience was profound. Back on the Rutgers campus, David began dressing in orange, wearing a beaded necklace with Bhagwan’s photo on it and insisting that he be called Swami Das Anudas. University life soon lost its hold, and Davis moved to India to be with Bhagwan full-time.","Just as Sandra was recovering from that shock, David gave his daughter, Dara, a collection of Bhagwan’s speeches. Dara was hooked immediately by his promise of “a new way of being,” his rejection of the “institutional, rigid ways of society,” and she booked a trip to India to meet the guru.","“Her father gave her the money. It just kind of happened, kind of quietly, without me being privy to the decision,” Sandra told me, as I recounted in a New Jersey Monthly Magazine feature story in 1986.","Mere weeks later, the terse postcard arrived back home. Dara, the Princeton Day School graduate, had become Ma Prem Dara and joined her father in the cult. “All through my childhood I thought I was the odd one,” Dara told me back then. “When I met Bhagwan he was just saying everything I was feeling all my life. It was like I could breathe ... ”","Sandra banded together with her two younger children, and especially her teenage son, Jamie. But she knew Dara was gone. “It was a terrible shock. I wanted her to go back to school, if not Bennington then somewhere. But there was no way I was going to influence her,” she said.","For five years, the Burrows children resigned themselves to the loss of their father and oldest sister. Then, in the summer of 1984, 22-year-old Jamie accepted an invitation to visit Rancho Rajneesh, where Dara and David had moved. Improbably, the Burrows’ youngest son also fell under the spell. When I interviewed Jamie, Dara and David together at the commune in 1984, Jamie was wearing the traditional Bhagwan “mala” necklace and introduced himself to me as Swami Anand Brahma. “The all-American family,” one sannyasin quipped, as she passed by our table.","Back home, Sandra was “emotional, weeping at the dining room table,” a family friend recalled. In desperation, Sandra called a cult psychologist to win her son back. “I didn’t know what I could do. He’s not a child. He hasn’t been kidnapped,” she told me for the New Jersey Monthly article.","Less than nine months after my visit, the cult imploded. Bhagwan’s top aide, the vicious Ma Anand Sheela, quit and ran off to Europe under a cloud. After a three-and-a-half-year period of self-imposed silence, an enraged Bhagwan gathered the media to denounce her. “Sheela and her group tried to kill three people,” Bhagwan said. “These people are absolute criminals.” Fearing arrest himself, Rajneesh boarded a Lear Jet and tried to flee the country. He was arrested and jailed, and pleaded guilty to immigration crimes in exchange for a big fine and deportation. State and federal investigators rushed in, and once-loyal insiders easily flipped. As The Oregonian reported in a 2017 series, “Rajneeshees piled into court, admitting criminal conduct on behalf of the sect. The charges included attempted murder, assault, arson, immigration fraud, wiretapping and conspiracy.” Sheela and the worst of the offenders did federal prison time.","Back at the commune, the residents of Rancho Rajneesh glumly packed their bags. The Rolls-Royces were auctioned off in Texas, and Jamie, Dara and David Burrows began planning for an uncertain future.","I reached out to the Burrows family last month, and all the old wounds still seemed fresh. I learned that Jamie works in finance now and didn’t want to discuss his brief time at the commune. Dara married, raised a family and for 22 years has served as a senior editor for a scientific nonprofit. She’s made peace with her mother, for whom the abandonment is hard to forget. “I’ve come back into the fold, but she always fears I could leave,” Dara said in a recent interview. “I’m making a really strong effort to be in constant contact with her and show her how much I really love her.”","Dara agreed to talk for the first time in three decades because, she said, she has nothing to hide. When we spoke last week, she said she was looking forward to watching “Wild Wild Country,” but added that she and most Rajneeshees were unaware of the serious crimes that took place at the commune. “I don’t have shame about becoming a sannyasin or going to India or to the ranch,” she said. “But I do have shame about being associated with an organization that did such horrific things and hurt so many people.”","Looking back, she admits that her fellow cult members “spread the illusion of us versus them, and how dangerous it was to leave the ranch.” The propaganda was relentless. “I definitely experienced being brainwashed,” Dara said. It’s taken her decades to move on.","“Wild Wild Country” fails to explore the heartache of the thousands of families like Dara’s who were left behind when loved ones joined Bhagwan in the mountains. It’s one of many flaws in an otherwise haunting series that exposes the brutal town-gown confrontation between the malicious and condescending sannyasins who took over tiny Antelope, Oregon, and the narrow-minded and often bigoted farmers and ranchers who opposed them at every turn. The directors of the series seem afraid to play referee, and viewers pay the price.","Consider this: Ma Anand Sheela, Bhagwan’s trusted assistant and the former CEO of all things Rajneesh, is accused in the series of ordering or participating in a dizzying array of felonies. Among them: poisoning an entire town with salmonella; stalking and attempting to gun down the then-U.S. attorney in Oregon, Charles Turner; setting a local government office on fire; illegally bugging friends and enemies; secretly pouring an anti-psychotic drug into kegs of free beer, to help control the thousands of homeless people Sheela had recruited to the ranch; and then dumping those same homeless people onto the streets of Oregon after they had served Sheela’s twisted purpose. Oh, and injecting Bhagwan’s personal physician with poison and attempting to murder him.","Despite Sheela’s frightening résumé, the makers of “Wild Wild Country” hand her the microphone and walk away. They never question or fact-check her self-serving version of events, or ask what Bhagwan knew about the criminal underworld operating feet from his throne. Did Sheela order the hit on Bhagwan’s doctor to prevent him from killing the master first, as Sheela has claimed? And did she wiretap the ranch and read through all incoming mail to protect her beloved Bhagwan, or merely to keep a close eye on her many rivals and shut down dissent? Viewers are left to wonder.","Three decades later, sales of Bhagwan’s books and tapes appear strong. Most of his current followers have accepted the canard that Bhagwan was manipulated by Sheela, and was an innocent dupe all along.","Dara’s father, David, was one of them. The university professor who once wore ties and wingtips and had a Peugeot sitting in the driveway quickly forgave his master. For a few years after the commune broke up, he wandered — to Nepal, Japan, Texas, New York and Guatemala. Then, in 1988, he confided to Dara, he had begun pining for India. “I don’t think I have to explain why,” he wrote. Burrows would live with Bhagwan once more.","Until his death last year at age 80, the man who became Swami Das Anudas had few regrets, even if it had become clear to most outside observers that Bhagwan’s cult didn’t offer the deliverance Burrows had sought from the cynicism and small-mindedness of the world. “Whatever happened at the ranch, it was still a lot better than what was happening in the rest of the world,” David Burrows once wrote to Dara. “The harder something is to go through, the more you learn as you come out of it.”","Jim Popkin is a writer in Washington, D.C.

The demonstrations were the biggest in Brazil since at least 2015, but this time, they also stretched beyond its borders: to the United States, Europe, Argentina and other Latin American countries.","By the time more than 40 people gathered outside the White House on Friday night to remember Franco, the only black woman on Rio’s 51-member council, Brazilian officials had made clear that her suspected murderers were rogue current or former police officers ― perhaps from an informal, extrajudicial militia. The bullets that killed Franco, nine in total, were traced back to a shipment purchased by Brazil’s Federal Police in 2006.","Franco, 38, who was born in one of Rio’s largest favelas — the informal neighborhoods that the government has long neglected — was an unflinching critic of the role Rio’s police have played in the rising levels of violence that have cast a pall over the city over the last two years.","In Washington, her death served as the latest reminder that the fight for racial equality ― and against police killings of black people ― was a global cause that stretches from Brazil to the United States and across the world.","“The reason why we see racist police terror in the favelas of Brazil is the same reason we see racist police terror in Southeast D.C., where poor and working black folks live,” Sean Blackmon, an organizer with Stop Police Terror Project DC, said. “We are all a part of this common struggle, and wherever we are on this earth, whatever language we speak, it is our duty to connect those struggles and to understand that the only way we can strike down state-sanctioned violence is to do it together.”","Brazil suffered more than 60,000 homicides in 2016, according to federal data, with more than 5,000 taking place in the Rio state. Police in Brazil killed more than 4,200 people that year ― with at least 925 of those killings occurring in Rio state. That’s roughly the same number that took place across the United States in 2016, even though U.S. population is nearly 20 times larger than Rio state.","Franco opposed President Michel Temer’s February decision to place the military in charge of public security in Rio de Janeiro, a move human rights groups argued would only exacerbate violence and civil rights violations against favela residents. Franco had recently been appointed to a city council commission to monitor the military intervention.","The vast majority of the victims of homicides in Brazil are black men, who are 23.5 times more likely to die from violent crime than members of other racial groups, a 2017 study found. More than three-quarters of the victims of police killings in 2016 were black men, according to federal statistics.","“We already knew that something systemic had to change in Brazil,” said João Coimbra Sousa, a native of northeast Brazil who now lives in Washington. “This is why Marielle was murdered, because she was the voice of that.”","The majority of Washington protesters were Brazilian expatriates, and they turned their ire on that country’s police and political establishment. They repeatedly called for an end to the military intervention in Rio and the abolition of Brazil’s armed forces police force, echoing a popular chant that rang through the demonstrations in Rio and São Paulo a day earlier.","“So many people have been dying for so many decades with so little attention,” one protester screamed into a bullhorn. “We need to pay attention to the genocide that’s happening in Rio. This is not a novel thing. This is a repetitive thing, and we need to move.”","Franco’s symbolic power in Rio, though, was about far more than her crusades against police violence, and her murder seems to have spotlighted all of the interweaving issues and problems facing Brazil.","She was born and lived in the Complexo do Mare, on Rio’s north side. After her pregnancy at 19, she left school, only to later return and obtain a master’s degree. She joined the leftist Socialist and Freedom Party after years of community activism, and won an improbable election to the city council in 2016.","That had made her a popular young politician who dared to challenge Rio’s establishment at a time when Brazil grapples with a massive political corruption crisis that has eroded faith in its democracy and its politicians.","Franco was also a queer woman in a city that elected a conservative evangelical mayor at the same time. Yet she was rising in popularity and clout in a country where someone like her rarely have had access to the levers of power, even at the municipal level.","She had opposed austerity measures from Brazil’s Congress that she believed would gut health, education and social programs that helped favela residents. She was also an advocate for better child care and assistance programs to help women like her work and raise a family, a fighter for seemingly every single segment of Brazil’s most vulnerable populations.","“She acquired a position of power in order to advocate for people in the favelas, and she was fighting for their lives,” one speaker said at the Washington rally. “She empowered so many people to keep going forward.”","And Franco had, as the activists pointed out, fought on behalf of the families of slain police officers, who have also suffered from Rio’s surge of violent crime. More than 120 officers were killed in the line of duty in 2016, according to federal statistics.","But while Franco has lived on as a symbol of hope in Brazil and around the world, she was also another casualty of her country’s inability and unwillingness to deal with the systemic racism that plagues it. And while her death has been viewed internationally as an unspeakable tragedy, there are fears among some Brazilians that it is also another sign of the country’s creep toward authoritarianism.","Rising rates of violence across Brazil have made public security one of the biggest issues in the general elections set for October, which will include choosing a new president. And on the political right ― and in elements of the center and center-right parties now in power ― there is broad support for even more aggressive policing tactics.","In that growing segment of the population, the common Brazilian saying that “bandido bom e bandido morto” ― “a good criminal is a dead criminal” ― sums up the preferred approach to violence. And while use of the hashtag #MariellePresente ― or “Marielle is here” ― spread quickly across social media after her death, roughly 7 percent of Twitter mentions of Franco’s name in the day after her death, one study found, took the view that she deserved to be murdered for her work “defending criminals.”","Coupled with the political corruption crises and an economic collapse that Brazil is only now emerging from, the outbreak of violence has contributed to growing nostalgia for the return of the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil from 1964 to 1985. Polls, meanwhile, have shown declining faith ― especially among young and conservative Brazilians ― in the idea of democratic governance.","Temer’s deployment of the military in Rio had already sparked uneasy memories of the junta and the human rights abuses it carried out among its opponents. And even as protesters in Rio, Washington and elsewhere responded to Franco’s death by calling an end to the “failed” military intervention, there were fears that Temer will use her murder to further justify it.","In Washington, a mixture of hope and anger fueled the demonstrations, as protesters vowed to continue Franco’s fight. But there were moments, too, when the sheer sadness of her death crowded out other emotions.","“I just have hope that Marielle’s death will not be in vain,” Sousa said. “It’s so little to ask, and so petty to ask, but if she could be the last one…”","He paused, and shook his head.","“But even then, this didn’t need to happen,” he said. “It just didn’t.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab13a3d200000d30ceb276b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"WORLD NEWS","headline":"Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy Reportedly In Police Custody, Official Says","authors":"","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nicolas-sarkozy-police-custody_us_5ab0c091e4b0e862383ae2c8","short_description":"He's to be questioned as part of an investigation into suspected irregularities over his election campaign financing.","date":"2018-03-20"},"articleContent":["PARIS (Reuters) - Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy was being held in police custody on Tuesday for questioning by magistrates looking into allegations of Libyan funding for his 2007 election campaign, an official in the French judiciary said.","A lawyer for Sarkozy could not be reached immediately for comment.","France opened a judicial inquiry in 2013 into allegations that Sarkozy’s successful 2007 election bid benefited from illicit funds from late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi.","A former minister and close ally of Sarkozy, Brice Hortefeux, was also being questioned by police on Tuesday morning in relation to the Libya investigation, another source close to the probe said.","Sarkozy, who served as president from 2007 to 2012, has always denied receiving any illicit campaign funding and has dismissed the Libyan allegations as “grotesque”.","In January a French businessman suspected by investigators of funneling money from Gaddafi to finance Sarkozy’s campaign was arrested in Britain and granted bail after he appeared in a London court.","Sarkozy has already been ordered to stand trial in a separate matter concerning financing of his failed re-election campaign in 2012, when he was defeated by Francois Hollande."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab0c0be1f0000150316ae2b.jpeg?cache=omnO917wso&ops=crop_174_109_1371_908%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Anti-Abortion Democrat Faces Primary Challenge From The Left","authors":"Laura Bassett","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dan-lipinski-abortion-marie-newman_us_5ab02e0ce4b0e862383a9154","short_description":"Marie Newman might unseat Congressman Dan Lipinski on Tuesday.","date":"2018-03-20"},"articleContent":["As Democrats topple Republicans in deep-red districts from Alabama to Pennsylvania, progressives are seizing on the party’s momentum to move it a bit to the left.","Rep.

Lipinski faces off in a primary race on Tuesday against challenger Marie Newman, a progressive businesswoman who supports a $15 per hour minimum wage and has hit Lipinski on his votes against reproductive rights, the DREAM Act, LGBTQ rights, and the Affordable Care Act.","“He likes to say he’s a centrist, he’s not. He is a Republican,” Newman told Vox. “There is not a division in the Democratic Party — he just is a dinosaur.”","Lipinski, co-chair of policy for the Blue Dog Democrats in Congress, touts the importance of bipartisan compromise and has characterized Newman as being part of a “Tea Party of the left.”","“What we need to do is sit down and work out some compromise,” he said in a February debate. “Compromise has become a dirty word in Washington.”","The primary race has divided the Democratic Party. Several progressive members of Congress, including Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), along with women’s rights groups like Planned Parenthood Action Fund, EMILY’s List and NARAL, have endorsed Newman. Anti-abortion groups and establishment Democrats, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, are backing Lipinski. Pelosi said last year that the Democratic Party should not have a litmus test on issues like abortion. “This is not a rubber-stamp party,” she said.","Newman and Lipinski are running neck and neck. The race to represent the southwest Chicago district turned ugly over the weekend as Lipinski backers sent out controversial text messages to some of the representative’s constituents. Some Newman supporters say they received texts suggesting Newman is a “Holocaust denier.” Other Chicagoans received texts on St. Patrick’s Day claiming Newman is “crazy anti-Catholic” and “supports laws that would jail nuns.”","The No Labels group, a centrist political organization that backs Lipinski, said it had recruited volunteers to send the texts and that one volunteer mistakenly conflated Newman with the Republican in the race, neo-Nazi Art Jones. “This is the only instance where we are aware of this happening,” the group told HuffPost. “We have since ended this program.”","No Labels said it had nothing to do with the nun text, which is likely a reference to Little Sisters of the Poor, the group that challenged Obama’s health care law because it required them to cover birth control in their health insurance plans.","Newman’s campaign decried the false texts, and the candidate says she believes her views on abortion are more closely aligned with the district’s than those of Lipinski, who was one of five Democrats to vote for the GOP’s 20-week abortion ban.","“The fact is seven in ten families across this district agree on keeping abortion legal, but for years Mr. Lipinski has ignored the values of his district,” Newman said in a statement to HuffPost. “Voters are sick of having their rights under fire and ready to dump Dan Lipinski.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab050521f0000150316adc1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"States Aren't Waiting For Feds To Ban Flame Retardants From Kids' Products","authors":"Stateline, Editorial Partner","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/states-arent-waiting-for-feds-to-ban-flame-retardants_us_5ab11a2de4b0c58e72a3744a","short_description":"Sixteen states are considering bans or restrictions on certain fire retardant chemicals used in toys, child car seats, strollers and other children’s and household products.","date":"2018-03-20"},"articleContent":["By Elaine S.

But advocates on the issue fear an internal political squabble will delay the agency from moving ahead with the ban.","Sixteen states aren’t waiting around. They have bills in the works this year to ban or tightly restrict certain fire retardants from use in toys, child car seats, strollers and other children’s and household products.","For many, the states’ legislation has taken on new urgency due to questions about what the CPSC might do if President Donald Trump’s nominee to head the commission is confirmed. Late last year, the commission voted to initiate a rule-making process that might eventually lead to a ban on the chemicals known as organohalogens, and warned the public about the dangers in the fire retardants in children’s products and household goods. But instituting a total federal ban on the products could take years.","The state bills vary in scope, but their intent is clear — to get rid of chemicals that have been found by scientists to pose more risks than rewards. States have been on track to ban certain flame retardants for some time, but some existing statutes already have become outdated, forcing the states to enact new laws to keep up. Indeed some state lawmakers, who predict that companies will evolve their chemical formulas, say they want to implement broader bans on potentially dangerous flame retardants that might not even yet be developed.","“If the federal government isn’t going to do it, we need to be the ones to do it, and we are,” said Democratic state Sen. Virginia Lyons, the lead sponsor on a piece of toxic chemicals legislation in Vermont.","Lyons’ proposal would go beyond individual chemicals and set up a mechanism to ban flame retardants from children’s products if they are deemed unhealthy by the state Department of Health following a scientific assessment.","“It’s an important and comprehensive bill for children’s products so we don’t have to pass individual laws on individual chemicals,” Lyons said. “The comprehensive program enables the Department of Health to take a lead in identifying toxic chemicals, regulating, labeling or banning.”","The issue for states is what to do about organohalogens, a group of chemicals used as flame retardants in upholstery, mattresses, electronic enclosures and some children’s products. The federal Environmental Protection Agency says the chemicals cause adverse effects such as cancer, endocrine issues and reproductive problems.","The chemical industry opposes most of the broad-based bills, saying that the chemicals should be evaluated individually, not as part of a class. “This broad class has different characteristics and profiles and different uses,” said Rob Simon, vice president for chemical products and technology for the American Chemistry Council, a trade group. “Just lumping them all together and saying they are bad isn’t accurate.”","In addition, the group testified to the CPSC that “the fire hazard of products is a real issue. … In the last few years, there have been hundreds of recalls of consumer products based on fire hazards. The reality is that the nature of today’s consumer products presents serious fire risks.”","But some scientists and firefighter groups think the chemical risk is worse. A 2010 study by the Marine Environmental Research Institute, in Blue Hill, Maine, concluded that: “Flame retardant chemicals can pose a potentially greater hazard than the risk from the fires they are supposed to prevent. Reducing the use of toxic and untested halogenated flame retardants will protect human and animal health and the global environment.” The study concluded that regulators should take this into account.","While the chemicals are designed to slow down fires in homes and other places, which would seem like a good thing for firefighters, firefighters’ associations want them banned too. In testimony to the CPSC late last year the International Association of Firefighters called for getting rid of the substances because of studies that show firefighters’ exposure contributes to increased cancer risk.","“The IAFF supports banning the use of organohalogen flame retardants because when burned they are all carcinogens that contribute to cancer and have additional negative effects on the health of our members,” said Racquel Segall, an occupational health specialist for the firefighters, in her testimony. “Given the increasing body of evidence that indicates the persistence, bio-accumulation and potential health concerns of these fire retardants, we believe the health risks associated with the use of these chemicals is greater than the fire risk without using these chemicals.”","The IAFF has delivered similar testimony in states such as Vermont, Minnesota, Washington, Maryland and Virginia, according to spokesman Tim Burn.","Some states already have begun to address the issue. California, in the wake of a prize-winning Chicago Tribune series that exposed the toxicity of the chemicals, enacted a 2013 law that requires manufacturers to attach a warning label to any furniture that has organohalogens.","Minnesota and Washington, D.C., also have approved anti-fire-retardant chemical laws. More states are looking to join them this year.","In Maryland, state Del. Angela Angel, a Democrat, is pushing a bill to add new organohalogens (an alphabet soup of chemicals known as decaBDE, HBCD, TBBPA, TCEP, or TDCPP by mass) to the list of banned fire retardants, including banning them from children’s toys, car seats and strollers. The bill would require manufacturers to get rid of the chemicals by January 2019, if they want to sell the products in the state.","In Massachusetts, a bill that would have banned 11 different flame retardants from highchairs, car seats, nursing pads, furniture, carpet pads and toys was approved last year 39-0 by the Senate, but not the House. This year, the Democratic state senator who sponsored last year’s bill, Cynthia Creem, said she has a House sponsor and is more optimistic that the bill will pass. It helps that Creem is now Senate majority leader, giving her more clout.","“This is a public health bill,” Creem said. “The truth is that we have been misled and our homes are now host to products that unnecessarily contain toxic flame retardants.”","In 2017, the Maine Legislature overrode Republican Gov. Paul LePage’s veto and enacted a law banning all flame retardants in upholstered furniture.","It’s unclear how quickly the Consumer Product Safety Commission might act on its ban.","In an op-ed for The Hill, a Capitol Hill newspaper, outgoing Democratic CPSC member Marietta Robinson said acting chairwoman Ann Marie Buerkle, who has been appointed by the president to be permanent chairwoman, has “aligned herself with the positions of regulated industries at the expense of the safety of consumers.”","Buerkle voted against proceeding to the rule-making on the flame retardant chemicals. Robinson voted for it.","That’s cause for concern for consumer groups. While they are pleased that the process to ban the chemicals has begun, the way forward is unclear.","“We know acting chair Buerkle opposed moving forward with this rule,” said Rachel Weintraub, legislative director and general counsel of the Consumer Federation of America. “We definitely have concerns about how this will continue to be a priority at the CPSC.”","The federation is hopeful that the guidance against the chemicals will go forward, she added. “The fact that states are taking action and building on what has happened at the federal level is significant.”","Buerkle requires Senate confirmation for a permanent appointment.","“The safety commission granted the petition, but that doesn’t automatically result in a ban. That’s a multiyear process, and at this point in time, who knows what’s going to happen,” said Eve Gartner, an attorney for Earthjustice, a nonprofit environmental law firm headquartered in San Francisco.","“Many states in the legislative session we’re currently in are looking to actually put into law the policy that the CPSC has said would be the right policy but has not yet codified into law,” Gartner said.","Stateline home page","Sign up for exclusive state policy reporting and research"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab11a611f00001b0016aede.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"New York Gov.

He was previously indicted in April 2017 on five obstruction charges. With the new charges pending against him, he was arrested earlier this month and is being held without bail in a Kentucky jail.","Moreland initially stepped down from his post as presiding judge in February 2017 after Nashville station WSMV-TV interviewed Natalie Amos, who said Moreland made her court and traffic fees go away and then pursued a sexual relationship with her.","Fees she owed totaling $1,200 were “just gone,” Amos told WSMV, referring to the first time she encountered Moreland in July 2015. “I just really thought I was gonna get an extension and [the fine] just went away.”","After Moreland waived her fees he reportedly texted her: “Your fees; fines and court cost are taken care of! You now officially owe me !! Haha.”","Their relationship didn’t turn sexual, Amos said, until a year later when she needed help paying over $1,000 in traffic fines in order to get her driver’s license back. Moreland reportedly helped dismiss Amos’ fees and then propositioned her for sex. When Amos accepted and the two discussed details of where to meet, Moreland texted her: “Just be horny and naked!!”","Moreland later used his standing as a judge to call off a police officer who had pulled Amos over during a routine traffic stop, according to the indictment.","Amos reportedly thanked Moreland by text, to which he responded: “Just used my superpowers!!” and later, referring to a sexual encounter, texted, “My desk still has butt marks on it!!”","Amos said she was introduced to Moreland through her friend Leigh Terry, who claimed she had a similar relationship with the ex-judge. Terry committed suicide in May 2016 and it was the investigation into her death that led authorities to look into Moreland’s behavior. In January 2017, The Nashville Scene reported that people close to Terry claimed she had slept with Moreland in exchange for favorable treatment of a DUI case.","Moreland denied having sexual relationships with the women in a statement at that time to the new outlet","He also said that “at no time did I intervene on their behalf during or after judgments were rendered by the appropriate courts” in their cases.","Prosecutors charge that before Moreland resigned from the bench in March 2017, he attempted to cover up his sexual misconduct. A month after he found out the FBI was investigating him, Moreland allegedly met with a person identified in court documents as “J.P.” and said he would pay Amos $6,000 as hush money.","Moreland reportedly enlisted J.P. to get Amos to sign an affidavit saying she fabricated their entire relationship. According to the most recent indictment, Moreland told J.P. to get Amos “liquored up real good” before bringing up the signing of the affidavit.","The affidavit said that Amos was “tricked” into giving the February 2017 interview with WSMV and the reporter paid her $2,500 to lie.","(Although Amos is not named in the indictment, local news outlets reported that she is the unnamed “Person 1” referred to throughout the document. The quotes used in the indictment also align with what Amos said in the original WSMV news reports.)","The $6,000 Moreland was going to give Amos to keep her quiet allegedly came from other illegal activity.","According to prosecutors, Moreland and another staffer had been skimming money from the Davidson County Drug Treatment Court program, which is designed to provide an alternative to jail for defendants with substance abuse problems. Moreland, who presided over the program, allegedly pocketed money from defendants who had to pay between $500 and $750 to join the program.","Both J.P. and the staffer who helped Moreland skim money ended up cooperating with the FBI in its investigation of Moreland.","Moreland was taken into custody in April 2017 on the obstruction of justice charges and released on bond.

Operating under the belief that either Hillary Clinton would be elected or that President Barack Obama would declare martial law if Donald Trump won, they allegedly planned to “wake people up” by bombing a Garden City, Kansas, apartment complex and mosque occupied by “cockroaches” ― their term for Muslim immigrants.","“The only good Muslim is a dead Muslim,” Stein allegedly said, adding that he would “enjoy” shooting Muslims and that he wouldn’t even spare the life of a baby. “There’s no leaving anyone behind, even if it’s a one-year-old,” he allegedly said. “I guarantee, if I go on a mission, those little fuckers are going bye-bye.”","The trial of the defendants, who are facing both a terrorism-related charge as well as a civil rights charge, will be a test of the federal government’s ability to prosecute non-Muslim extremists.","Sting operations targeting white extremists are much less common, and tend to result in lower punishments for defendants. That’s because federal law makes it much harder for the federal government to target and secure convictions against terrorists who sympathize with domestic extremist groups than those who support foreign groups like ISIS.","The trial, anticipated to last six weeks, comes amid heightened concerns about domestic terrorism and an increase in murders committed by white supremacists.","Members of an Illinois militia led by a former sheriff’s deputy who put in a bid to build Trump’s border wall were arrested last week for allegedly bombing a mosque in Minnesota as well as a women’s clinic in their home state. A white supremacist who attended an extremist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, over the summer was charged earlier this year with an attempted attack on an Amtrak train. Separately, a left-wing extremist shot at Republican members of Congress ― wounding House Majority Whip Steve Scalise ― over the summer as they practiced for a softball game.","A series of bombings targeting Austin, Texas, this month have renewed calls for the federal government to treat apparent terrorist attacks seriously even if there’s no readily apparent link to radical Islamic terrorism.","Stein, Wright and Allen appeared in a small federal courthouse in Wichita on Monday wearing either orange or blue jail jumpsuits and handcuffed at their feet, where a pretrial hearing and what U.S. District Judge Eric F. Melgren described as a “virtual tsunami of motions” gave a preview of their expected defense.","There’s a dispute about when precisely the trio’s plot began, and what exactly the conspiracy entailed. Melody J. Brannon, a federal public defender representing Allen, argued that the plot changed so much that there was no actual conspiracy the government could point to as a final plan.","“We don’t have any specific plan that the government can point to that says this is the conspiracy and this is what we are planning to do,” Brannon said.","Anthony Mattivi, one of the lead federal prosecutors on the case, told the court Monday that a “pivotal moment” in the plot came two days after the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando. Then-candidate Trump tweeted at the time that he appreciated “the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism” and called for “toughness & vigilance.”","Judge Melgren, the George W. Bush appointee overseeing the trial, said that all of the actions the trio contemplated were violent in nature. After all, he said, it wasn’t as though they were conspiring to petition their lawmakers for legislative changes. Rather, they appeared to be in agreement to commit an act of violence against Muslims.","“The defendants said lots of things. They were extraordinary loquacious,” Melgren said. “Obviously to their regret at this point.”","Defense lawyers plan to argue that the violent rhetoric their clients used amounted to ugly, but protected, speech. There was a lot of discussion over their use of Facebook, where the defendants regularly posted anti-Muslim and pro-Trump memes and fake news stories.","As a result, Facebook could play a major role in the trial, and defense attorneys had sought to have all the Facebook evidence suppressed, arguing that a Facebook warrant that resulted in at least 28,000 pages of material was flawed as well as overbroad and “highly invasive.”","There was also a dispute about what exactly Facebook likes indicate. The federal government argued that a Facebook like was an “affirmative gesture” indicating support. Judge Melgren said a Facebook like amounted to a “very mild statement” and told the government they would need to seek permission each time they wanted to introduce a Facebook like as evidence.","Defense attorneys tried to argue that the government should not be allowed to refer to their clients as terrorists, domestic terrorists or even extremists. Judge Melgren wasn’t buying that argument.","“Terrorism is obviously stated in the indictment, it’s part of the charge,” Melgren said.","But Melgren isn’t allowing the government to use video from a bomb test that would’ve illustrated what sort of damage the bombs could have done. “The jury probably didn’t need the help” to know what an explosion looks like, Melgren said. The judge also said he wouldn’t allow testimony from any of the residents who would have been victimized by the plot, saying that they only knew about the plot because the government told them about it.","As jury selection begins Tuesday, a major part of the defense strategy will also be packing the jury with as many Trump supporters as possible. Federal prosecutors have already expressed concern that the defense will attempt to discriminate against non-white potential jurors.","Next month, as the trial continues, the courthouse will host a naturalization ceremony for new U.S. citizens.

The older generation allegedly believe younger women need to be less sensitive and essentially buck up, while younger women think older women are out of touch with what constitutes sexual assault and harassment.","A new survey from Vox Media in partnership with Morning Consult, however, disproves this theory by a long shot.","“The results of our survey contradict the idea that there’s a war raging over #MeToo between generations of American women,” Vox’s Anna North wrote. “Instead, we found a lot of similarities across the age divide when it came to what women think about #MeToo ― and what too many of them still experience in the workplace.”","According to the report, published on Tuesday, a majority of women of all ages support the Me Too reckoning and believe the movement fairly represents their interests. Seventy-one percent of women 34 and under and 68 percent of women 35 and older responded that they support the movement. Only 8 percent of women under 35 opposed Me Too, while a slightly larger percentage (14 percent) of women over 35 also opposed it.","The poll was conducted from March 2-8 of this year, and sampled 2,511 women over the age of 18. The survey was conducted online and centered around cis gender people.","Researchers explained why they divided women by this age range: “We chose to compare women ages 18 to 34 with women 35 and over because much media conversation around #MeToo and generational divides focused on millennials. Definitions of ‘millennial’ vary, but most put the oldest members of the generation in their mid-30s today.”","The survey found that younger women were more concerned about the negative outcomes of Me Too than older women.","Thirty-one percent of women under 35 said they were “very” concerned about the Me Too movement causing men to deny women professional opportunities, while only 23 percent of women over 35 agreed. The margin was smaller between younger and older women when asked if they were worried about men being denied due process: 22 percent of younger women and 23 percent of older women said they were “very” concerned about this issue.","Vox and Morning Consult also found another surprising fact: Older and younger women experience similar rates of sexual harassment despite decades of discussions about gender equality in the workplace. Twenty-nine percent of younger women and 33 percent of older women responded that they have experienced sexual harassment at work, although older women are less likely to report the harassment.","Head over to Vox to read the rest of the survey’s results."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab14a142000003800eb2793.jpeg?cache=oz82LhXrGZ&ops=crop_0_347_5066_2952%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"In Tight Vote, Senate Bucks Bernie And Allows U.S. Role In Yemen War To Continue","authors":"Akbar Shahid Ahmed","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/senate-yemen-war-vote_us_5ab15ea7e4b008c9e5f226aa","short_description":"10 Democrats aligned with most Republicans to kill the Sanders proposal. But it got more support than expected, and activists say it's given them momentum.","date":"2018-03-20"},"articleContent":["WASHINGTON ― The Senate voted 55-44 Tuesday afternoon against taking up a resolution to end U.S. military support for a Saudi-led coalition that has killed thousands of civilians in Yemen ― which means the controversial policy will continue, but so will the growing Capitol Hill debate about it.","Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) introduced the bill to end the American role in the war three weeks ago, and it attracted high-profile co-sponsors like Sens. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.).","But Senate leaders, notably top Senate Foreign Relations Committee figures Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) and Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), said the proposal was too hasty and should return to committee, and the Trump administration invested heavily in convincing lawmakers it would unwisely damage the American partnership with the Saudis. Menendez and nine other Democrats ― Sens. Chris Coons (Del.), Catherine Cortez Masto (Nev.), Joe Donnelly (Ind.), Heidi Heitkamp (N.D.), Joe Manchin (W.V.), Bill Nelson (Fla.), Jack Reed (R.I.), Doug Jones (Ala.), and Sheldon Whitehouse (R.I.) ― ultimately aligned with all but five Republicans to kill the bill.","The issue came to a head this week as Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, visits Washington. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he was “very good friends” with the prince, who has been closely involved in Saudi-United Arab Emirates operations and alleged war crimes in Yemen.","Earlier Tuesday, Sanders said it would be cowardly and irresponsible for lawmakers to oppose putting his bill to a vote.","“I am deeply disappointed that Congress has once again abdicated its constitutional responsibility to authorize war,” he said in a statement after the resolution was tabled.","Still, the proposal’s backers secured significant Democratic support to at least consider the legislation, including from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). That meant they avoided what happened in the House of Representatives last year, when Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) introduced a similar bill, also citing the War Powers Resolution, and advocates and progressives ultimately felt Democratic leaders sided with Republicans to quash it and defer to the executive branch on foreign policy.","“We saw leadership divided” on the Democratic side, said Kate Gould, the Middle East legislative policy director at the Friends Committee on National Legislation. “We still had 44 senators that took the step not just of blocking a bomb sale, but of [considering] actually withdrawing U.S. armed forces from the conflict altogether, despite the fact that the Pentagon and the Saudis were really trying to scare senators.”","Critics of the war told HuffPost they also took some solace in the public relations impact of the debate and a commitment Corker made Tuesday morning to developing fresh legislation pertaining to Yemen.","Sens. Todd Young (R-Ind.) and Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) have filed an alternative bill requiring the State Department to certify that the Saudis are trying to wind down the war, but it would not take immediate steps to end American support vital to the Saudi-led coalition’s operations. Peace groups also worry that it invites further conflict by making an explicit exception for U.S.-backed coalition actions against Iranian intervention in Yemen. On the floor on Tuesday, Young said his bill had already changed considerably and would evolve further.","“The ideal case would be that the Iran language is entirely stripped ... and that the certification language is significantly strengthened,” Gould said.","Activists who mobilized around the issue ― highlighting the plight of the more than 20 millions Yemenis now in need of some aid ― say Tuesday’s vote has only emboldened them. Some began publicly shaming the Democrats who voted against the Sanders-Lee-Murphy bill.","“Today should have been the day that the Senate moved to end US involvement in this catastrophe,” said Scott Paul of Oxfam America. “But it is clear from today’s debate that the tide is turning. A number of senators demanded, and were assured of, swift action in the Foreign Relations Committee. With more than 120 children dying each day from preventable disease, the Committee must act now to tear up the blank check that the administration has written to the coalition.”","Igor Bobic contributed reporting.","This story has been updated to include comment from Kate Gould, identify more of the bill’s supporters and opponents and note the role of top Republicans in killing a War Powers Resolution effort in the House of Representatives last year."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab16a1e200000d30ceb27be.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Hm, I Wonder What Mark Zuckerberg’s Up To On Facebook Right Now","authors":"Ashley Feinberg","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-cambridge-analytica_us_5ab16456e4b0decad044d71a","short_description":"We're watching you, Mark.","date":"2018-03-20"},"articleContent":["Since this past Friday, we’ve been hit with revelation after revelation about Cambridge Analytica, the nebulous British firm accused of harvesting the Facebook data of over 50 million users and allegedly doubling as a bribery racket.

Another group protested in front of an archdiocese building in Krakow.","The protesters carried wire hangers to symbolize the dangers facing women driven to obtain illegal abortions by Poland’s already stringent laws.","The anti-abortion bill began as a citizens’ initiative pushed by conservative groups. On Monday, it won the support of a parliamentary committee on human rights, which means it will be studied by a second committee before potentially being submitted for a vote in Poland’s parliament, according to Agence France Presse.","If the measure passes these remaining hurdles, Polish President Andrzej Duda has pledged to sign the bill into law, AFP reports.","But according to the Federation for Women and Family Planning, a Polish reproductive rights group, the measure had been languishing in a “legislative freezer” ― until the Catholic bishops intervened.","“This illustrates the enormous power of the Church and the strong resistance of the politicians to put human rights over their own interests in the light of the upcoming elections in 2018 (local) and 2019 (national),” the federation said in a statement.","Poland already has some of the most stringent anti-abortion laws in Europe. The staunchly Catholic country made abortion illegal, with a few exceptions, in 1993. The move was strongly supported by Polish Catholic church leaders. Then-Pope John Paul II campaigned in his home country in favor of the bill.","Today, women in Poland are allowed to obtain abortions only if the mother’s life is at risk, there’s a fetal abnormality, or the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest. Women can have a hard time finding doctors who will perform abortions even when they fall under those exceptions, according to Time.","As a result, some women travel to nearby countries like Germany to have the procedure done or seek abortions from underground providers in Poland. Others order pills for abortions online.","According to Poland’s official statistics, about 1,000 legal abortions occur there every year. (The country has a population of roughly 38 million.) Abortion rights activists say the number of illegal abortions could be more than 10 times higher.","An estimated 95 percent of legal abortions in Poland are obtained because of fetal abnormalities, The Guardian reports.","Polish women have been voicing opposition to their country’s restrictive abortion laws in recent years.

Bernie Sanders’ televised town hall on economic inequality drew about 1.7 million live viewers during an online broadcast Monday night.","The panel-discussion-style event, called “Inequality in America: The Rise of Oligarchy and Collapse of the Middle Class,” exceeded the viewership of Sanders’ first live town hall on single-payer health care in January.","The broadcast provided the Vermont independent with an opportunity to expand his new alternative media revue beyond “Medicare for all” to the broader issue of economic inequality, which he maintains that commercial media outlets frequently ignore.","“What I would say to our friends in the corporate media: Start paying attention to the reality of how many people in our country are struggling economically every single day ― and talk about it,” Sanders declared at one point during the discussion.","Not content to wait for the cable television channels and newspapers to take him up on his advice, Sanders partnered with The Guardian, The Young Turks, NowThis and Act.tv to do just that for about an hour and a half on Monday night.","Three co-hosts aided Sanders in his efforts: Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), New School economist Darrick Hamilton and filmmaker Michael Moore.","Together they interviewed three guests with specialized knowledge of the economic and political structures suppressing economic mobility and funneling wealth upward. Catherine Coleman Flowers, a founder of the anti-poverty Alabama Center for Rural Enterprise Community Development Corp., spoke about the destitute poverty of the rural black community in Lowndes County, Alabama, where exposure to untreated sewage prompted a rare outbreak of hookworm.","Cindy Estrada, a vice president of the United Auto Workers, addressed the role of organized labor in raising living standards ― and how its decline has lowered them. And Gordon Lafer, a political scientist from the University of Oregon, explained how corporate interests neutralized public opposition through campaign donations and massive lobbying efforts.","An audience of about 450 people attended the town hall in person in the U.S. Capitol auditorium. An additional 100 people viewed the event on monitors in an overflow room.","The rest of what Sanders’ staff estimates were 1.7 million live viewers saw the event online. (HuffPost’s back-of-the-envelope tally from the social media pages of Sanders, Warren and the various digital partners produced a similar figure.)","Billed as a seminar on the causes of, and solutions to, rising income and wealth inequality, the town hall often doubled as a progressive pep rally for social democratic reforms.","During Estrada’s appearance, for example, Warren’s homage to labor unions elicited thunderous applause. “Unions built America’s middle class. It’ll take unions to rebuild America’s middle class,” she said.","For his part, Moore focused on the failure of the Democratic Party, which fashions itself as the party of working people, to stand true to its mission. This line of inquiry took Moore first into a discussion of the ostensibly Democratic leanings of the three wealthiest men in the country ― Warren Buffett, Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos ― and later into a riff on the Democrats who voted to authorize the Iraq War exactly 15 years earlier.","Moore appeared to be saying that letting Democrats off the hook had contributed to the collapse of the middle class.","“It’s so important that we hold the people who say they’re for the people ― hold their feet to the fire! And if they’re not going to do the job they say they’re going to do, let’s get somebody else,” he concluded to loud ovation.","The origins of American inequality that Sanders and his allies sketched on Monday are by now familiar to left-leaning activists immersed in the works of Robert Reich and Jacob Hacker, among other progressive thinkers.","In this history, former President Ronald Reagan ushered in a new era of corporate domination with his symbolic decision to fire striking air traffic controllers in August 1981. The move was the opening salvo in a prolonged war against organized labor that steadily diminished unions’ ranks and reduced their clout, according to numerous liberal scholars.","A host of tax breaks, deregulatory measures, corporate-skewed trade agreements and safety net reductions backed by members of both parties in subsequent decades served to heighten the inequality generated in the 1980s. The result, Sanders said in his introductory remarks, is a country where “the top 10th of 1 percent owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent.","“In recent years, we have seen incredible growth in the number of billionaires, while 40 million Americans continue to live in poverty and we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on Earth,” he continued.","A prominent feature of the evening’s analysis that Sanders’ critics have sometimes accused him of downplaying was an explicit breakdown of the racial roots of American poverty.","Flowers, who invited the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Extreme Poverty to witness the squalid conditions in Lowndes County, argued that state authorities have failed to address the issue of inadequate sewage systems because of entrenched racist views.","“Some of those same types of attitudes that existed prior to the 1960s, the structural racism that was reinforced by racial terror, is still in existence today,” Flowers said.","Hamilton suggested that the universal programs Sanders favors would not erase the racial inequities that follow black Americans at every level of socioeconomic and educational attainment. He noted that a black household headed by a college graduate has, on average, less wealth than a white household headed by a high school dropout.","“So when Sen. Sanders proposes that we should have tuition-free public education ― absolutely, but as an end unto itself. We exaggerate the returns from education, particularly to marginalized groups,” Hamilton said.","Sanders, Warren and Moore all endorsed relatively well-known left-leaning solutions to inequality, including a $15 minimum wage, stronger unions, free college education and paid family leave policies.","Perhaps in keeping with his intersectional focus, Hamilton embraced more radical measures. His preferred solutions included the creation of trust funds for every American at birth, a federal job guarantee, the replacement of private payday lenders with postal banking and an end to academic tracking in grade school, which he argued often replicates racial segregation, even within relatively integrated schools.","“To really get beyond our race problem, when we’re ready as a nation to come together, we need to come to grips with reparations,” Hamilton concluded, prompting cheers from the crowd.","CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly quoted Sanders as stating that the top tenth of 1 percent of earners own almost as much wealth as the bottom 99 percent.

Noor’s attorney did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.","Damond’s family applauded the charges in a statement, calling them “one step toward justice.”","“No charges can bring our Justine back,” the family wrote. “However, justice demands accountability for those responsible for recklessly killing the fellow citizens they are sworn to protect, and today’s actions reflect that.”","The decision comes more than three months after Freeman’s initial deadline for announcing whether he would bring charges against Noor.","“Because the investigation was thorough, we have a nearly second-by-second understanding of what happened, from the moment she called 911 to the moment she was fatally shot by Officer Noor, 13 minutes later,” Freeman said during the press conference Tuesday.","In the eight months leading up Tuesday’s charges, many questions remained about what prompted Noor, 32, to fire his weapon on July 15, 2017 from the passenger seat of a police cruiser, across his partner and through the driver-side window, fatally striking Damond in the abdomen.","Noor and his partner, Matthew Harrity, were responding to Damond’s report of a possible nearby sexual assault. They were startled by a “loud slap” on their vehicle, Harrity told investigators. An attorney for Harrity said it’s possible the officers were concerned about being ambushed, though Damond’s neighbors have questioned this response, given the area’s low crime rate.","Noor, who was put on paid administrative leave following the shooting, did not provide a statement to the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, which conducted an investigation and gave its findings to the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office in September.","“There is no evidence that Officer Noor encountered a threat, appreciated a threat, investigated a threat, or confirmed a threat that justified his decision to use deadly force,” Freeman said Tuesday. “Instead, Officer Noor recklessly and intentionally fired his gun from the passenger’s seat.”","The officers’ body cameras were only activated after the shooting, Freeman said.","Damond’s death sparked protests across Minneapolis. The Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul have a history of high-profile police brutality incidents, including the July 2016 shooting death of Philando Castile in the suburb of Falcon Heights. A week after Damond’s death, Minneapolis Police Chief Janeé Harteau was forced to resign.","Justice for Justine, a group of Damond’s neighbors and friends, praised the charges in a statement emailed to HuffPost.","“We are relieved that her killer is being prosecuted and hope for a swift trial that is respectful to Justine and her loved ones,” the statement read. “Police need to be held accountable for their actions that harm individuals and damage communities, just as any one of us would be held accountable.”","Although the charges against Noor may provide some temporary relief to Damond’s family and friends, prosecutors still face an uphill battle. Between 2005 and April 2017, only 35 percent of officers charged with murder or manslaughter for fatal on-duty shootings were convicted, according to research conducted by Philip Stinson, an associate professor of criminal justice at Bowling Green State University in Ohio.","Read the full complaint warrant against Noor below."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a45365f2100003e005f623d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"COMEDY","headline":"Gay Bunny Book Outsells Pence Family's Bunny Book","authors":"Ed Mazza","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-oliver-bunny-book-sales_us_5ab0676be4b0e862383aa9c2","short_description":"John Oliver's \"Last Week Tonight\" team beats Mike Pence in battle of the Bundo bunnies.","date":"2018-03-20"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"WEIRD NEWS","headline":"Feminists Demand Paris Sex Doll Brothel Be Shut For Fueling Rape Fantasies","authors":"Mary Papenfuss","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/debate-over-paris-sex-doll-brothel_us_5ab078b2e4b0697dfe19c4f4","short_description":"\"Westworld\" prequel?","date":"2018-03-20"},"articleContent":["A new Paris brothel featuring sex dolls should be shut down because the lifeless, life-sized silicone partners habituate men to degrade women and fuel rape fantasies, say French feminists.","Owner Joaquin Lousquy, 28, opened the business last month in an apartment in a “discreet” building in a neighborhood in the heart of the city, Paris Match reported.","It features three bedrooms for sex (the “Xdolls” are spray-cleaned and “disinfected” in another room) and a choice among three very expensive sex dolls made in China (Lily, Sofia and Kim).

So why would Congress add to the risks?","date":"2018-03-20"},"articleContent":["The Senate will vote this week on a bill that could force websites such as Craigslist and Backpage.com to banish sex work ads from their platforms. The measure holds companies liable for any content related to sex trafficking, and it has the backing of feminist politicians and celebrities. But critics say it conflates victims of sex trafficking with women who voluntarily work in the sex industry ― and puts both groups in danger.","A bill similar to the Stop Enabling Sex Trafficking Act (SESTA) easily passed the House in February.","There are statistics to back up the link between online platforms and sex worker safety. A 2017 paper by Baylor University economics professor Scott Cunningham and colleagues found that after Craigslist created an “erotic services” section, the rate of female homicides in U.S. cities fell by 17 percent (excluding crimes in which the victim knew her killer, such as domestic violence). The researchers concluded that sex workers who advertised online spent less time on the streets, where they were more likely to face dangerous situations.","HuffPost spoke with Cunningham, who has studied sex work for 10 years, about how SESTA could push more sex trafficking victims and sex workers into darker corners of the web and onto the streets.","What led to your research on the link between Craigslist and sex work safety?\n\nI did a survey in 2008 that found online platforms were helping sex workers screen clients through references and email correspondences. That research seemed to be extremely important for thinking about sex workers’ safety. Prostitutes have the highest homicide rates of any female occupation in the country. They have been targeted by serial killers, violent men, and they are viewed as disposable, as people nobody will miss.\n\nHow did Craigslist ads ― specifically those posted in the now-defunct erotic services section ― reduce the number of sex workers who are killed by such a drastic amount?","We mainly found evidence of street prostitutes moving indoors. Online platforms allow them to find one another without having to work for a pimp or an agency or having to be outside on the streets. And if they are soliciting clients through email or online messaging, they are probably corresponding with them and trying to get a sense of whether this guy’s shady or not. Outside, women are in situations where they have to make split-second decisions. And there are so many environmental risks. This technology puts tools in their hands. It keeps them considerably safer and could potentially save their lives.","Why was the erotic services section of Craigslist shut down?\n\nCraigslist voluntarily shut it down in 2010. Even though the company was protected under a section of the Communications Decency Act ― which gives websites legal immunity from user posts, though that would be compromised under SESTA ― I think the harassment they were getting from law enforcement and politicians was just not worth it. Instead the ads went into all the other sections of the Craigslist back pages, such as “women seeking men” and “men seeking women,” and onto other platforms, such as Backpage.com.\n\nProponents of SESTA say this bill will reduce the number of women forced into sex work by holding online platforms liable for any sex trafficking ads posted to their site. Based on your research, what’s wrong with this logic?","I think that probably people overestimate the prevalence of sex trafficking. I think when you really do give a critical eye to that academic literature, it sucks. It shouldn’t even be published in peer-reviewed journals. So you end up with a lot of anecdotes, and those anecdotes don’t tell you about the prevalence of the problem. There’s lots of embellishment. I think there’s a tremendous amount of voluntary sex work, and I believe it’s the majority of the market. But if you conflate voluntary sex work with sex trafficking, this liability involves all of the sex work ads. Part of what’s going on in this bill is basically to treat all sex work as the same thing.","Why is voluntary sex work conflated with sex trafficking?","There is a group of activists who say all prostitution is sex trafficking. They find prostitution morally repugnant, and they can’t understand why people would do this. So that’s a philosophical argument, which says this type of work cannot involve free agency. But if you talk to sex workers, many simply say, “This is fundamentally false. I chose to do this.” And why do people choose to do jobs? Well, that’s another question. Lots of people work in jobs that they don’t necessarily like because they don’t have better options. In this bill, activists have been successful in painting prostitution as a one-dimensional evil that completely disregards the voices of many women who do this voluntarily.","What effect could this bill have on the safety of voluntary sex workers?","It could disrupt the ability of voluntary sex workers to screen their clients and work indoors. If Backpage.com, for example, is held liable for a trafficked ad being on its website, what will the company do? If the liability is large, it will shut down the platform. If Backpage.com doesn’t exist, where will sex work advertisements go? They will they go to places much more difficult to police, like the dark web or to international companies that have no incentive whatsoever to work with national police departments. I know economists working with dozens of law enforcement [agencies] using machine-learning algorithms to help identify trafficked women online. If online ads for sex trafficking are being funneled through one platform, such as Backpage.com, at least you know where they are.","So it sounds like the bill could put victims of sex trafficking at risk, too?","At the end of a day, a violent male or a serial killer is going to be just as happy killing a trafficked person as they are a non-trafficked person. When we did our study, all we can say is female homicides fell 17 percent as a result of Craigslist ads. What percent of these women were trafficked victims? What percent were voluntary sex workers? We don’t know. But any bill that makes it more difficult to screen clients and work indoors means higher risk for trafficked or voluntary sex workers.","Why haven’t activists and policymakers paid more attention to this research?","This bill claims to be all about sex trafficking, but it seems to have a deep ignorance about how these markets work and a deep ignorance about the benefits of these technologies.\n\nThe people who support it don’t know about the client screening, they don’t know about the movement indoors and they don’t know that women are using these online platforms in order to avoid danger. They don’t know or they don’t care.\n\nThough I’ve been doing this research for 10 years, all you have to do is go out and ask sex workers how important these online platforms are for their safety. It’s the voluntary sex workers you just don’t hear about in this conversation. They don’t have a union, they aren’t collectively mobilized and they are vulnerable. They have no voice."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab165431e0000fb077af417.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"'Big Little Lies' Season 2 Already Looks To Die For","authors":"Cole Delbyck","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/big-little-lies-season-2-photos_us_5ab10861e4b0697dfe1a9b3a","short_description":"Madeline, Renata, Bonnie and Jane are back.","date":"2018-03-20"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"TRAVEL","headline":"United Airlines Temporarily Suspends Cargo Travel For Pets","authors":"Elyse Wanshel","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/united-suspends-pets-cargo-travel_us_5ab12b25e4b0eb3e2b30dd18","short_description":"The decision follows multiple pet-related mishaps, including the death of a puppy.","date":"2018-03-20"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"WORLD NEWS","headline":"Saudi Crown Prince's Claims About Gender Equality Don't Add Up","authors":"Willa Frej","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/saudi-prince-gender-equality_us_5aaf8397e4b05b2218005cd0","short_description":"Mohammed bin Salman says he's undoing decades of  oppression, but women still lack equal rights.","date":"2018-03-19"},"articleContent":["Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, says women and men are “absolutely” equal, even though he leads a country with some of the world’s strictest laws against women’s rights.","“We are all human beings and there is no difference,” he told CBS’ “60 Minutes” in an interview that aired Sunday.","Bin Salman ascended to the role of crown prince in June, and began a fast-paced and at times controversial cultural and political overhaul.

The president’s attorney, John Dowd, later urged the Justice Department to immediately end the special counsel probe. Despite ensuing White House denials, Dowd’s statement and Trump’s pointed attacks earlier in the day led many to speculate that Mueller’s job could be in peril.","On Monday, Trump again criticized the Russia investigation, alleging it had “massive conflicts of interest.”","Republicans over the weekend offered a mostly muted response to Trump’s attacks against Mueller. A few, like Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), warned that moving to terminate the special counsel would represent a “red line” and could even represent the “end” of Trump’s presidency.","No Republican, however, called for a vote on long-stalled legislation meant to shield Mueller from firing. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), a co-author of one such bill, tweeted Monday that the special counsel ought to be able to “continue his investigation unimpeded.”","Republican leaders, meanwhile, said they had no plans to intervene because they did not believe Trump would act against Mueller despite a slew of recent personnel shake-ups among government agencies and the firing of Andrew McCabe, who served as the Deputy Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Friday.","“I have urged the White House in public and private to allow Mueller to continue his investigation uninterrupted,” Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), the Senate president pro tempore, said in a statement on Monday. “I know Mueller well and believe him to be a straight shooter, and I continue to believe that giving Mueller the time and support necessary to get to the bottom of things is in the best interest of all parties involved.”","“My conversations with the White House have led me to believe legislation is not necessary at this point because I do not believe the president would take such a foolish action,” Hatch added in the statement.","Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) was similarly dismissive of the possibility that Trump could fire Mueller, telling reporters on Monday he did not think the president would do so because “the consequences would be so overwhelming.”","“I don’t see the necessity of picking that fight right now,” Cornyn added.","The views of Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) lined up with those of Republicans on Monday. She told reporters that she didn’t think special protections were necessary since firing Mueller was so obviously a bad move, according to The Washington Post’s Karoun Demirjian.","Feinstein clarified later that she believes Mueller is already protected under current regulations because Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein has said there is no cause to fire him. The senator added, however, that she also supports legislation to codify those regulations.","It’s not hard to envision Trump taking his attacks against Mueller to another level, however. The president has a reputation for impulsiveness, and on Monday the White House added a lawyer to its team who has pushed the theory on television that the FBI and Justice Department framed Trump.","Trump also surprised many members of his party earlier this month by announcing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports ― policies that have historically been opposed by free-trade conservatives. Many Republicans on Capitol Hill were unaware of the details surrounding the policy until after it was announced by Trump at the White House.","New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman wrote over the weekend on Twitter that the president was “testing” lawmakers with his attacks on Mueller."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab03a6d1e00008e0b7af25c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Report: Trump Demanded Nondisclosure Pacts So Staffers Can Never Spill","authors":"Mary Papenfuss","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-demanded-nondisclosure-pacts-so-staffers-can-never-spill_us_5aaf54d1e4b05b2218003805","short_description":"The agreements forbid senior White House staff members from talking, even after Trump's presidency ends.","date":"2018-03-19"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"SPORTS","headline":"Nothing Says March Madness Like A Coach Stripping To The Waist","authors":"Ron Dicker","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nothing-says-march-madness-like-a-coach-stripping-to-the-waist_us_5aaf8bb6e4b0c33361b21500","short_description":"\"It's the happiest I've ever been in my life,\" Nevada coach Eric Musselman said.","date":"2018-03-19"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Federal Judges Won't Block Fix To Pennsylvania's Gerrymandered Congressional Map","authors":"Sam Levine","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pennsylvania-gerrymandering_us_5aaff054e4b0e862383a2edf","short_description":"The decision leaves in place a congressional map issued by the state Supreme Court in February intended to remedy gerrymandering in the commonwealth.","date":"2018-03-19"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"SPORTS","headline":"LeBron James Once Gained 7 Pounds In A Single NBA Playoff Game","authors":"Andy McDonald","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lebron-james-once-gained-7-pounds-in-a-single-nba-playoff-game_us_5ab00d33e4b00549ac7e3719","short_description":"Teammates who reportedly saw the scale confirmed the story.","date":"2018-03-19"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Members Of Congress Want Austin Bombings To Be Treated As Domestic Terrorism","authors":"Antonia Blumberg","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/austin-bombings-terror_us_5ab01c97e4b0e862383a8257","short_description":"“For too long we have focused only on certain sources of terrorism and violence while ignoring others,\" the politicians said.","date":"2018-03-19"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Americans Say 2-to-1 That We Never Should Have Invaded Iraq","authors":"Ariel Edwards-Levy","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/americans-2-to-1-iraq-war-mistake_us_5ab0174fe4b0e862383a7c25","short_description":"Fewer than a quarter think history will judge the Iraq War as even a partial success.","date":"2018-03-19"},"articleContent":["Fifteen years after the U.S. invasion of Iraq, Americans now say, by a margin of about 2 to 1, that the decision was a mistake, a new HuffPost/YouGov poll finds.","Knowing what they do now, half of the public says they don’t believe the U.S. should have sent troops to fight in Iraq back in 2003, according to the poll. Just 24 percent say it should have. (A Pew Research survey released Monday found opinions much closer to evenly split: 48 percent of Americans in that poll said that the U.S. made the wrong decision by using military force in Iraq, but 43 percent responded that the country made the right decision.)","Just 4 percent of those in the HuffPost/YouGov survey say they believe history will judge the war as a complete success, with 19 percent saying it will be seen as more of a success than a failure, 36 percent that it will be seen as more of a failure than a success, and 19 percent that it will go down as a complete failure. Slightly over a 10th say they believe the war in Iraq reduced the threat of terrorism, while 37 percent say it increased it.","Opinions of the war remain starkly partisan. Two-thirds of Democrats but just 35 percent of Republicans say the U.S. should not have sent troops into Iraq. Although relatively few in either party believe the war will go down as a success, Democrats say by a 51-percentage-point margin that the war will be judged as more of a failure, while Republicans agree by a much narrower 6-point margin.","Twenty-two percent of Americans, including a plurality of Republicans, still say that, to the best of their knowledge, Iraq had weapons of mass destruction when the U.S. invaded in 2003, while 44 percent say Iraq didn’t have any WMDs. An additional 34 percent aren’t sure. By a 7-point margin, 37 percent to 30 percent, Americans say that former president George W. Bush lied about weapons of mass destruction in order to get the U.S. into the Iraq War.","Americans’ memories of the invasion may be fading. Just over a third say they have a very clear recollection of what led the United States to send troops to Iraq, and only about two-thirds say that they remember even somewhat well.","Many people are also now misremembering ― or unwilling to admit ― that they ever supported the war. As YouGov’s Kathy Frankovic has noted, support for going into Iraq topped 60 percent at the time of the invasion. But just a third of Americans now claim that, back in 2003, they favored sending troops to Iraq, while 39 percent say they opposed it, and the rest that they don’t remember. Gallup polling 15 years ago found that about half of Democrats supported the war, a level that’s more than twice as high as the share of Democrats in the HuffPost/YouGov survey who now claim they supported the war at its outset.","Use the widget below to further explore the results of the HuffPost/YouGov survey, using the menu at the top to select survey questions and the buttons at the bottom to filter the data by subgroups:","The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted March 15-16 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.","HuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

California is investing $25 million to get more women into the business.","date":"2018-03-19"},"articleContent":["By Teresa Wiltz","SAN JOSE, Calif. — She likes to say that she slept through the last 13 years of her life, and indeed, much of it is a blur: Abusive relationship. His-and-her arrests for domestic violence. Meth habit. A period of quasi-homelessness. A 37-day stint in jail for petty theft.","Now, at 38, Sandra Alvarez says she is awake — and duly awoken, she is aiming for a massive do-over: She’s newly sober. She’s off cash assistance. She’s got a job temping and a place to call her own. And most importantly, she’s got career aspirations: She wants to work in construction.","“The first time I went on a construction site, I felt some kind of power,” said Alvarez, sturdy and tattooed with a swath of dark, wavy hair. “It’s weird, but I felt like I belonged.”","But the construction field is a hard one to crack, particularly if you’re female. Women comprise less than 3 percent of the trade workforce, roughly the same portion as 30 years ago. The barriers are many. Sexism is a given — like the foreman who told Alvarez he didn’t need her help on his job site, but sure could use her help in the bedroom.","So Alvarez is hanging her hopes on a state-funded “pre-apprenticeship” program in California, where she is learning the basics of the industry, from blueprints and construction math to job safety. Above all, she’ll learn which trade would suit her best. Carpenter or electrician? Ironworker or pipefitter? (She’s pretty sure carpentry is her thing.)","The goal: With some training under her belt — and with some industry contacts — she’ll land a highly coveted apprenticeship that will lead to a good-paying union job.","More women might soon be able to take advantage of similar programs.","These days, states are faced with an aging infrastructure and an aging workforce. And just when the country is considering mammoth investments to repair its deteriorating roads, bridges and highways, there’s a shortage of skilled trades workers — which will only get worse as baby boomers enter retirement. California’s new Road Repair and Accountability Act aims to tackle both problems at once.","Mostly, it’s an ambitious, $50 billion, 10-year building program that will use a gas tax increase to fund road repairs, bridge maintenance and public transit.","But the law also includes an unusual provision: a $25 million investment to get more women like Alvarez into pre-apprenticeships.","The idea is to give disadvantaged Californians, including poor women, the tools they need to get accepted into trade apprenticeship schools — and in so doing, reduce the number of people receiving public assistance while moving more people into the workforce. The law’s funding will be used beginning next year by the California Workforce Development Board, which is the statewide coordinator for the pre-apprenticeship training programs.","“This creates an avenue for middle-class jobs and benefits,” said Democratic state Sen. Jim Beall, the primary sponsor of the legislation. “A lot of women shy away from construction because of the work environment. We’re trying to change that good ol’ boy, business as usual, construction culture.”","Breaking into the industry means combating stereotypes that construction is men’s work. And many women don’t know how to start to prepare for a career in the trades, said Meg Vasey, a onetime electrician and the executive director of Tradeswomen Inc., an Oakland-based training and advocacy group that offers woman-centric pre-apprenticeships.","Traditionally, construction newbies enter the industry through a state-regulated apprenticeship. In a way, these programs function much like a medical residency for young doctors: Apprentices earn as they learn, over a three to five year period, laboring under the mentorship of seasoned professionals, with some supplementary classroom instruction. Apprentices can join a union from the start, getting a bump in salary as they complete each level of their training. And ultimately, when they graduate, they land high-paying jobs.","But often, to get into these programs, Vasey said, you have to know how and where to find them. Sometimes that means stalking construction sites and begging the foreman to give you a chance. For women in particular, that can be daunting. Other times, there are limited application periods and yearslong waitlists.","Pre-apprenticeships can help fill that void, because class curriculums are devised with input from local trades unions, whose members drop in for guest lectures about what it takes to succeed in a particular trade. (Hint: If you’re scared of heights, a career as a roofer might not be the way to go.)","The current pre-apprenticeship initiative builds on earlier efforts following President Barack Obama’s 2009 stimulus plan and a 2014 California program for the clean-energy industry, said Tim Rainey, executive director of the California Workforce Development Board. The idea is to get disadvantaged Californians sufficiently trained in the soft skills, like showing up on time, interviewing, and learning how to work on a team, so that they qualify for highly competitive apprenticeships with construction projects.","Advocates argue that women, in particular, benefit from that kind of intensive coaching.","“You have to be intentional about bringing women into the industry,” says Vasey of Tradeswomen Inc. “Otherwise, they’re going to hire the one-armed, one-eyed, ex-offender male before they hire a woman.”","Opening Doors","A small cohort of women started entering the construction industry in the late ’70s and early ’80s, during the full bloom of the women’s liberation movement. At the same time, affirmative action required that the construction trades open up to them. In 1978, President Jimmy Carter set a goal to have women constitute at least 6.9 percent of the workforce among construction companies with federal contracts. But women in the trades were met with hazing and hostility. Attrition was high.","The only source of federal construction dollars that can be targeted to women and other disadvantaged groups, including pre-apprenticeships, comes through set-asides from federal highway resources allocated to states, said Lauren Sugerman, national policy director of Chicago Women in Trades, an advocacy and training group. But the set-aside is not mandated and most states don’t elect to use it, she said. Maine used the money in the ’90s on a bridge project, and thanks to aggressive enforcement and funding for pre-apprenticeships for women, the numbers of women in construction there jumped to 11 percent, she said.","And there’s never been a dedicated stream of funding for pre-apprenticeships for women, she said. Over the years, there have been limited demonstration grants through the Job Training Partnership Act. In 1992, Congress passed the Women in Apprenticeship and Nontraditional Occupations Act, which provides $1 million a year in grants and technical assistance to encourage the employment of women in manufacturing, transportation and construction. But the program reaches only a handful of groups around the country.","In California, groups such as PolicyLink, an Oakland-based research and advocacy group focused on economic equity, want the state to do more to ensure that contractors hire graduates from the pre-apprenticeships.","But because affirmative action by public employers is illegal in California, Rainey said, the state can’t set specific goals for hiring or training women or other disadvantaged groups.","And there’s a chance that the broader transportation law won’t survive. Republicans in the California House are pushing to repeal the law, and voters will decide in November whether to continue paying the gas tax hike.","Rising Sun","As a means to hire more women and underserved Californians, construction jobs make sense for a lot of reasons. You don’t need a college career to earn a good living: Experienced tradespeople can make between $25 and $50 an hour — even apprentices average $15 an hour to learn on the job.","For people who have taken a few detours on their career trajectory, construction can be quite forgiving, said Cesar Diaz, legislative and political director at California’s State Building and Construction Trades Council, AFL-CIO.","And unions like it because it trains women with tools they need to be more qualified, Diaz said.","“What’s going to change the culture is having more women on the job site, first and foremost.”","Many pre-apprenticeship programs are co-ed, but often, the most effective ones are the ones that are exclusively for women, said Vasey of Tradeswomen Inc. To qualify, participants need a GED or high school diploma and proof that they’re eligible to work in the United States. A driver’s license is recommended.","At the Rising Sun Energy Center in Berkeley, instructor Ester Sandoval, a compact woman with a pixie haircut and a ready smile, paces the packed room. It’s an all-women’s class, where women take field trips to job sites, brush up on their math skills, learn how to apply for a job, and work out with a trainer so they’ll be strong enough to haul gear and lift pipes. They also learn how to cope in a male-dominated industry: how to deal with bullying and the art of the snappy comeback.","The students, a variety of ages and colors, hunker down, all furrowed focus.","There’s Annie Batten, 54 and a little shell-shocked after 23 years in prison. There’s Rachel Foreman, 29, a onetime art major who’s working as a house painter after crawling out of addiction and homelessness.","And there’s Timberlie Laramie, at 19 one of babies of the group, wiry and bouncing with energy. She’s still in foster care, and said she really wants to be a neurosurgeon. But she needs a job, like, now, and can’t afford to be in school for the next decade. She figures a career in the trades will keep her brain engaged — and pay the bills.","Sandoval is part cheerleader, part drill sergeant, pushing the women, urging them to speak up, “raise your voice through your core.”","“Fake it till you make it,” Sandoval tells them. “You’ve got to be comfortable talking to folks who don’t look like you.”","Folks who happen to be men.","’Cause those people who don’t look like you are the ones who have the jobs, she said.","Training Around the Country","Several other states, among them Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota and West Virginia, have used pre-apprenticeship programs to launch women into careers in construction, cobbling together funding from a variety of sources. Maine was one of the first states to tie public works funding with actively recruiting women to work in construction. In 1994, the Maine Department of Transportation used a $157 million, four-year bridge replacement project as an opportunity to create a more “women-friendly” work environment, funding mentorship programs for women interested in construction. It even offered on-site child care.","And in 2006, Illinois lawmakers earmarked $6.25 million to fund pre-apprenticeships for women and other disadvantaged groups as part of an infrastructure bill. But amid the state’s budget crisis, the money dried up in 2014.","But California’s plan is unusual in its size and scope. It employs a multi-curriculum approach, exposing students to a variety of trades, from metalworking to pipefitting to plumbing, and it requires that the programs work directly with local unions.","“This is part of a trend to make sure that as we invest in roads and transportation, that we’re also making an investment in building a skilled workforce — and that we’re using those public dollars to end those inequities that have shut women out,” said Sugerman, who got her start in the trades as an elevator constructor in 1980.","Getting Dirty","On a recent day in the backside of the San Francisco International Airport, Sara Glascock, 38, a sweet-faced woman with green pigtails, is giving a visitor a tour of her job site. Pointing, she shows where she stood on the scissors lift, many feet above ground, and strung wires that hang from the ceilings of the warehouse.","Both her parents are professionals with master’s degrees and dreams of sending their daughter to college at Mount Holyoke. “That was never going to happen,” Glascock said, laughing. School never stuck for her. She tested out of high school at 16, and tried on a lot of careers, including stints at Starbucks and coordinating architecture projects. But desk work constricted her. Working with her hands, in the great outdoors, seemed more fun.","After she completed two pre-apprenticeship programs, she found work as an electrician’s apprentice.","She gets up at 4 every morning, and is out the door before 5, trying to beat the traffic. She brushes her hair in the car, slaps on some makeup, scarfs down some breakfast, and is on the job by 7. She’s off by 3:30, and twice a week, she’s taking apprenticeship night classes as part of her training. She doesn’t get much sleep, and she’s constantly battling carpal tunnel from working with her hands. But she loves it.","There are eight women out of 50 students in her class, a big jump from previous classes. And along the way, she’s encountered sexism on the job, like the foreman who wouldn’t make eye contact with her, or the one who just assigned her cleanup and put the more skilled tasks to the male apprentices.","This is a typical tactic to hold women back on the job, said Olwyn Brown, a journeyman carpenter who has taught pre-apprentices in Oakland and San Francisco.","Because of that, “women aren’t trained as thoroughly,” Brown said. “You have to fight for it.”","Glascock lucked out with her current boss, who makes sure that men and women get an equal shot at learning their trade. But even if her next boss turns out to be less enlightened, Glascock said she’s going to keep showing up.","“There’s nothing in this world that’s going to prevent me from having a pension and getting $57 an hour,” she said.","Starting Over","Alvarez leads a life surrounded by men. She lives with her teenage son. She temps as a day laborer at construction sites, where she’s usually the only woman. Her pre-apprenticeship class is co-ed, but the men far outnumber the women.","Even the 12-step meeting she goes to here in San Jose is located in an all-male rehab facility. She goes because it meets on Saturday mornings, close to her all-day class with Working Partnerships USA, a community organization located here in the Silicon Valley, and it’s easy to pop out for a quick meeting.","But after one Saturday session, right after participants recited the Lord’s Prayer, a heavily tattooed man approached her. “My friend wants to meet you,” he insists, gesturing toward a small man standing nearby. Alvarez demurs. The tattooed man presses.","“Why would you do that?” she tells him. An AA meeting, she adds, is hardly the time or place to hit on her.","As she walks back to her class, Alvarez frets. She’s trying to stay focused, stay clean, make a real life for herself, but men don’t take her seriously, she says.","One man who does take her seriously is her instructor, José Mendez. Back in class, he shows her how to read blueprints and use her engineer’s ruler. She hunkers down with her calculator, looking pleased.","“I know it’s not normal for girls to be hitting up construction sites and wanting to work hard,” Alvarez said.","But ever since she worked in a hardware store as a teen, she’s been fascinated with the idea of building things. This is where she belongs.","“I want to run stuff,” she said. “This is my calling.”","Stateline home page","Sign up for exclusive state policy reporting and research"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aafc3d01e0000fe077af17e.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Helicopter Carrying Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner Experienced Engine Failure Last Week","authors":"Rebecca Shapiro","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ivanka-trump-jared-kushner-helicopter-engine-failure_us_5ab00473e4b00549ac7e29b6","short_description":"The chopper, which was on its way to New York City, returned safely to Washington.","date":"2018-03-19"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"QUEER VOICES","headline":"LGBTQ Activists Had A St. Patrick's Day Message For Mike Pence","authors":"Curtis M.

(Actually, a 200-year-old magnolia uprooted from the White House grounds thanks to the first lady.)","Responding to Hope Hicks’ departure and, perhaps subliminally, the rumored future exile of son-in-law Jared Kushner, the president typically half-lamented and half-quipped, “So many people have been leaving the White House. It’s invigorating, since you want turnover. I like chaos. It really is good. Who’s going to be the next to leave? Steve Miller or Melania?”","Melania has been unavailable for comment on her own possible future place among the fallen of the Trump era. Perhaps, though, she’ll hang around and offer her husband a little comfort in Stormy weather, as rumors continue to circulate that his perfectly real daughter and her all-too-real husband may be ousted from the premises.","Not surprisingly, personnel issues seem to be on the president’s mind these days. On March 6, in the East Room of the White House and flanked by the Swedish prime minister, he boasted, “So many people want to come in. I have a choice of anybody. I could take any position in the White House, and I’ll have a choice of the 10 top people having to do with that position. Everybody wants to be there.”","However, with constant media conjectures about yet more departures including National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster and possibly even White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, there seems to be a predisposition to move out of, not into, this Oval Office. In a remarkably short space of time, President Trump has already achieved a record 43 percent turnover rate for top-level staff members, some of whom may be jumping ship in hopes of emerging with reputations relatively untarred, while avoiding lengthy prison sentences.","As collateral damage in his world mounts, it seems as if the only members of the Trump Empire, White House division, guaranteed job security are his lawyers and perhaps Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Even that most nuclear of families ― his ― seemed in peril of exploding, as the countdown to Kushner’s exit approaches the zero hour. It looks as if we may all have scored front-row seats for the latest you’re-fired episode in the White House reality show.","Given the not-if-but-when nature of Kushner’s departure from the White House, it’s none too soon for media outlets to prepare themselves. With that in mind, here is a prospective political obituary for him.","Bringing Peace to a Riven World","The political career of Jared Kushner met a slow death from unparalleled incompetence, conflicts of interest, and financial sleights of hand. He is survived by his father-in-law Donald Trump and ― though no one knows for how long ― his wife, Ivanka. At age 37, he had held the role of White House senior adviser and assistant to the president since the day Donald Trump entered the Oval Office. Just two months later, his wife agreed to take a similar advisory position. Though together they were reported to be worth a mere $740 million, they generously offered to do their new jobs without pay from a sense of duty to country and the kindness of their hearts ― and also perhaps to avoid running afoul of an anti-nepotism law passed in 1967 when Lyndon B. Johnson was president.","Jared’s year-plus in the White House proved another Trump-style record setter, a pro bono financial odyssey of a sort no previous White House had ever witnessed. While traveling the globe to carry out his “duties” and hobnob, negotiate, and pose for endless photo-ops with world leaders from Iraq, China, Israel, and a host of other countries ― a role once upon a time filled by the secretary of state ― the overworked adviser somehow found a few moments to cash in his diplomatic air-miles big time.","In his Rolodex of titles, he would also serve as head of a completely fabricated new entity, the White House Office of American Innovation. In both capacities, he stood ready to change the world, a goal he achieved handily ― if the world you happen to be talking about was his own financial one. And that was no small thing. After all, it’s not easy to oversee and advance (or, in his case, even potentially depth charge) your private business interests while lending a hand running the country, not to speak of the world, and freeing your father-in-law to work on his golf stroke.","For example, Kushner attempted to extract from investors in Qatar a modest half-billion dollars in bailout funds for a cratering Manhattan skyscraper, 666 Fifth Avenue, that he had purchased for his family business while still in the private sector. Unfortunately, that particular deal fell through, after which Kushner and his father-in-law happily backed the Saudis in their blockade and quarantine of Qatar.","Taking his business-oriented focus on the road as the White House liaison for peace in the Middle East, Kushner was also tasked with the simple goal of brokering the settlement of the Israel-Palestine conflict. His familiarity with the region was significant since, among other things, he had gotten at least four major loans from Bank Hapoalim, Israel’s largest bank, for the Kushner family real estate company. (Hapoalim is undergoing a criminal probe by the U.S. government for tax evasion services it reportedly provided to its wealthy clients.) Shortly before President Trump’s visit to Israel in May 2017, Kushner Companies also received a $30 million investment from Menora Mivtachim, one of Israel’s largest insurers ― and what could be more peaceable than that? As everyone knows, Kushner himself left office just as peace was settling over the region (and the U.S. was moving its embassy to Jerusalem).","China, of course, had been a longtime target of Donald Trump until ― in a similarly diplomatic frame of mind ― Kushner helped organize a fabulous Dover sole dinner at the president’s Mar-a-Lago club with Chinese President Xi Jinping last April. He would also prove to be a key figure in smoothing the way for better relations with that rising global superpower ― an approach that just happened to fit perfectly with the Kushner family business. Only a month after that dinner, for example, his sister, Nicole Meyer, was already reportedly pitching the glories of One Journal Square, a Jersey City housing project the Kushner family owns that was in need of $150 million in investments, to a gathering of 100 potential Chinese investors at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Beijing. As part of that pitch, while dropping her brother’s name, she offered them a path into the U.S. EB-5 visa program, sometimes referred to as a “citizenship for sale” program, which they could enter through Kushner properties for a mere $500,000 each.","Building brilliantly on his Chinese portfolio, Jared Kushner, too, held private meetings with elite potential Chinese investors in... well, properties like his family’s and spent copious time with the Chinese ambassador to the U.S. during and after the election campaign. He allegedly also attended high-level meetings with the chairman of Anbang Insurance Group during the Trump transition period. At the time, Anbang just coincidentally was considering making an investment in 666 Fifth Avenue. Unfortunately, no deal resulted. Since then, the company has been seized by the Chinese government and its chairman prosecuted for “economic crimes.” For Kushner, refinancing that single building in New York proved no easier than making peace in the Middle East.","But give him credit: while advising the president, he never stopped looking out for those closest to him (i.e., his family) and never forgot his role as a junior mogul on the make. In the process, he entertained a cast of key bank executives. In an office only doors from the Oval Office, he regularly connected with some of the biggest players on Wall Street, including those at bailout-prone Citigroup, scandal-ridden Deutsche Bank, and the asset-management goliath Blackstone Group. As the Wall Street Journal reported, he also remained in undisclosed business relationships with Goldman Sachs, investor George Soros, and billionaire venture capitalist Peter Thiel. All three had business stakes in a “real-estate tech startup called Cadre that Kushner co-founded and currently partly owns.”","Being the statesman he was, however, there can be little doubt that Kushner attended such meetings purely to explore the state of banking and investment for the sake of the economic well-being of the American people. After all, no portfolio, from the secretary of state’s to infrastructure and the opioid crisis, was beyond his skills.","In his brief time in the White House, one thing can be said: his generosity of spirit was second to none. He opened his arms to any financial firm that wanted to help him put the United States on a path back to being great again. (Whatever multi-million-dollar loans to the Kushner family business occurred in the process surely represented no more than a random confluence of events.) Last November, for example, Apollo Global Management, one of the world’s largest private equity firms, loaned $184 million to Kushner’s family real estate company in order to refinance a mortgage on a Chicago skyscraper. That was after its founder, an adviser to the Trump administration on “infrastructure,” met numerous times with Kushner in the White House.","When that sum proved less than adequate for the family’s dreams, a far larger company, one that the U.S government had bailed out during the financial crisis of 2007-2008, stepped in and offered his family firm an even bigger loan. It came from Citigroup, which lent Kushner Companies $325 million to help finance office buildings in Brooklyn. As the New York Times reported, “That loan was made in the spring of 2017, shortly after Mr. Kushner met in the White House with Citigroup’s chief executive, Michael L. Corbat.”","In all such situations, the appearance of impropriety was at best circumstantial. In his year-plus in the White House, Kushner unfortunately became the subject of “fake news,” above all by reporters pushing the absurd idea that his family business had somehow profited by his unpaid position in the Trump administration.","Death in a Revolving Door","Only in February did things start going truly badly for the young presidential adviser. Having held only an interim top-secret security clearance for more than a year while his background check stalled (reportedly due to fears that he might be manipulated by foreign powers over his family’s finances), he was suddenly downgraded to “secret” by White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, considered anything but a “Javanka” ally. Such a functional demotion meant that he suddenly had less access to key documents and crucial information of governing than the White House calligrapher. In the process, he got pummeled in the media (through no fault of his own, of course).","President Trump was reportedly “frustrated” by that media browbeating, but no less so by Kushner himself. According to the New York Times, Trump now viewed his son-in-law “as a liability because of his legal entanglements, the investigations of the Kushner family’s real estate company, and the publicity over having his security clearance downgraded.” It even began to be rumored that the president had privately asked Chief of Staff Kelly to begin the process of pushing not just Kushner but his own daughter out of the White House. Given the president’s well-documented predisposition to turn his back on former loyalists, that proved to be the end of the road. In Trumpian terms, Kushner quickly found himself not six feet out of power, but six feet under it.","It was with deep regret that Jared Kushner left behind his cozy office at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and his unfinished masterpiece: peace in the Middle East (and possibly the world). He did, however, retain the Washington residence that the first daughter and he had occupied for $15,000 a month. That humble abode was owned by Chilean mogul Andrónico Luksic, whose mining company happens to be mired in a dispute with the U.S government over billions of dollars (which, it goes without saying, had no bearing on the Kushners’ choice of a dwelling).","In his post-political life, Kushner faces another problem he couldn’t solve while in the White House: by January 2019 the Kushner family organization needs to cough up $1.2 billion to save its flagship New York property from defaulting, a building that, despite Kushner’s well known savvy when it comes to... well, everything, has been losing money since it was purchased for a record $1.8 billion in 2007. Fortunately, who knows better than the Trump family and by extension the Kushners that, after every possible investor is exhausted, bankruptcy court is always an option.","In the end, Kushner’s White House journey was through a door revolving around the instability of Donald Trump’s judgment.","And so Jared Kushner’s political career ended. Of course, he’ll always have, if not Paris, then Jerusalem and the odd trip to Mexico.","He is survived in the White House by his father-in-law and, for the time being, his wife. Meanwhile, that revolving door continues to spin.","Nomi Prins is a TomDispatch regular. Her new book, Collusion: How Central Bankers Rigged the World (Nation Books), will be published May 1.

Senator Lindsey Graham, another Republican, said if Trump were to dismiss Mueller, it would mark “the beginning of the end of his presidency.”","AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, said: “As the speaker has always said, Mr. Mueller and his team should be able to do their job.”","In an effort to tamp down the chatter, White House lawyer Ty Cobb issued a statement on Sunday night saying Trump was not weighing Mueller’s removal.","“In response to media speculation and related questions being posed to the Administration, the White House yet again confirms that the President is not considering or discussing the firing of the Special Counsel, Robert Mueller,” he said.","The Republican comments underscored the risks for Trump if he goes too far to thwart the federal probe.","“I don’t know what the designs are on Mueller, but it seems to be building toward that (firing him), and I just hope it doesn’t go there, because it can’t. We can’t in Congress accept that,” Flake told CNN’s “State of the Union.”","“So I would expect to see considerable pushback in the next couple of days urging the president not to go there.”","In a series of tweets over the weekend, Trump accused the FBI leadership of lies, corruption and leaking information. He called the Russia probe a politically motivated witch hunt.","“The Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime,” Trump said on Saturday. On Sunday, he attacked former FBI Director James Comey and McCabe, top officials who were involved in the Russia probe and subsequently fired.","The U.S. intelligence community has concluded that Moscow conducted an influence campaign aimed at swaying the 2016 presidential election to Trump over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. Mueller is investigating the Russian meddling and any possible collusion with the Trump campaign.","On Saturday, Trump’s personal lawyer John Dowd urged the Justice Department official overseeing Mueller, Rod Rosenstein, to “bring an end to alleged Russia Collusion investigation manufactured by McCabe’s boss James Comey.”","Republican U.S. Representative Trey Gowdy criticized Dowd in an interview with “Fox News Sunday.”","“I think the president’s attorney, frankly, does him a disservice when he says that and when he frames the investigation that way,” Gowdy said. “If you have an innocent client, Mr. Dowd, act like it.”","TRUMP FRUSTRATED","White House legislative affairs director Marc Short said the Trump team was fully cooperating in the Mueller investigation and that the president was expressing his growing frustration with how long the probe has lasted.","Graham, a co-author of legislation that would make it harder for a president to fire a special counsel, said it was very important that Mueller be allowed to proceed without interference and that many Republicans share this view.","“The only reason Mr. Mueller could ever be dismissed is for cause.

He should’ve been allowed to finish through the weekend,” Senator Marco Rubio said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”","Rubio, who supports the special counsel probe, said the decision to fire McCabe was made before the release of the Justice Department inspector general’s report that Attorney General Jeff Sessions cited in his dismissal.

When Candace Jean Andersen came across a photo of a group of people at a 1971 science conference in Virginia, she noticed that the only person who was unidentified in the caption was a black woman. Curious to know who the trailblazer was, she took to Twitter to ask for help in her search, in an attempt to unearth what turned out to be another “Hidden Figures” story.","Andersen’s plea was met by more than 11,000 people who chimed in to help identify the only female at the science conference. She tells Yahoo Lifestyle it was beautiful how “complete strangers [came together] using their time to jump in and help just because they wanted to,” she says. “Asking colleagues, digging through archives, passing the word on until the mystery was solved… it was really great.”","After several tips from across the web, Andersen was able to track down a coordinator of the science conference named Suzanne Contos, who decided do a little digging of her own to help find out who the mystery woman was.","Suzanne reached out to other attendees, some of whom were able to identify her and provide a name.","They were able to put a name to the half-covered face: Sheila Jones. They claimed that the mystery woman had been an administrator and most likely not even officially invited to the conference.","But Andersen was not satisfied with the answers based on speculations, and neither was the Twitterverse. If Twitter had come so far as to track down other attendees and coordinators, concrete and factual information on Jones had to be out there. And it was.","That’s when two workers from the Smithsonian reached out to Andersen. They did an archival search, in which they were able to identify with certainty that the mystery woman was not just an administrator or “uninvited person” but an actual scientist.","“She was a Biological Research Technician for Smithsonian Institution in (at least) 1972 & ’73; a position which required a BS or MA degree,” Anderson wrote.","The mystery woman, no longer a mystery, was Sheila M. Jones (her maiden name was Sheila D. Minor), and Andersen contacted her. “She seemed excited at first that I found her, and excited to see that picture,” Andersen says.","Jones gave her details on her life as a scientist and told her that in fact, she had a bachelor of science degree in biology at the time of the conference.","Jones also told Andersen about the path that her career subsequently took:","Those following the story were overjoyed to have found Jones and learned about her life as a trailblazing black woman scientist dating back to the 1970s.","Yes, thank you to Andersen and the Twitterverse for helping bring well-deserved recognition to Jones and her incredible life.","Read more from Yahoo Lifestyle:","Girls, teens are left out of #MeToo, says 13-year-old activist\nWhy ‘Museum Mammy’ believes the feminist movement ‘will never be perfect’\nYahoo readers weigh in on what ‘feminism’ means to them","This post was originally published on Yahoo Lifestyle."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab004172000007d06eb25c3.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Watch Blue Ivy Bid $19,000 On Art Like It's No Big Deal","authors":"Ron Dicker","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/watch-blue-ivy-bid-19000-on-art-like-its-no-big-deal_us_5aaf9052e4b0c33361b21c2c","short_description":"She showed Jay-Z and Beyoncé who's the boss at an LA auction.","date":"2018-03-19"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"WOMEN","headline":"Jameela Jamil's 'I Weigh' Instagram Celebrates Body Positivity, Self-Worth","authors":"Jenna Amatulli","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jameela-jamils-i-weigh-instagram-celebrates-body-positivity-self-worth_us_5aafb558e4b0c33361b25d43","short_description":"The “I Weigh” movement hopes to show individuals their value so they can see “how amazing” they are “beyond the flesh on our bones.”","date":"2018-03-19"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"So Did A Major Negan Twist Slyly Happen On 'Walking Dead'?","authors":"Bill Bradley","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/did-a-major-negan-twist-slyly-happen-on-walking-dead_us_5aac1b34e4b0c33361b05a81","short_description":"Carl, this is all your fault.","date":"2018-03-19"},"articleContent":["What just happened?","“The Walking Dead” aired one of its best Season 8 episodes, “The Key,” on Sunday, but there’s one lingering question — and I’m not even talking about that mysterious new group that showed up.","Uh, did the show just kill Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan)?","In the episode, the Saviors ― led, of course, by Negan ― drive over to Hilltop to stage an attack against their rivals with zombie-blood-tainted weapons. The idea is that even a nick will cause victims to fall ill with the zombie virus. In fact, a good bit of time is dedicated to showing us that Negan has undeniably covered his barbed-wire-wrapped baseball bat, Lucille, with zombie blood.","Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) has other plans.","He sniffs out the specific vehicle with Negan onboard and rams into him, leading to a car chase. In the process, Rick causes Negan’s car to wreck, and the two end up pursuing each other on foot through an abandoned building with walkers inside.","That’s pretty baller. But this is where it gets weird.","Rick ends up procuring Lucille, and while struggling with Negan, pretty clearly hits him in the arm with the bat. Sure, Negan is wearing a leather jacket, so the barbs would’ve had to penetrate the sturdy material ― and Rick did light the bat on fire before he hit him.","But that bat had been sitting in a bucket of zombie blood, basically just marinating, prior to the fight.","I’m not familiar with the rules of sterilizing a zombie blood-infused baseball bat, but even if it was lit afire, I’d advise against getting slammed in the arm with one.","The show moves past this moment pretty quickly, though.","We’d probably ignore the hit entirely if not for the death of Carl (Chandler Riggs) earlier in Season 8. Carl died as a result of a zombie bite obtained in Episode 6, “The King, the Widow, and Rick.” Fans didn’t even notice the bite had occurred until a couple episodes later.","Back to Sunday’s episode: Negan eventually escapes Rick and wakes up in a car, having been kidnapped by Jadis (Pollyanna McIntosh), former leader of the Scavengers. She soon knocks him out, but why was he unconscious in the first place? Could he have perhaps been feeling the effects of the zombie virus?","Listen, anything is possible. After all, in “The Walking Dead” comics, Negan and Carl had a lot of storyline that wasn’t included in the show.","Following Carl’s death, Negan actor Morgan posted a tribute to Riggs, citing the Carl-and-Negan dynamic as a big reason he joined the show, adding that he’ll “forever be disappointed” that the two couldn’t play out that relationship more.","Now that there’s no Carl, could Negan be a goner, too?","A new villain may have already replaced him. After Negan didn’t return to the Saviors, Simon (Steven Ogg), one of Negan’s top guys, stepped up and told the group to basically eliminate the Hilltop. Negan originally just wanted to hurt some of the rivals, turning them into zombies to scare others into submission.","Simon is an even more malevolent presence than Negan right now.","Beyond all this, a new group showed up and gave Maggie (Lauren Cohan) food and infrastructure information in exchange for music records. (They could be a teaser for the Commonwealth, an elitist group in the “Walking Dead” comics.)","Oh, there was also a naked zombie. Who cares, though? If the show kills off Negan this soon, what the crap is even going on?","In all likelihood, Negan will live. Why wouldn’t he live? But if you asked me before Season 8, I’d probably have said the same thing about Carl.","What a trip.

The app, which announced the partnership Monday, has an ambitious goal: reduce incarceration and recidivism by offering local governments “an alternative to holding low-risk people behind bars simply because they can’t afford bail.”","“We are increasingly alarmed by the injustice in our criminal justice system,” said Jay-Z in a statement with the announcement. “Money, time and lives are wasted with the current policies. It’s time for an innovative and progressive technology that offers sustainable solutions to tough problems.”","Promise’s website positions the app as a service that aims to “get people out of jail and provide ongoing support and supervision to help keep them out.”","The app would come into play during the pretrial process to aid participants who can’t afford bail and. After a comprehensive intake procedure, the team behind the app would create an individualized plan going forward.","Promise says it will then monitor and support participants by generating an intelligent calendar of the participant’s obligations ― think court appearances, drug testing, substance abuse treatment, etc ― and sets reminders. The app also “provides coordinated referrals and support based on individual needs, including job training, housing, counseling, etc.”","Government agencies will have access to the app’s offerings, as will users on parole and those who would otherwise be incarcerated.","Co-founder Phaedra Ellis-Lamkins told Rolling Stone that she hopes the app will “create a sustainable and scalable program that will reduce the number of people behind bars, recidivism and the cost of care by extending the capabilities of community supervision.”","An app like this seems particularly needed when you consider that pretrial detention costs $13.6 billion each year and the nation’s high rates of recidivism, or when someone released from prison reoffends. A Bureau of Justice Statistic study found inmates released from state prisons have a five-year recidivism rate of 76.6 percent. A USSC study calculated comparable federal prisoners who are released have a 44.7 percent re-arrest rate after five years.","Jay-Z’s support for the app’s mission aligns with other causes the rapper has spoken about. Just last year, he wrote an op-ed in Time about the “exploitative bail industry” and pretrial incarceration.","“If you’re from neighborhoods like the Brooklyn one I grew up in, if you’re unable to afford a private attorney, then you can be disappeared into our jail system simply because you can’t afford bail,” he wrote. “Millions of people are separated from their families for months at a time — not because they are convicted of committing a crime, but because they are accused of committing a crime.”","The Roc Nation Twitter account has also frequently posted about the current incarceration of Meek Mill, frequently retweeting messages like “Free Meek Mill” and stories related to the rapper’s case.","Promise will formally debut on March 20 at Y Combinator Demo Day, a presentation for startups.","The app is currently onboarding one county. A spokesperson told HuffPost that the company is “in the contracting process for another county and are in talks with several other jurisdictions to offer the platform as an alternative to county jail pre-trial.”","“We’re hoping to continue forming relationships with communities across the country to create a better system for everyone,” the spokesperson said."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab022d5200000d30ceb25ec.jpeg?cache=aiFQpvG5za&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Here's One 'American Idol' Winner With A New Success Story","authors":"Lauren Moraski","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/scotty-mccreery-american-idol_us_5aa6af9ae4b03c9edfae68ff","short_description":"After some drama and a 5-year musical hiatus, Scotty McCreery is back with a new album and his first No. 1 hit.","date":"2018-03-19"},"articleContent":["Scotty McCreery stood backstage at Build Series in New York awaiting our live sit-down interview when he hopped on the phone with his fiancée, Gabi Dugal.","“I was in the dressing room today giving her my thoughts on the invitations, so I think we finally have those ready to go,” he said.","Those “invitations” are meant for the couple’s summer wedding. The pair met in kindergarten, started dating when they were high school seniors and got engaged last fall. But it’s clear sparks flew very early on. McCreery says that while in kindergarten, Gabi wrote the words “Mrs. Gabi McCreery” in her diary with hearts around it.","McCreery said his fiancée is definitely doing more heavy lifting in terms of wedding planning.","“I just don’t have as much to offer on colors or floral designs ― different things like that. But I can taste test,” he told HuffPost at the Build Series, which is owned by HuffPost’s parent company, Oath. “Catering is my specialty. I will help her with that.”","“I’m going to have a big say in the playlist,” McCreery said. “We’re going to have a DJ, not a band. And she will, too. But we love the throwback jams to dance to.”","It’s no surprise that the Season 10 winner of “American Idol” wants to be involved in the music for their big day. In fact, a lot of his own music is inspired by his soon-to-be-wife. His new album, “Seasons Change,” even features a song about his proposal.","McCreery wrote the track called “This Is It” roughly two weeks before he popped the question near Grandfather Mountain in North Carolina ― in their “spot.” It’s an area they stumbled upon a few years ago while getting lost looking for a waterfall. They found themselves on some beautiful cliffs instead; and now every time they go hiking there, they make sure to visit those cliffs.","“I had everything planned out. I knew where I was going to ask her and how I was going to ask her … I think that’s how it tipped her off because I don’t plan anything ever … Luckily she said yes, so we put [‘This Is It’] on the record.”","The album has been a long time coming for McCreery, who won “Idol” in 2011 at 17 years old and released his self-titled debut that same year. Two more albums followed in 2012 and 2013 ― and then nothing for five years. During that time, plenty of issues started to creep up.","“We had just come off a platinum and a gold single … There were decisions made — the powers that be — about what direction they wanted the music to go to and the next single, which was definitely a pivot from what I traditionally like to lean with my music. Lo and behold, that song didn’t work out and a few months later we get dropped [from my label],” McCreery said. “Life comes at you fast. But hey, for 24 hours I was at a down point and you just pick yourself up and move on. That’s all you can do in life. So a year later, we finally got done with all the legal stuff that goes along with all that. That was a long year.”","Also around that time, McCreery’s former manager sued him during a legal dispute involving back pay. And in 2014, he was robbed and held up at gunpoint during a home invasion.","“That’ll put life in perspective,” he said. “I’ve been sued. Like who the heck gets sued when you’re like 20 — but me! It’s been a crazy crazy few years. But a lot to learn from. I feel like I’m a better man today because of the experiences I’ve had.”","It all helped inspire songs on the new album, including the title track.","“Seasons Change” was the the first song I wrote back in ’16 or ’17 right after we had just gotten released from our last label,” McCreery said. “Before that I was in such a down spot and so low. And it wasn’t a happy spot. And I was like, ’You know what? You’ve got a great life. You get to travel the world singing country music and you get to write songs for a living. So pick yourself up and go make something out of it. And just have fun.’”","McCreery certainly picked himself up. “Seasons Change,” which came out Friday, features his first No. 1 hit country hit, “Five More Minutes.”","And soon, he’ll return to his “Idol” roots. McCreery will appear on an upcoming episode of ABC’s “American Idol” reboot.","“I’ve already flown out to L.A. and filmed a little mentoring bit with one of the contestants. That was fun,” he said. “I enjoy doing that because I feel like I learned a lot in my team and know some stuff that as a contestant on ‘Idol’ no one can really prepare you for … I try to offer my tricks of the trade.”","Now 24 years old, McCreery is ready to offer advice on what he’s learned about music and the business over the years.","His main piece of advice?","“You just gotta stay true to yourself because there’s a lot of opinions from all different directions,” he said, adding, “Listen to everybody’s advice but at the end of the day make your own decisions and follow your heart.”","“Seasons Change” is out now.","Watch the full Build Series interview below."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aac104f2000003800eb22a9.jpeg?cache=ppAqTXUYt3&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"COMEDY","headline":"John Oliver Wants Your Help Telling Mike Pence To 'Go F**k Himself'","authors":"Ed Mazza","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-oliver-mike-pence-bundo-book_us_5aaf3ac3e4b0337adf8520a7","short_description":"\"Last Week Tonight\" gives the Pence family's new bunny book a gay makeover.","date":"2018-03-19"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"BUSINESS","headline":"Claire's Is Entering A New Chapter In Life: Bankruptcy","authors":"Rebecca Shapiro","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/claires-bankruptcy_us_5ab00d6de4b0e862383a6ee6","short_description":"Growing up is never easy.","date":"2018-03-19"},"articleContent":["First Toys R Us, and now Claire’s.

But she never expected to win the U.S. Open in August, just a month after her comeback.","“There was no real thought to it,” she said. “It was just getting out here and playing.”","However, there was one person who knew from the beginning that Stephens would dominate.","At the beginning of last year’s U.S. Open, Stephens crossed paths with sportscaster and former professional tennis player Mary Carillo, whom she’d met while at the Tennis Channel. It was the beginning of the tournament, and while Sloane was just happy to be back, Carillo saw more.","“She’s like, ‘You’re playing so great, I think you could win the U.S. Open.’ And I was like, ‘I don’t really know about that,’” Stephens joked. “But I was just so focused on having a good time and just having fun that everything just kind of fell into place. I think the journey is just perseverance and just kinda staying true to yourself.”","Tennis, like golf and swimming, is a sport typically marketed to whiter audiences, with notoriously few women of color represented at its top levels.

Tribal elders and other members of the Navajo Nation, Hopi, Zuni and Ute Mountain Ute tribes made it clear at the gathering that they are focused on ensuring the area is given the protections they believe it deserves: nothing less than the 1.35 million acres set aside by President Barack Obama in 2016.","Malcolm Lehi, a member of the Ute Mountain Ute tribe who lives near White Mesa, said energy is building in indigenous communities, and lawmakers and government officials can’t turn a blind eye.","“It’s a really strong movement,” he said. “I like what I see.”","In December, on the recommendation of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, President Donald Trump reduced Bears Ears by 85 percent, cutting it to 201,876 acres, and divided it into two disconnected areas. The Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition, the group of tribes that petitioned for monument status, condemned the move — which opened the door for new mining claims — and filed a legal challenge.","That Trump decided to gut Bears Ears came as no surprise, given comments he and Zinke made early in their review of the area.","The national monument designation “should never have happened” and was made “over the profound objections” of Utah citizens, Trump said at an executive order signing ceremony. And in a summary report in August, Zinke said the overwhelming number of public comments in support of maintaining the size of Bears Ears and other monuments was simply due to “a well-orchestrated national campaign organized by multiple organizations.”","The last few months have only further confirmed critics’ fears about the administration’s motives. Uranium mining company Energy Fuels Resources, a U.S. subsidiary of a Canadian firm, lobbied the administration to dramatically reduce the monument’s size, The Washington Post reported in December. And The New York Times obtained emails via a public records request that show potential future oil extraction played a central role in the decision.","The storytelling event on Sunday was organized by Utah Diné Bikéyah, a nonprofit organization working to safeguard Bears Ears and other ancestral lands, and came a little more than a week ahead of public scoping meetings that the Bureau of Land Management is hosting as it plans for how to manage the new, smaller monument.","Tara Benally, of the Navajo Nation, said Bears Ears has sustained her people for generations, and that they still use the area for religious ceremonies and to collect food and traditional medicinal plants.","“Losing Bears Ears to a cloud of industrial smoke from extraction and mining does not keep that preservation of life for us,” she said.","Clark Tenakhongva, an artist and the vice chairman of the Hopi Tribe, echoed that message. The Hopi, he said, believe they were the first to occupy this area and feel a responsibility to protect it.","“We do not want or believe that mining is good for our people,” he said at the event. “It may bring revenue, but what are we doing to the Earth?”","The tribes say they were ignored throughout the administration’s monthslong review — a claim the Interior Department has dismissed. Zinke did meet with representatives of the tribal coalition last year, but for just one hour. He also toured Bears Ears with several monument opponents, including Utah Gov. Gary Herbert (R) and commissioners of San Juan County, where the monument is located.","Zinke sparred with Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) on this topic during a congressional budget hearing last week. Gallego, who has introduced legislation that would protect the monument’s original boundary, asked the former Montana congressman about how many times he had met with industry representatives versus coalition members. Zinke said “all sides were represented” in his recommendation to Trump.","Gallego toured Bears Ears over the weekend and ended his visit with a stop at Utah Diné Bikéyah’s event. He told HuffPost that meeting with tribal members and hearing stories about their connections to the area only reinforced for him that the area is worth preserving. Shrinking the monument is an attack on the United States’ public lands and is “stripping parts of, I would say, people’s souls, because the Native American population here is so connected with that,” he said.","Gallego added that he expects “a monumental fight” ― one he sees the Trump administration ultimately losing, whether in court or via congressional action.","“People are excited about protecting Bears Ears,” he told tribal members. “It’s something we have to continue to work on. But what I see for the first time in a long time is that the movement to protect Bears Ears is on the offense.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aafac261f0000180316ac6b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"In This Red State, Progressives Are Taking Matters Into Their Own Hands","authors":"Jeffrey Young","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/in-this-red-state-progressives-are-taking-matters-into-their-own-hands_us_5aadb598e4b0337adf8449fa","short_description":"Amateur activists, sick of being ignored by the GOP, are fighting to cover the uninsured.","date":"2018-03-19"},"articleContent":["IDAHO FALLS, Idaho ― It’s a lonely feeling being a progressive in the deep red state of Idaho, but Amy Pratt is finally ready to channel her frustrations into taking action she believes can improve the lives of her fellow Gem State residents.","In a state that’s been run by Republicans since the 1990s and that hasn’t gone for a Democratic presidential candidate since President Lyndon Johnson’s landslide win in 1964, Idahoans like Pratt are tired of feeling ignored ― and they’re banding together in living rooms and libraries and Facebook groups across the state.","The activists are focusing on an issue they think can bring Idahoans together: skirting their GOP-led legislature to make Idaho the next state to adopt Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion.","“My entire life, I’ve been watching the lack of care for people,” said Pratt, a 47-year-old bus driver. In her view, the state’s political leaders put money “in their own pockets for everything, and I have been waiting for a revolution, of a sort.”","She spent the cold winter weekends knocking on doors in her conversative hometown of Idaho Falls trying to persuade her neighbors to play a small part in that revolution.","Pratt is a volunteer for Reclaim Idaho, a tiny grassroots operation with a single paid employee and a mission to give Idahoans an opportunity to vote on a ballot initiative in November’s elections to expand Medicaid to working adults.","From March 11-13, HuffPost traveled across southern Idaho along the path of the Snake River from Idaho Falls to Boise with stops in between in Pocatello and Twin Falls.","In those southern Idaho towns, organizers, volunteers and first-time political candidates got together to carry out an ambitious quest to overrule the elected Republicans who run the state and haven’t taken action to help the uninsured.","The very fact that this campaign exists is evidence that Idaho’s government isn’t working the way it should, said Pat Tucker, who is trying her hand at elected politics by running for a local state House seat. “People are frustrated,” she said. “People are feeling personally the consequences of not being represented, of not being heard, in their own lives.”","Deep Frustration","These activists, most of them new to politics, spoke of being inspired by the opportunity to make positive change in their communities. Some spoke of being driven to act by the election of President Donald Trump. But they all lamented the feeling that their government doesn’t care what they want.","Like liberal activists mobilizing around the country on a variety of issues, taking action is making these Idaho volunteers feel less alone and more empowered.","“I didn’t think most of us realize how many out there feel the same way, and I found that knocking on doors,” Pratt said. “I hope this spurs more throughout the state, I hope this spurs more throughout the country.”","An estimated 78,000 uninsured people would be eligible for health coverage if Idaho, one of the 18 states that hasn’t opted into the Medicaid expansion, accepted federal dollars available through the Affordable Care Act to participate.","Nine percent of Idahoans lack health coverage, the same as the national uninsured rate. For 18 years before getting a new job in 2017, Pratt was one of them. “I can go out there and sell this. I can go out there from experience,” she said. “The fact is, everybody knows somebody who falls into the gap, and everybody has a story like this.”.","Luke Mayville and Garrett Strizich, both 32, natives of Sandpoint in the far north of Idaho, founded Reclaim Idaho last year because they believe state legislators are out of touch with what their constituents actually want.","The GOP Rules Idaho","Idaho is a Republican stronghold. Trump won 59 percent of the presidential vote in 2016 to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s 28 percent. The state hasn’t had a Democratic governor since 1995 and the GOP has had control of both the state House and state Senate since 1992. Democrats make up just 11 percent of the state’s registered voters, compared to 50 percent registered as Republicans.","Idaho has an unusual relationship with the Affordable Care Act.","The state hasn’t taken up the Medicaid expansion and recently tried to allow health insurance companies to sell policies that ignore key aspects of Obamacare, chiefly its ban on charging higher premiums to people with preexisting conditions.","But it’s also the most conservative state to establish a state-run health insurance exchange, Your Health Idaho. Gov. C.L. “Butch” Otter has proposed health care reforms that would extend coverage to some of those who’d qualify for Medicaid under an expansion, but legislators haven’t acted on them. That’s despite a unanimous 2012 recommendation by Otter’s hand-picked Medicaid expansion working group that the state expand the program.","All of those obstacles doesn’t mean Mayville and Strizich are crazy for trying to make Idaho the latest state to take up the Medicaid expansion, which would make health benefits available to anyone earning up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level (for a single person, the 133 percent figure is about $16,000).","According to a survey conducted by Boise State University in December, 71 percent of Idahoans support closing the so-called Medicaid gap, with just 22 percent opposing.","The gap refers to a quirk in how the Affordable Care Act was implemented. As written, the law envisioned a nationwide Medicaid expansion for those under 133 percent of poverty, and also made tax credits available to people whose incomes are above the poverty level, which is about $12,000 for a single person.","But the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that states could opt out of the Medicaid expansion, leaving those with incomes between those two thresholds with no source of coverage. In states like Idaho, they’re effectively too poor for Obamacare.","Pratt was one of about 20 volunteers who got together for a meeting in Idaho Falls March 11 that transitioned into a celebration complete with guitar and banjo players. They gathered at a restored early 20th century house that Tucker, its owner, converted into a children’s art gallery to honor her daughter, Cady, who died in 2002 at 11 years old in a car crash in neighboring Montana.","Local elections, mostly for bonds and levies to fund schools, were coming on March 13, and Reclaim Idaho planned its biggest one-day effort to date. Mayville said the goal was to collect 10,000 signatures on Election Day.","As the evening wound down, the crowd heard from Mayville, who traveled back to Idaho with his wife, Elena Mayville, from their home in New York City. (The couple is planning to relocate to Idaho eventually.)","“There’s one thing that they really underestimated when people were skeptical of this campaign ― and this is something that we saw early on. They underestimated how much hope people have all over this state,” Luke Mayville said. “To have hope, victory doesn’t have to be certain. It doesn’t even have to be probable. To have hope, victory just has to be possible, and it has to be a victory that’s worth fighting for.”","Meeting For Coffee and Activism","Smaller gatherings on March 12 at Pocatello’s bohemian Bru House Galilei coffee house in the shadow of a vast mountain range and at a private home in a quiet Twin Falls neighborhood brought out handfuls of activists making plans for Election Day.","Volunteers in Pocatello, including Chris Stevens, a retired school teacher who’s also mounting her first-ever political campaign by running for Bannock County Commission, laid out cookies and crudités and talked strategy.","In Twin Falls, Democratic state Senate candidate Deborah Silver, who lost a state Senate race in 2016 and the state treasurer race in 2014, hosted a meeting in her home.","On March 13 in Boise and its suburbs, volunteers met in coffee shops to check in, collect materials and share stories. Aaron Swisher, one of two Democrats vying to challenge U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson (R) this November, stopped by to lend support. It’s Swisher’s first political campaign.","The obstacles to success are real, and not just because of Idaho’s conservative political base.","The state doesn’t have a history of successful ballot initiatives and referenda. In order to get Medicaid expansion on the ballot, Reclaim Idaho has to get 56,000 signatures, which would meet the threshold of 6 percent of the state’s registered voters. But under the law, they have to meet the same 6 percent threshold in 18 of Idaho’s 35 state legislative districts. They have until May 1 to submit their petitions.","That means they have to campaign in the reddest parts of Idaho. It also means they have to spread out across a state that’s the 14th largest by area and sixth-least dense by population. At least the Medicaid Mobile, which broke down during a stop in Hailey last month, is up and running again.","Disappointment, With A Side Of Optimism","Election Day didn’t meet Mayville’s highest expectations. Mostly in the Boise suburbs and in Lewiston, on the border with Washington state, about 200 volunteers collected 5,000 signatures, half of what he wanted.","Voter turnout was low, even for an off-year election on relatively obscure local matters, Mayville said. The enthusiasm of the volunteers in Idaho Falls, Pocatello and Twin Falls didn’t translate into a lot of signatures.","At Boise’s Lake Hazel Middle School, Kenneth Freeman, 58, and Paula Schuelke, 71, were having a little luck getting signatures. The weather cooperated but there weren’t many voters coming to the polls during the key post-work evening hours.","Freeman has been active in progressive politics before, but his anger at Trump ― especially over net neutrality ― drove him to do more. “Trump made a leftist out of me,” he said.","Schuelke also is new to politics. Taking action lets her feel she has a say in a state where the elected leaders aren’t listening, she said. “We are so out of balance. If you are in the middle or you are a Democrat, you have no voice,” she said.","There’s a lot left to do, Mayville told HuffPost, but they’re getting there. After Election Day, Reclaim Idaho had collected 29,000 signatures, passing the halfway point. And they’ve either met or very nearly met the 6 percent threshold in as many as seven legislative districts and are within a couple hundred signatures in eight more, he said.","“That means that by the deadline we’re going to have the vast majority of signatures that we need collected by volunteers, because we’re likely to get at least 10,000 or 15,000 more in the next six weeks,” Mayville said.","So far, this has been an all-volunteer effort. Luke and Elena Mayville and Garrett and Emily Strizich aren’t getting paid. All their funding has come from small donations.","The Strizichs spent $1,500 of their own money to buy a camper van that became the Medicaid Mobile that’s been up and down Idaho over the past few months. Supporters have signed the outside of the van, making it a kind of rolling petition.","Influential organizations including the Idaho Medical Association, Idaho Hospital Association and AARP formed a coalition three years ago to promote Medicaid expansion called Close the Gap Idaho. So far, however, those groups haven’t pitched in to help collect signatures for the ballot initiative.","Reclaim Idaho does have support from a union-backed national organization called the Fairness Project, which helped activists in Maine win a ballot initiative to expand Medicaid last year and scored victories in campaigns to raise the minimum wage in five states in 2016.","Paid canvassers funded by the Fairness Project also has begun gathering signatures in Idaho. Mayville didn’t know how many they collected and their tally isn’t included in the 29,000 Reclaim Idaho has secured.","As the campaign continues and, he hopes, gains more traction, Mayville expects Reclaim Idaho will get more help. “More and more people around the state, organizations around the state, are seeing the momentum we have and they really believe in this cause,” he told HuffPost.","The groups that compose Close the Gap Idaho are divided on whether to assist Reclaim Idaho, said Lauren Necochea, a spokeswoman for the coalition and the director of Idaho Voices for Children in Boise. But they are taking notice.","“The volume of the outpouring of volunteers has been astounding, and they’ve made remarkable progress just using volunteers,” Necochea said. Idaho Voices for Children is weighing how it can ramp up its involvement in the campaign separate from the coalition, she said.","In the meantime, the Mayvilles, the Strizichs and their small army of volunteers will keep knocking on doors. And the warming weather creates opportunities to find supporters at places like the Boise Farmers Market, the Treefort Music Festival, and gun-control rallies planned throughout the state, he said.","For Pratt, the Medicaid expansion campaign is a chance to prove that the people of Idaho can make change, even when their elected representatives won’t. She wants to win not only because she believes in the cause of expanding health coverage, but to prove a point to the lawmakers in Boise and Washington, D.C.","“We put them in office,” she said. “We have the power.”","CORRECTION: A previous version of this story indicated the Mayvilles planned to move to Idaho permanently this year. While they intend to move to Idaho permanently, they have yet to set a date for the move. This story also has been updated to correct Kenneth Freeman’s age and include information about his past political activities."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aadb9ea1e0000fb077aefd8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Jim Carrey Starts Controversy With Painting That Looks Like Sarah Huckabee Sanders","authors":"Jenna Amatulli","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jim-carrey-starts-controversy-with-painting-that-looks-like-sarah-huckabee-sanders_us_5aaff3f5e4b0697dfe19476a","short_description":"The 56-year-old also tweeted a painting that looks like President Trump as the Wicked Witch of the West.","date":"2018-03-19"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Katy Perry Disses Taylor Swift On 'American Idol' Because Feuds Die Hard","authors":"Ron Dicker","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/katy-perry-taylor-swift-feud-amercan-idol_us_5aaf79e3e4b0337adf855008","short_description":"The \"Roar\" singer said a lot to a contestant with very little.","date":"2018-03-19"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"BLACK VOICES","headline":"‘Black Panther’ Female Warriors Take Center Stage In New Spinoff","authors":"Elyse Wanshel","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/black-panther-female-warriors-get-spinoff_us_5aafba99e4b0c33361b269f8","short_description":"The Dora Milaje will kick butt with Spider-Man, the X-Men and the Avengers in the comic series.","date":"2018-03-19"},"articleContent":["Some “Grace Jones-looking chicks” are about to take a bite out of the Big Apple.","Marvel announced Friday that the Dora Milaje, AKA the badass female warriors from “Black Panther,” are getting a new comic miniseries, starting with the book Wakanda Forever: The Amazing Spider-Man.","The comic, which will be released in June, will be followed up with Wakanda Forever: X-Men in July and Wakanda Forever: Avengers! in August.","Author Nnedi Okorafor is writing the three-issue miniseries that begins with Okoye, Ayo and Aneka on a mission to New York City in which they team up with Peter Parker.","“Typically when you see them, they’re with T’Challa, representing and protecting him,” Okorafor told Vogue of the soldiers, who have become fan favorites since the film “Black Panther” premiered in February. “Now you’re going to see the Dora Miljae for the first time as an independent entity; they’re not under the shadow of the throne.”","Okorafor is a Hugo and Nebula award-winning author whose fantasy and sci-fi works are inspired by Nigerian folklore and explore Afro-futurism.","“I like to write the future; the Africa I feel can be and the Africa that will be, that has always been my vision,” she told Vogue.","This is not the first time the Dora Milaje has gotten its own Marvel spinoff, however. Black Panther: World of Wakanda, written by New York Times best-selling author Roxane Gay, was cancelled after only six issues in 2017 — just a few days after the trailer for the “Black Panther” film was released.","Gay’s spinoff followed warriors Aneka and Ayo as they lead a revolt against women’s oppression and the Wakanda monarchy, according to The Root. Aneka and Ayo were also characterized as very out and open lesbians.","In the film, Ayo (Florence Kasumba) plays a minor role and no details about her sexuality are showcased.","An earlier version of the movie reportedly had a scene in which Ayo flirts with Okoye (Danai Gurira) — though Marvel has said that their relationship was never supposed to be interpreted as romantic. Kasumba has said the scene was filmed, but does not know why it was cut.","She told Vulture in February that she suspects that the scene was taken out due to time restraints — but said she’d “love to” see Ayo’s sexuality get fleshed out more in future films.","So, it will be interesting to see how Ayo’s characterization develops in “Black Panther” movie sequels and in Okorafor’s comic series."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aaff24e1e000008087af20b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"The Iraq War Built The Modern Democratic Party.

Republican foreign policy has been defined by it, and Democrats have had to answer for their vote in favor of the invasion, which is now widely considered to be one of the country’s biggest mistakes in modern times.","The 2020 election could be a break from this history. It could be the first presidential election without the politics of the Iraq War, with nominees who don’t have the baggage of a pro-war vote and foreign policy debates that aren’t defined by the 2003-2011 conflict. But as Democrats move away from that front, they’re struggling to find a new voice on foreign policy.","Democratic politicians, and much of the rest of the country, are now united around the idea that America should not have invaded Iraq in 2003. From fabricated intelligence, a media and political establishment that largely accepted the administration’s spin, unrealistic expectations, poor planning and a culture of militarization, the affair became a cautionary tale of what happens when the public ― and more importantly, the people who are supposed to represent them in Washington ― sleepwalk their way through foreign policy and let politics dictate war.","But it wasn’t always this way. A majority of the Democratic caucus in the Senate sided with all but one Republican in authorizing the invasion. Some of them believed the George W. Bush administration’s case for war. More knew it was a bad idea but were afraid to speak out in that post-Sept. 11 era.","“It was done out of fear of being accused of being soft on terrorism,” said former Sen. Russ Feingold (D-Wis.), who was one of the 22 Democrats in the chamber who voted against the war. “The completely phony notion that Saddam Hussein had been tied to al Qaeda had been thrown around the country, and frankly, people did not vote their conscience. They voted politics.”","Iraq’s Dominance In Presidential Elections","In the first few years after the invasion, people started to change their minds about the war. The weapons of mass destruction Bush warned about didn’t exist, and the fighting dragged on long after he declared “mission accomplished” in May 2003. The progressive group MoveOn.org, which had advocated against the invasion, saw its membership skyrocket between 2002 and 2004.","“It was just out of nowhere,” recalled Eli Pariser, who was running MoveOn’s Iraq War campaign at the time. “There were thousands and thousands of people meeting all around the country. That was the first moment I felt like this was striking a much bigger chord than I thought.”","But the anti-Iraq War shift wasn’t enough to fully make an impact in the 2004 presidential election. Bush was re-elected, still riding the wave of patriotic fervor, while the Democratic Party struggled to come up with a compelling, convincing alternative to the war.","The 2006 midterm elections were completely different. The left, by this time, was gaining momentum around the idea that it was time to withdraw from Iraq. Progressive organizations on the ground were working with unions; think tanks like the Center for American Progress; and Democratic leaders in Congress to shift opinions both within the party and in the general public.","A key piece of the strategy was making hawks within the Democratic Party pay. Progressives ousted Sen. Joe Lieberman (D-Conn.), the party’s 2000 vice presidential nominee, in the Democratic primary that cycle. (The senator went on to win re-election as in independent.) But Tom Matzzie, another MoveOn veteran who also ran the coalition Americans Against Escalation In Iraq, said he still considered what happened a victory.","“For our political purposes, that almost didn’t matter,” Matzzie said of Lieberman’s win in the general election. “Every Democrat in Congress saw what happened and didn’t want that to happen to them ... The Lieberman primary really energized people across the country around the idea that this effort will take back the House and Senate in 2006.”","And they did. Democrats swept the midterms, knocking Republicans out of power in both chambers of Congress. Two critics of the war, Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.), took control as the leaders of the House and Senate.","By 2008, opposition to the Iraq War was firmly established in the party and was perhaps the major reason that Sen. Hillary Clinton (D-N.Y.) lost to Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) ― who was not in the Senate in 2002 but had spoken out against invasion. In the general election, Obama against Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who was one of the biggest hawks in Congress.","In 2012, Republican Mitt Romney, who lost to Obama, struggled on the issue of Iraq, criticizing the president’s withdrawal plan but largely avoiding the topic.","The war also played a role in the 2016 presidential elections, albeit a smaller one. Clinton remained haunted by the problems from 2008, and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) occasionally used her Iraq vote against her.","The war arguably had a bigger effect on the Republican side. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, widely considered the front-runner for the nomination, stumbled early in the race when he was unable to give a straight answer about whether he thought his brother’s war was a mistake.","Donald Trump, meanwhile, vocally called the war a mistake and claimed that he was publicly against the invasion from the beginning ― even though there is no evidence that he was.","Fresh Start In 2020","The 2020 election is still two years away, but the Democrats most often talked about as potential candidates ― people like Sens. Kamala Harris (Calif.) and Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) ― largely have political careers that started after the 2003 invasion.","And for the contenders whose careers do intersect with the war, there’s little indication that it will be a major issue if they run.","Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) voted to extend funding of the war in 2007, which was a break from most members of the party at the time. Former Vice President Joe Biden, another potential 2020 candidate, voted for the war, but he has disavowed his support and said it was a mistake.","Feingold said that he believes enough time has passed that the Democratic Party has a chance to have a clean slate.","“Democrats are going to say, ’Look, this is a new era. We’ve got to get this right,’” he said, adding, “That, I think, is the best approach. I don’t think the Iraq War is going to be terribly important in 2020.”","“After 9/11, the consensus among party elites was that you had to be pro-war,” Matzzie, the MoveOn veteran, said. “That consensus is totally shattered. The consensus is now, for a Democrat, that you can’t be the super pro-war hawk or you’re in danger inside the Democratic Party.”","As Iraq has faded as an issue for the party, Democrats have largely returned to talking about domestic and economic issues. In part, it’s because the country is focused there, but it’s also because these are the areas where Democrats have traditionally felt the strongest.","But many veterans of the Iraq fights worry that the party is giving up valuable ground in the national security arena that it was able to gain over the past 15 years ― making clear that strength doesn’t have to equal military might and that Republicans aren’t the only party that can be trusted on foreign policy. Officials haven’t offered clear alternatives to what Trump is doing that the party has been able to unify around.","“We’re struggling,” said Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.), a veteran who is emerging as a leading foreign policy voice the party.","“We need to talk about what a strong national security policy means,” he said. “For too long, Democrats have just been talking about watering down our national security position or saying that we need to invest in national security ― but not too much.”","During the Iraq War, Democrats coalesced around the need to withdraw, spurred in large part by an influential report from the Center for American Progress. The report called for “strategic redeployment” ― a proposal to draw down troops from Iraq and redistribute them to other locations. It offered a progressive alternative to the Bush approach, arguing that the war was hurting military readiness and draining resources away from true national security threats.","It wasn’t just “cut and run” ― it was an actual plan for how to withdraw and redeploy.","The plan gave Democrats something to cite when Republicans charged that they had no path forward and no alternative to what Bush was doing in Iraq. It was influential with lawmakers like Rep. John Murtha, a conservative Democrat from Pennsylvania who shook up the national debate when he gave a speech calling for withdrawal in November 2005. Murtha, who served in the Marines Corps for 37 years, was the first Vietnam combat veteran elected to Congress who became one of the most powerful lawmakers on defense issues.","“Our military is suffering. The future of our country is at risk. We can not continue on the present course,” he said at the time.","Democrats who needed cover to come out against the war, who were afraid of being called weak, now had a protector. When Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) said “thank God” Murtha was not in Congress for World War II, because otherwise “we would be here speaking Japanese or German,” Murtha was able to rebuke him in a way few other people could.","“Were you there?” Murtha responded. “Were you in Vietnam? Were you in Iraq?”","Gohmert admitted he had not fought in any of those locations.","Brian Katulis, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress and one of the authors of the strategic redeployment report, says part of the problem now is that Trump is so good at distracting people that it’s hard to get the left unified around one issue or one position.","“The Trump agenda on foreign policy is so potentially cataclysmic and disastrous,” he said. “We’re all like Pavlov’s dogs ― he does one thing and distracts us. We take our eye off the ball on huge issues.”","Looking For Alternatives","Right now, when Democrats talk about foreign policy, they tend to emphasize diplomacy and steadiness as a contrast to Trump hollowing out the State Department and tweeting recklessly, for example.","“I think Democrats are not afraid of using the military and certainly are supportive of [utilizing] the military,” said Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), an Iraq War veteran. “But we first and foremost understand that the primary tool of our foreign policy should be diplomacy, not military expeditions.”","But Democrats haven’t been able to unify in opposition even when it comes to responding to Trump’s foreign policy. In April 2017, when Trump launched missile strikes on Syria, many Democrats said they were furious that he didn’t involve Congress in the decision, saying what he did may be “unconstitutional.” Their objections were to the process ― in the end, they seemed to concede that the strikes themselves were the right thing to do anyway.","There are attempts by some prominent members of the party to talk more about foreign policy. Sanders, who has built his reputation by focusing obsessively on domestic economic issues, gave a high-profile foreign policy speech in September that attempted to tie his core policies to national security. It reframed the debate away from terrorism and whether to go to war and argued that there needs to be a holistic approach to what’s happening the world.","“What foreign policy also means is that if we are going to expound the virtues of democracy and justice abroad, and be taken seriously, we need to practice those values here at home,” Sanders said. “That means continuing the struggle to end racism, sexism, xenophobia and homophobia here in the United States and making it clear that when people in America march on our streets as neo-Nazis or white supremacists, we have no ambiguity in condemning everything they stand for.”","But speeches like this are usually more about vision, not about specifics. And many progressives acknowledge that the party needs to communicate more details and a clearer alternative. As Katrina vanden Heuvel, editor of “The Nation” magazine, wrote in 2017, “Where is the Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren of foreign policy? Many Democrats are positioning themselves to take on Trump four years from now. They’d be wise to seek leadership by demonstrating it.”","“The Democrats have a chance to offer [an alternative] again against someone who’s even worse than George Bush in these respects,” Feingold said. “So I’m looking forward to people getting out there and starting to talk about this. I think it would be a mistake to think about only domestic issues, as important as they are, because Donald Trump is unbelievably unqualified to handle foreign policy.”","Ben Rhodes and Jake Sullivan, who both held top foreign policy positions in President Barack Obama’s administration, have started a new group, National Security Action, intended to be a political strike force to respond to Trump. It won’t be developing new policies, but it will connect the media, Democratic politicians and other groups with experts in this area and, they hope, get more traction for the progressive plans that do exist.","“There is a clear alternative, in that I think Democrats believe that we need to use military force when necessary, but we also need to exhaust diplomatic options to prevent conflicts or resolve conflicts,” Rhodes said.","Rhodes noted that there is often a vacuum for a political party that emerges from eight years in the White House and now has no clear leader.","That’s where people like Moulton and Duckworth hope some veterans will be able to step in, perhaps playing a role like Murtha. There are also at least 25 veterans running for Congress as Democrats this year.","“That is a role that I and other Iraq and Afghanistan veterans in the Democratic Party can play,” Duckworth said. “To say, ’Wait a minute, let’s just be clear,′ questioning the motives of the administration and questioning the veracity of the data that they’re presenting, does not make us weak on defense. If anything it makes us the stronger champions for the Department of Defense and the military.”","Since Sept. 11 and the Iraq War, the issues in foreign policy have gotten more diffuse ― and, in many ways, more complicated, in the sense that the public doesn’t know what side to take. Current issues like drones and operations in Syria and Yemen aren’t on the top of most people’s list.","People now seem to understand that going to war in Iraq was a bad idea. But many Democrats wonder if politicians, both on the Republican and Democratic side, have fully internalized why it was a bad idea and shed the mindset that led to supporting the invasion.","And if there were a vote to authorize the invasion of Iraq again today, Moulton said he’s absolutely worried Congress would do it all over again.","CORRECTION: A previous version of this story indicated Obama defeated McCain in 2012 rather than 2008."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aa97cd51e000008087aeb29.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Trump Loved Hacks.

In July, after the Democratic National Committee’s emails were posted online, he — perhaps jokingly — called for more hacks: “Russia: If you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.” When WikiLeaks released the emails of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta in October, Trump was ecstatic. “I love WikiLeaks!” he declared. He said “WikiLeaks” at least 141 times the month before the election.","Trump probably didn’t mean to invite hackers to target him and his allies and post their findings on WikiLeaks.","But politically motivated hacks and leaks have continued unabated since Trump won the election. White House chief of staff John Kelly’s personal cell phone may have been compromised while he was working on the transition team at the end of 2016. Outgoing White House communications director Hope Hicks told the Senate Intelligence Committee last month that one of her email accounts had been hacked. And Trump associates and others outside the administration have seen their emails hacked and released for political purposes. Yousef Al Otaiba, the United Arab Emirates ambassador to the United States, had his emails leaked to U.S. media outlets.","So did Trump confidant and top Republican fundraiser Elliott Broidy.","Broidy acknowledges the similarities between the hackers who targeted him last month and those who targeted Democratic operatives during the election. “For whatever reasons, they don’t agree with what someone’s doing, so they try to wreak havoc and destroy their reputation,” he told HuffPost.","The 2016 election hack wasn’t the first of its kind. But it was the most spectacular. And given the gambit’s success, it may be hard for any government, organization or powerful individual that wants to influence U.S. public opinion to resist trying to copy it.","“Everyone involved in politics — whether you’re on a more state-focused campaign or national — you’re going to be heavily targeted, especially seeing the success of what happened,” said Ben Johnson, a former cybersecurity specialist at the National Security Agency. “Everyone is a target, from the intern to the candidate.”","Hillary Clinton’s aides and allies warned that they weren’t the first, and wouldn’t be the last, to be hurt by politically motivated hacking and that the U.S. government should take the threat seriously. Even Broidy now seems to agree.","“I’m not happy to see anyone hacked. That includes whether it’s Hillary Clinton or John Podesta, or anyone else,” Broidy said. “What happened in the 2016 election, or what’s happened to me, or what will happen to somebody else today or tomorrow — it’s just not right and I think we should work hard to make sure it doesn’t happen.”","Not all state-sponsored hacks have been aimed at the political process. China and North Korea, which are allegedly behind some of the highest-profile hacks, have stolen information with the apparent goals of obtaining intelligence, accessing trade secrets or securing a ransom. When the U.S. and Israel allegedly deployed an advanced team of hackers in Iran, their aim was to destroy a critical part of Iran’s nuclear program.","About a decade ago, hackers demonstrated how to use stolen information to advance a political narrative. Thousands of private emails sent by scientists affiliated with the Climatic Research Unit at England’s University of East Anglia were hacked in 2009. WikiLeaks published those materials and climate change deniers seized on parts of the emails to accuse the authors of scientific misconduct and fabricating a pattern of global warming.","Climategate, as it was termed, broke just weeks before a United Nations climate conference in Copenhagen, Denmark. Negotiations over ways to curb greenhouse gas emissions collapsed.","The release of the emails appeared to be timed to disrupt the conference, although it’s unclear how much damage they did. The stolen zip file was stored on a server in Russia, but investigators never conclusively attributed the hack to Moscow. Regardless of who orchestrated it, Climategate was an early example of hackers plotting to “take the fruits of illegal behavior, weaponize them, then use them in a political context,” Podesta told Mother Jones.","In 2013, the hacker Guccifer, later revealed to be a Romanian individual named Marcel Lazăr Lehel, began releasing emails he’d stolen from U.S. political figures. He leaked emails from former Secretary of State Colin Powell, former Bill Clinton adviser Sidney Blumenthal, and Dorothy Bush Koch, the sister of George W. Bush. There is no public proof that Lehel’s efforts were state-sanctioned.","The hackers who later targeted the DNC and Podesta adopted Guccifer’s persona, referring to themselves as Guccifer 2.0. WikiLeaks dumped the first cache of stolen emails about Hillary Clinton and the party’s internal deliberations only days before the Democratic convention. Podesta’s emails were posted about an hour after The Washington Post’s story about Trump bragging that he could grab women by the genitals in a 2005 “Access Hollywood” recording.","The Clinton campaign pleaded with reporters to be cautious about covering the hacked emails. “You’re basically doing Russia’s bidding right now,” Jesse Lehrich, a former campaign spokesman, recalled telling the media.","But Lehrich’s reminders had limited effect. WikiLeaks had already posted the emails online for anyone to read and some of them contained newsworthy information about a major presidential candidate.","“Unless there’s a giant pact among reporters that nobody will cover this stuff — which, let’s face it, is never gonna happen — reporters are trapped in this fucked-up situation,” Lehrich said. “You’re either missing out on stuff people are writing up, fighting a noble battle that’s not actually accomplishing anything. Or you’re furthering the agenda of foreign actors,” he said.","Another challenge for reporters — and anyone hoping to capitalize on hacked material — is that it’s often extremely difficult to determine who is responsible for a hack and what their motivations might be. Authentication can be a hurdle: Hackers might slip forged or altered documents into a giant release, which would be hard to catch. The Clinton team refused to confirm on the record the authenticity of any of the emails stolen during the campaign.","So far, the Trump administration has done very little to protect the country from cyberattacks. In January 2017, he vowed to appoint a team of experts to deliver a plan to counter hackers within the first 90 days of his presidency.","But months passed and Trump’s administration blew through self-imposed deadlines without taking action. When the president signed an executive order on cybersecurity last May, Robert Ackerman, the founder of a cybersecurity venture firm called Allegis Capital, described it as “the skeleton of a policy” that mostly built off existing initiatives. Trump later floated the idea of creating an “impenetrable Cyber Security unit″ — in coordination with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Lawmakers slammed the notion and Trump backed down.","Even members of Trump’s own party have blasted him for failing to address the nation’s cyber vulnerabilities. “Unfortunately, leadership from the executive branch on cybersecurity has been weak,” said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) last August.","State-sponsored hacking is very tough to identify, track and prevent — especially as hackers develop more sophisticated ways to obscure their identities and hackers-for-hire allow states to direct an operation without leaving their fingerprints. But there are things the U.S. government can and should do.","Experts have long urged the government to take a more active role in protecting critical infrastructure ― like power grids, water systems and emergency services ― and in regulating security standards for internet-accessible consumer products ― like cameras, thermostats and baby monitors. They also have pressed the federal government to give states the money to replace easily hackable touch-screen voting machines.","And now that Trump is in power, he, his allies and coworkers, and his correspondents are targets as well — not just for Russia, but for anyone in the world who wants to sway American public opinion.","“This is not going away anytime soon,” said Hank Thomas, the CEO and founder of Strategic Cyber Ventures. “Hacking is far too lucrative and inexpensive for governments to not keep it as a primary tool in their arsenal of defense and espionage tools.”","The purpose of the DNC and Podesta hacks was to dump a massive amount of information online all at once and to allow everyone to comb through it, craft their own conspiracies or disinformation, and spread it quickly on social media. More recent hacks have been carefully curated and delivered to the reporters who knew best how to tell the story the hackers wanted the public to hear.","Last summer, a group that called itself GlobalLeaks selectively released to several media outlets, including HuffPost, emails belonging to Yousef Al Otaiba, the UAE’s influential ambassador who is close to presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner. The name GlobalLeaks appeared to be a nod to DCLeaks, the group that had distributed the Democratic emails during the 2016 election.","But unlike DCLeaks, GlobalLeaks targeted just one politically prominent individual: Otaiba. And instead of just being dumped online, the documents were leaked to specific reporters who wrote about foreign policy and the Middle East.","The emails, which showed Otaiba repeatedly criticizing Trump, were released amid a diplomatic crisis between the UAE (and others) and Qatar. Otaiba had been carefully cultivating ties to the new administration, working to gain Washington’s support in cutting off Qatar and its broader foreign policy agenda. The leaker denied having connections to Qatar. The source used a .ru email address, suggesting they were Russian or trying to appear Russian.","It’s not clear what, if any, effect the stolen emails had on Trump’s view of the Gulf dispute. Over the next several months, he flip-flopped between accusing Qatar of funding terrorism and offering to help Qatar resolve the rift with its neighbors. But the emails undoubtedly sullied Otaiba’s reputation in Washington. Last August, the Intercept published an account of Otaiba hiring escorts. The story relied, in part, on those emails.","Then last month, the hacking hit someone with personal ties to the president: Broidy. On Feb. 28, a group identifying itself as LA Confidential emailed reporters, again including at HuffPost, copies of the GOP fundraiser’s emails. The documents appeared to show Broidy trying to use his connections to the Trump administration to influence the outcome of a Justice Department investigation into a potential client of his wife’s law firm. (Broidy denies any wrongdoing.) They also show Broidy privately pitching Trump on the idea of a Gulf-funded Muslim army to fight America’s wars.","Broidy, who is outspokenly critical of Qatar, has accused the small gas-rich nation of orchestrating the hack. He told HuffPost that he would share proof to back up his allegation at a later date. Qatar denies it was involved in the hack.","He has not discussed the threat of state-sponsored hacking operations with Trump, Broidy said. Nor does he share the frustration of Trump’s critics, who say the president hasn’t done enough to respond to Russia’s election interference. “I’m more interested in law enforcement doing its job because the laws and the policies are there,” he said.","Asked how he reacted when the DNC and Podesta emails were released during the presidential race, Broidy said he couldn’t recall. “I mean I don’t think stealing stuff from people is right,” he said. “It’s just not my thing. I’m very interested in national security and law and order.”","Lehrich, the Clinton campaign spokesman, said he does have sympathy for Republican hacking victims like Broidy.","“This guy Broidy seems like a really bad dude, and the things that he’s done, obviously there is merit to them being exposed,” Lehrich said. “But at the same time, I think it’s a dangerous, slippery slope when they’re coming to light thanks to hostile foreign actors who have their own agenda.”","Maxwell Strachan and Akbar Shahid Ahmed contributed reporting."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aac1ac72000007d06eb22ba.jpeg?cache=wBqFNm0jrz&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Parkland Students: 'We're The Mass Shooting Generation'","authors":"Alanna Vagianos","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/parkland-students-were-the-mass-shooting-generation_us_5aafb06be4b0337adf85a6a4","short_description":"Five survivors of the Florida school massacre trace the month that put them at the forefront of a movement.","date":"2018-03-19"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"WEIRD NEWS","headline":"Guy In Bear Costume Has No Problem Voting In Russian Election","authors":"David Moye","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/russian-bear-election-voting_us_5ab01791e4b0697dfe198fec","short_description":"Even though he could barely fit into the voting booth.","date":"2018-03-19"},"articleContent":["Apparently, bears are allowed to vote in Russia ― or at least people in bear costumes.","During Sunday’s national election, a voter in the Siberian town of Severobaykalsk ― more than 3,400 miles east of Moscow ― decided to show he was bullish on Russia by dressing up as a bear.","Russian government-controlled Sputnik News reported that the unnamed voter scared a few people with his loud roar, but that most people seemed amused.","However, there were some challenges.

When it comes to activism, the teens say they’re running the show. But there are adults behind the scenes of March for Our Lives: A document uncovered by HuffPost reveals a diverse board of directors that includes public servants, legal experts and professionals based outside of Florida.","Money raised for the March for Our Lives Action Fund, a nonprofit, will cover expenses associated with the national student rally taking place in Washington, D.C., on March 24. The money will also be used to “fight for comprehensive gun safety legislation” and to promote voter education, ballot initiatives and lobbying efforts, according to 42 West, the bicoastal entertainment industry public relations firm handling press requests for the campaign.","A board that includes six volunteer directors is overseeing all March for Our Lives funds, a spokesperson for 42 West told HuffPost in an email. Decisions on how to spend the funds will be up to that board and a “student advisory board,” the spokesperson said. When asked what sort of oversight mechanisms are set up to ensure the money is going to the students’ desired reforms, the spokesperson said, “The board of directors will handle.”","It’s perfectly normal for adults to be involved when millions of dollars are at stake. But other than the document HuffPost discovered, a nonprofit registration filed in Florida and posted on the Florida Department of State’s website, there is little publicly available information about the March for Our Lives Action Fund or who’s running it.","The fund’s directors, according to the form, are George Kieffer, chair of the Board of Regents of the University of California; Jeri Rhodes, who is with the Friends Committee on National Legislation, a Washington-based lobbying group founded by Quakers; Aileen Adams; who served under former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa; Nina Vinik, an attorney who has a background in gun violence prevention; Vernetta Walker from BoardSource, an organization that provides support for nonprofit leaders; and Melissa Scholz, an attorney who has expertise in nonprofit law. The fund is organized as a Delaware corporation and operates as a 501(c)(4) nonprofit.","The document lists Deena Katz, an Emmy-nominated producer and the co-executive director of the Women’s March Los Angeles Foundation, as president. She is helping organize the March for Our Lives on her own as an individual, a 42 West spokesperson said.","The application was linked to an address for a tax consulting firm listed on the March website advising donors where they could mail checks. An employee at the tax firm confirmed that March for Our Lives is a client. (The fund’s board of directors did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)","42 West did not say how much money the fund has raised.","The Parkland students who have become the face of the gun control movement have made a concerted effort to show that they’re not simply figureheads of the campaign. Although high-profile gun violence prevention advocates and wealthy donors have taken an interest in the effort, the students are careful not to be used for anyone’s agenda, they said in an interview with “60 Minutes” on Sunday.","The teens are allowing those who’ve backed them “to help where they can,” Cameron Kasky, a junior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, told the program. “But we make sure that we are calling the shots.” Kasky, who is 17, noted that he’s not old enough to book a hotel by himself or secure permits for the upcoming Washington rally. But he also said the teens have turned away money from people who offered donations with strings attached.","It’s not uncommon for robust fundraising efforts to spring up after a high-profile mass shooting. But they’ve typically focused on covering costs for victims and their families. A separate fund for Parkland victims, coordinated by the Broward Education Foundation, is dedicated to those efforts and has raised more than $4 million, according to the campaign’s GoFundMe page.","That makes the March for Our Lives Action Fund, which is focused on national anti-gun violence advocacy, unusual.","A petition on the campaign’s website highlights a few possible legislative priorities for the students, including banning assault weapons like the one used at the Parkland school and closing a loophole in federal background check law. With the Parkland students positioning themselves to be an enduring force in the gun policy debate, it’s also possible that these priorities will continue to evolve after the march.","Although public details are still vague, a number of high-profile figures have pledged donations. The 42 West spokesperson said they have received donations from Oprah Winfrey (a reported $500,000), George and Amal Clooney ($500,000), Gucci ($500,000) “and other gracious donors.”","There is a GoFundMe campaign that had raised more than $3.3 million as of Monday, which is being split equally between the March for Our Lives Action Fund and the Broward Education Foundation.","There are also a number of large, progressive figures and groups publicly supporting the march, though it’s unclear what kind of guidance they are providing. The gun safety group named for former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.) is continuing to “lend support in any way the students need, especially helping to operationalize these marches, from logistics to programming,” a Giffords spokesman said.","A spokesperson for Everytown for Gun Safety, which is assisting in coordinating sibling marches around the country, emphasized that it’s a “student-led effort.”","As a 501(c)(4) group, March for Our Lives Action Fund is subject to few public disclosure requirements regarding donors or expenditures, meaning the Parkland students and the board aren’t obligated to be fully transparent.","For now, the students seem fired up to continue efforts to fight gun violence in America— even as they acknowledge they’re learning as they go along. “Working with money people and law people and everybody else from home today,” Kasky tweeted last month. “Never thought I’d actually be excited to return to school.”","This is a developing story.

He said the lawsuit seeks to protect any New Yorker who wears religious head coverings that leave the face visible, including hijabs, yarmulkes, turbans and wigs.","“Requiring a Muslim woman to remove her hijab in public is akin to demanding that a secular person strip naked in front of strangers,” the lawsuit argues.","Currently, the NYPD’s patrol guide provides that arrestees who refuse to remove their religious head coverings for their official photo should be transported to police headquarters in Manhattan. There, the arrestee can have the picture taken in private by an officer of the same gender.","The New York City Law Department said in a statement to The Associated Press that it’s confident the current policy “passes constitutional muster.”","“It carefully balances the department’s respect for the customs of all religions with the legitimate law enforcement need to take arrest photos,” the law office said. “Persons who do not wish to remove religious head coverings in front of others have the option of being taken to a separate, more private facility to be photographed.”","Clark, a Muslim woman from Cedar Grove, New Jersey, was arrested on Jan. 9, 2017, at Manhattan Family Court for violating a protective order. The lawsuit claims Clark’s abusive former husband had fabricated the charges underlying that order. The charges were later dismissed by prosecutors, The New York Times reports.","According to the lawsuit, police officers ordered Clark to remove her hijab to pose for a booking photo. She told them that her religious beliefs barred her from removing her hijab in front of men who did not belong to her immediate family. Police then allegedly informed her that she would be prosecuted if she declined, and one officer made “numerous hostile comments about Muslims,” the lawsuit claims.","After being taken to NYPD headquarters, Clark agreed to remove her hijab so that a female officer could take her photo in a private room. But Clark contends that the female officer subsequently showed the photo to approximately five male colleagues.","“When they forced me to take off my hijab, I felt as if I were naked. I’m not sure if words can capture how exposed and violated I felt,” Clark said in a CAIR press release.","Her lawyers claim that the NYPD maintains at least one photograph of Clark without her hijab in its database.","“The existence of this photograph haunts Ms. Clark, who is distressed by the prospect of the photograph being viewed again and again by men who are not members of her immediate family,” the lawsuit says.","Aziz, a woman from Brooklyn, New York, contends that she had a similarly distressing experience with New York police. She was arrested on Aug. 30, 2017, for violating a protective order filed “on false pretenses” by a sister-in-law, her lawyers allege. Those charges would also later be dismissed by prosecutors.","Officers at Brooklyn Central Booking demanded that Aziz remove her hijab for a photo, according to the lawsuit. She refused, explaining that she wore the hijab for religious reasons. She said she offered to pull the headscarf back slightly to reveal her bangs and hairline, but the officers continued to demand that she remove it entirely. Although they also said she could be transported to NYPD headquarters to take the picture, they allegedly claimed that there was no guarantee a female photographer would be present and that the move would force police to “restart” the entire booking process.","Aziz finally agreed to pull the hijab down to her neck. The lawsuit alleges she “wept throughout the entire ordeal” and continues to experience “distress and humiliation” when she thinks about how those pictures may still appear in the NYPD’s database.","Turning Point for Women and Families, a Queens-based advocacy group for Muslim survivors of domestic violence, is also listed as a plaintiff in the lawsuit. Its executive director, Robina Niaz, said that fear of police officers can discourage her group’s clients from coming forward with allegations of abuse.","“I fear this policy [on head coverings] makes it harder for victims of domestic violence that we serve to report their abusers to the police,” Niaz said in the CAIR press release.","The lawsuit seeks to prohibit the NYPD from requiring the removal of “any religious head or hair covering” for the purpose of post-arrest photographs.","Cahn declined to comment on how he feels the police department should handle booking photos for Muslim women who wear the niqab or burqa, two types of Islamic garments that cover the face. He said this lawsuit focuses exclusively on the rights of detainees whose religious head coverings leave their faces uncovered.","The suit points out that other federal and state entities have policies allowing Muslim women to remain covered in official photos.

Scavino, who is one of Trump’s closest aides, holds the title of assistant to the president, the highest-ranking staff position in the White House, one that he shares with aides like Kellyanne Conway, White House Counsel Don McGhan, and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, among others.","Jennifer Scavino filed for divorce on Jan. 18, 2018 in Dutchess County, New York, where the Scavinos own a home. In county records, she is listed as the plaintiff, while her husband is listed as the defendant. Not much else is known about the cause of divorce, as the state of New York keeps divorce records under seal, and they can only be accessed by the parties involved and their attorneys.","The Scavinos have two children. A wedding announcement in the Poughkeepsie Journal says they were married on Sept. 23, 2000.","The White House declined to comment. Jennifer Scavino did not reply to an email requesting comment by the time of publication.","Scavino, 42, has a long history with Trump and the Trump family. He met then- businessman Donald J. Trump in 1990, when he served as his caddie, and later served as the general manager of one of his golf clubs. Scavino was just 16 years old at the time.","A June 2017 profile of Scavino in Politico characterized him as “the president’s mini-me, a man whose bombast, impulse control and instinct for a good punch match those of his boss.”","During the 2016 presidential campaign, Scavino was a constant at Trump’s side and could often be seen at campaign rallies taking photographs or filming video, which he would post on Trump’s social media accounts. Scavino first gained national attention in July 2016 after it was revealed that he was responsible for sourcing and tweeting, from Trump’s account, an image of Hillary Clinton that many critics saw as anti-Semitic because the backdrop was a sea of cash along with a six-pointed star (like the Star of David) and the words “most corrupt candidate ever!”","In a tweet posted three days after the controversy erupted, Scavino said, “For the MSM to suggest that I am antisemite is AWFUL. I proudly celebrate holidays w/ my wife’s amazing Jewish family for the past 16 years.”","While at the White House, Scavino has continued his bombastic style of tweeting, which has led him to run afoul of the law. In June 2017, after the Democratic-leaning watchdog organization, CREW, filed a complaint, the Office of the Special Counsel said that Scavino had violated the Hatch Act when he tweeted at Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) and encouraged Trump supporters to defeat him. The Hatch Act limits certain political activities of federal government employees.","The tweet came about when Trump was in a spat with some members of the Freedom Caucus, of which Amash is a member. The representative had refused to support Trump’s plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act.","Outside of controversial tweets, Scavino has generally kept a low profile in the administration, and he has only talked about his wife when referencing his advocacy for Lyme disease awareness and research. Jennifer Scavino has grappled with the disease for over a decade. (Scavino believes his wife got it from a tick bite while she was gardening in their backyard.)","Two months before Trump launched his campaign for the presidency in 2015, Scavino tweeted an image of his wife with the caption: “My amazing wife, Jennifer has Chronic Inflammatory Polyneuropathy Disease from a tick, resulting in Lyme Disease. We are both 39 years old. 10 years of this awful neurological disease, she is my hero. Not once feeling sorry for herself or really even talking about it outside of our home. While I had to leave my career, I have and will be with her every step of the way. Today is treatment day.

A version of the legislation easily passed the House, 388-25, late last month. Both proposals would hold online platforms, such as Craigslist and the personal classifieds site Backpage, liable for user content related to sex trafficking. This could encourage websites to censor sex-related ads to protect themselves from litigation, free-speech advocates warn. Sex workers would have to turn to methods that offer less privacy to promote their services, making it tougher to screen clients or warn others about dangerous customers.","Voluntary sex work is often conflated with sex trafficking, which is less common than trafficking of people into farm, factory or household labor. But many sex workers are not victims of the sex trade or human trafficking; they are self-supporting and have decided for themselves to do the work. Given harsh prostitution laws across the country, sex workers often work underground and depend on sites like Backpage, which allow users to screen clients, protect their identities and find clients.","SESTA’s opponents argue that making websites liable for sex trafficking-related content will push both sex trafficking and voluntary sex work further underground ― leaving trafficking victims and voluntary sex workers worse off than they are now.","Once websites are legally liable for user-related content related to sex trafficking, they’ll turn to automated filters to find and delete that content, predicted Elliot Harmon, an activist at Election Freedom Frontier. But automated filters, while useful to site moderators, aren’t an effective method of monitoring content, leading to needless censorship. Google’s PerspectiveAPI, an automated filter meant to monitor “toxicity” in online discussions, was unable to differentiate between “I am a Jew” and “I don’t like Jews.” There’s no reason to believe automated filters will be any better at differentiating between ads for voluntary sex work and those tied to sex trafficking than they were at identifying anti-Semitism, Harmon added. And sites that can’t post sex workers’ ads without fear of being sued probably won’t post them at all.","And pushing sex work-related ads offline will leave sex-trafficking victims even worse off than they are now, said Jean Bruggeman, executive director of Freedom Network USA, an advocacy group that supports victims of human trafficking. Ads for sex work that appear online are easier to monitor and track than ones that appear elsewhere, Bruggeman noted. Without an online platform, sex traffickers and their victims will be more difficult to track down; having a digital footprint is actually helpful when it comes to finding and rescuing victims.","“When websites are shut down, the sex trade is pushed underground and sex trafficking victims are forced into even more dangerous circumstances,” Bruggeman said. Under SESTA, “trafficking victims face even more violence, are less likely to be identified, with less evidence of their victimization.”","SESTA “boasts of being the answer to uncovering and punishing those engaged in sex trafficking online, but what it actually is about is internet censorship,” Briq House, communications director for the Sex Worker Outreach Project-USA, which promotes the decriminalization of sex work, wrote last summer. “Without proper ways to establish identity, set service boundaries and screen people properly, this bill could turn casual meet-ups into life-or-death situation.”","The bill is cruising toward passage anyway. Its most prominent Democratic backers were reluctant to address sex workers’ critiques of the measure.","Harris, who as California attorney general charged the CEO of Backpage with felony pimping, did not respond to requests for comment, and Gillibrand’s office cited the fact that the bill has broad support from sex trafficking advocacy groups, tech groups and faith leaders.","A spokesman for Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), the bill’s Republican author, similarly declined to comment on sex workers’ concerns and also pointed to the list of groups backing the proposal.","But some of the bill’s backers insist it will protect women who are at risk.","“I have a constituent whose daughter was trafficked and then killed using Backpage and these sites,” said Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.). “We have to do something.”","“I think we need to do everything we can to try and shut down those websites,” said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.). “But there are a lot of other things we need to do to support victims and to make sure law enforcement has the tools they need.”","About a dozen human trafficking organizations have endorsed the bills, including the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the Trafficking in America Task Force and the New Jersey Coalition Against Human Trafficking.","“This bill targets the business model of companies like Backpage.com by opening the door to civil liability and allowing states to enforce their trafficking laws when online entities choose to profit from the exploitation of sex trafficking victims,” Christine Raino of Shared Hope International, a religious-based organization focused on preventing sex trafficking, wrote in support of the measure. Major websites including Facebook, Google and Oracle also support SESTA.","But several groups that advocate for sex workers are concerned that no one is talking to those who would be most affected.","“Sex workers across the country, including survivors of sex trafficking, are vehemently opposed” to both the House and Senate versions, Ty Mitchell wrote for HuffPost Opinion last week. “But lawmakers are not listening to us.”","Congress’s attempt to combat sex trafficking is a good thing, Bruggeman said, but these laws are drawn up without consulting sex workers and victims of sex trafficking about their lived experiences.","That several feminist senators who are otherwise outspoken advocates for sexual assault survivors support the legislation is also a disappointing factor for many sex workers ― a group often left out of mainstream feminist movements to begin with.","“I live in California, and Kamala Harris is my senator. It has been dispiriting, to say the least, to see her zeal in using law enforcement to crack down on voluntary sex workers in an effort to combat trafficking,” Lola Davina, a former sex worker and author, told HuffPost. “I wish Senator Harris would take the time to actually talk directly to voluntary sex workers to learn about their lives and livelihoods. Sex work is often an occupation of last resort that women, queers and trans folk fall back on when they have few other options .… Making their work even more dangerous, more marginal, more stigmatized, more difficult does nothing to help them ― they are collateral damage in the fight against trafficking.”","And Davina isn’t sold on the idea that senators have assembled a broad coalition of advocacy groups to back SESTA.","“I wish lawmakers would see voluntary sex workers for what they are,” she said. “Small business owners attempting to promote their services, which, when consensual, harm no one.”","This article has been updated with comment from Duckworth and Shaheen."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aa844941e000008087ae925.jpeg?cache=hcHvIZ4V4k&ops=crop_0_0_3312_1732%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"QUEER VOICES","headline":"Irish Prime Minister And His Partner Join NYC's St. Patrick's Day Parade","authors":"Curtis M.

Then a senator from Alabama, Sessions chaired the meeting as head of the Trump campaign’s foreign policy team.","“Yes, I pushed back,” Sessions told the House Judiciary Committee on Nov. 14, when asked whether he shut down Papadopoulos’ proposed outreach to Russia. Sessions has since also been interviewed by Mueller.","Three people who attended the March campaign meeting told Reuters they gave their version of events to FBI agents or congressional investigators probing Russian interference in the 2016 election. Although the accounts they provided to Reuters differed in certain respects, all three, who declined to be identified, said Sessions had expressed no objections to Papadopoulos’ idea.","However, another meeting attendee, J.D. Gordon, who was the Trump campaign’s director of national security, told media outlets including Reuters in November that Sessions strongly opposed Papadopoulos’ proposal and said no one should speak of it again. In response to a request for comment, Gordon said on Saturday that he stood by his statement.","Sessions, through Justice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores, declined to comment beyond his prior testimony. The special counsel’s office also declined to comment.

A criminal charge would require showing Sessions intended to deceive. Sessions told the House Judiciary Committee that he had always told the truth and testified to the best of his recollection.","Legal experts expressed mixed views about the significance of the contradictions cited by the three sources.","Sessions could argue he misremembered events or perceived his response in a different way, making any contradictions unintentional, some experts said.","Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University, said Sessions’ words might be too vague to form the basis of a perjury case because there could be different interpretations of what the term pushing back means.","“If you’re talking about false statements, prosecutors look for something that is concrete and clear,” he said.","Other legal experts said, however, that repeated misstatements by Sessions could enable prosecutors to build a perjury case against him.","“Proving there was intent to lie is a heavy burden for the prosecution.

The real intrigue was not the race itself, but what happens next.","The Russian Constitution bars Putin from running again in 2024, and this year’s vote is a starting gun for the country’s powerful officials and oligarchs to jockey for position ahead of an uncertain future.","The leading figures in Russia’s behind-the-scenes power struggles include longtime Putin associates and top government figures, a rising group of young technocrats and a powerful security service. These factions have been increasingly, openly at odds as anticipation grows over who Putin will include in his new government and who will hold influence outside of it.","“After March 18, Putin has to appoint a new government and he has to start thinking about his last presidential term. He has to start thinking about some kind of mechanism to remain in power, transfer to a successor or change the system,” explained Mikhail Zygar, a Russian journalist and author of a book on Putin’s inner circle.","“That’s the mystery for everyone. Everyone is very scared because they don’t know what surprise he is preparing.”","A Corruption Case Shocks Russia’s Elites","Putin has long tried to prevent any one interest group or individual from gaining too much power, seeing political upstarts as threats to his authority. But it appears his control over his associates has begun to slip, and he hasn’t been able to keep disputes between major figures behind closed doors.","In an episode last year that showed the high stakes of these battles, a court sentenced former Economy Minister Alexei Ulyukayev to serve eight years in a penal colony and pay $2.2 million for corruption and accepting bribes.","Ulyukayev denied the charges and blamed a political opponent for setting him up ― Igor Sechin, a former deputy prime minister who is now head of Russian oil giant Rosneft. Sechin, in turn, denies Ulyukayev’s accusations.","The case centered on a meeting between the two men in late 2016 at Rosneft headquarters, where hidden cameras captured Sechin giving Ulyukayev a gift basket full of sausages and a large brown bag. The bag contained $2 million, which Sechin accused Ulyukayev of seeking as a bribe. Ulyukayev claims he thought the bag contained bottles of wine.","Based on the sting operation and Sechin’s testimony, Ulyukayev was convicted.","Sechin served as Putin’s secretary in the 1990s and is now one of the country’s most powerful men, even though he no longer holds a position inside the Kremlin. Experts describe him as a staunch conservative and anti-Western figure in Russian politics, and he is currently under U.S. sanctions related to Russia’s annexation of Crimea.","Sechin is a linchpin in a group of hawkish former security officials known as the “siloviki,” who are looking to gain more influence during Putin’s next term. Sechin’s power has grown to the point where analysts say that in addition to his role in Rosneft, he also holds significant pull over both the court system and Russia’s security services.","“Sechin, on the one hand, is the CEO of the biggest Russian oil company, and on the other hand, is a member of Putin’s inner circle, so he basically can do everything he wants without the limitations that a public official has,” said Konstantin Gaaze, a political analyst who writes for the Carnegie Moscow Center think tank.","“He has more influence than the prime minister.”","Staking A Claim In Putin’s Final Term","Ulyukayev’s harsh sentence and his allegations against Sechin set a disquieting tone for Russia’s elites. The former economy minister’s downfall provides both a glimpse of potential disputes to come in the next six years and a sign that even powerful figures are now vulnerable and that a wrong political move could result in jail.","In a closing statement at the trial, Ulyukayev paraphrased John Donne’s poem “For Whom The Bell Tolls” and warned those watching that “the bell could start tolling for any of you.”","“That case is a major reason why the level of trust in Russian elites is dramatically low. They just don’t trust each other,” said Gaaze.","“They are afraid not because of some abstract feeling, not because of the Western sanctions, but they are afraid because they feel the rules of the game in the Russian elite changed dramatically.”","Already, other tensions have begun to escalate within the Kremlin, including between the speaker of Russia’s parliament, Vyacheslav Volodin, and Putin’s first deputy chief of staff, Sergei Kiriyenko. Both wield sizable power within the government, control duties that go beyond their titles and are seeking to expand their roles.","But as Kiriyenko and Volodin gain more influence, their conflict has become increasingly heated. The two fought over the best way to manage Putin’s election campaign and address his opponents, experts say, with Volodin criticizing Kiriyenko for drawing too much attention to the race and turning it into a circus.","The next presidential term will likely also see other top members of the Kremlin, such as Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, seek to secure their places. More liberal-minded economists, military figures and other interest groups are all expected to vie for prominence.","The Young Technocrats","Even after the election, it won’t be immediately obvious who is set to emerge from the melee. Putin will appoint a new government and is likely to bring in new people for a number of positions, potentially even replacing Medvedev, who is mired in corruption allegations.","Positions in Putin’s new government may instead fall to a new generation of officials whose ambitions the president can easily control.","“For Putin, it will be much easier to choose young technocrats for government positions instead of trying to persuade some politically strong, experienced figures,” said Tatiana Stanovaya, head of the political analysis organization R.Politik.","As a result, Stanovaya says it’s likely that these younger, less ideological figures who won’t challenge Putin’s authority will enter Russia’s government. Important figures in the Kremlin may then shift to roles more like Sechin’s, using unofficial means of wielding their influence while avoiding the accountability that comes with public office.","“The biggest prize for lots of public officials right now is the right to leave office after the election. After the Ulyukayev case, they realize that they take all the risk with none of the benefits,” Gaaze said.","But several government positions Putin will pick still wield significant power, such as deputy prime minister, and are worth keeping an eye on. Given the uncertainty over what Russia’s next six years will look like, however, there’s no guarantee that whoever takes those jobs will hold on to them.","“The government he’s going to appoint right after the election is not the government that is going to be in power by the end of his presidential term,” Zygar predicted.","“Everyone is expecting a long period of turbulence.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aa999f92000007d06eb1edb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Kevin Hart And Conan O’Brien Carbo Load And Then Try Sumo Wrestling","authors":"Andy McDonald","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/conan-and-kevin-hart-carbo-load-and-then-try-sumo-wrestling_us_5aad37b3e4b05b2217ff1bef","short_description":"This is not going to go well.","date":"2018-03-17"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"SPORTS","headline":"No. 16 UMBC Defeats No. 1 Virginia In Biggest Upset In Men's NCAA Tournament History","authors":"Jillian Stampher","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/umbc-defeats-virginia-ncaa_us_5aac8a90e4b05b2217fee4e1","short_description":"It's the first time in the men's NCAA tournament a No. 16 seed has defeated a No. 1 seed.","date":"2018-03-17"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Trump's Personal Lawyer Is Now Calling For End To Russia Probe","authors":"Sebastian Murdock","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trumps-personal-lawyer-is-now-calling-for-firing-of-robert-mueller_us_5aad3eb8e4b05b2217ff1e28","short_description":"He called for \"an end to alleged Russia Collusion investigation.\"","date":"2018-03-17"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Mike Huckabee Celebrates Firing Of Former FBI Deputy Director By Making Dead Dog Joke","authors":"Sebastian Murdock","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mike-huckabee-andrew-mccabe-dead-dog-joke_us_5aad6c68e4b0c33361b0e9e9","short_description":"No one is laughing.","date":"2018-03-17"},"articleContent":["Former Arkansas Gov.

Funny stuff, right?","President Donald Trump also tweeted about McCabe’s firing on Saturday, and insisted once again that there had been no collusion between his 2016 presidential campaign and Russian operatives.","While at the FBI, McCabe apparently wrote detailed memos about his interactions with Trump. He has since given those memos to special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating the relationship between the Trump campaign and Russia.

But for the most part, the deadliest U.S. military intervention since the Vietnam War remains a footnote in America’s social studies classrooms.","Fifteen years after the U.S.-led coalition invaded Iraq to topple Saddam Hussein, teachers and education leaders are still trying to find ways to teach students about an intervention that has yet to end.","The challenges teachers face are obvious: In a world where there is always too much to teach and standardized tests reign supreme, recent history tends to get left behind, even if this history is essential for understanding modern geopolitics.","Content requirements in social studies classrooms vary by state. Beyond that, experts say the handling of this issue likely varies by district. Jonathan Zimmerman, a professor of history of education at the University of Pennsylvania, reviewed how some major textbooks handled the Iraq War for the war’s 10th anniversary and was impressed with the books’ complex and multi-sided perspectives on the issue.","But in cash-strapped districts, outdated textbooks are the norm.","“This is probably system-wide in Chicago, but our textbooks are pretty outdated and not in the best of shape at my school,” said Dave Stieber, a teacher at a public school on Chicago’s South Side. In Philadelphia, the school district’s budget allocated $0 per student for textbooks in 2014 and 2015.","The stereotype of teachers instructing their students to turn to a certain page in their books and begin working through the material isn’t accurate when it comes to covering more recent topics such as the Iraq War. Students are more likely learning from varied materials that include clips from news articles, books and other media. The content, and quality, can differ between schools and only adheres to state standards for curricula that are outlined in broad strokes.","In New York, for instance, the state Education Department includes Iraq only as one line in a subsection of its standards for teaching the role of the U.S. in the world post-1990. Iraq is grouped with the Sept. 11 attacks and the Patriot Act as part of teaching about America’s war on terror. Students are asked to examine the decision to invade Iraq and trace the course of the conflict.","Growing Up With The War","Despite the Iraq War playing an immense role in shaping current U.S. foreign policy and contributing to the emergence of the Islamic State militant group, many students today see the conflict in abstract terms.","“A lot of the kids don’t have a strong background in it. Obviously they know about 9/11, but they don’t know a lot past that,” said Adam Mogilevsky, a social studies teacher at Warren Early College High School in North Carolina. “They have a very beginner’s idea of what could have occurred, but a lot of it is misinformed.”","Unless students have a direct connection to Iraq, such as a family member in the armed services, teachers say kids in their classrooms rarely interrogate why the U.S. is in conflict. Instead, the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan are a kind of lifelong background noise that students have normalized and tuned out.","“When I started talking about these topics I really had to go back to the beginning. There wasn’t really any base-level knowledge,” said Tyler Bonin, a 33-year-old Iraq War veteran who teaches at a small private school in the Raleigh, North Carolina, area.","“It was a bit shocking at first, because this was something that defined my life,” he said. “Not only because I served in Iraq, but because 9/11 shaped my high school career — it happened towards the end of high school for me and I enlisted after that.”","With each new class of high school freshmen more and more removed from the start of the intervention, there seems to be a growing disconnect toward the conflict. Bonin believes this is in part because younger generations in America have fewer family ties to military service members than at any time since World War II, which means students have little reason to engage with the war on personal terms.","An Intervention That Never Really Ended","Another difficulty in teaching the war is that U.S. military involvement in Iraq is still ongoing, despite the large-scale reduction in troops stationed in the country during President Barack Obama’s administration.","Whereas history classes covering conflicts such as the Revolutionary War or Vietnam tend to focus on key turning points, battles and leading figures, teachers say that’s far more difficult with Iraq. The United States’ continued presence in Iraq, with thousands of troops still stationed in the country, provides no easy bookend for educators.","“It’s currently part of our lives, so we don’t know how the war is going to be treated in history. We don’t know the outcome yet, and that leads to uncertainty and the inability to teach it as clearly,” said Chris Bunin, a teacher at Albemarle High School on the edge of Charlottesville, Virginia.","As military operations have shifted in recent years to encompass coordinating the fight against ISIS, there is also greater complexity to the U.S. intervention and more context required for students to understand the military’s role in Iraq. Time constraints, and the need to cover a wide swath of basic background information, mean that it’s often impossible for teachers to address even major aspects of the war, let alone how U.S. goals have changed over its course.","In social studies classrooms, history is typically taught chronologically. Recent history, like the Iraq War, sometimes does not make the cut, especially as the intense pressures of standardized testing loom large.","“Yes, it is part of our teaching. But it depends on the teacher as to how much or how little gets taught,” said India Meissel, history and social studies chair at Lakeland High School in Virginia.","When Meissel teaches the war, she connects it to the Gulf War from the early 1990s, under President George H.W. Bush. After 31 years in the classroom, she believes you cannot teach one without the other.","But she doesn’t blame teachers who don’t get to this war, or who only teach a superficial overview.","In some ways, it’s too soon to delve into complicated dynamics, says Meissel, who is also president-elect of the National Council for the Social Studies. She points to the 2017 Super Bowl between the New England Patriots and the Atlanta Falcons, which had the eventual victors down for most of the game. It was only at the last second that the Patriots came back for the win.","“The in-depth portion will come in time,” she said."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aa2fe2b1e000008087ae09e.jpeg?cache=eXrgdTpqXp&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"QUEER VOICES","headline":"For Greg Berlanti, 'Love, Simon' Is A Pinnacle In A Career Marked By LGBTQ Inclusion","authors":"Curtis M. Wong","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/love-simon-greg-berlanti-interview_us_5aa8458ce4b0f7a689cd33a1","short_description":"The director says making queer-inclusive projects is \"incredibly rewarding.\"","date":"2018-03-17"},"articleContent":["“ Love, Simon ” will make history this weekend as Hollywood’s first major studio film to feature a gay teen protagonist. If director Greg Berlanti had his way, however, that wouldn’t be the case.","“I wish it wasn’t 2018 and that we weren’t the first teen rom-com with a gay lead to receive major studio backing,” he told HuffPost. “I wish we were the 10 or the 12 – there’d be a lot less pressure in many regards.”","Based on Becky Albertalli’s 2015 novel, Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda, the movie follows Simon Spier (played by Nick Robinson), a charming and popular 17-year-old who is struggling to come to terms with his sexuality. He begins corresponding anonymously with another closeted student known as Blue over email, and the budding friendship turns romantic over time. Just as Simon begins to warm up to the idea of pursuing a relationship with Blue beyond a computer screen, a classmate threatens to expose his secret.","In some respects, Berlanti’s whole career has been building up to the release of “Love, Simon.” His first feature film, 2000’s “The Broken Hearts Club,” followed a group of gay men on a West Hollywood baseball team. Since then, he’s incorporated LGBTQ themes into a number of his television projects, including “Dawson’s Creek,” “Brothers & Sisters,” “Arrow” and “The Flash.” Yet “Love, Simon” seems poised to make an even bigger impression.","In a conversation with HuffPost, Berlanti chatted about making “Love, Simon,” how marriage and fatherhood have affected his artistic perspective and why portraying queer themes in television and film is still “incredibly rewarding.”","One of the things that struck me most about “Love, Simon” is how the story felt true to the John Hughes teen rom-com genre, but, at the same time, it’s radical because it’s being told through a queer perspective. Was that your intention?","Absolutely. I think that was true of the book, and I think that was true of the script that I read. We had a number of conversations about those iconic movies from the ’80s about coming of age, and mostly technically. The subject matter… was the thing that made it feel contemporary, so we were more focused on, “OK, so how as a film, stylistically, can we emulate some of those movies but let the content be the thing that’s contemporary?”","You’ve mentioned that Nick Robinson was your only choice to play Simon. What was it about him as an actor that made you think he would be the perfect person for the role?","I loved him in “The Kings of Summer,” and I felt like he had my heart for that whole film. I thought, “OK, this is sort of that movie.” [“Love, Simon”] has some of those qualities on steroids, in terms of the fact that you really have to experience this film through Simon.","At the same time, you have to feel like Simon is playing a role in front of all these individuals and hiding this secret, but you’re still engaging with him. Once we sat down and talked about the movie, I could see that Nick was personally connected with the character. Once he did a read for us, it was really obvious not just to me, but to the studio and to all the producers, that he was our Simon, and he had to do the role.","One of the high points, for me, was Simon’s determination to own his coming out for himself and his devastation when things don’t really work out that way.","I’ve talked to people in the business who are deciding publicly when they should come out, and my advice has always been the same. I say two things: one is the Harvey Milk quote, “Every gay person must come out.” That’s part of your obligation as a gay individual to the next generation, to ultimately tell your story. The caveat always is, “But only you know when that timing is.”","I think a person knows when they’re ready, and that timing should be up to that individual. When I came of age and came out, the internet was not as pervasive and social media wasn’t happening yet. So I didn’t have to worry about somebody seeing me out on Facebook and then telling my parents. I got to facilitate my own timing.","Another high point is the movie’s soundtrack, which was curated by Bleachers frontman Jack Antonoff. What discussions did you have with Jack about the type of music that Simon would be listening to and would make the most sense in the film?","John Hughes’ movies… always had a soundtrack that lived with you well beyond the movie. So that was on my checklist of things I felt the film needed to have. Before Jack said yes to it, he wanted to watch the movie. He was so moved.","He rewatched the film with me, and he kept pulling out his iPhone, which has some of the best unreleased songs known to mankind. He just started putting the iPhone up next to the picture, and so many moments in the movie just came alive in a whole new way.","When you’re bringing a queer-themed storyline to the big screen or TV, is there ever a fear that the story won’t resonate with those who don’t identify as LGBTQ? How do you address that in the creative process?","I think that’s an excellent question. I don’t worry about it. One of the good fortunes of coming out of TV is that you do a lot of testing. They do a lot of research in TV, and so when we got to the movie testing on this film, it was a breeze comparatively.","An audience can be from anywhere and they all love to feel something. They all love to laugh and cry. They all love to connect, and the second they connect emotionally with a character, it doesn’t matter what the actor looks like or who that character is. If you can create empathy for the character, they can be as wildly different from the audience as possible, and it doesn’t make a difference.","When we tested this film, we tested it in a very liberal state, and then we tested it in a very red state. It tested the same, if not a little bit better, in the red state. They applauded [the ending] just as much as they applauded it in the blue state. Storytelling is storytelling.","You’re both a newlywed and a new father. Have marriage and parenthood changed your artistic perspective in any way, or changed the types of stories you’d like to depict on film?","Absolutely! I definitely can’t write at night anymore because I’m exhausted at the end of the day. [laughs] I think when you have a child, it’s impossible to not start seeing the world through their eyes, whether you’re teaching them about words or you’re starting to teach them about concepts, and you are extra sensitive ― as I think you should be ― to the input that they’re getting. It’s made me hypersensitive in a lot of new ways that I’m grateful for.","You directed one of the movies that really touched me a lot as a young queer person, 2000′s “The Broken Hearts Club.” When you think about your experience directing that film versus “Love, Simon,” has bringing LGBTQ stories to the big screen or TV gotten easier with time?","It’s easier in TV, for sure. I haven’t made enough movies to say if it’s easier in film. Everyone involved in this movie, though ― prior to me getting involved ― that decided that they were going to make it was straight, as far as I know. So I think that shows a lot of progress in that regard.","As a queer person yourself, do you feel any obligation to represent the LGBTQ community in any specific way in film?","Just to make sure I’m doing it. I think that it’s incredibly rewarding for me, because it’s something I understand and am familiar with in my own way. Most of my opportunities came because I was writing about myself and issues that I went through, and those were issues of being a young gay person. It wouldn’t be right if I were to then turn around and not create some of the same opportunities for the next generation of LGBTQ people that have a whole new way of experiencing the world.","Are there any aspects of queer life that you’re hoping to explore in future projects that you haven’t already?","I really want to get some trans superheroes on my shows.","What does the success of “Love, Simon” mean to you?","Every time I hear that [“The Broken Hearts Club”] connected with somebody and informed their life in some way, it’s deeply affirming. It reminds me to keep going there as an artist. You want to be the kind of story, whether it’s on TV or in film, that connects with a generation and grows up with them, almost like a friend, and they revisit the way that we all go back to things, stories that we love.","This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aac42c31e0000fb077aef32.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"And Just Like That, Gaming And Mainstream Entertainment Are As One","authors":"Andy Campbell","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gaming-mainstream-entertainment-unite_us_5aabd6d1e4b05b2217fe417f","short_description":"Drake played video games with Ninja, a popular streamer, signaling a huge shift for pop culture.","date":"2018-03-17"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Parkland Shooting Survivor Calls Out Lawmakers In Chilling NRA-Style Ad","authors":"Lee Moran","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/parkland-shooting-survivor-nra-style-ad_us_5aacce18e4b0337adf83f531","short_description":"“What if our politicians weren’t the b***h of the NRA?\"","date":"2018-03-17"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"WEIRD NEWS","headline":"Driver Tries To Pass Homer Simpson License Off As Real To Cops","authors":"Lee Moran","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fake-homer-simpson-driver-license_us_5aaceecae4b0c33361b0b256","short_description":"D'oh!","date":"2018-03-17"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Before You Buy 'Ready Player One' Tickets, Read Ernest Cline’s Horrifying Porn Poetry","authors":"Claire Fallon","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ernest-cline-poetry-nerd-porn-auteur_us_5aabc7e5e4b0c33361afce93","short_description":"\"Nerd Porn Auteur\" dares to dream of a world where even more porn is made with geeky men in mind.","date":"2018-03-17"},"articleContent":["Later this month, many of us will hop in our “Ghostbusters”-branded DeLoreans, cruise over to our local cineplexes and purchase tickets for a viewing of Steven Spielberg’s “Ready Player One,” a gamer action movie based on Ernest Cline’s 2011 bestselling novel of the same title.","And that’s fine! We should find our bliss wherever we can in this crazy world. But first, there’s something we should all read.","It’s a slam poem, written in the late ’90s or early aughts, called “Nerd Porn Auteur.” You can, and indeed should, read the entire poem ― or, if you’re feeling particularly iron-stomached, his entire collection of poetry, The Importance of Being Ernest.","With apologies to Ready Player One, this early composition probably remains Cline’s most vital work. In just a few pages of verse, it lays out a compelling philosophy on masculinity, misogyny, pornography, sexuality and other “y”s that dominate our culture. Cline’s philosophy, to be clear, is: Nerd men are unloved mensches who simply must be given porn with more “Battlestar Galactica” references; other people are Bad and maybe not even human.","If you’re already having horrifying flashbacks to the aggrieved male nerds of #GamerGate: Same.","“I’ve noticed that there don’t seem to be any porno movies / that are made for guys like me,” the poem begins ― a baffling allegation, considering how much porn is made for everyone, but especially men and extra-especially male nerds. By 1998, there were multiple porn versions of both “Star Wars” and “Ghostbusters” in circulation.","But I digress. It would be uncouth not to let him explain:","All the porn I’ve come across\n\nwas targeted at beer-swilling sports bar dwelling alpha-males\n\nMen who like their women stupid and submissive\n\nMen who can only get it up\n\nfor monosyllabic cock-hungry nymphos\n\nwith gargantuan breasts and a three word vocabulary\n\nAdult films are populated with these collagen-injected, liposuctioned women\n\nMany of whom have resorted to surgery and self-mutilation\n\nin an attempt to look the way they have been told to look.\n\nThese aren’t real women.\n\nThey’re objects.\n\nAnd these movies aren’t erotic.\n\nThey’re pathetic.\n\nThese vacuum-headed fuck bunnies don’t turn me on.\n\nThey disgust me.","Cline goes on to clamor for more nerdy women in porn:","The girl in the tweed skirt and the horn-rimmed glasses....\n\nBetty Finnebowski, the valedictorian!\n\nOh yes.\n\nFirst I want to copy her Trig homework,\n\nand then I want to make mad, passionate love to her\n\nfor hours and hours\n\nuntil she reluctantly asks if we can stop\n\nbecause she doesn’t want to miss “Battlestar Galactica.”\n\n[...] But do you ever see that kind of woman\n\nin a contemporary adult film? No!","A porn actress wearing horn-rimmed glasses, pretending to be a geeky high schooler? Hey, maybe that extremely common trope emerged after he wrote the poem. Maybe Ernest Cline made it happen. Maybe I’m better at finding porn than he is. Let’s not speculate.","The point is: Wise, deserving nerd men love smart women, not only because they can effortlessly profit from women’s intellectual labor but also because they can have sex with them. And yet, thanks to life’s cruel inequities, they are denied these women (in their porn).","Cline ties the whole poem up by explaining that he plans to fix this injustice by making “fuck films for my nerd brethren / of all sexual orientations.” Presumably not for women, who do not act as porn consumers in his universe. They are the objects of the male gaze, in which position they may take one of two roles: repulsive “cock-hungry nymphos” or bewitching trigonometry whizzes who will let a studly nerd hump them for hours, well past the point of chafing.","Step one in his business plan:","If you’re an intelligent woman who is interested in\n\nbreaking into the Adult Film Industry,\n\nand if you can tell me the name of Luke Skywalker’s home planet,\n\nthen you are hired!","Yes, to be a valid geek girl, you have to pass this dude’s test. Sorry, you thought you might have agency and self-determination in his new regime ― lol, no.","In total, the poem is a weird amalgamation of self-pity, vicious slut-shaming, smug back-patting about his own nerd credentials and litmus tests for women who claim to be nerds themselves, and, of course, the performative, half-assed feminism that barely rescues it from being a straightforward incel/MRA manifesto.","Sure, this all sounds like dated bullshit, especially cringey thanks to our post-GamerGate awareness of toxic nerd masculinity. To be entirely fair, that’s in part because the poetry is dated. In the introduction, Cline explains that these poems, which take about 20 minutes in total to read closely, arose from his time doing poetry slams in Austin, Texas, where, back in the golden years from 1997 to 2001, he often won spoken-word competitions.","This origin story accounts for some of his groan-inducing tendencies: The pandery rants celebrating geeks, “Star Wars” and oral sex while excoriating knuckle-dragging jocks and corporate jobs; the habit of ending lines and poems on easy puns, exclamation points and expletives. (Those strategies probably played better to a live, lightly drunk crowd of Austinites than they do to a gimlet-eyed solitary reader.)","The cultural conversation (and the availability of hyper-specific porn) has undoubtedly evolved since 2001. That was, after all, 17 years ago. It’s evolved a little less since 2013, though, when Cline composed a new introduction for his collection, in which he opines that he’s “still proud of [the poems]... most of them still hold up pretty well.”","One might remember 2013 was just one year after the mass shooting in an Aurora, Colorado, movie theater. Nonetheless, it seems, Cline felt “Cinéma Vérité (My Closing Argument),” his detailed poem about murdering three people for causing distractions in a movie theater, held up quite nicely in this changed cultural and political environment. A sample:","Did it occur to her inbred ass that bringing a 2 year old [sic]\n\nTo an R-rated movie on a Friday night was not a good idea?\n\nNo.\n\nIt did not.\n\nTherefore, I think you’ll agree ― she had to die.","Hilarious.","Cline’s collection boasts other non-porn-themed standouts. “Bottom Bunk Messiah” tells the story of a young man who shares a college dorm room with Jesus Christ, a foreign exchange student who wears togas, cures frat boys of gonorrhea and gets high with his girlfriend, Mary Magdalene.","Jesus is, he writes, a welcome change from his previous roommate, “a dim-witted, misogynistic, knuckle-dragging / football-playing business-slash-physical education major” who was “luckily... now serving five to fifteen years / on three counts of date rape... where, if there is any justice, / he is being sodomized on hourly shifts.”","Jesus Christ and prison rape ― let no one say this poem doesn’t have range.","The book also features poems about his “Inner Geek” (“He wants to kick your ass in Star Wars Trivial Pursuit. / And he will. / Because he’s a fucking Geek”) and cunnilingus (“Unenlightened, Neanderthal frat boys / can continue to feign intolerance / at the taste or the smell, while boasting about the size of their phallus, / all of them leaving a sea of unsatisfied women in their wake”).","At any rate, the book, and his spoken word album (featuring highlights of his work), are still featured on Cline’s website under the tab “Spoken Word.” He wants you to read it! So definitely take a moment before clicking “buy” on those opening night “Ready Player One” tickets, open up “Nerd Porn Auteur” and soak in every single unhinged word.","Enjoy the show!"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aac28811e000057107aef22.jpeg?cache=qNMILXlAtH&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"WORLD NEWS","headline":"Georgia Ski Lift Malfunction Hurls People Into Air, Injuring 11","authors":"Carla Herreria","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/georgia-ski-lift-accident-malfunction_us_5aac312be4b0c33361b0737f","short_description":"The Caucasus resort's chairlift switched to reverse at high speeds as mangled carriers piled up at the terminal.","date":"2018-03-16"},"articleContent":["A chairlift at a ski resort in the country of Georgia malfunctioned on Friday, causing panic and chaos as passengers were hurled from their seats at high speeds.","Onlookers posted videos of the violent scene as the incident unfolded at the Gudauri Ski Resort, located in the south-facing area of the Greater Caucus Mountain Range.","The incident left at least 11 people injured, with eight hospitalized in stable condition, Nino Mamaladze, a Georgian ministry of health official, told ABC News.","Images of the accident’s aftermath show a pile of mangled carriers near the chairlift terminal’s base.","Warning: The footage and images below are graphic.","During the malfunction, the chairlift traveled in reverse at a high speed, whipping carriers around the terminal and hurling skiers from their seats.","Some skiers jumped or fell before the carrier reached the terminal, while others clung on and were eventually hurled from their seats.

Weiss suggested the Yorkshire, England, native keep his own accent when playing the Stark patriarch.","“We were doing the [pilot] read-through and the producers and the writers said, ‘Why don’t you just keep your own accent?’ And I said, ‘All right! Good for me,’” he said on Build Series, laughing. “But then, everybody else had to do the same accent [as] me from the Stark family. So I established the way we speak.”","“That set the tone for I guess the next seven seasons,” he later told HuffPost. “They all had to talk like me.”","Casting director Nina Gold confirmed Bean’s pivotal role in an interview with HuffPost last year. “Sean Bean is a delight and an amazing actor,” she said. “After casting him, we wanted to make people seem like they were a part of his family and part of the same anthropology. It set the tone for the casting of the rest of the North.”","“I guess we were trying to make it have a homogeneous feel,” she added, referencing the Northern English accent. ”[We] were trying to find something to bring them together … but also, it makes sense because it’s the North!”","Of course, Michelle Fairley (Catelyn), Richard Madden (Robb), Kit Harington (Jon Snow), Sophie Turner (Sansa), Maisie Williams (Arya), Isaac Hempstead Wright (Bran) and Art Parkinson (Rickon) were all cast as members of the Stark clan. Each attempted to bring Bean’s accent to life in their own way on screen, some better than others.","“A lot of British actors are magnificent at accents, but Kit and Maisie, who are both from the West country, and Richard, who is Scottish, all particularly nailed what we were looking for,” Gold said.","As for whether Bean helped any of his young co-stars with the Northern accent, he told HuffPost, “Now and again, yeah, but not often. Kids are quick at picking things up; the older guys could use help a bit.”","“But no, it’s quite a well-known accent and it’s not that hard,” he said.","Bean’s accent eventually even led producers to cast Bella Ramsey, aka everyone’s favorite speech-giving spitfire from Bear Island, Lady Mormont.","“The kind of convention that we’ve sort of got going on is the people in the North have a Northern accent. We then went with it for the whole of the North ... so we were looking for Northern kids,” she said, “We met her at [The Television Workshop in Nottingham] ... and it was just great.”","Apparently, Ramsey didn’t even have to audition too many times because, at that point, producers knew what they were looking for.","And, it was her.","Bean hasn’t kept up with the show as much as he would’ve liked to. (“I think I got me head chopped off in the ninth episode, I stopped watching it then,” he said, laughing.) But he’s glad to be a small part of Westeros and eager to see Ned’s kin ultimately reign supreme.","“I think Jon Snow would be a good choice [for the Iron Throne],” he said.","Watch Sean Bean’s full Build Series interview below.","Bill Bradley contributed reporting."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aa6b7042000007d06eb16cc.jpeg?cache=yY1nGicj1f&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"WORLD NEWS","headline":"Scotland Yard Launches Murder Investigation Into Russian Exile's Death","authors":"Antonia Blumberg","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/scotland-yard-russian-exile-death-investigation_us_5aac0692e4b05b2217fe93af","short_description":"Police say there is no evidence linking the businessman's London death to the poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter.","date":"2018-03-16"},"articleContent":["British police on Friday launched a murder investigation into the death of a Russian exile and critic of Vladimir Putin in London.","Nikolai Glushkov, 68, who received political asylum in Britain, was found dead at his London home on Monday.","Scotland Yard announced the murder investigation following a pathologist’s report that gave the cause of death as compression to the neck.","Glushkov’s death came just over a week after former Russian spy Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, were found on a park bench in Salisbury, England, after being poisoned by a nerve agent. They remain hospitalized in critical condition.","British officials said Monday it is “highly likely” Russia was behind the Salisbury attack on March 4.","The Kremlin’s alleged “record of state-sponsored assassinations” adds to the likelihood that Russia either deliberately carried out the attack or let the poison get into the hands of others, said British Prime Minister Theresa May. Russia has denied any involvement in the poisoning.\n\nScotland Yard said its counter-terrorism division is leading the murder investigation “because of the associations Mr. Glushkov is believed to have had,” but noted that there is currently no evidence linking Glushkov’s death to the poisonings.","“At this stage there is nothing to suggest any link to the attempted murders in Salisbury, nor any evidence that he was poisoned,” the police said in a statement.\n\nRussia’s Investigative Committee also announced that it had initiated a murder investigation into Glushkov’s death, The Guardian reported.\n\nGlushkov was known to be close friends with Russian businessman Boris Berezovsky, who fled from Russian to the U.K. in the late 1990s after a falling out with Russian President Putin. Glushkov had worked for the state airline, Aeroflot, along with Berezovsky’s LogoVaz car company.\n\nHe left Russia in 2006 after a Moscow court gave him a two-year suspended sentence for fraud. In a 2017 Russian trial, Glushkov was sentenced in absentia to eight years in prison for stealing $123 million from Aeroflot.\n\nGlushkov was reportedly due to appear in court in London on the morning of his death but failed to appear.\n\nIn 2011, Glushkov gave evidence in a court case brought by Berezovsky against his fellow tycoon Roman Abramovich, an ally to the Kremlin.\n\nBerezovsky was found dead at his ex-wife’s home in Berkshire in March 2013. Though police did not treat his death as suspicious, the businessman’s friends were skeptical. A coroner later recorded an open verdict in his cause of death.\n\nGlushkov told The Guardian at the time of Berezovsky’s death: “I’m definite Boris was killed. I have quite different information from what is being published in the media.”\n\nHe pointed to other Russian exiles, including Alexander Litvinenko, who had died under mysterious circumstances in 2006. “Boris was strangled. Either he did it himself or with the help of someone. I don’t believe it was suicide,” Glushkov said.","If the Russian government is found to have any ties to the Glushkov’s death or to the poisonings of Skripal and his daughter, the incidents would join a long list of suspected assassinations of Russian dissidents abroad, and specifically in the U.K. Litvinenko, Russian spy, was poisoned in London in an attack that a British government investigation later concluded was “probably approved” by Putin."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aac10f42000003800eb22ae.jpeg?cache=NXye6BG24x&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"WORLD NEWS","headline":"Russia Vows To Expand 'Black List' Of Americans In Response To New Sanctions","authors":"","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/russia-sanctions-retaliation_us_5aab7f9ce4b0337adf82bce5","short_description":"Moscow has also not ruled out extra measures in response to new sanctions for allegedly interfering in U.S. elections and cyber attacks, which Russia denies.","date":"2018-03-16"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"WORLD NEWS","headline":"South Africa Hits Ex-President Zuma With Corruption Charges","authors":"","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/south-africa-zuma-corruption-charges_us_5aabd7dbe4b0337adf834718","short_description":"Jacob Zuma, who was forced to resign last month, was charged with corruption over a $2.5 billion state arms deal.","date":"2018-03-16"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"QUEER VOICES","headline":"Irish Lawmaker Proposes Ban On 'Harmful, Deceptive' Conversion Therapy","authors":"Zoe Tabary, Reuters","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ireland-conversion-therapy-ban_us_5aabd859e4b05b2217fe46cf","short_description":"The widely discredited practice has only been completely banned in three nations so far.","date":"2018-03-16"},"articleContent":["LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - An Irish lawmaker has introduced a bill that would ban so-called conversion therapies claiming to “cure” lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people.","Fintan Warfield, a senator with Irish nationalist party Sinn Fein, proposed the bill on Wednesday to ban conversion therapy as a “deceptive and harmful act or practice against a person’s sexual orientation, gender identity and, or gender expression.”","Despite global gains in LGBT rights, many gay people are still forced to undergo archaic and invasive therapy based on the idea that homosexuality is a mental disorder or medical condition.","Although conversion therapy has been widely discredited, only Brazil, Ecuador and Malta have nationwide bans, says the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA).","Such therapies could have a “negative impact on people’s mental health, as they can lead to lower self-esteem, depression and suicidal ideation,” Evelyne Paradis, ILGA’s executive director in Europe, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.","“Legislation sends out a powerful message that stigma masquerading as ‘therapy’ will not be tolerated by modern societies ... and we encourage Irish parliamentarians to quickly pick up this really important issue,” she said by email.","Under the bill, individuals found guilty of performing conversion therapy on another person could be fined up to 10,000 euros ($12,351) and face up to a year in prison.","Irish politicians have called on Leo Varadkar, Ireland’s first openly gay prime minister, to raise LGBT rights at a meeting on Friday with U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, who has expressed staunchly anti-gay rights views.","Ireland made history in 2015 as the first country to legalize gay marriage by popular ballot: in the referendum, 62 percent voted in favor in a nation that was once dominated by the Catholic Church.","Reporting by Zoe Tabary @zoetabary, Editing by Robert Carmichael.

Astore","Overseas, the United States is engaged in real wars in which bombs are dropped, missiles are launched, and people (generally not Americans) are killed, wounded, uprooted, and displaced. Yet here at home, there’s nothing real about those wars. Here, it’s phony war all the way. In the last 17 years of “forever war,” this nation hasn’t for one second been mobilized. Taxes are being cut instead of raised. Wartime rationing is a faint memory from the World War II era. No one is being required to sacrifice a thing.","Now, ask yourself a simple question: What sort of war requires no sacrifice? What sort of war requires that almost no one in the country waging it take the slightest notice of it?","America’s conflicts in distant lands rumble on, even as individual attacks flash like lightning in our news feeds. “Shock and awe” campaigns in Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003, initially celebrated as decisive and game changing, ultimately led nowhere. Various “surges” produced much sound and fury, but missions were left decidedly unaccomplished. More recent strikes by the Trump administration against a Syrian air base or the first use of the most powerful non-nuclear weapon in the U.S. arsenal, the MOAB super-bomb, in Afghanistan flared brightly, only to fizzle even more quickly. These versions of the German blitzkrieg-style attacks of World War II have been lightning assaults that promised much but in the end delivered little. As these flashes of violence send America’s enemies of the moment (and nearby civilians) to early graves, the homeland (that’s us) slumbers. Sounds of war, if heard at all, come from TV or video screens or Hollywood films in local multiplexes.","We are, in fact, kept isolated from Washington’s wars, even as America’s warriors traverse a remarkable expanse of the globe, from the Philippines through the Greater Middle East deep into Africa. As conflicts flare and sputter, ramp up and down and up again, Americans have been placed in a form of behavioral lockdown. Little more is expected of us than to be taxpaying spectators or, when it comes to the U.S. military, starry-eyed cheerleaders. Most of the time, those conflicts are not just out of sight, but meant to be out of mind as well. Rare exceptions are moments when our government asks us to mourn U.S. service members like Navy SEAL William “Ryan” Owens, killed in an abortive raid President Trump ordered in Yemen in early 2017 in which children also died (though that was something just about no one here even noticed). While the military has been deploying and striking on a global scale, we’ve been told from the very first moments of Washington’s self-proclaimed war on terror to go shopping or to Disney World and let the experts handle it.","We have, in short, been sidelined in what, to draw on the lexicon of World War II, might be thought of as a sitzkrieg, the German term for phony war.","A bizarre version of blitzkrieg overseas and an even stranger version of sitzkrieg at home could be said to define this peculiar American moment. These two versions exist in a curiously yin-yang relationship to each other. For how can a nation’s military be engaged in warfare at a near-global level ― blitzing people across vast swaths of the globe ― when its citizens are sitting on their collective duffs, demobilized and mentally disarmed? Such a schizoid state of mind can exist only when it’s in the interest of those in power. Appeals to “patriotism” (especially to revering “our” troops) and an overwhelming atmosphere of secrecy to preserve American “safety” and “security” have been remarkably effective in controlling and stifling interest in the country’s wars and their costs, long before such an interest might morph into dissent or opposition. If you want an image of just how effective this has been, recall the moment in July 2016 when small numbers of earnest war protesters quite literally had the lights turned off on them at the Democratic National Convention.","To use an expression I heard more than a few times in my years in the military, when it comes to its wars, the government treats the people like mushrooms, keeping them in the dark and feeding them bullshit.","The Fog of Phony War","Prussian war theorist Carl von Clausewitz famously spoke of the “fog of war,” the confusion created by and inherent uncertainty built into that complex human endeavor. As thick as that fog often is, in these years the fog of phony war has proven even thicker and more disorienting.","By its very nature, a real war of necessity, of survival, like the Civil War or World War II brings with it clarity of purpose and a demand for results. Poorly performing leaders are relieved of command when not killed outright in combat. Consider the number of mediocre Union generals Abraham Lincoln cycled through before he found Ulysses S. Grant. Consider the number of senior officers relieved during World War II by General George C. Marshall, who knew that, in a global struggle against Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan, subpar performances couldn’t be tolerated. In wars of necessity or survival, moreover, the people are invariably involved. In part, they may have little choice, but they also know (or at least believe they know) “why we fight” ― and generally approve of it.","Admittedly, even in wars of necessity there are always those who will find ways to duck service. In the Civil War, for example, the rich could pay others to fight in their place. But typically in such wars, everyone serves in some capacity. Necessity demands it.","The definition of 21st century phony war, on the other hand, is its lack of clarity, its lack of purpose, its lack of any true imperative for national survival (despite a never-ending hysteria over the “terrorist threat”). The fog it produces is especially disorienting. Americans today have little idea “why we fight” other than a vague sense of fighting them over there (Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Niger, Somalia, Syria, Yemen, etc.) so they won’t kill us here, to cite George W. Bush’s rationale for launching the war on terror. Meanwhile, with such a lack of national involvement and accountability, there’s no pressure for the Pentagon or the rest of the national security state to up its game; there’s no one even to point out that wherever the U.S. military has gone into battle in these years, yet more terror groups have subsequently sprouted like so many malignant weeds. Bureaucracy and mediocrity go unchallenged; massive boosts in military spending reward incompetency and the creation of a series of quagmire-like “generational” wars.","Think of it as war on a Möbius strip. More money shoveled into the Pentagon brings more chaos overseas, more imperial overreach, and undoubtedly more blowback here at home, all witnessed ― or rather largely ignored ― by a sitzkrieg citizenry.","Of course, for those fighting the wars, they are anything but phony. It’s just that their experience remains largely isolated from that of the rest of us, an isolation that only serves to elevate post-traumatic stress disorder rates, suicides, and the like. When today’s troops come home, they generally suffer in silence and among themselves.","America’s New (Phony) National Defense Strategy","Even phony wars need enemies. In fact, they may need them more (and more of them) than real wars do. No surprise then that the Trump administration’s recently announced National Defense Strategy (NDS) offers a laundry list of such enemies. China and Russia top it as “revisionist powers” looking to reverse America’s putative victory over Communism in the Cold War. “Rogue” powers like North Korea and Iran are singled out as especially dangerous because of their nuclear ambitions. (The United States, of course, doesn’t have a “rogue” bone in its body, even if it is now devoting at least $1.2 trillion to building a new generation of more usable nuclear weapons.) Nor does the NDS neglect Washington’s need to hammer away at global terrorists until the end of time or to extend “full-spectrum dominance” not just to the traditional realms of combat (land, sea, and air) but also to space and cyberspace.","Amid such a plethora of enemies, only one thing is missing in America’s new defense strategy, the very thing that’s been missing all these years, that makes twenty-first-century American war so phony: any sense of national mobilization and shared sacrifice (or its opposite, antiwar resistance). If the United States truly faces all these existential threats to our democracy and our way of life, what are we doing frittering away more than $45 billion annually in a quagmire war in Afghanistan? What are we doing spending staggering sums on exotic weaponry like the F-35 jet fighter (total projected program cost: $1.45 trillion) when we have far more pressing national needs to deal with?","Like so much else in Washington in these years, the NDS doesn’t represent a strategy for real war, only a call for more of the same raised to a higher power. That mainly means more money for the Pentagon, the Department of Homeland Security, and related “defense” agencies, facilitating more blitz attacks on various enemies overseas. The formula ― serial blitzkrieg abroad, serial sitzkrieg in the homeland ― adds up to victory, but only for the military-industrial complex.","Solutions to Sitzkrieg","Of course, one solution to phony war would be to engage in real war, but for that the famed American way of life would actually have to be endangered. (By Afghans? Syrians? Iraqis? Yemenis? Really?) Congress would then have to declare war; the public would have to be mobilized, a draft undoubtedly reinstated, and taxes raised. And those would be just for starters. A clear strategy would have to be defined and losing generals demoted or dismissed.","Who could imagine such an approach when it comes to America’s forever wars? Another solution to phony war would be for the American people to actually start paying attention. The Pentagon would then have to be starved of funds. (With less money, admirals and generals might actually have to think.) All those attacks overseas that blitzed innocents and spread chaos would have to end. Here at home, the cheerleaders would have to put down the pom-poms, stop mindlessly praising the troops for their service, and pick up a few protest signs.","In point of fact, America’s all-too-real wars overseas aren’t likely to end until the phony war here at home is dispatched to oblivion.","A final thought: Americans tell pollsters that, after all these years of failed wars abroad, they continue to trust the military more than any other societal institution. Consistent with phony war, however, much of that trust is based on ignorance, on not really knowing what that military is doing overseas. So, is there a chance that, one of these days, Americans might actually begin to pay some attention to “their” wars? And if so, would those polls begin to change and how might that military, which has experienced its share of blood, sweat, and tears, respond to such a loss of societal prestige? Beware the anger of the legions.","Faith in institutions undergirds democracy. Keeping the people deliberately demobilized and in the dark about the costs and carnage of America’s wars follows a pattern of governmental lying and deceit that stretches from the Vietnam War to the Iraq Wars of 1991 and 2003, to military operations in Afghanistan, Syria, and elsewhere today. Systemic lies and the phony war that goes with them continue to contribute to a slow-motion process of political and social disintegration that could result in a much grimmer future for this country: perhaps an authoritarian one; certainly, a more chaotic and less democratic one.","Societal degradation and democratic implosion, caused in part by endless phony war and the lies associated with it, are this country’s real existential enemies, even if you can’t find them listed in any National Defense Strategy. Indeed, the price tag for America’s wars may in the end prove not just heavy but catastrophic.","William Astore, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel and history professor, is a TomDispatch regular.

Louise Slaughter (D-N.Y.), one of the longest-serving women in the U.S. House, died early Friday at the age of 88.","She died at George Washington University Hospital, her office confirmed in a statement. She had been hospitalized for a concussion after a fall at her Washington home last week, according to the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle.","“As the first chairwoman of the House Rules Committee, Louise blazed a path that many women continue to follow,” said her chief of staff, Liam Fitzsimmons. “It is difficult to find a segment of society that Louise didn’t help shape over the course of more than thirty years in Congress, from health care to genetic nondiscrimination to historic ethics reforms. The Slaughter family is incredibly grateful for all the support during this difficult time. Details on funeral arrangements will be provided when they are available.”","Slaughter was elected to Congress in 1986. She was known for championing women’s and reproductive rights during her time in the House. In 2007, she became the first woman to chair the powerful House Rules Committee.","Having grown up in Kentucky coal country, Slaughter went on to obtain a bachelor’s degree in microbiology and a master’s degree in public health. She then moved to New York City to work for Procter & Gamble, at which point she became interested in politics. In 1982, she was elected to New York’s State Assembly, where she remained until she won her U.S. House seat and became the first woman to represent western New York.","Some of the first policies she helped pass reflected her work as a defender of women: the allocation of $500 million in federal funding for breast cancer research and the mandated inclusion of women and minorities in all federal health trials. She co-authored the 1994 Violence Against Women Act, which offered legal avenues to women who were victims of crime.","Slaughter was part of the group of seven Democratic congressional women who in 1991 marched up the steps of the U.S. Capitol, attempting to delay the confirmation process for then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas. They were unsuccessful in demanding the male leaders of the Senate to fully investigate Anita Hill’s sexual harassment allegations against Thomas.","“There’s no monolithic way that women respond to this. But we are the people who write the laws of the land. Good Lord, she should have some recourse here,” Slaughter said at the time, according to The New York Times.","In 1996, she was one of only a handful of Democrats who voted against the Defense of Marriage Act, which the Supreme Court struck down in 2013, paving the way for LGBTQ couples to legally marry.","She marked her time as the first female chairwoman of the House Rules Committee from 2007 to 2011 by playing a role in passing other historic legislation, including the Affordable Care Act, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 and the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act. Slaughter was a co-chair and founding member of the Congressional Pro-Choice Caucus.","House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) commemorated Slaughter as “a trailblazer.”","“Her strong example inspired countless young women to know their power, and seek their rightful place at the head of the decision-making table,” she said in a statement on Friday.","Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas), who currently chairs the Rules Committee, remembered Slaughter as “a fearless leader, deeply committed to her constituents, and a dear friend.”","“As the first female Chairwoman of our Committee, she was a force to be reckoned with, who always brought her spunk, fire, and dynamic leadership to every meeting,” Sessions said in a statement. “Although we sat on different sides of the aisle, I have always considered her a partner and have the utmost respect for her.”","Slaughter was married to husband Bob Slaughter for 57 years, until his death in 2014, according to her office.

Bush didn’t wave at Stevie Wonder. But political myths like these have ways of sticking in the public memory and distorting history.","When it comes to the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq, rumors have circulated since the early months of the conflict that Washington’s original name for the war was “Operation Iraqi Liberation.” After the war’s architects realized that name produced the embarrassing acronym “OIL,” they quickly changed the official title to “Operation Iraqi Freedom.”","In reality, however, there is no public record of Operation Iraqi Liberation as the official U.S. label, and no evidence that it was ever seriously considered.","So, how did this story start?","The OIL Myth","The story of “Operation Iraqi Liberation” is mild enough to be believable. It also neatly fits two prominent antiwar narratives: that the invasion was primarily aimed at capturing Iraq’s oil reserves, and that George W. Bush’s administration was full of morons.","Perhaps because it sounds plausible, the “OIL” story doesn’t just live in YouTube conspiracy videos and on internet message boards. It has appeared in articles in major newspapers and books on the Iraq war, and over the years has popped up in letters to the editor columns. But the story is always unsourced or attributed to anonymous military historians. It has a friend-of-a-friend-told-me quality any time it’s mentioned.","The anecdote appeared as early as August 2003, just months after the start of the conflict. An Aug. 13 Washington Post article covering a series of U.S. military raids in Iraq called “Operation Ivy Lightning” notes that mission’s regrettable “OIL” acronym, and mentions rumors that military officials earlier that year avoided naming the war Operation Iraqi Liberation.","The Likeliest Explanation","On the afternoon of March 24, just days after the U.S launched a barrage of missiles at Baghdad to kick off the war, White House press secretary Ari Fleischer held a briefing with the media.","Fleischer gave a report on the president’s day and his phone calls with foreign leaders. But a few sentences into his briefing, he stumbled on the name of the war, and said “Operation Iraqi, uh, Liberation.”","Which brings us to Jay Leno.","One day after Fleischer botched the war’s name, Leno taped the 51st episode of his 11th season as host of “The Tonight Show,” the top-rated program on late-night television that year. His guests that night included Hillary Swank, Chris Rock and musician Sean Paul.","Like every late-night host at the time, Leno’s opening monologues were a deluge of Iraq war jokes. Many of these from the March 25 show involved cringeworthy puns ― “You think right about now, Saddam Hussein is suffering from Iraq-tile dysfunction?” ― and topical references ― “Not only do we have the Iraqis on the run, but late today, two of the Dixie Chicks surrendered.”","Then there was this:","“In more serious news, the war continues in Iraq. They’re calling it ‘Operation Iraqi Freedom.’ They were going to call it ‘Operation Iraqi Liberation,’ then they realized, uh-oh, that spells ‘OIL.’”","Given the show’s references to daily events in Iraq, it’s likely Leno’s writers were watching Fleischer’s briefings, or at least seeing news reports about them. A Leno joke from April 3 even mentions Fleischer by name, according to a database of late-night jokes about the Iraq war compiled by Michel M. Haigh and Aaron Heresco for a study published in Mass Communication and Society Journal.","The “OIL” joke was popular, or obvious enough that it was soon repeated outside of late-night television. When New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof held a contest in November 2003 to find a better name for Operation Iraqi Freedom, a number of the 4,000 entries he received included the suggestion of Operation Iraqi Liberation.","A representative for Fleischer did not respond to multiple HuffPost requests for clarification on why the former press secretary might have used the name, which he repeated during a briefing on April 1, 2003. Jay Leno’s publicist did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.","The Case Against The OIL Story","It’s impossible to definitively say if Leno and Fleischer are the source of the “OIL” story, but what is certain is that the war was never officially named Operation Iraqi Liberation. There’s also no apparent documentation that suggests “OIL” was ever a real contender in the naming process, if it was brought up at all.","Naming a military operation is a convoluted process. United States Central Command officials propose possible titles, in accordance with restrictions laid out in the manual for the military’s “Code Word, Nickname, and Exercise Term System.” The Joint Chiefs of Staff then selects a name, which is sent to the secretary of defense for approval.","The George W. Bush administration announced the Iraq war’s official title, “Operation Iraqi Freedom” on March 20, 2003, according to a Scripps Howard News Service article published the same day. The operation had no individual title before that, but fell under the umbrella of the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan ― “Operation Enduring Freedom.”","The U.S. Army War College has no record of the name “Operation Iraqi Liberation” in any of its literature, including an upcoming U.S. Army Operation Iraqi Freedom study group history of the war, according to an official there.","“I would not be surprised if that Liberation name got thrown around when the operational name was being discussed in D.C., but I cannot find any reference it was ever seriously considered,” said Conrad Crane, chief of historical services for the Army Heritage and Education Center in Carlisle, Pennsylvania.","The Joint Chiefs issued an even stronger denial.","“There is no record on the Joint Staff of any other name used or considered for ‘Operation Iraqi Freedom,’” said Richard R. Osial, spokesman for the Joint Chiefs.","Several other military historians and Iraq war experts contacted by HuffPost all either said they were unaware of the “Liberation” story, or had heard it but never saw any proof."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aaaa0e12000003800eb2079.jpeg?cache=OeiK06hBpO&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"To Prevent Suicides And School Shootings, More States Embrace Anonymous Tip Lines","authors":"Stateline, Editorial Partner","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/to-prevent-suicides-and-school-shootings-more-states_us_5aabd0dde4b03cc9629c66c2","short_description":"Last school year, more than 9,000 tips were submitted statewide.","date":"2018-03-16"},"articleContent":["By Sophie Quinton","After a teenage gunman killed 17 people at a Parkland, Florida, high school last month, schools across the country were hit by a wave of copycat threats.","In Colorado, at least two high school students were arrested based on information sent to the state anonymous tip line and mobile app, known as Safe2Tell. “They had a list, they had weapons, they knew exactly what they wanted to do,” said Colorado Attorney General Cynthia Coffman, whose office administers the program.","States across the country are responding to high-profile school shootings and rising teen suicide rates by creating tip lines modeled on Colorado’s. The programs aim to prevent young people from behaving dangerously, whether that means bullying, using drugs or killing someone.","Coffman said that Safe2Tell has saved lives in Colorado, and that such a system could have prevented the Parkland shooting. Nikolas Cruz, the expelled student who has admitted to shooting his former classmates at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, had a long record of disturbing behavior but it didn’t provoke a sufficient response from local authorities. A tipster’s warning to an FBI hotline was never communicated to local law enforcement.","Tips that are sent to Safe2Tell, in contrast, are required to be passed on to school districts and often police departments, and local officials are required to investigate. That might mean setting up a meeting between a student and a school counselor, or it might mean sending a police car straight to a student’s home.","“Something like Safe2Tell would have led to an intervention,” Coffman said of the shooting in Florida. “I feel very confident saying that.”","Tip lines, which are relatively inexpensive and don’t affect gun control laws, are one of the few policy responses to mass shootings that Republicans and Democrats can agree on.","Colorado launched Safe2Tell after Columbine in 1999. Since 2014, Michigan, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Wyoming have launched similar programs, prompted in part by the Sandy Hook massacre in 2012.","In the wake of the Parkland massacre, the Colorado Safe2Tell office has fielded calls from the Trump administration and interested state and local officials nationwide. “We’re getting calls from all over the country now, it’s crazy,” said Susan Payne, the director of Safe2Tell.","The Colorado Attorney General’s Office is working with its Florida counterpart to potentially set up a tip line there. In Arizona, a bill setting up a similar program is making its way through House and Senate committees. And this week the U.S. House passed legislation that would authorize grants for such programs along with other school safety initiatives.","“Solutions on the state level — including in my home state of Utah — can help show us the way forward,” Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch said in a speech last month announcing the school safety legislation. Utah’s anonymous tip line has investigated 86 credible school attack threats since it launched in 2016, according to University of Utah Health, the health care system that manages the program.","A Response to Columbine","Payne came up with the idea for Safe2Tell in the 1990s when she was working as a police detective in Colorado Springs. At the time, youth violence was rising locally, and she found that young people often had valuable information about what was going to happen and needed trusted adults to tell — and a reliable way to do it.","She envisioned a system that would teach children that speaking up was their civic responsibility and doing so didn’t make them a tattletale. Unlike the national tip line Crime Stoppers, there would be no cash reward for providing information. Safe2Tell expanded statewide in Colorado in 2004, initially as a nonprofit.","Today, Colorado state patrol officers respond to tips that reach Safe2Tell by phone, mobile app or website 24/7, and ask tipsters detailed questions to gather information about a potential problem. Alerts are sent out to local officials soon after the interview ends.","John McDonald, head of security for Jefferson County Public Schools, said he’s been woken in the wee hours by his phone buzzing with an incoming alert. Often, he said, young people submit their reports when they’re up late worrying about something.","He has responded to tips about everything from suicidal thoughts to underage keg parties. Sometimes, tips lead to dramatic rescues. He and Coffman both shared the story of a middle-school-aged boy who tried to hang himself in a park. The boy’s teenage brother found him and saved his life after a principal received a tip and called the family in alarm.","Payne says that non-emergency reports are important, too. For instance, a report that a child has been cruel to animals can help a school district intervene and address his violent tendencies early on.","Last school year, more than 9,000 tips were submitted statewide. The most common tip involved a suicide threat. Other common tips involved bullying, drug use, cutting and depression, and about 300 involved planned school attacks. Anyone can use the service, including parents, teachers, college students and other community members.","Social media has made it easier than ever for users to spot and share safety threats. Sometimes tipsters will share pictures students have posted online of themselves wearing body armor and posing with a gun.","To make sure the program is being used, Safe2Tell officials team up with schools and nonprofits to educate students about it. “Just a tip line, by itself, I don’t think is the answer,” Payne said.","Not a Magic Solution","Yet some acts of violence have slipped through the cracks. In 2013, a student entered a Denver-area high school armed with a shotgun, a hunting knife and three Molotov cocktails. He shot a classmate in the head and then shot himself. Both teenagers died.","Although several students had had concerns about the student’s violent tendencies, nobody called the state tip line. “If just one student or teacher had called Safe2Tell, this tragedy might have been averted,” a report from researchers at the University of Colorado at Boulder and the University of Northern Colorado said about the shooting.","The researchers found that, among other mistakes, the high school never properly taught students and staff about Safe2Tell. The program was advertised on posters in the hallways, and stickers on the back of student identification badges, but students had not been trained to use it.","School districts need a system for keeping track of and addressing worrisome behavior way before a student reaches a crisis point, said William Woodward, one of the report authors and director of training and technical assistance at the Center for the Study and Prevention of Violence at the University of Colorado. The center is working with Colorado schools to improve intervention.","And schools also need the resources to follow up. Nevada, for instance, hired more school social workers before it launched a tip line this year. “We didn’t want tips to come in, and nobody ready to respond,” said Christina McGill, director of the office for a safe and respectful learning environment at the Nevada Department of Education.","“I will kid you not: It is labor intensive,” McDonald said of the Safe2Tell program. Tips can come in at any time of day and might involve a coordinated response from school administration and the police. “You’re waking up a lot of people,” he said.","Coffman said that policymakers and school officials in other states have told her that they’re worried some schools may not have the capacity to adequately respond to a high volume of tips.","The number of tips submitted in Colorado have increased dramatically over the past decade, which Coffman attributes partly to rising awareness of the program and partly to rising incidence of mental illness among young people in Colorado and nationwide. “I think that is an undercurrent through all these statistics,” she said.","States that want to set up a program similar to Safe2Tell should start with legislation that guarantees anonymity for tipsters, Payne said, and they can reach out to Colorado for advice. Safe2Tell cost less than $600,000 to run last year, she estimated.","Payne said she has encouraged the White House to establish a national umbrella to oversee all the state programs, as tips can come in to Colorado’s system that affect other states, and vice versa.","Although the White House has not commented on the umbrella organization idea, President Donald Trump supports school safety legislation passed by the House this week, according to spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders.","Stateline home page","Sign up for exclusive state policy reporting and research"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aabd0f12000008106eb221e.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Republican Food Stamp Plan In Disarray","authors":"Arthur Delaney","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republicans-food-stamps_us_5aabc379e4b0c33361afc925","short_description":"It's not clear how Republicans could overcome a Democratic filibuster in the Senate.","date":"2018-03-16"},"articleContent":["WASHINGTON ― A Republican plan to shrink food stamp enrollment is in some serious trouble.","Earlier this week House Agriculture Committee chairman Mike Conaway (R-Texas), the Republican in charge of writing new food stamp legislation, postponed releasing his bill in order to win Democratic support first. But on Thursday Democrats abandoned the negotiation.","“The Democratic members have made clear that they unanimously oppose [Conaway’s proposal] as it has been described to them and reported in the press,” Rep. Collin Peterson (D-Minn.), the top Democrat on the committee, said Thursday evening.","Conaway has to figure out whether he wants to write a bipartisan bill or one that would pass the House with just Republicans. But since Republicans don’t have a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate, it’s hard to see how a Republican-only strategy could succeed.","Nevertheless, an influential group of hardline House conservatives has been telling Conaway and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) that if they’re not ready to severely shrink enrollment with the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, then they should wait until after midterm elections in November.","“I’m focused on real welfare reform, including food stamp reform, and if that’s not in the legislation then I’ve said before I think it should be a short-term extension,” Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), founder of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, told HuffPost on Thursday.","Roughly 42 million Americans receive food benefits from the program, which is one of the federal government’s most important safety nets and one that experts have credited for eliminating starvation in the U.S. Monthly benefits average $125 per person.","Republicans say having extra money for food discourages people from working, though recent research shows most adults who receive SNAP benefits participate in the labor force.","The Trump administration has made a lot of noise about food stamps this year, saying it favored replacing benefits with boxes of canned goods. The administration is closely allied with the Freedom Caucus leaders, who have been badmouthing an investigation into Trump’s presidential campaign.","Peterson said in a radio interview last week that Conaway’s plan would deny benefits to 8 million people. A Conaway spokeswoman said the number was not accurate but declined to provide details. Enrollment in the program has been declining for years, and budget forecasters already expect improved economic conditions to result in 8 million fewer people receiving monthly benefits a decade from now.","Jordan said he hadn’t seen Conaway’s bill, but that if it kicked an extra 8 million people off food stamps, “that certainly sounds like it’s moving in the right direction.”","The Agriculture Committee traditionally produces a farm bill every five years reauthorizing agribusiness subsidies and nutrition assistance. The previous farm bill bogged down in 2013 under similar circumstances, with hardline conservatives balking at a bipartisan measure that didn’t cut benefits as much as they would have liked. So the House passed a more conservative bill that ultimately got smothered in a House-Senate conference committee.","Citing his own conversations with Senate Agriculture Committee chairman Pat Roberts (R-Kan.), Peterson said last week that “the Senate’s not going to do any of this stuff, so this has been an exercise in futility.”","Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) told HuffPost that delaying the farm bill would be good because “anything trying to happen before the midterms is difficult.”","The idea that Republicans could get a better deal if they wait until after November doesn’t make much sense to Rep. Frank Lucas (R-Okla.), who chaired the Agriculture Committee when hardliners blew up his farm bill five years ago. After all, if Democrats win enough seats to retake the House, they’ll be in charge of the farm bill.","“What happens if we are not in control then a year from now?” Lucas told HuffPost. “Then the document becomes totally different.

Unless you’ve been through it and you can say it’s the same, then fine. If it was the same to you, OK — not the same to me.”","“I don’t want to throw everyone on the same manure pile,” she added. “Being a jerk is not the same as being a rapist — it just isn’t.”","Cohen then asked Gifford if she had reached out to Cosby after she heard about the allegations against him. She said she had, and that she and the comedian had been friends for years.","Gifford said she also called and left a message for Weinstein, another friend of 30 years, after allegations against him surfaced.","“I just want people to know I don’t judge them,” Gifford said. “I don’t like what they do, but God knows their hearts and there’s hope for them. And you can’t call yourself a friend when the first minute where there’s trouble, you run. That’s called a fair-weather friend, and that’s not a friend at all.”","Over 60 women have accused Cosby of sexual misconduct. He is set to go to trial April 2 on charges that he drugged and assaulted former Temple University women’s basketball director Andrea Constand. More than 80 women have accused Weinstein of harassment and assault.","“I hope people are not misunderstanding this,” Gifford told Cohen. “I am not saying that that kind of behavior is in any way acceptable. It isn’t, and it’s horrible. As a woman who’s experienced it, it’s awful.”","“But, can we at least look at each individual case and see it for what it is, and be merciful to people that are sorry for what they’ve done?” she asked. “If we stop having mercy as a part of our vocabulary, Andy, our world will completely die.”","When allegations first surfaced against Cosby in 2014, Gifford admitted she had a hard time coming to terms with the news.","“He is kind, he is capable of great kindness, he’s capable of great generosity,” she said on the “Today” show at the time. “I, along with so many Americans and people worldwide, don’t want these stories to be true.”","She then recalled being on tour with the comedian in the 1970s; she said he tried to hit on her but that she turned him down.","“But I’m not saying that the women are liars,” she said. “From my own personal experience, it didn’t happen. A lot of married men come on to single women, but once I said, ‘No, absolutely not,’ he respected it.”","Just a few months ago, Gifford faced widespread criticism for her response to NBC firing her former co-host, Matt Lauer, amid sexual misconduct allegations.","“I texted him this morning and I said, ‘I adore you,’” she said. “No one is perfect in this world.

Sure, I ultimately didn’t love the season, and I have some quibbles with the winner. But it was a satisfying finish, just twisty enough to keep us on our toes, with a terrific challenge attached. At this point, that’s about all I can hope for.","The actual challenge is an interesting twist: Instead of just performing as a girl group on the main stage, as the final fours of season 9 and “All Stars” season 2 did, the All Stars season 3 girls will be performing a remix of RuPaul’s “Kitty Girl” all around the studio. But the biggest gag of all: It’ll all be in one take. The news makes Trixie Mattel and Shangela practically gag with glee, while Bebe Zahara Benet, who struggles mightily with choreography this week, seems less thrilled.","For someone who ruled during the competition, and had fans convinced she was part of a bigger conspiracy, Bebe goes out with a whimper in this finale. She is easily the worst in “Kitty Girl,” both lyrically and with the choreography. On the runway, her best drag look is exactly as wild as you’d expect — but that’s not quite a good thing. If your best drag is going to be something expected, it has to be flawless. And this wasn’t.","Bebe fails hardest, however, during a new segment introduced for this finale. Ru herself does not choose who will be the last two standing of the final four; she has the six eliminated queens serve as a jury. Each of them votes on which two queens they want as the finalists. Arbitrary? Kinda. Tacked-on? Sure feels like it. Drama? Absolutely, girl.","Before they vote, they have a chance to question the queens, and Bebe’s performance is nothing short of a disaster. The eliminated queens want to know who she would have brought back and eliminated had she won the “Nobody’s Supposed to Be Here” lip sync two weeks ago. I said last weekBebe was smart not to reveal her choices of who to return and eliminate. In the moment, that was true; she had absolutely nothing to gain by revealing them, as she would have certainly angered whoever she chose to eliminate. But to not reveal her choices when asked by the jury? When they’re insisting that they want to know and might not vote for you because you wouldn’t say? Bad gameplay, girl.","Whereas Bebe is overly defensive with the jury, Kennedy Davenport is a dream. She leads with her heart in her interview, leading queens like Thorgy Thor to praise her for being “real.” She emphasizes how much it would mean to her, and generally slays — as you’d expect a pageant queen experienced in interview portions would be. Somehow, the Dancing Diva of Texas gives her best performance when sitting down.","Shangela and Trixie both acquit themselves well in the challenge and on the runway (each wearing their best-ever looks on the main stage). With the jury, each does OK, and strikes a similar note of “I’m already an All Star.” Which is true! They are two of the most popular, most successful queens to ever come from Drag Race. Some might say that’s the reason why they should win.","But in listening to Kennedy talk, combined with her thoughts last week on wanting to be the Ru Girl that fans are lining up to see, I felt a real pang of love for Kennedy. She’s right: The crown would mean more to her than it would to the others. She is a legend, she has given us major moments across two seasons (her “Roar” lip sync! The Bitchelor!), and she does deserve the platform that “Drag Race” offers.","In truth, I think Shangela and Trixie are better at what is required of a “Drag Race winner.” But damn if I wasn’t swayed by Kennedy’s candor, emotion and narrative.","We don’t get full vote totals — which is deeply bullshit, to be frank — but we see a few highlights: Thorgy votes for Shangela and Trixie. DeLa votes for Kennedy. We’re meant to assume Chi Chi votes for Kennedy. The end result is that Kennedy and Trixie earn enough votes over Shangela and Bebe to make it into the top two.","After an emotional lip sync to “Wrecking Ball” by Miley Cyrus, Trixie Mattel takes it. She’s not the best winner in franchise history, not by a long shot, but she’s certainly one of the best drag queens to ever compete on RuPaul’s Drag Race. This was about minting someone who was already a winner in the real world, and that’s a pretty damn good reason for a win.","How the fanbase takes this win is to be determined, but frankly, I’m tired of sticking my finger in the air to see how the wind blows. There’s been a lot of noise this season that drowned out more constructive conversation about the show. Was this season a disappointment? Arguably, yes. It certainly was for me personally. But “Drag Race” on a bad day is still more entertaining than most shows. We expect a ton of it, and are quick to criticize heavily when it fails us. Sometimes, the criticism is fair; often, it’s whining about rigging when our faves don’t make it far.","The world is better for having “Drag Race” on the air. And I’m thrilled we’re moving on to another season with new girls and, hopefully, a new vibe. But Trixie can raise her head high. She’s the winner of “RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars,” and nothing can take that away from her.","It’s all over but the shouting — and the final thoughts, of course:","“All Stars” season 3 sits in the bottom three or four seasons for me, only besting All Stars season one, and the flagship series’ seasons 1 and 7 on a quality level. But even original recipe seasons 1 and 7 are important to the show’s legacy and growth — hell, I think season 7 is maybe the most important season of “Drag Race.” But that’s a subject for another time. For now, I’ll just say that “All Stars” season 3 wasn’t in any real way important to the show’s growth, and I hope season 10 improves on that point.\nI hope All Stars season 3 improves “Drag Race” season 9’s legacy in retrospect. That one isn’t a perfect season, but it does sit in the top half or so of “Drag Race” seasons, and got a deeply unfair reputation when it aired. A much worse season directly following it should give it a bit more shine in the rear-view mirror.\nShangela’s final look was a goddamn dream. Trixie and Kennedy’s were both impressive, for their respective surprise factor and glow-up factor. Bebe flopped this whole episode, and her look was no exception. It was disappointing to see a queen who gave us some major moments this season (Jungle Kitty, “The Boss”) underwhelm at the finish line.\nSpeaking of, Bebe’s “The Boss” reigns as my favorite individual lip sync performance of the season. DeLa’s “Anaconda” and Shangela’s “Freaky Money” come close.\nAja and Thorgy killed the jury segment, asking smart questions and looking great. DeLa was practically invisible, which felt odd to me.\nThough I appreciated the idea of casting nothing bu queens who didn’t finish in the top three (excepting Bebe, of course), the resulting season was too high on drama and not strong enough creatively. So for “All Stars” season 4 — which shouldn’t air until summer 2020 at the absolute earliest — I’d recommend a mix. Give us Stacy Layne Matthews, Jessica Wild, Valentina, Ongina, but also give us Shea Coulee, Trinity Taylor, Courtney Act, etc. And please, please, for the love of Ru, change the format. Lip Sync for Your Legacy was a gag once, but it is fully tired.\nThis season turned sour in a flash, but the response we got from these recaps was worth the more unpleasant moments. Thank you all so much for reading. Here’s to better seasons in the future, and drag on our TV screens in all sorts of formats forever.","RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars may be over, but Drag Race season is just getting started.

It’s about time.”","Adomian is perhaps best known for his recent portrayals of Bernie Sanders, often playing opposite Anthony Atamanuik’s impression of President Donald Trump.

Had I been on set or known about this, I would have made all efforts to stop this. I’ve called the producers to express my outrage.”","PETA says the video was shot in November and shows a cage containing a dog suspended from a crane. Several individuals appear to be holding the cage back with a rope before they suddenly release it. The cage spins wildly in the air, falls into a river, and is submerged for a few seconds before it’s raised back into the air.","PETA told HuffPost that the footage that was being filmed was for a scene in which an alien picks up the dog and tosses it around. HuffPost reached out to the film’s production company, Dirty Monkey Films Group, but did not immediately receive a response.","PETA says the whistleblower reported that there were multiple takes of this scene, and another scene where a handler “tormented the dog ‘into a frenzy’” over a two-hour time period. The dog allegedly never received breaks.","“PETA is urging the actors to hold the production accountable and calling for the public to boycott this film,” the organization said in a statement. “This scene should be cut, and [director Ning Hao] should commit to never working with live animals again. We’re asking that the cast — including ‘Glee’ actor Matthew Morrison — donate their salaries to animal-protection charities in China.”","A similar controversy arose over the film “A Dog’s Purpose” last year, when footage from the set suggested a German shepherd was forced to swim against its will. Animal trainers and the film’s producer said the footage was misleading and that the dog was unharmed."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aac2bc91f00002c0016aa41.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"'Weird Al' Yankovic Just Made History In The Weirdest Way Possible","authors":"Ed Mazza","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/weird-al-hamilton-polka-billboard_us_5aab475ee4b05b2217fd8f62","short_description":"This is definitely not a lame claim to fame.","date":"2018-03-16"},"isValid":false},
