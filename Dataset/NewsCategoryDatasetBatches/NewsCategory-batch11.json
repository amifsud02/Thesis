As YouTube has steadily risen in popularity, Asians have dominated. Among those top online personalities is Anna Akana.","Akana, whose channel now boasts more than 2 million subscribers, has used humor and wit to create a massive repertoire of funny skits and short films on topics ranging from cats (she has six!) to mental health. She does not shy away from her Asian-American identity online, often making videos that speak to the community — like this one on yellow fever, or this one about that moment of solidarity that occurs when Asian strangers in the U.S. spot each other. (It’s so real.)","The actress will be starring in upcoming teen dramedy “Youth & Consequences,” premiering on March 7 on the paid streaming service YouTube Red. In the series, which is being described as a “woke ‘Mean Girls,’” Akana plays high school queen bee Farrah Cutney.","The significance of an Asian-American lead who bucks the quiet, obedient Asian stereotype isn’t lost on Akana, who hopes to show viewers what Asian-American representation can look like.","HuffPost sat down with Akana to chat about her new series, the Asian-American space on YouTube, as well as why fellow YouTuber Logan Paul’s trip to Japan was all-around horrifying.","Oftentimes, Asian characters assume background roles or are just completely erased from the narrative. How does it feel to play a character who’s front and center?","I’ve said this a lot but this definitely feels like my dream project. It’s the kind of show I loved watching ― I loved high school dramas and more importantly it has a female ensemble that’s diverse and reflects real life. [The characters] are incredibly empowered and complex and not just accessories in a man’s life. Especially being able to be the lead character of something like this, as an Asian woman who’s struggled to be seen past stereotypes, and to even have Piper Curda in it ― two strong Asian women vying for power, but it’s not women against women ― feels like absolutely everything I’ve been working for for the last decade.","YouTube has been a place where many strong Asian-American personalities have launched their careers. But we’re still struggling in other platforms and on-screen. Why do you think YouTube has become such a haven for Asian-American personalities?","I think, definitely, the reason why Asians are on YouTube is because we weren’t seeing representation anywhere else. It was finally a platform that catered to us having representation. At the beginning of YouTube, the biggest stars were Asian ... They were able to amass incredible followings. I was introduced to it by my brother and I watched because it was like, “Wow, that’s someone who looks like me and they’re funny and they’re great, and you never get to see Asians acting this way.”","You have experience in both the web industry as well as Hollywood. Do you feel a stark difference between both industries in terms of how you’re treated as an Asian-American?","It’s a little harder to say because the lines have blurred a lot. I think the difference to me feels like creative involvement. In traditional, if I’m hired as an actor, I don’t get a lot of creative say in what happens whereas on YouTube, if it’s great, I get all the glory, if it sucks, I get all the shame because I’m the driving force behind whatever I’m putting out.","The most interesting part is now that I’ve had a following online, I’m able to leverage that and use that financial stability to turn down roles that I now feel are degrading and I don’t want to go out for. At the time, it felt really necessary to go out for certain things because I felt I needed credits and that was all that was available to me. Now I’m in a position where I don’t have to do that anymore. I can go for roles that represent me and my race in a positive way and I can make a positive change.","Do you feel like there’s been a difference in the roles available to you as time has gone on from when you started on YouTube?","Oh, 100 percent. I have so much more of an empowering say in my career now. My first job ever was in what was rated something like the worst movie of all time by Metacritic. I played an Asian driving student, and the whole scene was basically this guy called “The Amazing Racist” berating me and asking me if my pussy was slanted and how I could possibly see out of my tiny eyes. It felt awful that I was like, “Well, this is paying my rent and it’s my very first movie credit so cool.” And I feel like these days now I can absolutely look at that and be like, “No, 100 percent no.” My manager would never even bring something like that to me. It has completely impacted how powerful I feel about what I get to put out.","Yeah, there’s sometimes a tendency for people to blame an actor of color to take a stereotypical role but especially for Asians, who have few roles available to them in the first place, it’s much more complicated than that.","There’s a line that Farrah says that I think about all the time ― it’s “Get on top and then you can make change.” I think that is so true because you have to start from the bottom and then work your way into the system.","The year started off with Logan Paul’s horribly offensive suicide video, which you spoke out about. Do you think that situation was handled properly?","I think by de-monetizing his channel and taking him out of the partnership, [YouTube] made a strong statement about the type of content they were going to tolerate on the platform, which I commend them for.","I put 100 percent of the blame on Logan Paul. I think we’ve gotten so desensitized to everything ... It’s a huge omen about what we expect for content to be. I loved the reaction to it, I loved how everyone was like, “This is not OK, and we’re not going to tolerate that.” But then the very next week he came out with a video with him tasing dead rats and taking a fish out of water.","I’m really disappointed he didn’t take this opportunity to really learn and understand the power he has over young people, but that’s his task. So the most we can do is just speak out.","Another aspect to that incident that was covered less in the media was the way in which Logan Paul treats Asians or portrays them in his videos. You see him doing offensive things, like treating people like Pokémon, along with the already offensive suicide video. What was your reaction to that?","It was awful, especially because Japan is all about respect. They are an incredibly respectful nation. I lived there when I was a kid and was enrolled in public school and the sense of community is as strong as America’s sense of individuality. They place such an emphasis on conducting yourself as a respectable member of society who contributes accordingly.","He made Americans seem like total fucking buffoons. It’s heartbreaking, because I did watch that video of him throwing Pokémon balls in the street and at elderly people and he prefaced it with recognizing that Japan is a place for respect. To not only be completely aware of the country you’re visiting and their values, but to completely ignore that and do stuff for the sake of your content was just gross and disrespectful.","Would you say there’s a way to bring in viewers and put out viral content without having to resort to exploiting shock?","Yes! I would hope so. Look at Liza Koshy. She’s a huge YouTube star and the whole premise of her videos is dancing and being silly and being funny, and people don’t have to resort to shock value or being insane in a public space to get a following. I’m very against that whole culture.","Going back to your new series ― it’s being talked about as a “woke ‘Gossip Girl’” or “woke ‘Mean Girls.’” What kind of social issues do you go into?","We touch on transgender issues ― there’s an episode dedicated to a character who we’re not sure if he’s trans or not and he’s trying to change in the girl’s locker room. There’s a big debate of, is this some guy who’s an asshole jock who’s trying to take advantage of the laws to watch women change? Or is there something going on here?","We also tackle issues of social media and privacy. Some people get doxxed in the series in terms of their private sexual lives or infidelity. The thing that [creator Jason Ubaldi] did best with these scripts was he tackled social media in a way I hadn’t seen before and treated these teens as the sophisticated adults that they are ... Now teens have access to everything they want to know immediately and that’s such a frightening place to be. High school already felt like life and death to me. The stakes felt so high because the reference level in life is so short. For kids today, it’s crazy. They can’t get away from high school no matter where they are!","When you’re in that writers’ room, creating, how do you bring in voices from other issues that you’re touching on? How are you able to make these issues feel authentic in representation?","It was really important to us ― because none of us are trans ― to consult someone from the community and ask, “How are we representing this?” The hard part is ― and I think this is the same with a non-Asian writing an Asian story ― you want to believe that all experiences are universal to a degree and we’re all human and we can all relate to each other and we are compassionate with each other. But at the same time, everybody’s story is completely different. Everyone’s view on something is completely different, so even consulting a trans person we were like, “OK, we’re getting one opinion on this but there might be 10 or 20 other people who disagree with this person.” So we tried to make it the most empathetic, compassionate story possible of someone being outed against their will and someone going through a confusing time.","Do you have any advice for any Asian-Americans trying to make it on YouTube?","I would say, don’t give up. You would be surprised to see how lazy people in LA are. If you have tiger parents who’ve instilled a work ethic in you, you can make it here. We don’t see representation, so you don’t think it’s possible, but oh, my God ― the amount of friends I have here who just don’t do the work is astounding. I just try to tell people, “Come! Be ready prepared to work hard and for it to take a long-ass time.” But if you’re willing to take 12 years for medical school, fuck it. Come be an actor, come be a writer, come be a director. It’ll take the same amount of time and you’ll be doing something that you love."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a96f2b61f00005100168bfb.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"BUSINESS","headline":"Papa John's Is No Longer NFL's Official Pizza","authors":"David Moye","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/papa-johns-nfl-sponsor_us_5a95df6de4b09c872baec75f","short_description":"The relationship has been sliced.","date":"2018-02-28"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Here’s What Is Leaving And Arriving On Netflix In March 2018","authors":"Todd Van Luling","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/leaving-arriving-netflix-march_us_5a95a250e4b0bef79e3084dc","short_description":"\"Forgetting Sarah Marshall\" is just one of many movies joining the service.","date":"2018-02-28"},"articleContent":["March is the time of year when parts of the country finally start to warm up after the long, cold winter.

testified as part of a push to get more states to adopt the federal Sexual Assault Survivors' Bill of Rights Act.","date":"2018-02-28"},"articleContent":["Actress Evan Rachel Wood detailed her own story of sexual assault, rape and domestic violence to a congressional committee on Tuesday to help other abuse survivors.","Wood appeared before the House Judiciary Committee as part of an effort to encourage states to implement the federal Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights Act in all 50 states. Currently, the bill provides survivors with basic rights in federal cases, but has only been adopted by nine of the 50 states.","“I’m here today to use my position as an artist, survivor, mother and advocate to bring a human voice to the population of 25 million survivors in the U.S. who are currently experiencing inequality under the law and who desperately need basic civil rights,” Wood said.","The actress testified along with the CEO and founder of anti-sexual violence organization RISE, Amanda Nguyen, RISE chief of staff Lauren Libby and the vice president of the Rape Abuse Incest National Network (RAINN), Rebecca O’Connor.","“I struggle to speak to you today because I’m not sure what words are appropriate when discussing this issue,” Wood told the committee. “However, if you can’t hear the whole truth you will never know true empathy, and I believe in the saying ‘If we have to live through it then you should have to hear it.’”","Wood described how she was in a violently abusive relationship with a former partner who physically, verbally and sexually abused her repeatedly. She discussed how her former partner raped her while he believed she was unconscious. Sometime after, Wood said, she was raped by a different man in a storage closet at a bar.","Wood termed the federal law a “recognition of basic civil rights for sexual-assault survivors and serves as a first step.”","“It’s a safety net that may help save someone’s life one day,” she said.","During the hearing, committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) explained how the Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights Act works on a federal level:","This legislation assured that in federal cases, a victim would have the right to have their rape kit preserved for the duration of the statute of limitations or up to 20 years; a victim would not have to pay for their own forensic examination; a victim would be informed of any results of their forensic examination; would be provided with written policies on forensic testing kits; and finally, would be informed before their sexual assault examination kit was destroyed and be permitted to request further preservation.","While these rights are afforded to survivors of federal crimes, Goodlatte noted that said they are “not consistently recognized” by all of the states. “And of course, it is in the states where most sexual assault cases are prosecuted,” he said.","While Wood said that while the Me Too movement spotlighting the problem of sexual abuse has been “empowering and validating for survivors,” it also has triggered disturbing memories for her. Many survivors have echoed her feelings over the past months.","“While no one had to tell me that rape was such a worldwide epidemic, to see the flood of stories so similar to my own was both freeing and soul-crushing,” Wood said. “Waves of memories and details came flooding into my brain every time I read the words. I froze. I thought I was the only human who’d experienced this and I carried so much guilt and confusion about my response to the abuse.”","She discussed the aftermath of rape, reminding the panel that it’s a “huge part of the conversation that needs much more attention.” She listed some of the lasting effects of the abuse she’s endured: feelings of shame and despair, depression, addiction, agoraphobia, two suicide attempts and post-traumatic stress disorder.","“So often we speak of these assaults as no more than a few minutes of awfulness, but the scars last a lifetime,” she said. “Even though these experiences happened a decade ago, I still struggle with the aftermath. My relationships suffer, my partner suffers, my mental and physical health suffers. ... Rape is often more than a few minutes of trauma, but a slow death.”","Wood concluded her statement on a powerful note, discussing her role in combating sexual violence as the mother of a young son.","“This makes me think of my son and the world that he will be raised in and the day I will have to explain to him what rape means and why it happened to his mother,” she said. “When I knew I was to become a mother I prayed for a boy for this reason. However, I realized it could be just as easy for my son to fall prey to the lies society tells us about men. ... So I’m also here to advocate for men and for my son, who I hope grows up knowing he’s much more valuable than that and who I can only hope I will set an example for by continuing to fight for him and myself and for all the people affected by abuse, because that is our job as parents and as leaders.”","Watch the full hearing below or fast forward to minute 18:30 to hear Wood’s statement."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a96b9431f00005100168b5c.jpeg?cache=UzvBl9vC0Z&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Emma Thompson Says Real-Life Heartbreak Inspired 'Love Actually' Performance","authors":"Cole Delbyck","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/emma-thompson-love-actually-inspiration_us_5a96eb0de4b0e6a5230435ec","short_description":"Yes, THAT scene somehow got even sadder.","date":"2018-02-28"},"articleContent":["As if we needed another reason to get overly teary about “Love Actually,” one of the stars of the film, Emma Thompson, has revealed that she drew inspiration for her storyline from real-life heartbreak.","The British actress is featured in one of the romantic comedy’s few not-so-happy endings when her character, Karen, discovers that her husband, played by the late Alan Rickman, is having an affair with his assistant.","In one of the film’s most gut-wrenching scenes, Karen realizes he gave the other woman a necklace she thought was intended for her.","“That scene where my character is standing by the bed crying is so well known because it’s something everyone’s been through,” Thompson said at a fundraiser in London on Sunday, according to The Telegraph.","The “Sense and Sensibility” star struggled with infidelity in her own marriage to actor and director Kenneth Branagh. The pair fell in love on the set of the 1987 BBC drama “Fortunes of War” and married two years later. They became a beloved acting-directing duo in the early ’90s, starring in films like “Peter’s Friends” and “Much Ado About Nothing” together.","However, their rom-com took its own dramatic turn when they publicly separated in 1995, blaming their busy work schedules. Later, rumors surfaced that Branagh had begun an affair with actress Helena Bonham Carter the year before, while filming and co-starring in “Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein.”","“I had my heart very badly broken by Ken. So I knew what it was like to find the necklace that wasn’t meant for me,” Thompson said Sunday. “Well, it wasn’t exactly that, but we’ve all been through it.”","Thompson essentially confirmed that the affair was more than just speculation when she revealed that any bad blood about the breakup was “under the bridge” in a 2013 interview.","“I’ve had so much bloody practice at crying in a bedroom, then having to go out and be cheerful, gathering up the pieces of my heart and putting them in a drawer,” she told The Telegraph.","“You can’t hold on to anything like that. It’s pointless,” she added. “I haven’t got the energy for it. Helena and I made our peace years and years ago.”","The Oscar winner went onto marry actor and producer Greg Wise in 2003 and they now have two children together.

So cleaning is not just an end unto itself. Cleaning is the beginning.","[Clorox has] used that paradigm to create this wonderful space through Thrive Collective — this youth arts center. Just a couple of months ago it was a run-down school, and now they’ve created a space where kids can express themselves ― visually, artistically … There’s over 400 schools that Thrive Collective works with that have lost their arts funding in New York City, primarily [its] inner-city areas. So when you take those things away from kids it makes it seem that imagination is not something that should be prized or important. As an actor myself, my imagination, without it, you couldn’t do what I do.","This is about mentorship as well. Who were some of your mentors growing up or one person who stands out to you?","That’s a good question. There’s a woman by the name of Barbara Bull who was my high school adviser. In eighth grade, she was my algebra teacher. And I asked her, “Mrs. Bull, where did you go to school?” And she said, “I went to Stanford University.” I said, “Well, that’s where I will go.” And she said, “It’s hard to get in.” I said, “OK, that’s where I want to go.” And that’s where I wound up going.","She taught me about investing in the stock market. She would come to all my plays — sometimes when other family members weren’t able to be there. I would hang out in her room and do my homework. In between football practice and play rehearsal, I would go to Mrs. Bull’s room because she would always be there. So, she is a second mother to me. I haven’t seen her in awhile, but I love you Mrs. Bull. I hope to see you soon.","“This Is Us” returns this evening. Last time we saw you, we saw an older Randall. What is it like stepping into an older self on the show?","It is interesting. One thing I learned about myself. I didn’t like seeing fat older Randall. They gave me a belly pooch. Look, I’m a pretty easy, go-lucky kind of guy. And they gave me this belly thing, and I was like, “What is this? This does not belong to me. Take this back!” They were like, “We need something different. We need to make sure that people recognize [the older Randall].”","It’s nice to know that our show and our creator has the imagination to say we could go anywhere. As long as we have a family member, this Pearson family, we can track them into the future, into the past. And it’s exciting. It’s exciting to know someone has vision and knows where he wants to take the show because when you trust in the direction you’re being led in, you’re like, “I’ll go wherever you take me.”","In that case, if you could take Randall anywhere, where would you take him?","I think at some point in time Randall has to have more time with his family from Memphis. We opened up this whole other family that he didn’t even know that he had. I hope that we get more time to explore that arena. And then this is sort of a “Black Panther” / “This Is Us” crossover, if you will.","I remember I was talking to a person of African descent who lived in Britain, and she would ask me where I was from. And I was like, “I’m from St. Louis, Missouri.” And she was like, “No man, where are you from?” Well, my mom’s from Arkansas, and my dad’s from Mississippi. She’s like, “No, no, no. But where are you from, right? And I was like, “I don’t know.” So maybe if Randall could trace his ancestry back to the motherland that would be a really interesting thing to explore because we as African-Americans are a group denied the answer to that question: Where are you from?","Speaking of which, there’s been so much success with “Black Panther.” What is it like to see black representation on the big screen in this way?","It fills your boy up! Just being on the set and looking at the trailers at base camp. There would be 20, 25 trailers lined up and then we’d get called to set, and you see a black face coming out of those trailers over and over again. To know that Marvel had the vision and the courage to put this sort of financing behind a film with all these African and African-American faces, and that it has proven that it can be financially viable and not just to the community to which it represents but to the mainstream as well. And that people see themselves.","There’s a very fundamental question at the center of the film: Are you your brother’s keeper? Am I my brother’s keeper? And whether you’re black, white, Asian, Latino, it doesn’t matter — I think that’s a question that we all wrestle to deal with. Ultimately, we say yes, and there are a couple of misguided attempts throughout the course of the film to try to answer that question. But ultimately T’Challa takes it on in a way that hopefully we can move forward in the universe in a way that makes sense. I love this film. I love the way in which the audiences are responding to this film. I love going on Instagram and seeing people dress up in dashikis and African garb and just feeling so big because for so long you’ve been denied that image of yourself on the big screen, that image of yourself as superhero. And now it’s here. And people are feeling it.","How do you feel about who Killmonger becomes in the film?","As his father, he expresses his disappointment. Like I was trying to give you something, and I made a mistake. I kept you away for too long. I didn’t give you enough. I feel like his journey is an interesting parallel to African Americans’ journey in terms of like how exactly am I connected to this thing from which I’ve been disenfranchised. Have I been separate, or am I a part? And so, while he has good intentions, he doesn’t have the best of intentions. The man shot his girlfriend … He burned up all of the earth. It wasn’t like he was trying to be magnanimous to make sure that this continued. He wanted to have absolute power … But it was misguided … and that’s what happens oftentimes. People have these great intentions. But the manifestation, the practical application, they don’t know exactly how to make that happen.","So, it’s nice to see that T’Challa is able to take and recognize within Killmonger that he has a point. But there’s another way to go about it. The conversation over Killmonger has been one of the more fascinating things about the film. I love going on and reading the articles about how this character has struck a chord.","You’re hosting “SNL” on March 10. Who is Sterling K. Brown as “SNL” host?","I’m going to have so much fun.

Behind the scenes, this is causing internal debate and disagreements, Yahoo Finance has learned.","When asked if Whole Foods will add “consumer packaged goods like Coca-Cola,” Whole Foods spokesperson Brooke Buchanan said, “As you know, we have really high-quality standards, and those products that you just mentioned don’t meet those quality standards. If there were new products that actually do meet our quality standards, then there’s always that consideration.” Amazon declined to comment.","In June, Whole Foods CEO John Mackey called the marriage with Amazon, “love at first sight.” And the two appear to be in a happy union, with one big announcement after another: price cuts on staples; Amazon Echo devices debuting in stores; and recent free delivery on Whole Foods products for Prime members.","But the honeymoon may be over as Amazon and Whole Foods butt heads over what to stock store shelves with. Would adding Coke sacrifice the healthy, organic image Whole Foods has long held dear?","Adding Coke would signal greater changes","Whole Foods has been known for its strict rules on sourcing products, requiring foods “free of artificial preservatives, colors, flavors, sweeteners, and hydrogenated fats,” according to its website. That rules out Coca-Cola, the household product with artificial preservatives in the secret recipe, and even its healthier diet version.","Amazon’s plan to change Whole Foods’ shelves is a key effort of the e-commerce giant’s initiative to make Whole Foods profitable. Whole Foods same-store sales had been falling for eight consecutive quarters before being bought by Amazon. After Amazon’s takeover, Whole Foods reported a 4.4% increase in sales for the quarter ending Sept. 24, 2017 from a year earlier — the biggest in two years.","While Whole Foods gained an almost cult-like following, it has also been criticized for its limited store offerings, even as retailers like Walmart and Costco have started to sell more organic produce. Whole Foods owns just a 4% share in the total U.S. grocery market, a far cry from Walmart’s 25% and Kroger’s 10%, according to a Susquehanna analyst note last June.","Then Amazon came. As a consumer-centric company, Amazon is leveraging Whole Foods to satisfy customer needs. That has become more urgent after Amazon provides free delivery of Whole Foods groceries for Prime members, who have a large appetite for packaged goods like Coca-Cola and PepsiCo snacks.","“Whole Foods has proved a specialty retailer focusing only on organic food can’t scale and be profitable,” says Brittain Ladd, a retail and supply chain consultant. “Amazon doesn’t want to maintain the status quo. They can’t see people go elsewhere simply because these highly-popular products are not available in Whole Foods.”","Whole Foods resistance","Amazon could add private label products as soon as March, but the plan of bringing in consumer-packaged goods still faces obstacles from Whole Foods, according to sources familiar with the matter.","“If that does ever happen, it will upset a lot of team members and customers,” a longtime Whole Foods store employee in Austin told Yahoo Finance. “That’s what makes Whole Foods Market different from our competitors.”","But food makers have already started providing healthy alternatives of its products for the Whole Foods. Last year, Bloomberg reported PepsiCo’s Frito-Lay developed organic Doritos marketed under the name “Simply,” which meet all the criteria needed to be sold in Whole Foods. Industry experts said Whole Foods will eventually benefit from larger store selections, since many packaged goods have higher margins and a strong customer base.","“It’s painful, but Whole Foods needs to be put out of the comfort zone,” Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail told Yahoo Finance. “There are retailers that can provide high-quality organic food while offer packaged goods, and Amazon is helping Whole Foods in that direction.”","Do you think Whole Foods should carry more consumer packaged goods?

The survivors of the Valentine’s Day school shooting spent the last two weeks pressuring lawmakers and the National Rifle Association to take action against gun violence. To get their attention, the survivors, mostly students, maintained a steady presence in front of news cameras, organized nationwide school walkouts and staged protests in front of state capitols and the White House.","Before Walmart’s announcement, President Donald Trump met with a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the White House to discuss gun laws and school safety.","Though Trump spoke vaguely about his support of a number of different policies, the president urged lawmakers from both parties to write a “strong bill” that is “really strong on background checks.”","He also accused Republican lawmakers of being intimidated by the National Rifle Association after Sen.

Meanwhile, 50 percent of people of color said they somewhat or strongly opposed arming teachers, versus 44 percent of white respondents.

However, there appears to be an intensity gap on the issue. While only 20 percent of respondents overall said they strongly support arming teachers, 36 percent said they strongly oppose it.","But parents with children under the age of 18 showed some enthusiasm for the idea. Overall, 33 percent of parents said having armed educators would make them feel more safe, while 22 percent said it would make them feel less safe. One-quarter said it wouldn’t make them feel more or less safe either way.","President Donald Trump has repeatedly said teachers should be armed to prevent school shootings like the one in Parkland, Florida, that left 17 people dead on Feb. 14. In the weeks since, a group of the school’s surviving students have mobilized widespread resistance to pro-gun organizations like the National Rifle Association.","In the wake of the shooting, the president held a listening forum with survivors of gun violence and their families. Trump heard from attendees who want to increase the level of security in schools via police officers or armed educators. But some critics have expressed fear that this would only exacerbate the school-to-prison pipeline, a phenomenon in which biased or overly strict security and discipline processes help funnel students from school into the criminal justice system. Others posited that arming teachers could put the lives of black students in danger.","The president’s words aren’t being taken lightly. Nearly half of survey participants ― 44 percent ― called the idea of arming educators with firearms to prevent mass shootings a “serious policy proposal.”","In the same vein, white respondents were more likely to say that they would support having armed police officers stationed at schools. As of 2014, 30 percent of schools employed a school-based police officer. Most poll respondents who identify as white ― 70 percent ― said they at least somewhat endorsed this idea, compared to 58 percent of non-white respondents. Overall, 66 percent of survey respondents said they supported this idea.","Overall, Republican respondents were significantly more likely to support the idea of armed police officers in schools than the general population, at 83 percent versus 66 percent. About 60 percent of Democrats said they backed the idea.","But at the same time, white and Republican respondents were less likely to think schools in the U.S. have safety problems, the poll found.

Movement in and out is prohibited except at a handful of crossings, heavily guarded by both regime and rebel forces.","While the government campaign to regain control of eastern Ghouta has dragged on for years, the intensifying military offensive in recent weeks has produced what United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres called “hell on earth” for the almost 400,000 trapped civilians.","More than 500 people have been killed in the past week, according to estimates from Doctors Without Borders. Schools and medical facilities have been targeted, forcing people to take shelter underground. And because the Assad regime has placed a blockade on humanitarian access, food is severely limited. As of last November, the proportion of children under age 5 suffering from acute malnutrition in eastern Ghouta was the highest percentage recorded during the Syrian civil war.","The U.N. unanimously approved a resolution on Saturday calling for a 30-day ceasefire.","“The resolution will be immediately implemented and sustained, particularly to ensure the immediate, safe, unimpeded and sustained delivery of humanitarian aid and services, the evacuation of the critically sick and wounded and the alleviation of the suffering of the Syrian people,” Guterres said.","Yet no convoys have been able to travel into Syria since the U.N. vote.","“We still don’t have the green light to go inside and bring desperately needed food and medical supplies, and to do medical evacuations,” Panos Moumtizis, the U.N.’s regional humanitarian coordinator for the Syria crisis, told France 24.","The Syrian government has by and large prevented humanitarian aid from reaching eastern Ghouta in the last few years, with the exception of a few deliveries of food and medical aid.","Assad cut off the tunnels used by those smuggling in aid supplies in February of last year, said Aron Lund, a fellow with The Century Foundation, and the U.N. has barely been granted access since September. In October, the government closed the last remaining checkpoint leading into the eastern Ghouta city of Douma, the al-Wafideen crossing, according to Amnesty International, which isolated that area from basic necessities like food and medication.","At the same time, rebel groups have been known to use the blockade on humanitarian access for their own political or financial gain, Lund said. Rebels have monopolized the local economy by being the ones to smuggle in goods and sell them at highly inflated rates, while government soldiers manning the checkpoints profit from their control over some of the smuggling routes.","Violence has repeatedly flared up between Islam Army and Failaq al-Rahman, the two predominant rebel factions in eastern Ghouta, due to disputes over smuggling profits, Lund noted.","“The government has used the humanitarian crisis to its advantage in ways that are not legal under international law,” he said. “It’s not a fair tactic. But you’ve had rebel groups also making money off people’s hunger, so it’s not a black and white situation.”","With both checkpoints and tunnels out of commission, however, innocent civilians are the ones bearing the brunt of the political fighting between the regime and the rebels."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a956ac61e0000fb077acf14.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Limits On Federal Gun Research Spur States To Step In","authors":"Stateline, Editorial Partner","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/limits-on-federal-gun-research-spur-states-to-step_us_5a95774be4b0d02ea9314569","short_description":"The lack of federal funding for gun-related research leaves policymakers without basic information that would help inform policy decisions. Some states are filling the gap.","date":"2018-02-27"},"articleContent":["By Michael Ollove","As deaths from mass shootings have mounted across the United States, some states are moving to collect hard data to guide their decisions about guns — even as the federal government has retreated from such research in the face of pressure from pro-gun groups.","The New Jersey Legislature, for example, is weighing a measure that would create a gun-violence research center at Rutgers University. The center would be modeled on the new Firearm Violence Prevention Research Center at the University of California at Davis, which launched last summer with $5 million in state money over five years.","The impetus for both initiatives is the vacuum created by the federal government’s virtual abandonment of research into gun violence — its causes, its patterns, its perpetrators, its victims, and the best ways, based on scientific evidence, to curtail it.","The federal government’s reluctance to fund research has had a ripple effect. A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association last year found that between 2004 and 2015, research related to gun violence was “substantially underfunded and understudied” compared with other leading causes of death, based on the mortality rates of each. The study said that gun violence research received a paltry 1.6 percent of the funding ($22 million) that would be predicted ($1.4 billion) based on the number of deaths caused by guns — 36,252 in 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.","The influence of pro-gun groups has also dissuaded many private foundations from funding such research, according to David Hemenway, who studies gun violence and injury prevention at the T. H. Chan School of Public Health at Harvard University.","“If you fund gun research, you know you’ll be attacked, and there are so many other things that need research,” Hemenway said. “Funders figure they don’t need the headaches that come with studying gun violence.”","In California and New Jersey, supporters of research say states must pick up the slack.","“California essentially said that the federal government wasn’t fulfilling its responsibility, so we’re going to step into the breach, just as we have with climate change and years before with highway safety,” said Garen Wintemute, the director of the new California center and an emergency physician who has studied gun violence for three decades.","The feeling in New Jersey was the same, according to state Sen. Troy Singleton, a Democrat who introduced a separate bill to fund a $400,000 study of gun violence. It passed out of a Senate committee this month.","“I’m dismayed over the political decision that caused the federal government to walk away from studying this issue, which has put us in a dangerous situation nationally,” Singleton said. “When we develop evidence-based solutions, that’s when we’re at our best.”","The sponsor of the bill to establish a gun research center at Rutgers, Democratic Assemblywoman Joann Downey, said she is more optimistic than ever before about the legislation’s chances.","“Especially with what happened in Florida,” she said. “Our parents are scared. Our teachers are scared. Our students are scared.”","A Shift on Capitol Hill?","In the wake of the killings at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida earlier this month, a few congressional Republicans have indicated a willingness to lift federal restrictions on gun research.","Gun-violence researchers say such a shift would make a huge difference. Without federally funded research, they say, policymakers lack the basic information that would help them make wise policy decisions.","“What isn’t known?” Hemenway said. “Everything. Everything.”","For instance, there are no national studies of who owns guns, how gun owners acquired their weapons, the theft of guns, the number of households with guns, the attributes of a high-quality gun training, or the risk factors associated with gun violence.","Without that knowledge, Hemenway said, “How are you supposed to come up with effective policy?”","The federal government’s withdrawal from gun research began in the late 1990s. Gun researchers such as Hemenway said it was spurred by the first studies indicating that the presence of a firearm in the home increased rather than decreased the chances of gun-related fatalities, either by suicide or homicide. Subsequent studies confirmed those findings.","The studies incensed pro-gun organizations such as the National Rifle Association, which protested to congressional supporters. The result was the Dickey amendment, which Congress added to the 1996 funding bill for the CDC, and which bars the agency from using money to “advocate or promote gun control.” Former U.S. Rep. Jay Dickey, an Arkansas Republican who died last year, eventually expressed regret for the amendment that bears his name.","The Dickey amendment does not explicitly prohibit the CDC from studying gun violence. But it has had a chilling effect on such research, especially since Congress cut the CDC’s annual budget by exactly the amount that it had been spending on gun-related research, about $2.6 million a year.","Though the National Institutes of Health and the National Institute of Justice have continued to hand out small grants for such research, NIH several months ago quietly shelved an $11.4 million gun-violence research initiative that President Barack Obama launched in 2013 in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in Newtown, Connecticut. The initiative has funded 14 firearm related projects over the past 3 years.","Many pro-gun groups continue to support the Dickey amendment — and they are still angry about CDC studies published with federal money.","“At the time the amendment was proposed, officials in the CDC were indicating that they were going to use the agency in order to attack firearms ownership — and to demonize firearms in the same sense as they had demonized tobacco,” Erich Pratt, executive director of Gun Owners of America, wrote in an email to Stateline.","Valuable Research","Even if there isn’t as much gun research as there should be, Philip Cook, a professor at the Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke University, argues that policymakers should be paying attention to what is being produced.","In a December article in Science, Cook cited published research that shows an increase in violent crime as states replaced concealed carry laws with right-to-carry laws. Concealed carry laws gave law enforcement the authority to determine if a gun owner had a justifiable reason to carry a concealed weapon. Right-to-carry laws give most gun owners that right without having to justify themselves.","Similarly, according to Cook’s paper, research has shown that laws preventing those with misdemeanor convictions for domestic violence from owning guns have saved lives. Finally, he noted, research showed that laws that increased prison sentences for those using a firearm in an aggravated assault or robbery has reduced the rate of robberies in which a gun is involved.","“Despite the relative lack of federal funding in this area, there has been quite a lot of research going on,” Cook said. “And it’s productive and evidence-based, exactly what is needed to create effective policy.”","At UC Davis, Wintemute said his center plans to give California lawmakers what they need to create effective policy.","“Soon we’re going to publish the first large-scale epidemiological study on gun violence in California in 30 years,” he said. “The reason I know that is because I’m the one who did the study 30 years ago.”","Stateline home page","Sign up for exclusive state policy reporting and research"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a95794e1e000031007acf33.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Majority Of Voters Want Trump To Do More To Combat Violence Against Women","authors":"Alanna Vagianos","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-violence-against-women-poll_us_5a957101e4b02cb368c60460","short_description":"In a recent survey, more than two-thirds of voters said the president \"needs to do and say more\" on the issue.","date":"2018-02-27"},"articleContent":["Most voters believe President Donald Trump should do more to prevent violence against women.","Sixty-eight percent of people in a recent survey from the Center for American Political Studies at Harvard and the Harris Poll believe Trump “needs to do and say more” on violence against women.

That Feldman and Stern communicate with one another onscreen using a combination of sign language and gestures is, in some respects, beside the point; the experiences their characters convey are messy, relatable and funny. (Catch a behind-the-scenes sneak peek at the show in the video above.)","The actor-creators first collaborated in 2015, introducing less-developed versions of their “This Close” characters on a web series called “Fridays.” A second, five-part incarnation of the show, “The Chances,” debuted to great acclaim at the Sundance Film Festival last year.","Their mission with “This Close,” Feldman said, was to give members of the deaf community the onscreen complexity they had lacked.","“In the past, when deaf characters are represented or introduced, it’s because they’re deaf. The sole purpose that they’re in the story is because they’re deaf,” he told The Observer. “With this show, Kate and Michael are deaf, yes, but they are so many other things, too, and I think that’s new.”","Ahn, who is also a Sundance veteran, told HuffPost that he took an interest in Feldman and Stern because of the pair’s willingness to “challenge and redefine the mainstream” through their work. The filmmaker won near-universal acclaim for his 2016 feature, “Spa Night,” about a closeted gay teen who experiences a sexual awakening amid the underground world of Korean spas.","“This Close,” he said, offered him a chance to follow up “Spa Night,” which won the prestigious John Cassavetes Award at the 2017 Independent Spirit Awards, with a project that explored “themes of identity and intersectionality” in a similar way.","“Shoshannah and Josh have created characters and a relationship that reveal our humanity, our connection to each other,” Ahn told HuffPost. “I felt an intense sense of community while making the show. Whether we’re deaf or hearing, gay or straight, man or woman or somewhere in between, we are connected.”","Like “Spa Night,” “This Close” has a distinctly queer element, too. Michael is revealed as gay in the first episode, and over the course of the season, he struggles to recover from a devastating breakup with his fiancé, Ryan (Colt Prattes), through drugs, alcohol and casual sex.","On the flip side, Michael’s relationship with Kate seems deeper and more affectionate than the one she has with her hapless fiancé, Danny (Zach Gilford) ― a testament to the enduring kinship many gay men enjoy with straight women.","Already, “This Close” has also provided some much-needed opportunity for other deaf artists, too. Both “America’s Next Top Model” heartthrob Nyle DeMarco and Marlee Matlin, who remains the only deaf performer in history to win an Oscar (for 1986′s “Children of a Lesser God”), appear in guest roles in later episodes.","Between “Spa Night” and “This Close,” Ahn said he definitely feels a responsibility to depict often-overlooked communities in his work and wishes other Hollywood players would follow suit.","“I really believe that the true impact of the show will reveal itself in all the films and television shows in inspires,” he said. “If I made something just for the money or entertainment, I think I would get bored.”","To that point, he’s confident that Feldman and Stern’s influence will resound beyond the show’s first season.","“It takes artists like Josh and Shoshannah to take the initiative and tell their stories,” he said. “I know they will inspire others.”","Catch the trailer for the series below."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a9473792000003800eb0053.jpeg?cache=Hl5ef5LCgq&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Jimmy Fallon Makes Emotional Pledge To Join Student-Led March For Gun Control","authors":"Lee Moran","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jimmy-fallon-parkland-students-march_us_5a950c7ce4b0699553cbdb75","short_description":"\"This is a real revolution.\"","date":"2018-02-27"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"GOP Education Bill Would Make College Even Less Affordable For Many, Experts Say","authors":"The Hechinger Report, Editorial Partner","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gop-education-bill-would-make-college-even-less-affordable_us_5a95b563e4b03afbcf9031a2","short_description":"By Delece Smith-Barrow, The Hechinger Report WASHINGTON — A bill proposed by Republicans in the House of Representatives","date":"2018-02-27"},"articleContent":["By Delece Smith-Barrow, The Hechinger Report","WASHINGTON — A bill proposed by Republicans in the House of Representatives could change the college-financing system dramatically, moving billions of dollars out of financial aid programs.","If H.R. 4508, becomes law, college affordability would go from bad to worse, say many higher education experts, and students from low-income backgrounds would suffer most.","According to an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the net loss of funds to students over the next 10 years would be almost $15 billion if the bill is enacted as written. Other analysts say that figure would be even higher.","The bill, known as the Promoting Real Opportunity, Success, and Prosperity through Education Reform (PROSPER) Act, would also make more money and regulatory flexibility available to for-profit colleges, many of which have been cited for high costs, low graduation rates and a history of taking advantage of low-income students and military veterans.","“If enacted, it would decimate the loan repayment safety net for low-income borrowers,” said Ben Miller, senior director for postsecondary education at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank. “It would expose students to unscrupulous actors, especially in the for-profit space. And it would do nothing to actually address the real problems we have around completion and equity.”","The Higher Education Act, first passed in 1965 and revised perodically, regulates how the federal government financially assists postsecondary institutions and students. It governs how federal student loans are distributed, who is eligible for federal financial aid, how loans must be repaid and which institutions can receive federal money. The PROSPER bill was moved out of committee by House Republicans in December. The Senate is holding hearings to develop its own version.","With the national student debt hovering around $1.3 trillion, lawmakers, parents and students have been crying out for a fix to the higher education lending system.","But many see the new bill’s proposed fixes as harmful to those who most need the boost toward the middle class that comes with a college education. For some, it would make college less affordable altogether; for others, it would add to the debt burden they would carry after college.","To meet its stated goal of simplifying the many federal grant and loan programs, the House bill proposes streamlining application processes, which could help students and their families, but also eliminating several of those programs.","Among the proposed cuts are grant programs, including Teacher Education Assistance grants (for those who agree to teach, after college, for four years in a public school serving low-income families) and Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (additional grant money for qualified undergraduate students from the lowest income levels).","The bill would also eliminate some loan programs — including a key loan program for graduate students — and some beneficial repayment options. These include the option for some low-income students to extend their repayment plans (without extra interest) and a program that forgives loans after 10 years of repayment for those working in government or nonprofit public-service jobs.","For-profit institutions, conversely, would benefit from the proposed bill because it would eliminate the 90-10 rule, which currently prevents these institutions from receiving more than 90 percent of their revenue through federal financial aid. The rule pushes schools to create programs that enable students to be successful after graduation, because some revenie is coming directly from students or employers. Before the 90-10 rule was instituted, for-profit-colleges often enrolled low-income students who had little prospect of earning a degree, obtained those students’ federal grant and loan money, and suffered no consequences when the students dropped out or received a substandard education.","“A for-profit college could be a hundred percent federally funded,” if the PROSPER Act becomes law, Miller said.","The bill would also narrow the eligibility requirements for deferment of loans and require those in certain types of payment plans to pay more than previously expected. For example, the percent of what’s defined as discretionary income that borrowers must pay under an income-driven repayment plan would increase from 10 to 15 percent. And the bill would require even full-time students from low-income backgrounds to pay interest on their federal loans while they are pursuing their degrees. Currently, students are not responsible for any interest while they are in school.","“Undergrad students with low expected family contributions should not have to accrue interest while in school,” said Jean McDonald Rash, chair of the Higher Education Loan Coalition, a group of financial aid professionals who work to improve federal loan programs. She said the group has many concerns about the bill in its current form.","For example, as noted, the new bill proposes ending the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, which benefits students who go into nonprofit fields or government work and are not likely to earn large incomes.","“We think that’s very important to attract students into those kinds of fields of study,” said McDonald Rash, who’s also a director of financial aid at Rutgers University.","Some believe that with fewer options from the government to pay for school, students and educators would have to think more carefully about how to finance the cost of a degree. Currently, schools don’t have an incentive to lower their prices because students can use government aid to foot the bill, said Mary Clare Amselem, an education policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a right-leaning think tank.","“Overwhelming economic evidence is suggesting that heavily subsidizing federal student loans has led to college tuition increases,” Amselem said. Schools “know that pretty much regardless of what they charge, students are going to be able to find the loans from the federal government.”","Amselem also believes the new bill would push students to borrow from private lenders, which she says is a good thing. “The federal government controls 90 percent of the student loan market, so they’ve virtually crowded out private lenders,” she said. “I think if we had more options for students, we would have a very robust, very competitive market that would offer really great options for students.”","Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., chairwoman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, introduced the new bill in December. It was voted out of committee on straight partisan lines and sent for debate in the full House.","“Our proposals offer the same deal for everyone, regardless of occupation, and put downward market pressure on institutions to keep costs down,” Rep. Foxx said in an emailed statement. “Additionally, the PROSPER Act puts additional funding behind the time-tested cornerstone of financial aid for low-income students: the Pell grant.”","Pell grants are awarded to students most in need; to qualify, family income must usually be below $50,000 a year. The maximum grant for the 2018-19 school year is $5,920. Under the proposed new bill, Pell recipients would receive an additional $300 if they’re taking at least 15 academic credits per semester, a provision designed to encourage people to finish college as quickly as possible.","The Education Trust and 34 other organizations — including the NAACP and the National Association for College Admission Counseling — wrote a letter to several members of Congress in which they said the proposed act “exacerbates the increasing burden of student debt and continued inequity in higher education access and outcomes. It would make higher education less affordable, saddle students with greater debt, and push more students into loan default.”","While a bill this vast — nearly 600 pages — has a number of pros and cons, many say it’s not an even split.","“There’s a couple things here and there that aren’t bad for low-income students,” Miller said, “but they are far outweighed by the litany of items that would hurt them.”","Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, has said he hopes to see a bipartisan version by early spring that can be recommended to the full Senate.","This story was produced by The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education.

Conservatives specifically support adding stricter work requirements for people to receive SNAP benefits, and the traditional place for that debate would be as part of the five-year reauthorization of the farm bill, which expires in October. But reading the mood of their fellow Republicans in this election year, conservatives now seem to be pushing for a tactical retreat.","“They better not do a long-term reauthorization,” Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) told HuffPost on Tuesday. “Only way I’d be for a long-term reauthorization is if we actually addressed the food stamp issue and do welfare reform.”","Jordan said he supported a five-year reauthorization of nutrition and farm programs in the unlikely event the bill included his priorities. “But you know the lay of the land. And so there better not be a long-term reauthorization unless we deal with that,” Jordan said, referring to stricter work requirements.","“In lieu of doing what we need to do,” Jordan continued, a one-year extension of existing programs would be “much better.”","Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, told HuffPost that “any momentum for a new bill is weak,” also suggesting that a short-term extension of nutrition and farm programs might be the way to go.","Part of the problem for conservatives is that they know Democratic votes will be necessary to pass a farm bill ― at least in the Senate ― and they think many of their fellow Republicans won’t go along with a plan that puts tighter restrictions on SNAP beneficiaries in an election year.","A prominent conservative aide noted that without the advantage of a fast-track budget process ― in which Republicans could pass a work requirement bill with a simple majority in the Senate, like they did for tax reform ― and with the intra-party disagreements over both food stamps and agriculture subsidies, the farm bill “becomes a needlessly divisive process for House Republicans this year.”","But on the other side of the GOP conference, some Republicans who oppose more SNAP cuts sense that passing a five-year reauthorization this year is their best shot at preventing things like SNAP work requirements for able-bodied adults with young children.","“To pass a farm bill, we need a bipartisan coalition,” Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.), chairman of the moderate Tuesday Group, told HuffPost on Tuesday. “We’ll need that now, and we’ll need that a year from now.”","Conservatives have been holding out hope that Republicans would use the budget reconciliation process to enact additional SNAP work requirements.","“If budget reconciliation was perceived as an option,” the senior conservative aide told HuffPost, “leadership could dump any welfare reform ideas that they didn’t want to deal with during the farm bill into the budget.”","Since there’s apparently no plan to do a budget, however, there’s no shot of using the special reconciliation process. And without any other realistic way to enact the changes conservatives want, the farm bill becomes the only vehicle to push for those changes, meaning they won’t want to give up any of their leverage there.","When HuffPost raised the idea with Dent ― that conservatives were holding out hope to pass SNAP work requirements through reconciliation, but didn’t want to give up leverage on the farm bill just yet ― he suggested the argument was irrelevant.","“The farm bill’s expiring,” Dent said. “We should deal with it now because that’s our job, not kick the can in hopes of getting some other policy that we can’t get today.”","The House Agriculture Committee is moving ahead with at least a markup of the farm bill. Chairman Mike Conaway (R-Texas) told HuffPost on Tuesday that he intends to finish the reauthorization this year. Asked about a one-year extension, Conaway said that was “not something I’m considering.”","In fact, the Agriculture Committee plans to unveil a draft of the farm bill next month, and the panel actually met Tuesday morning to discuss it.","“We hope to be able to convince at least 217 of my good friends to support the legislation,” Conaway said.","The congressman, who has in years past resisted cuts to SNAP, does seem more open to ideas like additional work requirements ― a fact that Meadows noted when he praised Conaway as a “great advocate for the ag community.” But even if Conaway did go along with what conservatives want on work requirements, there’s a good chance the Senate wouldn’t.","Spokespeople for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) said they expect the Senate to vote on its version of a farm bill later this year. With 60 votes needed to pass a farm bill in that chamber, Democrats there have significant sway over changes to SNAP.","Back in the House, the Freedom Caucus has some say over what comes out of the chamber, but they don’t control what gets a vote. By pushing for a low-drama extension, conservatives are hoping to persuade House leaders to kick this can down the road rather than getting into a potentially messy fight.","Spokespeople for House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) did not immediately respond when HuffPost asked if they were committed to giving Conaway’s farm bill a floor vote this year.","SNAP is one of the biggest safety net programs in the U.S., with more than 42 million beneficiaries. The program provides a monthly stipend averaging $125 per recipient that can be redeemed in grocery stores for most food products.","Federal law already prohibits more than three months of SNAP benefits for unemployed able-bodied adults without dependents, but states are allowed to waive the time limit in areas with high unemployment. Republicans agree on making it more difficult for states to obtain such waivers, even though childless adults without disabilities represented only about 8 percent of SNAP beneficiaries in 2016. But Jordan has also proposed expanding the work requirement so that it applies to some parents as well.","The proposed changes, the exact text of which Democrats on the House Agriculture Committee have not been shown, already have SNAP advocates worried. Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) is concerned that how Republicans have gone about preparing for the farm bill markup shows that many people will, in fact, get kicked off food stamps — even if the changes are less aggressive than what Jordan wants.","“The way this is playing out right now you are paving the way for a more partisan bill,” McGovern said."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a958d051e000017087acf60.jpeg?cache=wDr06B38sJ&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"SPORTS","headline":"Olympic Doping Whistleblower Fights Back Against Russian-Backed Lawsuit","authors":"Michael Isikoff, Yahoo News","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/olympics-doping-whistleblower-fights-russia-backed-lawsuit_us_5a95b655e4b0e6a52301fd6e","short_description":"The strange case of Grigory Rodchenkov, who blew the whistle on Russia's Olympic doping operation and fled to the U.S., takes another turn.","date":"2018-02-27"},"articleContent":["The whistleblower who exposed Russia’s Olympic doping scandal is firing back at a powerful oligarch who is financing a lawsuit against him in the United States, demanding that the businessman preserve documents that he believes may show Russian President Vladimir Putin’s government is secretly behind the litigation.","And in a letter addressed to Mikhail Prokhorov, the billionaire businessman who is also the owner of the Brooklyn Nets basketball team, the lawyer for whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov threatens a countersuit aimed at exposing the Russian government’s efforts to harass and intimidate his client in the United States.","The letter by lawyer Jim Walden, a copy of which was provided to Yahoo News, adds to the intrigue surrounding a lawsuit that was filed against Rodchenkov last week in a New York state court by three Russian biathletes who were stripped of their 2014 Olympic medals as a result of the whistleblower’s allegations about Russian doping. The lawsuit accuses Rodchenkov, the former director of Russia’s antidoping laboratory, of defaming the biathletes and “destroying their careers.”","Letter To Mikhail Prokhorov","Scott Balber, the New York lawyer for the Russian athletes, has acknowledged that Prokhorov is helping to finance the lawsuit along with unnamed others. “I am not at liberty to identify anyone else other than Mr. Prokhorov,” Balber said in an email Monday, when asked who else was bankrolling the lawsuit.","Balber once represented Donald Trump in a $5 million lawsuit — filed in 2013 and later withdrawn — against comedian Bill Maher for likening Trump’s hair to an orangutan’s. He currently represents another Russian oligarch, Aras Agalarov, and his son Emin Agalarov — two key figures in the Trump-Russia investigation who helped arrange the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Russian operatives at which Trump campaign officials were promised derogatory information about Hillary Clinton.","“Mr. Balber’s admission that unnamed ‘others’ are also financing this lawsuit is strange — raising the specter that the Kremlin itself might be acting through proxies here,” Walden said in a statement to Yahoo News. “Certainly, this could be problematic for all involved in this shady suit.”","In his letter to Prokhorov, Walden asks that all documents relating to the litigation be preserved, including any communications between the Brooklyn Nets owner and “any current or former Russian government officials, Russian law enforcement officers, officers or agents of the FSB [Russia’s domestic intelligence service] or representatives of the Russian Olympic Committee.”","Asked for comment, Balber called Walden’s letter “a publicity stunt” and said, “As far as I know, there is absolutely no Russian government role in the filing of the lawsuit. This appears to be complete fiction.” He added: “The sole purpose of this lawsuit is to clear the names of three hard-working, world-class Olympic athletes, and to obtain compensation for the economic loss they have suffered as a result of Mr. Rodchenkov’s false and defamatory statements.”","The legal sparring is the latest development in a complicated political and sporting saga that has been playing out since Rodchenkov fled Russia and went public with his account in 2016, describing what he portrayed as a vast and sophisticated scheme by Russia to provide banned drugs to the country’s athletes to boost their performance in the Olympic Games and other international sporting competitions — and to cheat the systems meant to catch them.","In numerous interviews and in the widely acclaimed Netflix documentary “Icarus,” Rodchenkov described how he worked with the FSB, the Russian spy agency formerly headed by Putin, and with Russia’s sports ministry to oversee a system in which sealed urine samples of athletes were routinely swapped after testing, allowing athletes to take banned substances to avoid detection. After the Sochi Olympics, Rodchenkov was awarded a prestigious Order of Friendship medal by Putin.","The allegations by Rodchenkov were confirmed by international investigators and led to the International Olympic Committee’s decision to bar Russia from sending a delegation to this year’s Winter Olympics in South Korea, although Russian athletes were allowed to participate as individuals. That decision was reaffirmed just this week by the Olympic Committee, which refused to let Russian athletes march under their own flag in the closing ceremony at the South Korea Olympics.","Since fleeing to the United States, Rodchenkov, now in the federal witness protection program, has provided key evidence to international investigators and Justice Department officials about potential violations of federal law by the Russians. In doing so, he has become virtually public enemy No. 1 to Putin’s government: Prosecutors in Russia have filed criminal charges against him, accusing him of drug trafficking, and Putin during his end of the year press conference last December suggested that Rodchenkov was being drugged and manipulated by U.S. intelligence agencies.","“What are [U.S. intelligence agencies] doing with him there?” Putin said at the December press conference. “Are they giving him some kind of substances so that he says what’s required?”","Shortly after Putin’s comments, Walden said he was warned by U.S. officials that Russian agents may be looking for Rodchenkov in the United States. Walden, a former federal prosecutor, said he is concerned that the lawsuit is in fact in furtherance of that effort — an attempt “to find him through judicial means.”","Read more from Yahoo News:","House Democrats seek 20 to 30 more witnesses in Russia probe, but GOP resists\n\nMeet the teen girl behind the National School Walkout movement: ‘We are motivated, passionate people’\n\nAuthor Eric Metaxas, evangelical intellectual, chose Trump, and he’s sticking with him","This story was originally published on Yahoo News."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a95cc1f1e000008087acfcd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"COMEDY","headline":"'Late Night' Writer's Winter Olympics Roundup Will Make You Say Whaaat?","authors":"Ron Dicker","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/amber-ruffin-winter-olympics_us_5a958927e4b0bef79e3064b8","short_description":"You didn't need to watch for two weeks.

Last week, he directed his administration to regulate bump stocks, the gun accessory used to simulate automatic fire in the 2017 Las Vegas attack.","Trump has even urged state governors not to be afraid of the National Rifle Association, the nation’s most powerful gun lobby, as they seek to address school safety ― a remarkable thing for a Republican president to say.","“Don’t worry about the NRA. They’re on our side,” Trump told a bipartisan gathering of governors on Monday during a White House meeting. “If they’re not with you, we have to fight them every once in a while. That’s OK. They’re doing what they think is right.”","It’s not hard to understand why Trump has tried to move to the middle on guns. Support for stricter gun laws has spiked to its highest level since 1993, according to a recent CNN poll, with 70 percent of Americans now saying they support more gun control. That’s up from the 52 percent who said they supported stricter gun laws in the wake of the Las Vegas massacre, where 58 people died. Trump’s approval rating, meanwhile, has slumped again to match the lowest of his presidency.","Yet Republicans in Congress, many of whom are facing competitive primaries ahead of the 2018 midterm elections, seem no more willing to tackle the issue of gun control. Without clear direction from the leader of their party, it’s unlikely they’ll do so in a substantial way this year.","“If President Trump weighs in ― and leans in ― we could see some reasonable changes on things like bump stocks and age restrictions. If not, the status quo will largely remain,” said Doug Heye, a veteran Republican operative and former Republican National Committee communications director.","Trump’s tactics on guns so far have mirrored his handling of the immigration debate. Early in conversations with lawmakers over the legal status of young undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children, the president expressed a desire to pursue comprehensive immigration reform and even said he’d be willing to “take the heat” from his supporters if Congress decided to act. He also told lawmakers that he would sign any bill they sent him that would institutionalize President Barack Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, buoying activists’ hopes that Congress would reach a compromise.","Yet his vague promises and platitudes on immigration were quickly followed by intense lobbying from immigration hawks in the White House and the Department of Homeland Security against a bipartisan measure in the Senate that would have paired $25 billion for border security with a pathway to citizenship for nearly 2 million undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. Neither that bill nor other competing ones received enough votes to advance.","With more Republicans expressing skepticism this week about additional restrictions on guns, Trump seems to be heading toward a similar backtrack. The president, per CNN, appears to be softening his position on raising the age at which people can purchase AR-15 rifles, the weapon used in the Parkland massacre, and similar weapons. But a White House spokesperson insisted Tuesday that the president still supported the idea.","It’s also unclear what kind of bill toughening background checks Trump is willing to endorse. Democrats are calling for universal gun background checks, while Republicans support more modest efforts to beef up the national background check system. Trump is scheduled to meet with Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a top gun control advocate, to discuss the matter on Wednesday.","“We expect to have some specific policy proposals later this week,” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters on Tuesday.","Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) called on the Senate the same day to “immediately” pass a bill to strengthen background checks for gun purchases, which he co-sponsored with Murphy. The measure, called Fix NICS, would require states to produce an implementation plan focused on uploading all gun purchaser information to the federal background check system and penalize federal agencies if they failed to record that information.","Democratic senators support Cornyn’s bill but call it a “tiny” effort to curb gun violence. They would also like the Senate to consider more gun-related initiatives, such as an assault weapons ban, magazine restrictions and stricter background checks ― all ideas opposed by Republicans and the NRA.","“My sense is Republicans aren’t going to move here on serious gun legislation unless the president pre-endorses it, so what he says in the next few days and what he says tomorrow will be important,” Murphy said Tuesday.","Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) agreed that it would be helpful if Trump said what he preferred Congress to do on the issue of guns.","“The president said some things that were encouraging, that were common sense,” Graham said during a sit-down with reporters. “But whether he follows through with them ― I don’t know.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a95c4111f00005100168a1c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Supreme Court Curbs Rights Of Immigrants Awaiting Deportation","authors":"Lawrence Hurley, Reuters","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-immigrants-rights-deportation_us_5a95a008e4b036ab0142fda8","short_description":"The Supreme Court curbed the ability of immigrants held in long-term detention during deportation proceedings to argue for their release.","date":"2018-02-27"},"articleContent":["WASHINGTON, Feb 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday curbed the ability of immigrants held in long-term detention during deportation proceedings to argue for their release in a ruling in sync with President Donald Trump’s get-tough approach toward immigration.","The justices, in a 5-3 decision, overturned a lower court’s ruling that required that immigrants held by the U.S. government who are awaiting the outcome of deportation proceedings get a bond hearing after six months of detention to seek their release.","The court’s five conservatives were in the majority in the ruling written by Justice Samuel Alito, and three liberals dissented, including Justice Stephen Breyer, who sharply criticized the decision. Another liberal, Justice Elena Kagan, did not participate in the ruling.","The court threw out a 2015 decision by the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which had ruled that the government must provide bond hearings to gauge danger and flight risk when detention exceeds six months, and every six months after that. Former President Barack Obama’s Justice Department appealed that ruling.","Breyer, in a lengthy dissent, said that forbidding bail would likely violate the U.S. Constitution’s guarantee of due process under the law. Breyer said he doubted the U.S. Congress, in crafting the immigration provisions at issue in the case, would have wanted to put thousands of people at risk of lengthy confinement in the United States without any hope of bail.","“We need only recall the words of the Declaration of Independence, in particular its insistence that all men and women have ‘certain unalienable Rights,’ and that among them is the right to ‘Liberty,’” Breyer wrote.","Alito said that the immigration law provisions in question cannot be interpreted to limit the length of detention. He called Breyer’s view of the statutes “utterly implausible.”","Class action litigation brought by the American Civil Liberties Union challenged the U.S. government’s practice of placing immigrants facing deportation proceedings in detention for months or years without a chance to argue for release.","The case assumed added importance in light of the Trump administration’s decision to ramp up immigration enforcement, with growing numbers of people likely to end up in detention awaitingdeportation.","The government has argued that bond hearings can be permitted in certain instances, but opposed a blanket rule requiring them.","Those suing included immigrants who were held at the border when seeking illegal entry as well as others, including lawful permanent residents who hold so-called green cards, who have been convicted of crimes.","‘LEGAL FICTION’","In dissent, Breyer said that asylum seekers or non-citizens who arrive at the U.S. border still have due process rights.","“We cannot here engage in this legal fiction,” Breyer wrote.","“Whatever the fiction, would the Constitution leave the Government free to starve, beat, or lash those held within our boundaries? If not, then, whatever the fiction, how can the Constitution authorize the Government to imprison arbitrarily those who, whatever we might pretend, are in reality right here in the United States?”","Breyer added, “No one can claim, nor since the time of slavery has anyone to my knowledge successfully claimed, that persons held within the United States are totally without constitutional protection.”","The lead plaintiff is Alejandro Rodriguez, a legal immigrant from Mexico living in California who was brought to the United States as a baby. He was working as a dental assistant when he was detained for three years without a hearing after being placed in deportation proceedings based on two non-violent convictions, joyriding and misdemeanor drug possession.","Although Rodriguez was released eventually, the case brought on his behalf continued.","The justices issued the ruling on Tuesday after hearing the case for a second time. The Oct. 3 arguments came after they decided to rehear the case with a full complement of nine justices, with Trump’s conservative appointee Neil Gorsuch joining the court in April 2017, after earlier holding arguments while shorthanded by one.","The Trump administration took the same position in the case during the October arguments as the Obama administration had taken previously.","(Reporting by Lawrence Hurley; Editing by Will Dunham)"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a95a87b1f000051001689f0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Wisconsin's Top Election Official Resigns After GOP Votes To Oust Him","authors":"Sam Levine","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/michael-haas-wisconsin_us_5a95be3ae4b09c872bae8674","short_description":"The state's election commission and Senate disagreed over who had the right to remove the commission's administrator.","date":"2018-02-27"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Gun-Carrying GOP Lawmaker Calls For Assault Weapon Ban: 'Not One More School Shooting'","authors":"Hayley Miller","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/brian-mast-nra-assault-weapon-ban_us_5a956d6ae4b01f65f59a8b82","short_description":"Rep.

Hartung","Imagine for a moment a scheme in which American taxpayers were taken to the cleaners to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars and there was barely a hint of criticism or outrage. Imagine as well that the White House and a majority of the politicians in Washington, no matter the party, acquiesced in the arrangement. In fact, the annual quest to boost Pentagon spending into the stratosphere regularly follows that very scenario, assisted by predictions of imminent doom from industry-funded hawks with a vested interest in increased military outlays.","Most Americans are probably aware that the Pentagon spends a lot of money, but it’s unlikely they grasp just how huge those sums really are. All too often, astonishingly lavish military budgets are treated as if they were part of the natural order, like death or taxes.","The figures contained in the recent budget deal that kept Congress open, as well as in President Trump’s budget proposal for 2019, are a case in point: $700 billion for the Pentagon and related programs in 2018 and $716 billion the following year. Remarkably, such numbers far exceeded even the Pentagon’s own expansive expectations. According to Donald Trump, admittedly not the most reliable source in all cases, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis reportedly said, “Wow, I can’t believe we got everything we wanted” ― a rare admission from the head of an organization whose only response to virtually any budget proposal is to ask for more.","The public reaction to such staggering Pentagon budget hikes was muted, to put it mildly. Unlike last year’s tax giveaway to the rich, throwing near-record amounts of tax dollars at the Department of Defense generated no visible public outrage. Yet those tax cuts and Pentagon increases are closely related. The Trump administration’s pairing of the two mimics the failed approach of President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s ― only more so. It’s a phenomenon I’ve termed “Reaganomics on steroids.” Reagan’s approach yielded oceans of red ink and a severe weakening of the social safety net. It also provoked such a strong pushback that he later backtracked by raising taxes and set the stage for sharp reductions in nuclear weapons.","Donald Trump’s retrograde policies on immigration, women’s rights, racial justice, LGBT rights, and economic inequality have spawned an impressive and growing resistance. It remains to be seen whether his generous treatment of the Pentagon at the expense of basic human needs will spur a similar backlash.","Of course, it’s hard to even get a bead on what’s being lavished on the Pentagon when much of the media coverage failed to drive home just how enormous these sums actually are. A rare exception was an Associated Press story headlined “Congress, Trump Give the Pentagon a Budget the Likes of Which It Has Never Seen.” This was certainly far closer to the truth than claims like that of Mackenzie Eaglen of the conservative American Enterprise Institute, which over the years has housed such uber-hawks as Dick Cheney and John Bolton. She described the new budget as a “modest year-on-year increase.” If that’s the case, one shudders to think what an immodest increase might look like.","The Pentagon Wins Big","So let’s look at the money.","Though the Pentagon’s budget was already through the roof, it will get an extra $165 billion over the next two years, thanks to the congressional budget deal reached earlier this month. To put that figure in context, it was tens of billions of dollars more than Donald Trump had asked for last spring to “rebuild” the U.S. military (as he put it). It even exceeded the figures, already higher than Trump’s, Congress had agreed to last December. It brings total spending on the Pentagon and related programs for nuclear weapons to levels higher than those reached during the Korean and Vietnam wars in the 1950s and 1960s, or even at the height of Ronald Reagan’s vaunted military buildup of the 1980s. Only in two years of Barack Obama’s presidency, when there were roughly 150,000 U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, or about seven times current levels of personnel deployed there, was spending higher.","Ben Freeman of the Center for International Policy put the new Pentagon budget numbers in perspective when he pointed out that just the approximately $80 billion annual increase in the department’s top line between 2017 and 2019 will be double the current budget of the State Department; higher than the gross domestic products of more than 100 countries; and larger than the entire military budget of any country in the world, except China’s.","Democrats signed on to that congressional budget as part of a deal to blunt some of the most egregious Trump administration cuts proposed last spring. The administration, for example, kept the State Department’s budget from being radically slashed and it reauthorized the imperiled Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) for another 10 years. In the process, however, the Democrats also threw millions of young immigrants under the bus by dropping an insistence that any new budget protect the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or “Dreamers,” program. Meanwhile, the majority of Republican fiscal conservatives were thrilled to sign off on a Pentagon increase that, combined with the Trump tax cut for the rich, funds ballooning deficits as far as the eye can see ― a total of $7.7 trillion worth of them over the next decade.","While domestic spending fared better in the recent congressional budget deal than it would have if Trump’s draconian plan for 2018 had been enacted, it still lags far behind what Congress is investing in the Pentagon. And calculations by the National Priorities Project indicate that the Department of Defense is slated to be an even bigger winner in Trump’s 2019 budget blueprint. Its share of the discretionary budget, which includes virtually everything the government does other than programs like Medicare and Social Security, will mushroom to a once-unimaginable 61 cents on the dollar, a hefty boost from the already startling 54 cents on the dollar in the final year of the Obama administration.","The skewed priorities in Trump’s latest budget proposal are fueled in part by the administration’s decision to embrace the Pentagon increases Congress agreed to last month, while tossing that body’s latest decisions on non-military spending out the window. Although Congress is likely to rein in the administration’s most extreme proposals, the figures are stark indeed ― a proposed cut of $120 billion in the domestic spending levels both parties agreed to. The biggest reductions include a 41% cut in funding for diplomacy and foreign aid; a 36% cut in funding for energy and the environment; and a 35% cut in housing and community development. And that’s just the beginning. The Trump administration is also preparing to launch full-scale assaults on food stamps, Medicaid, and Medicare. It’s war on everything except the U.S. military.","Corporate Welfare","The recent budget plans have brought joy to the hearts of one group of needy Americans: the top executives of major weapons contractors like Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, and General Dynamics. They expect a bonanza from the skyrocketing Pentagon expenditures. Don’t be surprised if the CEOs of these five firms give themselves nice salary boosts, something to truly justify their work, rather than the paltry $96 million they drew as a group in 2016 (the most recent year for which full statistics are available).","And keep in mind that, like all other U.S.-based corporations, those military-industrial behemoths will benefit richly from the Trump administration’s slashing of the corporate tax rate. According to one respected industry analyst, a good portion of this windfall will go towards bonuses and increased dividends for company shareholders rather than investments in new and better ways to defend the United States. In short, in the Trump era, Lockheed Martin and its cohorts are guaranteed to make money coming and going.","Items that snagged billions in new funding in Trump’s proposed 2019 budget included Lockheed Martin’s overpriced, underperforming F-35 aircraft, at $10.6 billion; Boeing’s F-18 “Super Hornet,” which was in the process of being phased out by the Obama administration but is now written in for $2.4 billion; Northrop Grumman’s B-21 nuclear bomber at $2.3 billion; General Dynamics’ Ohio-class ballistic missile submarine at $3.9 billion; and $12 billion for an array of missile-defense programs that will redound to the benefit of... you guessed it: Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, and Boeing, among other companies. These are just a few of the dozens of weapons programs that will be feeding the bottom lines of such companies in the next two years and beyond. For programs still in their early stages, like that new bomber and the new ballistic missile submarine, their banner budgetary years are yet to come.","In explaining the flood of funding that enables a company like Lockheed Martin to reap $35 billion per year in government dollars, defense analyst Richard Aboulafia of the Teal Group noted that “diplomacy is out; air strikes are in... In this sort of environment, it’s tough to keep a lid on costs. If demand goes up, prices don’t generally come down. And, of course, it’s virtually impossible to kill stuff. You don’t have to make any kind of tough choices when there’s such a rising tide.”","Pentagon Pork Versus Human Security","Loren Thompson is a consultant to many of those weapons contractors. His think tank, the Lexington Institute, also gets contributions from the arms industry. He caught the spirit of the moment when he praised the administration’s puffed-up Pentagon proposal for using the Defense Department budget as a jobs creator in key states, including the crucial swing state of Ohio, which helped propel Donald Trump to victory in 2016. Thompson was particularly pleased with a plan to ramp up General Dynamics’s production of M-1 tanks in Lima, Ohio, in a factory whose production line the Army had tried to put on hold just a few years ago because it was already drowning in tanks and had no conceivable use for more of them.","Thompson argues that the new tanks are needed to keep up with Russia’s production of armored vehicles, a dubious assertion with a decidedly Cold War flavor to it. His claim is backed up, of course, by the administration’s new National Security Strategy, which targets Russia and China as the most formidable threats to the United States. Never mind that the likely challenges posed by these two powers ― cyberattacks in the Russian case and economic expansion in the Chinese one ― have nothing to do with how many tanks the U.S. Army possesses.","Trump wants to create jobs, jobs, jobs he can point to, and pumping up the military-industrial complex must seem like the path of least resistance to that end in present-day Washington. Under the circumstances, what does it matter that virtually any other form of spending would create more jobs and not saddle Americans with weaponry we don’t need?","If past performance offers any indication, none of the new money slated to pour into the Pentagon will make anyone safer. As Todd Harrison of the Center for Strategic and International Studies has noted, there is a danger that the Pentagon will just get “fatter not stronger” as its worst spending habits are reinforced by a new gusher of dollars that relieves its planners of making any reasonably hard choices at all.","The list of wasteful expenditures is already staggeringly long and early projections are that bureaucratic waste at the Pentagon will amount to $125 billion over the next five years. Among other things, the Defense Department already employs a shadow work force of more than 600,000 private contractors whose responsibilities overlap significantly with work already being done by government employees. Meanwhile, sloppy buying practices regularly result in stories like the recent ones on the Pentagon’s Defense Logistics Agency losing track of how it spent $800 million and how two American commands were unable to account for $500 million meant for the war on drugs in the Greater Middle East and Africa.","Add to this the $1.5 trillion slated to be spent on F-35s that the nonpartisan Project on Government Oversight has noted may never be ready for combat and the unnecessary “modernization” of the U.S. nuclear arsenal, including a new generation of nuclear-armed bombers, submarines, and missiles at a minimum cost of $1.2 trillion over the next three decades. In other words, a large part of the Pentagon’s new funding will do much to fuel good times in the military-industrial complex but little to help the troops or defend the country.","Most important of all, this flood of new funding, which could crush a generation of Americans under a mountain of debt, will make it easier to sustain the seemingly endless seven wars that the United States is fighting in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Syria, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, and Yemen. So call this one of the worst investments in history, ensuring as it does failed wars to the horizon.","It would be a welcome change in 21st Century America if the reckless decision to throw yet more unbelievable sums of money at a Pentagon already vastly overfunded sparked a serious discussion about America’s hyper-militarized foreign policy. A national debate about such matters in the run-up to the 2018 and 2020 elections could determine whether it continues to be business-as-usual at the Pentagon or whether the largest agency in the federal government is finally reined in and relegated to an appropriately defensive posture.","William D.

Politicization, according to the DCCC official, included talking about gun violence prevention policy.","“You and your candidate will be understandably outraged and upset, as will your community. However, DO NOT POLITICIZE IT TODAY,” DCCC regional press secretary Evan Lukaske wrote to candidates in the Northeast. “There will be time for politics and policy discussion, but any message today should be on offering thoughts/prayers for victims and their families, and thanking 1st responders who saved lives.”","The email, seen in its entirety below, reflects the careful balance that Democrats have tried to strike as they strive to advance modest gun safety regulations and shield candidates in swing districts from the political price that could accompany comments about guns.","But the cautious approach in Lukaske’s email is increasingly out of touch with what many party members, as well as gun violence prevention activists, would like to see from politicians ― especially in the wake of the recent deadly shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Many of the surviving Parkland students waited almost no time before beginning to agitate for different gun policies, sparking a movement that has captivated the country.","Gun violence prevention activists said they were disappointed the DCCC was advising candidates not to aggressively talk about policy solutions as often as possible. Ladd Everitt, director of the gun violence prevention group One Pulse for America, described the DCCC email as “pathetic.” Mark Glaze, senior adviser to the group Guns Down, said it was “straight out of the NRA’s talking points.”","“If the DCCC is willing to give up a key issue and offend virtually every Democrat so as not to bother eight Independents in rural Missouri, they’re even more incompetent than we thought, and Democrats should be very worried about the midterms,” Glaze said.","Several Democratic lawmakers have taken to mocking the traditional practice of sending gun violence victims “thoughts and prayers” without any follow-up of policy solutions.","Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who became a leading advocate of greater gun regulations after the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, wasted no time after the Las Vegas massacre calling for greater action to prevent gun violence.","“To my colleagues: your cowardice to act cannot be whitewashed by thoughts and prayers,” he tweeted a few hours after Lukaske’s email went out.","Asked about the email on Tuesday, Murphy emphasized that it was a message from “one staffer.”","Still, he added, “No Democrat should be worried about talking about policy changes in the wake of these mass shootings.”","Former Democratic Congresswoman Gabby Giffords and her husband, retired Navy Capt. Mark Kelly, “led by example” the day after the Las Vegas shooting by demanding congressional action on the steps of the U.S. Capitol the day after it occurred, noted Katie Peters, of the former congresswoman’s group Giffords: Courage to Fight Gun Violence. (Giffords became a more aggressive gun regulation advocate after being gravely wounded in a 2011 mass shooting.)","“Following the tragedy in Parkland, we’ve seen the students show incredible leadership in demanding more than thoughts and prayers from their elected officials,” Peters said.","Meredith Kelly, the DCCC’s communications director, emphasized that Lukaske’s message was intended to discourage hasty responses before all information about the shooting was known, rather than silence opinions about gun policy. It was also general advice that candidates were free to ignore.","“A communications staffer who fails to provide immediate and thoughtful guidance after a national tragedy, based on the best available information at the time, is not doing his job,” Kelly said.","The DCCC would not say whether it sent candidates similar guidance after the Parkland shooting. However, Kelly said the group, which is responsible for getting Democrats elected to the House, continues to caution candidates to consider their words carefully in the immediate aftermath of major national tragedies.","The revelation that the DCCC advised candidates to avoid “politicizing” the Las Vegas shooting occurs as the House campaign arm struggles to fend off progressive criticism of its electoral strategy, particularly through its involvement in primary elections.","Waleed Shahid is a spokesman for the left-leaning Justice Democrats, which backs a variety of candidates, including some the DCCC opposes. He called Lukaske’s email “a slap in the face to the movement” against gun violence.","“Politics is exactly how people come together to make change and hold those in power accountable,” he said.","This post has been updated with comment from Murphy.

But something about it bothered us even more than the loss of the younger Grimes (Chandler Riggs).","In the Season 8 midseason premiere on Sunday, Carl enjoyed a touching moment with his sister Judith (Chloe and Sophia Garcia-Frizzi), saying goodbye before his inevitable death from a zombie bite. He gave her his signature hat and told her that owning it was like having a part of their father with them at all times. Then he shared a few last words:","Before mom died, she told me that I was gonna beat this world.","Oh, God, we’re gonna start tearing up.","I didn’t.","No, please, Carl. Just stop.","But you will.","This is too much.","I know you will.","It’s an emotional moment from Carl.","Rick (Andrew Lincoln) was shook.","But Judith ... couldn’t really care less?","Nope. Judith grew up in the apocalypse and clearly doesn’t have time for this wishy-washy nonsense. Girl’s got ice in her veins.","So when it came time to cry, Judith just ... didn’t. Oh, it might have looked like she cried ― to a casual viewer. In fact, a lot of people tweeted praise for the moment.","But if you watched the scene closely, you could see that Judith was looking pretty content the whole time. That painfully obvious crying sound effect that you heard when she reached out her arm and conveniently covered her mouth ― yeah, that was production trickery.","And once you see the farce, you can’t unsee it.","Cut to seconds later, when Judith is turned away from the camera in Daryl’s (Norman Reedus) arms, continuing to look like she’s not crying at all.","I wasn’t buying the fake tears, and neither were many on Twitter.","Welcome to Baby-Gate.","Like many fans stated, the tears weren’t convincing. Also, the sound effect that production gave Judith was less a cry and more a painful squeal, like when Jonathan Taylor Thomas made the sound of a dying rabbit to attract bears in the 1997 movie “Wild America.”","For Judith to go from relatively chill to making guttural animal noises is about as believable as when that moose showed up and JTT ended up riding on its head.","So be careful, Carl. After that Judith cry, moose could be afoot.","To get to the bottom of Baby-Gate, I posed the question to Chandler Riggs himself. Since I saw the episode ahead of airtime, I asked the star during a conference call prior to the midseason premiere: “So, was Judith actually crying in that scene?”","Riggs, who was happy with how the scene turned out, told us, “They are babies, so they cry a lot no matter what,” referring to the young actors on set.","“I’m pretty sure what they ended up doing is just like editing in a part where [Chloe or Sophia Garcia-Frizzi] was actually just crying during the scene because she wanted her mom and parts where she wasn’t crying because she was content at the time.”","Perhaps the sound effect we heard was an actual recording of the child actor. Perhaps it was not. But this is not the face of someone who’s crying.","That’s the face of a stone-cold zombie killer who doesn’t have time for your B.S.","Ultimately, Judith is played by toddlers, so obviously producers had their hands tied. You’re not going to try to upset a child just to make them cry. Right? That’d be even more disturbing than some of the stuff that happens on “The Walking Dead,” a show where one character just ripped another’s guts out.","All we’re saying is, if Judith wasn’t feeling a cry in the scene, she wasn’t feeling a cry! Production should’ve just let her do her thing. After all, Daryl didn’t cry. He didn’t even hug Carl, which Riggs told us he didn’t mind because Daryl’s not “much of a hugger.”","Look, AMC, the sound effect wasn’t the best, but there’s no point in crying over spilt milk, or, in Judith’s case, over a dead Carl."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a9479c42000008806eb0058.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Ties At The Oscars: All You Need To Know","authors":"Leigh Blickley","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-happens-when-theres-a-tie-at-the-oscars_us_5a83328ee4b0cf06751f1ffc","short_description":"There have been six in Oscar history. Here's what they were, and how PricewaterhouseCoopers plans for the drama.","date":"2018-02-27"},"articleContent":["In 1969, something exciting happened at the Oscars.","After reading off the five nominees for Best Actress at the 41st Academy Awards, a look of utter shock swept across presenter Ingrid Bergman’s face as she opened the envelope. “It’s a tie,” she said to gasps from the audience. “The winners are Katharine Hepburn in ‘Lion in the Winter’ and Barbra Streisand...”","The rest of Bergman’s announcement was inaudible as the crowd erupted in applause for the “Funny Girl” star. Hepburn, who at that point had won two out of her 10 Best Actress Oscar nominations, wasn’t in attendance, so the spotlight shined solely on Streisand. Dressed in a sheer black sequin pantsuit with a Peter Pan collar and bow, the 27-year-old looked at her golden statue and uttered, “Hello, gorgeous!”","Yes, they’re highly unlikely, but ties have happened at Hollywood’s biggest awards ceremony. Counting the one in 1969, there have been six in Oscars history. The others:","2013 (85th Oscars) – Sound Editing: Paul N.J. Ottosson (“Zero Dark Thirty”) and Per Hallberg and Karen Baker Landers (“Skyfall”)\n\n1995 (67th Oscars) – Short Film (Live Action): Peter Capaldi and Ruth Kenley-Letts (“Franz Kafka’s It’s a Wonderful Life”) and Peggy Rajski and Randy Stone (“Trevor”)\n\n1987 (59th Oscars) – Documentary (Feature): Brigitte Berman (“Artie Shaw: Time Is All You’ve Got”) and Joseph Feury and Milton Justice (“Down And Out In America”)\n\n1950 (22nd Oscars) – Documentary (Short Subject): Richard De Rochemont and James L. Shute (“A Chance To Live”) and Chuck Jones and Edward Selzer (“So Much For So Little”)\n\n1932 (5th Oscars) – Actor: Fredric March (“Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde”) and Wallace Beery (“The Champ”)","How Ties Are Calculated And Confirmed","First off, another history lesson. It wasn’t always the case that a tie meant a dead-even vote. Initially, Academy rules stated that if a fellow contender came within three votes of the winner, both would receive the award. That’s what happened ahead of the 1932 ceremony, when March actually got one more vote than Beery.","By 1950, though, the rules had been changed to require an actual tie for more than one contender to get an Oscar.","Now, a voting primer.","The Academy has strict rules to determine which individuals or films can be nominated for an Oscar. In order to submit either for nomination, producers or distributors must sign and submit an Official Screen Credits (OSC) form in early December (The Oscars telecast is usually in late February or early March) proving their movies meet Academy criteria for consideration ― criteria like film-length and theatrical release information.","Once the eligible nominees have been determined, the Academy mails ballots to voting members that same month. Members are allowed to choose up to five potential nominees, ranked in order of preference, in categories that correspond to their distinct professions ― actors nominate actors, film editors nominate film editors, etc. When it comes to Best Picture, though, all voting members get to nominate a film. This year, the initial votes for Oscar nominations began rolling in (via mail and an online submission system) on Jan. 5, with a deadline of Jan. 12.","To determine the final list of nominees, accountants at PricewaterhouseCoopers use a preferential voting system ― they take the total number of nomination votes received for each particular category and divide it by the total possible nominees plus one to get a “magic number” threshold. For example, say there are 600 potential ballots for the Best Director category. Accountants would divide that number by six (since there are five possible nominees), and the “magic number” required to become an official nominee for Best Director would be 100 ballots. (Best Picture is the only category that can have up to 10 nominees.)","Then, following the nominations announcement in January, the actual awards voting begins. (Every Academy member can cast a vote for each category during finals voting.) According to a source close to the Academy, 23 out of the 24 Oscars categories are tabulated using a “winner-takes-all” system, meaning the person or movie with the most votes in each category wins ― period. If two or more nominees achieve this with the exact same number of votes, they all become winners.","“There could be a four-way tie if all [the nominees] received the same number of votes,” the source said. “That’s never happened ― it’s only ever been tied between two people or two films ― but yes, it could be a three-way tie or a four-way tie if that’s how the votes shook out.”","(For the record, as many categories contain five nominees, it could also be a five-way tie.)","The one category that will never end up in a tie is Best Picture, because the winner is determined using that previous preferential voting system, rather than winner-takes-all. This year, the 7,200 voting academy members will rank the nominated movies in order of preference, then accountants at PwC will sort the ballots based on members’ first-place choices, eliminating the film with the fewest No. 1 votes. As is practice, votes for eliminated films will go to the second-ranked movie on each of the respective ballots. And this process continues ― at each stage, the movie with the fewest No. 1s gets eliminated, and its votes are redistributed to the ballots’ next choices — until one film has at least 50 percent plus one of the entire vote.","“Basically, it ensures that the winning film has the most support of the Academy that’s possible,” the source told HuffPost. “So it’s actually the most democratic way of tabulating the votes.”","As the source noted, “the Academy itself doesn’t touch the ballots at all” during the voting process. Instead, accountants at PwC count every ballot “by hand.” If a tie does occur, those PwC accountants would conduct multiple recounts to confirm the draw.","A rep for PwC did not respond to a request for comment.","So What Happens At The Ceremony?","Once the ballots are counted (and recounted) and the envelopes are sealed, only three people in the world know in advance who the winners are ― or whether a tie has occurred ― the selected PwC accountants.","After last year’s Best Picture debacle ― when Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway received Emma Stone’s Best Actress envelope by mistake and announced “La La Land” as the Best Picture winner instead of the actual victor, “Moonlight” ― the Academy and PwC decided to appoint an additional accountant, on top of the two who remain side-stage, to sit in the production booth during the show.","“There will be the two on the side stages, as they always are, and they will each have their own set of envelopes and continue that practice,” the Academy source said. “Then a third balloting partner will be with the director in the truck to help if there is an issue ― solve it quicker, if that makes sense. As the Academy CEO [Dawn Hudson] said in one of her statements, we don’t anticipate [a mistake] happening again in another 90 years. It’s pretty buttoned up at this point.”","A tie isn’t necessarily an issue for the winners ― if anything, it’s just a nice surprise. But for a presenter, things could get confusing, which is why the Academy also added more “worst-case scenario” rehearsal time to their new protocol.","“It’s impossible to know what to do in that situation, but they do prep presenters in advance that ties are a possibility,” the source said. “It’s very clear on the card that it’s a tie and what to say and what to do.”","Mark Wahlberg, who announced the Sound Editing tie in 2013, was definitely taken by surprise. “No B.S., we have a tie,” he said as the crowd erupted in whispers.","“When I heard it was a tie, my mind kind of went, ‘Can this happen? What are they going to say? Does nobody go up to get the award? Do we have to have a recount?’” Karen Baker Landers told HuffPost. She, along with business partner Per Hallberg, tied with Paul N.J. Ottosson for the Sound Editing award that year.","“The air kind of got sucked out of the room, and you could hear murmuring. Looking back, it was awesome to be a part of that but at the time it was very confusing,” Landers said.","“The whole idea that you actually had two movies tying with thousands of votes is pretty cool,” Hallberg said.","Landers and Hallberg were honored to become a part of Oscars history in more ways than one, but they know that if a tie occurs in an acting category this year, it would be a much bigger deal.","“They would have more fun with it,” Landers said. “Maybe both the winners come out onstage together? It was very straight the way that we did it with them. Paul came up, walked off. We came up, walked off. I’m thinking, ‘Did I mention it was a tie? Did we have fun with that at all?’ I don’t think we did.”","Hallberg added, “It’s a night for the Academy to honor their own membership, but then at the same time it is a TV show and I’m sure they’d do something quite different with it if [a tie involved] actors. That would be more along the line of entertainment, right? That’s the reality of it.”","The awards season race has been pretty predictable so far this year, with Gary Oldman (“Darkest Hour”) and Frances McDormand (“Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri”) taking home most of the leading actor statues, while Sam Rockwell (“Three Billboards”) and Allison Janney (“I, Tonya”) have earned consistent accolades for their supporting roles.","But just in case 1969 repeats itself, here are all the nominees in the acting categories:","Best Actress","Sally Hawkins, “The Shape of Water”\nFrances McDormand, “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri”\nMargot Robbie, “I, Tonya”\nSaoirse Ronan, “Lady Bird”\nMeryl Streep, “The Post”","Best Actor","Timothée Chalamet, “Call Me by Your Name”\nDaniel Day-Lewis, “Phantom Thread”\nDaniel Kaluuya, “Get Out”\nGary Oldman, “Darkest Hour”\nDenzel Washington, “Roman J.

For more, read our story about the meeting.","James Bennet: So the op-ed page was created to do a bunch of different things. But it was partly because this other paper was going out of business, and the feeling — in this very New York-centric moment, The New York Times obviously was an entirely print-centric world — was, there’s nobody to keep us honest anymore. You know, we’ll take our positions and there’s nobody arguing the other side. And so the Times very deliberately went out to create a space in our own universe where there would be people taking the other side and where we would, again, be able to cover — and you can see this in the initial statement for the op-ed page — we engage with the culture, engage with a wide range of subjects. And that’s remained the goal of the page and the ecology of the opinion report over time. But what you’ve seen is the kind of regression to the mean, I think, that takes place. And in many ways we became more and more homogenous as the years went by. I mean, all the work was excellent. But I think a degree of sameness set in and to the point where it now — to grievously overstate the case, the idea of debate is, you have one guy for the Brookings Institution and one guy from the Council of Foreign Relations arguing in the page.","And we’ve conducted a number of — there have been a number of really important innovations in recent years, and I point to Op-Docs as really a central one. We can talk about that if you guys are interested. But in a lot of ways the world of opinion journalism has been, as you all know, undergoing a revolution over the course of the last 10 or 15 years. The Times hasn’t fully participated in it. So, what we’re trying to do now, and the sort of project we’re engaged in, is essentially to try — you can think of it as trying to diversify ourselves in four dimensions at the same time, or along four axes.","The first is our team itself. So again, the columnists are the most visible representation of this. Each of them are excellent in their own ways and are fantastic as an array. They don’t necessarily represent our aspirations for our audience, let alone our ambition to capture the full range of — one can never capture the full range — but a wider range of the debate that’s out there. This is true of the department as a whole, and we are working towards diversifying our team.","We’re trying to diversify the ways we tell stories, and that’s about breaking out of the boxes that really still constrain us in the print paper, and the notion that what we do is editorials of 500 words and columns of 800 words and op-eds of maybe 900 words. It’s hard to overstate the degree to which that framework constrains us still ― although we’re beginning to push past it and think about other ways of opinionizing against the news. Longer, more deeply reported pieces, incorporating or leading with graphics and visual forms of opinion. And we’ve created a small video unit that’s doing, now, opinion journalism for us, led by Adam Ellick. So that’s story form, second category.","Third category is subject matter — another way that we’ve kind of regressed to a mean, I think. Our default game in opinion is politics and global affairs. And that tends to dominate what we do. We’re going to be putting a much more deliberate focus on subject area and kind of diversifying our range of opinion to more deliberately engage with the world of technology, business and economics, and the culture. We can talk more about that if you want.","And then the last component for it is ideological range, where I think both on the editorial line and our columnists and a lot of our op-eds were conducting a debate that was often between the 40-yard lines. And this was evident in the last campaign, where — the last presidential campaign, now I am talking about politics again — where, you know, there wasn’t really an advocate for the Bernie Sanders view of the world formally in our pages. And we’ve had fewer voices to the right for quite some time. Now, of all of this work, it’s that last thing I mentioned that’s getting the most attention and the most concern, and the most blowback. But what I’m trying to explain is, it is one element in everything we’re trying to do.","We’ve gotten a couple more — and I’m very grateful for — some investment in the company for a few more slots that’s helping us do this work. But it’s a fairly ambitious reset of the entire operation largely within our existing footprint, and it’s really hard on our people. I mean, you’re going through a lot of turbulence right now. And Tyson can testify to that.","I think on the other side of that is a lot of excitement and fun and a real adventure as we kind of get people sorted and get a clear understanding of everything we’re up to, what the ambitions are, and can begin experimenting in a big way. But right now we’re in the thick of it.","Sorry, I talked a lot longer than I meant to. That’s the overall — did I leave anything out?","NYT employee: Can I ask you a question? Can you talk about some of the things that you’re really most proud of, or some of the biggest things you feel like you’ve been able to do since you’ve been here? Even if maybe they’re the most challenging at the same time.","Bennet: I wouldn’t say there’s anything I’m particularly proud of. I’m really grateful for the way that my colleagues have kind of risen to the occasion here. I mean, again, it’s been hard, because everybody’s job is changing, and our people just all lost their offices. I mean, talk about a first-class problem, but it is a problem. If you’re a columnist at The New York Times, part of what goes with that is you have an office. And one day, you get it taken away — and editorial board members, too. We still have members of the editorial board who lament the offices that we had on 43rd Street, which were sort of, I don’t know, baronial — fires in the [inaudible] and dogs on the floor, and somebody — anyway.","I think there’s some work we’ve been doing lately, there’s been some pieces — our graphics team is super strong. It’s two people, basically, right now. But I can point you to some examples of specific pieces, like the big piece about the opening up of this last Alaskan wilderness that we were able to do in a really — we just didn’t have the ability to tell a story that way just a few months ago. And it was really dynamic and powerful. And we’re doing more of that kind of work more regularly. I’m super happy with the work that Michelle Goldberg is doing. She’s a columnist for us, and Lindy West, who’s another new — she’s a weekly voice that we’ve added.","And when I imagine a counterfactual, which is, again, I don’t know if you guys have had time to read any of this stuff, I know we’re all super busy. But we’ve got a bunch more very strong — going through this Harvey Weinstein moment without them, we would have done some really good work, but when I try to imagine what that would have been like, it feels like our report would have been really impoverished. So in a way, both these things are sort of proof of concept to me of how much more exciting it’s going to be when we represent a wider range. I feel the same way about Bret’s work for us. I know that there was a lot of — and I experienced it — a lot of criticism and concern about him. And you guys may disagree or there may be people who do, but I just think he’s an exceptional writer and thinker. I don’t agree with him a lot of the time. But I like to read him, so. And one thing that’s hard here, by the way, is that among the things we’re asking of people is — and I’ve had this experience before elsewhere — is, it’s a really hard thing to ask people who disagree with each other to work with each other. You know? And particularly with opinion journalism, these are people who are paid to have very, very strong convictions, and to believe that they’re right.","And then you want to put them together and say, “OK now we want to treat each other civilly and be good colleagues.” And that can be a difficult thing. But again, people are, I think — and, Tyson, correct me if I’m wrong — they’re making it work. We’ve had some explosions, but culturally it’s real, it’s actually a challenge internally. And if you ask me what I’m proud of, I’m proud of the way people have — I was not proud of some of the moments along the way. But in general, I think people handled that with the grace and dignity we would expect from people at The New York Times.","NYT employee: I’m keeping an eye on Slack in case there are questions, but I guess what I’ll ask you is that — so you alluded earlier to a lot of, sort of, sameness, you know, among the opinions, like, across the board in media previously. How do you feel like the Times is currently — in your opinion section, that you’re running — how is it differentiating itself from, say, other publications?","Bennet: This is where we’re trying to get. If you, um... I think, in general, what we’ve seen is that there are not very many places that have the ambition of putting people with very different points of view into conversation with each other. That may be because it’s a bad idea. I think it’s also because it’s hard to do that. And other publications simply don’t have the same sense of purpose around this that The New York Times has. Particularly the digital upstarts that have come along. The startups, generally, and serious players over the course of the last 15 or 20 years tend to have a point of view on the world and drive that point of view through everything that they’re doing. In the print world, it’s the approach that The Economist has taken, and arguably, it’s kind of what The New Yorker is, in the print world. And if you imagine two axes — and this is Tyson’s visual representation of this — where you put digital and print on two of the extremes and a single point of view and many voices on the other, and you sort publications that way, what you find is that one quadrant is almost entirely empty, which is digital and lots of points of view. One exception to that is media, which is open to everybody and obviously not a curated space. When we think about the competitive landscape, if there’s one publication I would say is maybe ahead of us here is The Washington Post, which scares me, and they’re moving into that space. And there’s a lot of risk here for us.","I mean, this is where we need to go to be consistent with — and I think there’s an intuition and a faith that we’re not reaching a lot of readers who might otherwise appreciate Times journalism, partly because they feel like they don’t recognize themselves in our opinion report. That said, we could piss a lot of people off, you know, doing this work. And we don’t have very good measures of the risk or the reward. But I mean, I’m sorry, again, I’m talking way too much. I guess, to sort of answer your question, it feels like a very — the reason we’re driving towards this position is, it is both true to what... it’s authentic. It’s what we’re supposed to do. The third reason actually is true. It’s true to who we’re supposed to be. And it feels very differentiated. Nobody else is doing it.","The third reason I would say is, I just think it — the world needs this from us right now. You know it is, it is cutting against, and I don’t mean to sound pious, but it really is true that this is a crude and dangerously polarized time. And this is where it’s journalistically true to the ambitions of the Times, to approach opinion in this way. The notion that anybody has a monopoly on what the right answers are is just a dangerous kind of form of hubris that too many of us are really falling prey to right now. And you look what’s happening in the world, the sort of crackup of ideologies, of political parties. Neither party really makes sense, I don’t think, right now, in the U.S., ideologically, and there are big questions about trade, for example, that have been reopened. And to simply assert that we know what the right answers are is not good for the democracy. So I think trying to show that it’s possible, both to have strong convictions and an open mind to other people’s egos, is a valuable contribution that we can make.","NYT employee: So there are questions in Slack, but I don’t want to monopolize. So it’s kind of variations on the same question, so I’m just going to pick one. So, media literacy is a big problem. We see and understand the differences between the op-ed and editorial, but how do you communicate to readers and critics, and keep from sending mixed signals to the world?","Bennet: I think we do a really bad job of this right now. I think, a) I think those categories — these are the sorts of categories that make sense to us and don’t make any sense to other people. Like, what is an op-ed? I’d kind of like to stop using that word, even internally, but we’re stuck with it. What is an editorial? We have been talking too long now, even in the time I’ve been here, about doing a better job of communicating this to readers. And we’re still not actually doing it very well. Partly, it requires product solutions that have so far eluded our grasp. But I think every piece that goes out to us needs to be very clearly labeled. Not just labeled “opinion,” which right there we have a problem, particularly in social. But we’ve gotten a little better there. But then, it needs to carry a description of what it is.","That’s particularly true of editorials, but also other pieces of opinion. And right now, if you, I mean, you know, more than 80 percent of our readers encounter one piece of opinion from The New York Times a month, and that is their only exposure to Times opinion. And if that is a piece by Charles Blow or a piece by Bret Stephens or a piece by Erik Prince, you will form your opinion of who we are based on that one encounter with that one ambassador of our content. And this is... I mean, everybody has this problem: Somehow we have to do a better job at the atomic level of the individual piece of communicating a version of what it just took me 15 minutes to explain to you guys.","So I’d welcome any suggestions on how to do that. One of the areas — I mean, small thing, but where I envy the Post right now — and I don’t know how good or effective it is — but they’ve built a little bit of [artificial intelligence] into their... and I don’t know what level. But they are now able to automate serving up not just one argument, but the counterargument with it. So the related links are right there. Whether anybody uses those links or not, it’s a nice statement about the brand and the ambition ― that we’re giving you this point of view, and here’s somebody who disagrees with it in one package, should you choose to go there. That’s the kind of thing, you know, we should be doing, I think.","NYT employee: One of the questions on here is around the advocacy that you described. Can you talk a little bit about that?","Bennet: This was related to the tax bill, which we’ve been editorializing against. And the voice of the editorial board went onto Twitter to do direct advocacy on it, urging holdout senators who agreed with a number of the positions that we’ve taken on what it would do to the deficit, and how it was shifting the burden of taxation, and the specific issues it didn’t deal with. They each had a different specific issue to stand their ground. It was the kind of experiment that I’ve been encouraging our people to do. And I’m still not sure we’ve learned from it. It had — and, Tyson, you weigh in here, you have a better sense. It had, it had a very big impact. It got a lot of people talking. It pissed off our colleagues in the Washington bureau hugely, because it felt to everybody like a more direct form of advocacy than we traditionally do. In reality, I’ve yet to — and maybe one of you can do this — I’ve yet to get the explanation for why that’s the case. The principled explanation for why this was more direct. Like, we editorialized for this specific election in defeat of a given candidate. We editorialize and say “You should go throw this bum out of office.” That, to me, is as direct a form of advocacy as we could possibly do. Saying “Go call the senator and urge them to stick to their principles” feels like a much less direct form of advocacy. Yet it didn’t... I mean, I can argue logically that it’s a much — I think I’m right. But it felt — and I think it felt that way because it’s just different than anything we’ve done before. It was therefore shocking people and upsetting. But I’m still scratching around to try to figure out where the violation of principle is here.","Tyson Evans, senior editor, opinion products and strategy: I think that was key. Part of the problem in evaluating it is we don’t really have anything to compare it to, because we haven’t done anything similar, so it’s hard to know what size of impact it was supposed to have. I think in the spirit of this moment where we’re trying to say, the form of an editorial is so purely a print construct over the last century, that we’re asking, who are these editorials for? And what action are we trying cause by writing them? And what’s the value of the institution taking a position on something in a moment where it’s just a lot easier for this industry to do something when they feel compelled to do it. When they read a well-written, persuasive argument. Those are the facts on the ground and I think we’re still wrestling with what to do with it, and what’s the capital we have, how many times a year. The Guardian kind of plowed the way forward with this a couple years ago with their “Keep it in the ground” campaign, which was very, very driven over the course of one or two years, I think. [inaudible] It was a really concentrated effort of advocacy and trying to mobilize the citizenship to divest and persuade their legislative groups. So I don’t know, I think we’re early, and we’d love input on what’s the right way to do it, what are the right moments.","Bennet: There are definitely some tactical things that we would do differently if we do this again. And we were able to have an impact. I mean, we did jam the switchboards on Capitol Hill, which is a more tangible outcome than we often get when we editorialize, so. And then we got some pushback from some readers, and some from our colleagues. And from individual senators, who were really pissed. [Sen.] Susan Collins [R-Maine] was just — but, you know.","NYT employee: I mean, maybe to build on this point ― you started by talking about creating a place for civil debate. There is something about this that says, “But we’re also going to go and take some proactive actions beyond civil debate and push one side of the agenda.” And how do you think about the editorial page within that debate?","Bennet: Well, part of the goal of having more debate is, again, the, you know, basically making the editorial line a little more relevant in some ways. Because if we’re all agreeing with each other, what’s the point of having editorials? I think the first-order question is, what’s the point of having editorials? And here’s what I think, is that it saves us from more of the real moral hazards in the opinion environment in which we want to say, we want to convene lots of voices from lots of points of view. I would worry and personally be concerned about saying we’re indifferent to what the right answer is, right? We don’t just want to let a thousand flowers bloom, let a thousand schools of thought contend, and we’ll just provide the platform. In which there is one version of this, in which [inaudible], I think the conversation will continue about whether that’s actually the right outcome. What the editorials allow us to do, is to say on matters of real consequence, where for one reason or another, this institution has felt a kind of historic connection, the Times is going to come down. And God knows, we argued against women’s suffrage on the editorial page of The New York Times, so we should be humble every time we write one of these about whether we’re actually right. But on big questions, you know, climate change — I think this tax bill actually qualifies.","I didn’t mention this, but one of the things we’re trying to do is — and we have done, actually — is lower the key. You know, the last — since time immemorial now, it’s three editorials a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. We’re reducing the cadence, so there are fewer of them.","And then this is something David has pressed me for for a long time, is, so what are the issues that The New York Times should be engaging with? [Note to readers: We’re not sure who “David” is.] I mean, I think there’s... the three fundamental, you know, values that guide the editorial on is — and I’m still wrestling with all of these questions, and I’ve not done a good enough job of distilling any of this — but we’re concerned about honesty, fairness and progress. Right? And those things can actually be thought of as usefully in tension with each other. For example, take particularly progress and fairness. I mean, I think we are pro-capitalism. The New York Times is in favor of capitalism because it has been the greatest engine of, it’s been the greatest anti-poverty program and engine of progress that we’ve seen. But The New York Times is very concerned with fairness. We’ve been concerned with the essential equality of human beings from the get-go, and with minority rights and individual rights from the get-go. And in thinking about, for example, the tax bill in this and that, you know, we actually like the idea of reducing corporate rates. We’re not for taxation for purposes of taxation, but we are very concerned about fairness and equitable distribution. And it’s sort of wrestling with the, with the tensions there is, I think, how we come out where we do.","But, you know, there’s a hierarchy of specific concerns. Honesty speaks to, again, to my mind, it speaks to the free exercise of a sound conscience and our preoccupation with First Amendment rights, and the ability for people to always be able to speak their minds and advocate positions that they believe in. That’s kind of at the top of our hierarchy of concerns.","NYT employee: Just reading off the Slack channel, I’m going to abstract it out a little, but when you have differing opinions, how do you first of all vet and make sure that facts are right? But maybe even going a step further, how do you make sure that people aren’t misrepresenting facts? Maybe if you could even tie that into how you even think about the voices you invite in, to kind of judge whether they’re really going to take a fair take on [inaudible].","Bennet: You know we do, I mean at a very basic level, we fact-check our work. So, there is a kind of layer there of having a — but the harder question is representation of fact. And that’s where we’re really, you know, are instilling rules of the road and kind of values for how we approach argumentation and hiring for people. And you know, the first-order value is intellectual honesty. And that means — and God knows we don’t succeed at this every day — but the goal is, you’re supposed to take on the hard arguments on the other side, not the easy arguments. Not the straw men, but the actual substantive, kind of toughest arguments and acknowledge when the other side has a point. No ad hominem attacks. There’s a sort of series of things that we expect of our people and we’re hiring, to my mind — the two columnists who have been brought on board since I’ve been here have been Bret and Michelle so far, and both of them totally clear the bar, in my view, of being people who have both conviction — strong points of view — and very open minds.","I give our conservatives, in general, particular credit because they have to live this every day in a way liberals don’t, because they’re working in an environment where they are constantly having to grapple [with] people with very, very different points of view. It really is in the hiring, of picking people that have these different [inaudible].","But the seduction of straw-man arguing is quite powerful and something. And it’s a danger on the editorial side, too, that we face a lot. Particularly when you’re operating within an echo chamber.","NYT employee: So, kind of building on that, there’s sort of a question related, which is, like, in a world where a lot of people are sort of interested [in] reading the thing that they agree with, how do you balance the desire to have opposing viewpoints versus, you know, people gravitating to certain kinds of coverage? So yeah, just, how do you think about that?","Bennet: I’m really concerned about this for opinion journalism generally, because right now in the last couple of years, with your — particularly now, though, the rewards for saying the same thing over and over again, and providing that kind of affirmation, are huge. And the punishments for stepping out of line and saying something — I’m talking about the individual writer, now — saying, hey, actually you know, the Democrats have a point about X or the Republicans have a point about Y, depending on their point of view, you just get killed for that in social media.","Then the effect of this, and I think you can see it happening, is that writers are becoming less interesting. You know, I can say this particularly as someone who is looking forward to new opinion writers. And you want supple minds and people who are a little bit unpredictable, and you’re not reading the same piece over and over again. It’s getting harder to find people like that. And it is partly a function of the media environment. We need super-strong, tough people, for one thing, to weather that environment and stay true to the ambitions that we have for the work we want done.","NYT employee: I’m going to read, specifically, just cause I want your reaction to it, which is, how do you have a civil debate when one side isn’t interested in being civil or factual?","Bennet: I think there are a lot of people out there, on both sides actually, who aren’t that interested in — and I’ll be accused of both-siderism, I’m only saying that because I’ve experienced it — who aren’t particularly interested in being civil or factual. And that’s true. And I actually understand that feeling myself some days, when I don’t feel like I want to be terribly civil or factual because I’m so angry about it. Um, read the question again, it was —","NYT employee: Let me ask it this way. [inaudible] How do you think about, like, is there one side that isn’t — this specific thing is, one side isn’t interested in being civil or factual, and how do you think about that? Or not.","Bennet: I think that that’s true, and I lament it. I just don’t want to give into that ourselves. And I also think there are a lot of people out there who are susceptible to feeling that way, who aren’t necessarily going to feel that way if they are presented with an alternative. And this is where I think if — it’s not like we’re going to win all those people over and bring them onto our platform necessarily. But I do think if we show that we take — let’s talk about it from the point of view of the left and think about conservatives. Most of our readers [inaudible] are liberal. I think if we show we take conservatives seriously and we take ideas seriously there, we get a lot more moderates paying attention to what The New York Times has to say. I think we lose the moderates completely if we just show that we think the conservatives are just, that there’s no point in even engaging their ideas or to debate with them. That’s not the same thing as saying, you know, I don’t think we’re going to reform everybody in the world.","NYT employee: It’s a follow-up to something kind of earlier. You identified that you’re having trouble finding new voices, and that a lot of the problems you’ve identified seem to be that we just don’t have people representing certain positions. During the election you had no strong advocate for [Sen.] Bernie Sanders [I-Vt.], or any of those positions. And so I guess, in the more recent months, in your attempts to find those voices, where have you been looking, what types of people have you been looking for, and how are you trying to get a more diverse group of people regularly writing in the op-ed section?","Bennet: I think we need, and you know, I’m sorry if I’m going to talk in code a little bit here, but I’m not talking about ideology necessarily. I’m talking about identity, as well. What columnists do, you know,p again, highly intellectually honest, highly entertaining, highly interesting writers who have a lot to say — hard to find those people from the get-go. What a columnist is is a trusted voice in your ear that helps you process, kind of, the world in real time, right? Through a particular lens. And there are a number of lenses we’re missing right now, I think. And a lot of those are, it’s gender and it’s identity, you know, as well as ideology.","So where am I looking? I’m asking, I’m asking you guys. You know, send me names, please. You know, if there are people that you’re reading that you think belong in The New York Times. You know, please. I always, when I was at The Atlantic, I always kept a list of Atlantic writers who didn’t work for The Atlantic, just who felt like — I was at The Atlantic magazine before I came back to the Times, and there was a particular kind of, not that dissimilar from the kind of people we’re looking for now, with voice. And I could see them on other platforms and they just didn’t know that they were Atlantic people yet, but they were. And I don’t have as good a list now as I did then. It might be my own failing. Earlier I blamed the environment for that. But I’m taking nominations.","I’ve been... if I could, this is what I would be spending 90 percent of my time on. Because hiring in general, and I’m sure you guys feel this, too, is the most important thing that we do. Like, that’s the most important editing we do, is picking the people. After that, you know, you ideally cut them loose to do their thing. In reality, I’m spending a small percentage of my time on this. So I would love help. So please send your nominations my way.","NYT employee: So question for you. Do you consider women’s rights, trans rights, people of color’s rights, to be liberal stances?","Bennet: Um, I consider them to be classically liberal stances, as I understand liberalism classically. Which is to say, very concerned with the rights of the individual. The sort of John Stuart Mill sense of the world. You know, in a sort of American modern ideological framework, I would say they are also understood to be liberal. But I guess that’s not necessarily the way I would — I mean, these are human rights and deeply connected, I think, to our understanding of human value, which, again, I think is core to the editorial convictions of The New York Times. The essential equality of human beings.","NYT employee: Maybe, can I just do a follow-up on that one? How would you think about, like, when you think about encouraging open debate, something like trans rights versus climate change where, you know — are there certain things where you said, like, there’s really not a debate?","Bennet: Oh yeah, there are certain things I would think of as settled law. And I think the fact of climate change is one of them. That is the science of climate change, that it’s happening and that humans are driving it. What to do about it, how to address it, I think that’s a big debate that, in general, we should be participating in more actively than we are, right?","Yeah, there are issues like, “Nazism: good or bad?” is not a debate I imagine The New York Times necessarily convening. It’s just, like, I think there are issues that are settled law. Although, apparently now slavery is an issue again in the Alabama Senate race, as of today. There’s people making a case for that. Well, [Roy] Moore was asked — I only saw it — I guess he was asked when the last time America was great was, and that was when it was great.","NYT employee: So just to follow up on this, there was a thread in Slack on this. You know, with climate change, can people have opinions about it? You know, like with trans rights, can people have opinions about it? Or is The New York Times’ perspective, “No no no, the debate that we want to encourage is not whether there should be trans rights or whether there is climate change but the implications for society about it.” Or how do you think about it?","Bennet: I think we should have discussions about what the implications are for society. I’m not sure I understand the question exactly.","NYT employee: The question is — we’re talking about the debate, what matters are settled that shouldn’t even be debated, versus what the debate actually is. I think, you know, climate change is a good example. So they said that you have a voice in the opinion pages who maybe has a different perspective about what to do with climate change. You’d say, “It’s not that Bret Stephens opposes or doesn’t think climate change is happening,” right? Or is he representing that other perspective? How do you think about where the debate begins versus the debate having been settled?","Bennet: We — let me answer this generically first, and then come back specifically to Bret and climate change. We have, this is, this is the hard and interesting debate we have all the time, which is, what are the boundaries for debate in Times opinion. There are no hard and fast rules here. And it’s our privilege and burden as editors to define those boundaries, and we will get it wrong, right? There will be times we’ll publish a piece that feels, “Wow, that’s really a little bit out of bounds.” I would expect that to happen sometimes. I’d be much [more] worried about the environment in which we never crossed that boundary than one in which every now and then we do. So, that’s going to happen, I think.","And that said, we have faced this over and over again. For example, we published a piece — well, I just gave away the punchline — but we had a big argument over a piece by a settler. And you know, pick your issue. For some people it’s climate change, for some people it’s trans rights, for others it’s a two-state solution and the fate of the Palestinians. In this case, it was the settler saying, look, the two-state solution is dead and [it’s] time to face reality, and here’s some alternative paths for what the future would look like. And we had a real debate about whether this piece was crossing a line, because was it denying personhood to the Palestinians? Was it an act of, kind of, hate speech in a sense? I felt strongly that we should publish the piece and we did, as did others. Because this particular viewpoint is hugely consequential. It actually is creating reality on the ground. To pretend that somehow we would be — either to think that we were legitimating that point of view by having it in our pages or to tell ourselves that we were somehow changing the reality by not allowing it into our pages seems to me to be deluded a little bit. And our readers need to hear it, like, unmediated, I think. They need to confront these arguments. And we published that piece, and we faced that.","We talk a lot about the Richard Spencer test, you know: Would we publish Richard Spencer in the pages of The New York Times? The answer to that is no — oh, well, the piece we’d publish from him is “Why I Got Everything Wrong, by Richard Spencer,” if he was owning up to it. I mean, as you could imagine, there’s conditions. But the reasons we wouldn’t right now are largely because the guy is — he represents a particularly poisonous point of view. And that isn’t having those kinds of consequences. You know, it’s not a, it’s not a giant movement. We’ve published [Russian President] Vladimir Putin, you know, and should we not allow Vladimir Putin into our pages? It’s hard to say. It’s hard to say that that would be doing a service to our readers. But as you can see, I mean, I struggle to articulate what those boundaries are. It’s one of the hard things. You guys have to eventually render judgment, you know. And there’s a degree of subjectivity inevitably that creeps into all of these sorts of decisions, and it’s particularly true in the opinion environment. I do — and I mean, it is a real struggle, and I do want to emphasize the thought that I worry a lot more about how, again, over time, you play it safe, you play it safe, you play it safe, and you wind up where, I think, we were. And I think you become a lot less interesting and a lot less of a constructive source of force in this society if you are not willing to take some chances.","NYT employee: So [inaudible] if you publish one thing in this one perspective, how do you think about providing the balance or making sure that when you’re putting something out there — do you think about that? Or ...","Bennet: Um, I do. I don’t think we do a great job of that, as much as, you know, we want to have this kind of cacophonous opinion report with a lot of different points of view represented. I think it’s hard to do it and have it be compellingly journalistic. If it’s kind of over-engineered, that is, we’ll only publish this point of view when we have a point of view on the other side. And we’ll present everything as a debate — well, actually there are four or five corners to this debate, and we’ve got to wait until we have all the pieces, and then we — people don’t consume journalism that way, and it doesn’t feel very vital. I think it needs to be a running debate, that we need to be more deliberate over time about representing all these points of view. And then again, it’s a product question, too, like once we have them all, we need to be able to present them as a kind of constellation. But even in the editorial piece of it, and this is part of what the reorganization of our team is about, we’re not doing — we’re getting better at that. And look, you guys, I mean, debates are — there are always many, many points of view. And you can’t — my view is that it’s just one side and the other side, but... more voices is going to help us with that.","NYT employee: Do we have time for one more question? [inaudible]","Bennet: What do you guys think we’re doing wrong? Or what would you change?","NYT employee: I think something that the staff would probably say is that, on the web, it can be difficult — and this is something that A.G. said when we did the Q&A with him — is that, on the web, it can be difficult to differentiate opinion pieces versus news pieces when they’re, like, right next to each other. That just generally, I think, continues to be a confusing point for a lot of people.","Bennet: Yeah, yeah, I agree. We’re trying to make a bunch of changes, improve the labeling. We’re actually going to change — I mean these are, some of these are the sorts of cues we’ve used in the past that we tell ourselves matter but don’t really matter to the readers. I think we are going to wind up with a bolder kind of differentiated typographical treatment for our opinion pieces. But there are some basic things we should be doing, like when it’s an opinion piece, the bio of the writer should be at the top of the piece, so you know kind of some sense of who this is and what point of view they’re advocating. You know, that this is the president of Russia. You know, right now it can look like just a New York Times staff writer, and there are design and product solutions here that I hope we’re going to have in place in the first quarter next year. But honestly, I thought we’d have them in the first quarter of this year, so I can’t — um, things take a long time to work their way through the processes here. But I do agree. I worry about that a lot. I know I really don’t like our opinion work to be contaminated by the news side."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a94927b1f00005100168863.jpeg?ops=crop_243_282_3300_2111%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Gay GOP Group Leader Still Believes Donald Trump Is A 'Pro-LGBT' President","authors":"Michelangelo Signorile","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/log-cabin-republicans-donald-trump-lgbtq-rights_us_5a93901ae4b0ee6416a499df","short_description":"\"The facts speak for themselves,\" said Log Cabin Republicans' Gregory T.

He didn’t actually state his own position on the matter, but said that the issue was “settled law.”","“Barack Obama didn’t believe that when he entered the White House,” Angelo said. “Hillary Clinton only came around to that position in 2013.”","But Trump never changed his stated position from the presidential campaign, and he doesn’t actually support marriage equality. Obama and Clinton both have supported same-sex marriage for several years.","And within months of that “60 Minutes” interview, Trump nominated Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, making good on a promise to religious conservatives that he would install judges who could overturn the landmark Obergefell v. Hodges ruling on marriage equality.","Gorsuch’s decisions and views on “religious liberty” present a threat to LGBTQ rights. He has already written a dissent while on the high court that some legal scholars say sends an encouraging message to states that might want to challenge Obergefell.","When asked about reports that anti-LGBTQ leaders have a lot of access to Trump, Angelo responded that he himself had similar access.","“I’ve been to the White House numerous times,” Angelo said. “I’ve met with senior White House officials.”","“As I’ve long said, if you’re calling Donald Trump out for what are actual or perceived biases against the LGBT community, you have to call a spade a spade, highlighting the pro-LGBT things he has done,” Angelo said.","And yet, Angelo offered few actual examples of “pro-LGBT things” Trump has done.","He said he opposed Trump’s tweets announcing a ban on transgender people serving in the military, but excused the action as “cynical politics” meant to help a defense bill pass in a conservative Congress. He also said he thought Education Secretary Betsy DeVos was wrong to announce that the Department of Education would no longer investigate discrimination claims by transgender students regarding bathroom use, but added that she is “still pursuing other instances of discrimination against the transgender community.”","“You have to include these things,” Angelo said.","But seriously, a “pro-LGBT” president?","“The facts speak for themselves,” Angelo responded. “I don’t want to keep belaboring these points, but: [Trump] entered the White House as first president saying he supports that marriage equality is settled law of the land, sent a letter of congratulations and commemoration [on Log Cabin’s 40th anniversary], and has people in his Cabinet who support marriage equality.”","It’s hard to imagine how much lower the bar could be set."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a9594b42000007d06eb01e6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"QUEER VOICES","headline":"Kylie Minogue Will Headline NYC's Pride Island In June","authors":"Curtis M.

Only 1994 saw more, with 2,066 anti-Semitic incidents.","“A confluence of events in 2017 led to a surge in attacks on our community – from bomb threats, cemetery desecrations, white supremacists marching in Charlottesville, and children harassing children at school,” said ADL CEO Jonathan A. Greenblatt in a statement. “These incidents came at a time when we saw a rising climate of incivility, the emboldening of hate groups and widening divisions in society.”","The report breaks down anti-Semitic incidents into three categories: There were 1,015 incidents of harassment last year, a 41 percent increase over the prior year; 952 incidents of vandalism, an 86 percent increase; and 19 incidents of assault, a 47 percent decrease.","The most common place for these acts of hate was in schools. There were 457 anti-Semitic incidents at K-12 schools in America last year, a 94 percent increase from the 235 recorded at schools in 2016.","“The consistent increase of anti-Semitic incidents against students of all ages is deeply troubling,” Greenblatt said. “We know that students do not always report when they are being bullied, so for every incident that’s reported, it is likely there’s another that goes unreported.”","Another ADL report released last month detailed 204 incidents of anti-Semitism on college campuses in 2017, a nearly 90 percent increase over the year before.","The most anti-Semitic incidents last year occurred in the first three months of 2017, as the country reeled from a particularly contentious presidential election. January, February and March saw 208, 273 and 273 incidents respectively.","There were 163 bomb threats made against Jewish institutions during those three months. A 19-year-old Israeli-American named Michael Ron David Kadar was arrested in Israel for making the bulk of those threats. It later emerged that Kadar, whom his mother described as autistic and suffering from a brain tumor, sold his bomb threat services on the dark web.","“Our goal in the Audit is not to count anti-Semites, but rather to document cases where Jews were targeted for assault, vandalism and harassment,” an ADL spokesman explained to HuffPost.","“Regardless of the motivation of any specific perpetrator, Jewish communities were repeatedly traumatized by these assaults on their institutions and threats to their safety. The bomb threats sowed fear and anxiety among Jews across the country.”","The report similarly states that the desecration of seven Jewish cemeteries in 2017 — most of which occurred at the beginning of the year — “contributed to a sense that the Jewish American community was under siege.”","The ADL’s report adds to a growing body of evidence pointing to a rise in hate in America. A recent report, also from the ADL, found that white supremacists in the U.S. killed more than twice as many people in 2017 as they did the year before, helping make 2017 the fifth deadliest year on record for extremist violence in America. (Already in 2018, a neo-Nazi allegedly murdered a gay Jewish college student in California.)","Hate crimes rose about 5 percent in 2016, according to the latest FBI tally, marking the first time in over 10 years that the country has experienced consecutive annual increases in hate crimes.","Preliminary hate crime statistics for 2017 — collected by Brian Levin, a professor at the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino — showed a 20 percent rise in hate crimes in 13 large American cities.","Earlier this month, the Southern Poverty Law Center released its annual “Year in Hate and Extremism” report, identifying 954 hate groups in the U.S. – an increase of 4 percent from 2016. The SPLC attributed this rise in hate groups, and a similar increase in 2016, to the rhetoric of President Donald Trump.","“President Trump in 2017 reflected what white supremacist groups want to see: a country where racism is sanctioned by the highest office, immigrants are given the boot and Muslims banned,” said Heidi Beirich, director of the SPLC’s Intelligence Project.","To the delight of racists and fascists across the country, Trump has on numerous occasions given political cover or tacit support to white nationalism. During the campaign, he was slow to disavow the support of David Duke, a former KKK grand wizard and avowed anti-Semite. The president also tweeted an image of Hillary Clinton standing next to an apparent Star of David and a pile of cash. (This anti-Semitic meme originated on an alt-right message board on 8chan.)","Once in office, Trump issued a Holocaust Remembrance Day statement that omitted any mention of anti-Semitism or Jews. He refused to condemn his supporters for making anti-Semitic threats against journalist Julia Ioffe. “I know nothing about it,” he said. “You’ll have to talk to them about that.” (Andrew Anglin, the anti-Semite behind the neo-Nazi site The Daily Stormer, told HuffPost that he interpreted Trump’s lack of condemnation as “an endorsement” for the threats against Ioffe.)","And after the violent white supremacist gathering in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August — which ended with a neo-Nazi allegedly driving his car into a crowd of counter-protesters, injuring 19 people and killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer — Trump said there were “very fine people” on both sides of the rally.","America does not do a good job of tracking incidents of hate and bias.

At the time, A.G. Sulzberger, now publisher of the Times, was conducting a tour of the company he was about to inherit, meeting with employees from different corners of the newspaper. The Q&A session with Bennet was apparently convened in a similar spirit of transparency and goodwill. But according to some Times staffers who were present, little clarity was offered by Bennet and even less goodwill was spread. One person who was there, still angry more than two months later, called Bennet’s answers “equivocal bullshit.”","In the meeting, a recording of which was recently viewed and transcribed by HuffPost, Bennet talked extensively about some of the choices he’d made since his hiring in 2016, the problems he’d encountered, the criticism he’d received both internally and externally, and his successes and failures.","It was as frank an explication as Bennet has given of how he conceives of the opinion section. Slaloming between contradictions, Bennet laid out an ideology of no ideology. The editorial page is beholden to no priors (except when it is). It proudly forswears the idea of right answers (except when it doesn’t). It is humanist and ecumenical but also of the belief, for instance, that some kinds of ethnic cleansing are worthy of debate.","“The world needs this from us right now,” Bennet told the dozen or so New York Times staffers in the room. “I don’t mean to sound pious, but it really is true that this is a crude and dangerously polarized time... And to simply assert that we know what the right answers are is not good for the democracy.”","Some answers, though, are evidently so “right” in Bennet’s view that they can simply be asserted. “I mean, I think we are pro-capitalism,” he said later in the meeting. “The New York Times is in favor of capitalism because it has been the greatest engine of, it’s been the greatest anti-poverty program and engine of progress that we’ve seen.”","Bennet’s ideology of no ideology admits to a few other caveats. In the meeting, he talked about how some issues are “settled law” and thus beyond debate, citing the evils of Nazism and the science of climate change. He also talked about which views are too “poisonous” to be given an airing in his pages, such as Richard Spencer’s white nationalism. But even then, perhaps uneasy with the idea of a value-neutral editorial page having any values at all, Bennet wobbled:","We talk a lot about the Richard Spencer test, you know: Would we publish Richard Spencer in the pages of The New York Times? The answer to that is no... But the reasons we wouldn’t right now are largely because the guy is — he represents a particularly poisonous point of view. And that isn’t having those kinds of consequences. You know, it’s not a, it’s not a giant movement.","Is it the poisonous point of view that disqualifies Spencer, or is it the supposedly narrow scope of his white nationalism and its lack of consequences? If Spencer’s ethnic cleansing program scored favorably in the next Gallup poll, would he then be worthy of op-ed space in The New York Times?","“We’ve published Vladimir Putin,” Bennet said. “Should we not allow Vladimir Putin into our pages? It’s hard to say. It’s hard to say that that would be doing a service to our readers. But as you can see, I mean, I struggle to articulate what those boundaries are.”","In an effort to elaborate on how he understands those boundaries, Bennet brought up an op-ed published about a year ago in which an Israeli settler called for Palestinian apartheid:","We had a big argument over a piece by a settler. And you know, pick your issue. For some people it’s climate change, for some people it’s trans rights, for others it’s a two-state solution and the fate of the Palestinians. In this case, it was the settler saying, look, the two-state solution is dead and [it’s] time to face reality, and here’s some alternative paths for what the future would look like. And we had a real debate about whether this piece was crossing a line, because was it denying personhood to the Palestinians? Was it an act of, kind of, hate speech in a sense?\n\nI felt strongly that we should publish the piece and we did, as did others. Because this particular viewpoint is hugely consequential. It actually is creating reality on the ground. To pretend that somehow we would be — either to think that we were legitimating that point of view by having it in our pages or to tell ourselves that we were somehow changing the reality by not allowing it into our pages seems to me to be deluded a little bit. And our readers need to hear it, like, unmediated, I think. They need to confront these arguments. And we published that piece, and we faced that.","To be clear, the “reality” that the column described, and that Bennet decided his audience needed to confront, is that “the presence of these Arab residents alone does not warrant a new country,” in the writer’s words. “Arabs can live in Israel, as other minorities do, with personal rights, not national rights.” One of the “alternative paths” offered was “an exchange of populations with Arab countries,” in which “Palestinians in Judea and Samaria would be offered generous compensation to emigrate voluntarily.”","The opinion section in general is a case study in how essentially liberal institutions are undermined by the tools of their own liberalism. Illiberalism seeps into the hollows created by seemingly high-minded values about debate and the marketplace of ideas. The settled science about climate gets quickly unsettled by a columnist like Bret Stephens, a Bennet hire, who smuggles climate denialism onto the page by couching it in progressive-sounding language about debate, certainty and ecumenicism.","The specter of Stephens hovered at the edges of the December meeting, even when he wasn’t being discussed directly. In an earlier meeting between Sulzberger and the same group of Times staffers (video of which was also viewed by HuffPost), someone asked about Stephens’ handling of climate change: “So when Bret Stephens is writing a column and there’s information in there about climate change, how does the editorial section handle that?” Sulzberger emphasized the need for columnists, who aren’t heavily edited, to “have everything buttoned up,” though he allowed that “we are not an organization that [has] fact-checkers.”","In the meeting with Bennet, an employee asked how he makes sure his writers aren’t misrepresenting facts. Bennet replied:","You know we do, I mean at a very basic level, we fact-check our work. So, there is a kind of layer there of having a — but the harder question is representation of fact. And that’s where we’re really, you know, are instilling rules of the road and kind of values for how we approach argumentation and hiring for people. And you know, the first-order value is intellectual honesty. And that means — and God knows we don’t succeed at this every day — but the goal is, you’re supposed to take on the hard arguments on the other side, not the easy arguments. Not the straw men, but the actual substantive, kind of toughest arguments and acknowledge when the other side has a point.","Bennet was unstinting in his praise of Stephens: “I know that there was a lot of — and I experienced it — a lot of criticism and concern about him. And you guys may disagree or there may be people who do, but I just think he’s an exceptional writer and thinker.”","This is one way of looking at Stephens’ work. Reading him might lead you to a different conclusion. After Stephens wrote his notorious April 2017 column in which he questioned established climate science in his sidelong way, he was forced to correct the only line containing any reference to actual science three days later.","And he was just getting started. The first quarter of Stephens’ Feb. 9 defense of Woody Allen consisted of his retelling an entirely unrelated story for no apparent reason other than to remind us that someone was wrong one time. He wrote that “if Allen is in fact a pedophile, he appears to have acted on his evil fantasies exactly once,” as if that were a mitigating factor. (“Compare that to Larry Nassar’s 265 identified victims,” Stephens wrote.) He adduced to his argument a court ruling that actually undermined his framing of the case as a matter of a grownup’s childhood memories.","In October, Stephens wrote about a reckoning that existed only because countless women had risked their livelihoods to expose a serial predator and alleged rapist, saying, “Of all of the dismaying and disgusting details of the Harvey Weinstein saga, none is more depressing than this: It has so few heroes.”","The criticism of Stephens hasn’t just come from outsiders. On Saturday, one of The New York Times’ star reporters, Mike Isaac, tweeted the following:","Isaac’s tweet has since been deleted. It’s not clear whether he deleted the tweet of his own volition or whether he was asked to do so by his editors. We do know, however, that Times opinion columnists enjoy a special set of privileges ― like speaking their minds on Twitter ― not extended to the general newsroom staff.","In any case, none of Stephens’ infelicities really matter if writing and thinking are valued primarily as exercises in provocation rather than persuasion. In the December meeting, Bennet described columnists as “people who are paid to have very, very strong convictions, and to believe that they’re right.” This creates what he called the “real moral hazards in the opinion environment in which we want to, say, we want to convene lots of voices from lots of point of view.”","In Bennet’s view, editorials — the unsigned pieces attributed to the Times editorial board as a whole — offer an antidote to morally or factually ambiguous pieces published on the opposite page. While the rest of the section is enacting a spirited performance of epistemological inquiry, the editorials get to carry the tablets down the mountain.","I would worry and personally be concerned about saying we’re indifferent to what the right answer is, right? We don’t just want to let a thousand flowers bloom, let a thousand schools of thought contend, and we’ll just provide the platform... What the editorials allow us to do, is to say on matters of real consequence, where for one reason or another, this institution has felt a kind of historic connection, the Times is going to come down.","There are right answers, sometimes, at least on matters of “real consequence.” This helps explain at least one recent bizarre move from the op-ed page. On Feb. 12, two days before the massacre in Parkland, Florida, Bennet’s section ran a piece titled “Background Checks Are Not the Answer to Gun Violence.” The author was John Lott, a man famous for distorting data to push the pro-gun agenda from which he makes his money. This would certainly seem like an astounding oversight from the paper of record.","On Feb. 17, however, a Times editorial included this paragraph: “In a speech last month, [Attorney General Jeff] Sessions said undocumented immigrants are far more likely than American citizens to commit crimes, a claim he found in a paper by John Lott, the disreputable economist best known for misusing statistics to suit his own ideological ends. In this case, it appears Mr. Lott misread his own data, which came from Arizona and in fact showed the opposite of what he claimed: Undocumented immigrants commit fewer crimes than citizens, as the vast majority of research on the topic has found.” (Links were present in the original text.)","This was, apparently, one of those matters of real consequence on which Bennet felt it was the Times’ duty to take a stance. And who better than the editorial page of The New York Times to counter the disinformation put out by the op-ed page of The New York Times.","If Bennet held his December meeting in an effort to win favor with staffers, it seems to have backfired, according to some people in the room.","“People were not satisfied with his answers,” one staffer who attended the meeting told HuffPost in a text message, “since his answers were equivocal bullshit that didn’t really address that the opinion section abuses fact and elevates white male conservative voices under the guise of ‘diversity of thought.’ And that he admits to making mistakes without any concern or even acknowledgement of what the consequences of those ‘mistakes’ actually are.”","As for what those consequences might be, the employee cited “erosion of trust in the rest of what the NYT does, people coming to conclusions based on incorrect facts and then never seeing the correction (if there is one), and choosing to pay money and give a platform to these white dudes instead of marginalized voices who wouldn’t otherwise get their story told (and marginalizing them even more by publishing their bad takes).” A Vanity Fair piece published on Monday quoted a senior newsroom figure who said, “The newsroom feels embarrassed.”","In a statement to HuffPost, a New York Times spokesperson said: “We prioritize communicating with our employees and providing open forums for them to hear updates and offer comments. Leaders throughout the organization, including James, have been doing that on a regular basis. We’re a large company and we don’t expect every employee to agree with every decision we make.”","Two months or so after this meeting, the scrutiny on Bennet’s op-ed page has only heightened. Staff editor Bari Weiss, also a Bennet hire, infuriated a number of newsroom-side staffers when she wrote a tweet referring to American-born Olympic ice skater Mirai Nagasu as an immigrant, only to double down when called out on it, delete the original tweet and lie about what she’d actually said. Around the same time, Bennet announced the hiring of a new columnist, Quinn Norton, only to fire her roughly seven hours later after Twitter users discovered she’d previously boasted about her friendships with neo-Nazis.","But none of this is at odds with the vision of the section as laid out in the meeting by Bennet. Provocations were made; liberal readers were riled. The world was just getting what it needed.","You can read a full transcript of the meeting here.","Clarification: Language has been amended to reflect that A.G. Sulzberger and Bennet’s meetings were with New York Times Company staff outside of the newsroom.

But there’s not a lot of evidence that living through so many massacres has changed young people’s views about gun control.","Young Americans worried about school shootings — and practiced how to survive them — more often than their parents and grandparents did, a new HuffPost/YouGov poll finds. Around a fifth of Americans under age 45 say that, growing up, they were at least somewhat worried about a mass shooting at their school. Just 7 percent of people 45 and older remember being similarly worried. Not a single person polled who was over the age of 65 said that, as a child, they practiced what to do in the event of a school shooting. Just 2 percent of those aged 45-64, and 12 percent of those aged 30-44, had practiced how to survive a shooting. But for adults under age 30, the figure rose to nearly one-third.","On average, people over age 65 said that the first mass shooting they could remember didn’t take place until they were 50 years old. People under age 30 said, on average, that they were 12.","Overall, more than 80 percent of Americans say they feel mass shootings have grown more common in the past decade. (Whether such shootings have actually become more common, or simply more deadly, appears to depend on exactly how they’re measured.)","What’s less clear is what effect this all might have on young Americans’ views about gun control. Several recent polls have found a sharp uptick in support for new gun control laws. But in many surveys, younger adults don’t appear especially likely to stand behind such efforts.","Adults under age 30 are more likely than older Americans to believe that Congress should take action to reduce shootings, according to another HuffPost/YouGov survey taken just after the massacre in Parkland, Florida, but they’re less likely to favor making gun laws stricter, or to count gun issues among their top priorities. A Marist poll found similar results, with 64 percent of 18-to-29-year-old voters favoring more stringent gun laws, compared to 71 percent among voters as a whole. Adults under 45 have virtually the same opinion of the National Rifle Association as do those age 45 and older, according to results from CNN and the polling firm SSRS.","None of those polls capture the views of those currently under the age of 18, who are only rarely surveyed.","The Florida high school shooting spurred many surviving students into gun control activism, and sparked school walkouts nationwide. Their movement has already seen tangible effects, with companies ditching their affiliation with the NRA and Florida’s Republican governor announcing a proposal to increase restrictions on gun buying.","“Now that you’ve had an entire generation of kids growing up around mass shootings, and the fact that they’re starting to be able to vote, explains how we’re going to have this change,” Parkland survivor David Hogg told ABC in an interview. “Kids are not going to accept this.”","It’s less clear to what extent their opinions, and enthusiasm for the issue, carries on to their peers. But there’s evidence to suggest that those currently in school are being more acutely exposed to the threat of school shootings than the generations before them.","In the decade between 2003 and 2013, the share of public schools conducting active shooter drills rose from about 47 percent to just above 70 percent, according to statistics reported by Vox.","A third of parents with children under 18 in the HuffPost/YouGov poll say they’ve talked to their children about the Florida shooting. Asked about those conversations, many said they’d encouraged their children to tell an adult if they saw another student acting strangely or making threats.","Parents also tried to offer advice on how to react in the event of a shooting. “Hide. Escape at the first possible safe moment. Do not try to stop the person. Be very quiet,” one woman said she’d suggested. Another woman said she’d told her child to “grab books and put [them in a] book bag and place in front of chest to act as a bulletproof vest.”","Some said they’d discussed opinions on policies, which ranged from a belief that armed teachers could have “truly protected their students” to a conviction that when it comes to a gun like an AR-15, “no “normal person needs that kind of weaponry.”","And others said they’d simply had to reassure their children.","“My 5-year-old wanted to know if he was going to have to fight a shooter at school,” one mother said.","Use the widget below to further explore the results of the HuffPost/YouGov survey, using the menu at the top to select survey questions and the buttons at the bottom to filter the data by subgroups:","The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Feb. 20-22 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.","HuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

It said the proposal had been made by the party’s Central Committee, the largest of its elite ruling bodies. The proposal also covers the vice president position.\n\nXi, 64, is currently required by China’s constitution to step down as president after two five-year terms. Nearing the end of his first term, he will be formally elected to a second at the annual meeting of China’s largely rubber-stamp parliament opening on March 5.\n\nThere is no limit on his tenure as the party and military chief, though a maximum 10-year term is the norm. He began his second term as head of the party and military in October at the end of a party congress held once every five years.\n\nZhang Lifan, a historian and political commentator, said the news was not unexpected, and it was hard to predict exactly how long Xi could stay on in power.\n\n“In theory he could serve longer than Mugabe but in reality, no one is sure exactly what will happen,” Zhang said, referring to Zimbabwe’s former president whose four decades in office ended in November, after the army and his former political allies moved to force him out.\n\nThough positive remarks filled the comments section under the pages of main state media outlets like the People’s Daily, the move was not welcomed by everyone on China’s Twitter-like Weibo service,\n\n“If two terms are not enough, then they can write in a third term, but there needs to be a limit. Getting rid of it is not good!,” wrote one Weibo user.\n\nEMPEROR XI\n\nConstitutional reform needs to be approved by parliament, which is stacked with members chosen for their loyalty to the party - meaning the reform will not be blocked.\n\nThere has been persistent speculation that Xi wants to stay on in office past the customary two five-year terms.\n\nThe October party congress ended without appointing a clear eventual successor for Xi.\n\nHowever, the role of party chief is more senior than that of president. At some point, Xi could be given a party position that also enables him to stay on as long as he likes.\n\nXi is currently the party’s general secretary, but not chairman. China’s first three leaders after the founding of the People’s Republic in 1949 all carried the title party chairman -Mao Zedong, Hua Guofeng and then Hu Yaobang. It has not been used since.\n\n“Whether Xi ends up being Party Chairman or just remains Party Secretary doesn’t really matter. What matters is whether he holds onto power,” said Zhang Ming, a professor of political science at Renmin University of China in Beijing.\n\n“Titles don’t matter as much in China as they do in the West. Here what matters is whether you are the emperor,” he added. “In China, ordinary people already consider Xi Jinping to be the emperor.”\n\nEYES ON VICE PRESIDENT\n\nMao, the founder of Communist China and still held in god-like awe by many Chinese, died while still Communist Party chairman in 1976, having never retired.\n\nState media has also increasingly been using the term “lingxiu” to refer to Xi, which means “leader”. Distinct from the standard usage of “lingdao” for leader, “lingxiu” evokes grander, almost spiritual, connotations.\n\nMao, for example, was referred to as “lingxiu”, but Xi’s two immediate predecessors, Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, were not.\n\nIn a Sunday commentary on its WeChat account, state television said: “The people love the people’s ‘lingxiu’!”, above a picture of Xi being greeted by an adoring crowd in Sichuan province earlier this month.\n\nThe move to lift the presidential term limits is not unexpected. The party has been laying the groundwork for Xi not to have to go.\n\nOne of Xi’s closest political allies, former top graft buster Wang Qishan, stepped down from the party’s Standing Committee - the seven-man body that runs China - in October.\n\nAged 69, Wang had reached the age at which top officials tend to retire. But he has been chosen as a parliament delegate this year and is likely to become vice president, sources with ties to the leadership and diplomats say.\n\nThe move is significant because if Wang does not retire, that would set a precedent for Xi to stay on in power too after he reaches what is normally considered retirement age.\n\nThe Central Committee also proposed other changes to the country’s constitution, including inserting “Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era” into the constitution, referring to Xi’s rather wordy guiding political thought that is already in the party constitution.\n\nThe constitution will further ensure that party control over the country is not in any doubt, too, strengthening existing clauses about the leading role of the Communist Party in China.\n\n“The leadership of the Communist Party of China is the defining feature of socialism with Chinese characteristics,” Xinhua cited one of the proposed new clauses as saying.\n\n(Reporting by Ben Blanchard and Sue-Lin Wong; Editing by Robert Birsel and Bill Tarrant)"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a929f962000007d06eafe2d.jpeg?cache=hLtCVoPXgv&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"WORLD NEWS","headline":"Christian Leaders Shutter Jerusalem Holy Site To Protest Israeli Tax, Land Policies","authors":"Ori Lewis, Reuters","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/church-leaders-shutter-jerusalem-holy-site-to-protest-israeli-tax-land-policies_us_5a942030e4b03b55731e4a5d","short_description":"The Church of the Holy Sepulchre, where Jesus is believed to have been crucified, is temporarily closed.","date":"2018-02-26"},"articleContent":["JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Church leaders in Jerusalem shut the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on Sunday in protest at a new Israeli tax policy and a proposed land expropriation law which they called an unprecedented attack on Christians in the Holy Land.","Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox and Armenian church leaders said the holy site, a popular stop for pilgrims and where many Christians believe Jesus was crucified and buried, would remain closed until further notice.","After the protest move, an Israeli cabinet committee delayed by a week its scheduled consideration on Sunday of a bill that would allow the state to expropriate land in Jerusalem sold by churches to private real estate firms in recent years.","The stated aim of the bill is to protect homeowners against the possibility that private companies will not extend their leases of land on which their houses or apartments stand.","The churches are major property owners in the city.

Povich","In the wake of the Las Vegas concert massacre last fall, lawmakers in at least 30 states introduced legislation to ban “bump stocks,” which convert semiautomatic guns into automatic weapons and which were used by the gunman. Only two of the bills passed.","President Donald Trump this week said he’ll direct the Department of Justice to outlaw bump stocks nationwide. But the lack of state action on a device that allowed one man to shoot more than 500 people in a quarter-hour serves as a cautionary tale for those who think the latest tragedy — the killing of 17 at a high school in Florida — might finally prompt states to enact tougher gun laws.","In fact, the Florida House voted not to move ahead on a proposed ban on assault-style weapons just days after the school shooting with an AR-15 — as tearful students from the school looked on from the House gallery.","As Congress continues to resist taking action to restrict firearms — and the National Rifle Association suggests arming more teachers as an answer — some are looking to state legislatures for change. This week, high school students and others in Florida, Georgia, Colorado and North Carolina marched on state capitols to demand more restrictions.","Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, said he expects that states will take some action on firearms, perhaps pairing some tighter gun regulations with other measures that make it easier to own a weapon.","Following the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, for example, the state of Oregon closed the gun-show loophole that allowed people to buy guns in private sales or at gun shows without background checks. But it also made it easier for people with concealed-carry permits for guns to prove they have the right to carry them.","“Politicians make deals,” Webster said. “They are appealing to fear. One group feels more comfortable with more regulations and the other feels more comfortable with a gun at their side. I suspect something like that will happen in Florida.”","After the Florida high school shooting, areas of possible action include increasing the age at which residents are allowed to buy semi-automatic weapons and tightening restrictions on gun ownership for those with mental health issues.","But the bump-stock debate over the past few months illustrates how difficult it will be for gun-control advocates to enact other changes state by state. The challenge goes beyond the National Rifle Association, which is among the top outside-money spenders on the federal level and wields significant influence in statehouses. In each state, gun control supporters must navigate labyrinths of special interests, geography and partisan politics in order to succeed.","That was the case in Massachusetts and New Jersey — two Northern, relatively liberal states with Republican governors but Democratic legislatures — that approved bump-stock bans late last year. Outgoing New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, signed the legislation just before he left office, without comment.","In Massachusetts, Gov. Charlie Baker, also a Republican, allowed his lieutenant governor, Karyn Polito, to sign the bill, also with no comment. The governor’s office later issued a statement that the two leaders support the “Second Amendment to the Constitution and Massachusetts’ strict gun laws.”","Advocates for the bump-stock bans were successful in those two states because the NRA is not particularly strong in either one, said Adam Winkler, author of “Gunfight: The Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America,” and a law professor at the University of California at Los Angeles. And, in the case of New Jersey, Christie had nothing to fear from the gun lobby because he was on his way out.","The strength of the NRA and other gun groups, Winkler said, is that its supporters vote on guns as a single issue and turn out to vote. The gun-control community, by contrast, is not as single-minded, he said. He and others suggested that might be changing with the grass-roots movements that are developing after the Florida high school shooting.","“The student involvement is remarkable,” said Kristin Goss, a Duke University professor of public policy and author of “Disarmed: The Missing Movement for Gun Control in America.”","“Their involvement at critical-mass levels,” she said, “and their formal incorporation into national gun control organizations, is probably the most significant development on the pro-regulation side that I’ve seen since I began studying this issue two decades ago.”","Days after high school students demonstrated in his state, Republican Gov. Bill Haslam told Stateline early Friday that he would support a ban on bump stocks. There’s such a bill pending in his state Legislature.","Still, political analyst Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics, said recent mobilization of high school students is important — but not game-changing — because of the political entrenchment regarding guns.","“The parties are in their foxholes on so many issues, and this is a basic issue,” he said. “People think Republicans will be crawling out of their foxholes, and making their way across the DMZ to visit the Democrats. It’s not going to happen.”","In Virginia, for example, a House subcommittee in late January defeated a bump-stock ban, along with several other gun-control bills, on a party line 4-2 vote with Republicans in the majority, despite testimony from a state resident who had survived October’s Las Vegas shooting.","The subcommittee chairman, Republican Del. Thomas Wright of Amelia County, said that while he was sympathetic to the survivor, he did not think banning bump stocks was the answer.","“Until the evil in people’s hearts changes, the laws we pass cannot fix that,” he told a local news outlet.","Ari Freilich, staff attorney at the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, suggested that Trump’s support for a ban on bump stocks would be “helpful” but not necessarily enough in the states.","A bump-stock ban passed in the Washington state Senate, but it may not pass the House, where opponents argue it amounts to a path to “gun seizure.” Proposed bump-stock bans failed in Mississippi and New Mexico, states with high rates of gun ownership, according to a 2015 analysis published in the journal Injury Prevention. They already were illegal in California before the Las Vegas massacre.","Other states weighing bump-stock bans include Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Maryland, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina and Wisconsin.","Consider Georgia, where Democratic Rep. Mary Margaret Oliver introduced a bill last fall to ban bump stocks. The bill is still pending. Gun regulation supporters marched on the Georgia Capitol in recent days, but the outlook for stiffer regulation there is still bleak.","Jerry Henry, executive director of Georgia Carry, the predominant gun-rights group in the state, said he does not believe that there will be changes to gun laws this year. Henry said group members work to contact every state representative and senator each year to push their issue, demonstrating their single-minded commitment. Henry said they are less about giving money and more about personal contacts, reminding lawmakers of their presence.","Notably, the Pew Research Center (the Pew Charitable Trusts also funds Stateline) found last year that about 21 percent of gun owners have contacted a public official about gun policy, while just 12 percent of non-gun owners have.","“We do represent people who strongly believe in the Second Amendment,” Henry said. “If you start giving up one right, even a portion of a right, you will eventually lose all of them.”","Florida has some of the most lax gun laws in the nation, and legislators resisted efforts to tighten them after earlier shooting tragedies, including the massacre at an Orlando nightclub in 2016. The only laws Florida has passed recently are ones to expand concealed-carry rights or further loosen gun regulations.","Nevertheless, after high school students demonstrated and met with lawmakers in the past few days, the Florida House and Senate are readying a package of gun bills.","Those efforts include raising the minimum age to obtain and buy assault-style rifles from 18 to 21, providing more mental health counselors and security at schools, and enacting a waiting period for semi-automatic weapons purchases.","A bump-stock bill is also pending in the Florida Legislature, but lawmakers have not acted on it.","Stateline home page","Sign up for exclusive state policy reporting and research"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a9425c31e000048057acd66.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"QUEER VOICES","headline":"Civil Rights Act Protects LGBTQ Workers, Federal Court Rules","authors":"Daniel Wiessner, Reuters","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/civil-rights-act-protects-lgbtq-workers_us_5a94323ee4b01f65f598dae4","short_description":"The ruling went against a court brief filed by the Trump administration last year.","date":"2018-02-26"},"articleContent":["(Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court in Manhattan on Monday ruled that a federal law banning sex bias in the workplace also prohibits discrimination against gay employees, becoming only the second court to do so.","The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overruled prior decisions and said that a worker’s sex is necessarily a factor in discrimination based on sexual orientation.","The ruling went against a court brief filed by the Trump administration in 2017 that said Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was not intended to provide protections to gay workers.","The 2nd Circuit revived a lawsuit by the estate of Donald Zarda, a former skydiving instructor who said he was fired after he told a customer he was gay and she complained.

Conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch, the court’s newest justice and the likely deciding vote, did not speak during the argument.","Fellow conservatives Anthony Kennedy and Samuel Alito were particularly forceful in questioning the lawfulness of the fees, based on the notion that collective bargaining is in essence a political activity. Unions argue that their political activity is separate from negotiating contracts.","“Does this case affect the political influence of unions?” Kennedy asked union lawyer David Frederick.","“Yes,” Frederick said.","“Isn’t that the end of this case?” Kennedy said.","Liberal Justice Elana Kagan stressed how disruptive a ruling against the unions would be, leading to thousands of labor contracts being renegotiated and striking down laws in more than 20 states.","“When have we ever done something like that?” Kagan asked.","Dueling groups of protesters gathered outside the white marble courthouse ahead of the scheduled one-hour argument.","Union-backed protesters held signs saying “America needs union jobs,” while those supporting the challengers had signs saying “stand with Mark,” a reference to the plaintiff in the case, Illinois state worker Mark Janus.","Two dozen states require payment of these so-called agency fees, covering roughly 5 million public-sector workers. A Supreme Court ruling disallowing these fees would deal a setback to American organized labor at a time when the movement already is in a reduced state compared to the past.","Depriving unions of agency fees could undermine their ability to spend in political races. They typically back Democratic candidates over Republicans.","SIMILAR CASE IN 2016","The justices considered a similar case in 2016, and after hearing arguments appeared poised to overturn a 1977 Supreme Court precedent that let unions force non-members covered by contracts negotiated by organized labor to pay fees in lieu of union dues to help cover non-political union expenditures.","But the death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia the following month left the court with an even split of conservatives and liberals, and its 4-4 decision in March 2016 failed to settle the legal question. The Monday’s argument did not illuminate whether Gorsuch will, as expected, join his conservative colleagues in ruling against the unions.","Republican President Donald Trump’s appointment of Gorsuch last year restored the Supreme Court’s conservative majority.","The 2016 case was brought by non-union California public school teachers. Janus, the plaintiff in the current case, is a child-support specialist for the state of Illinois who opted not to join the union that represents employees like him, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME).","In both cases, the challengers argued that being forced to pay the agency fees to unions whose views they may not share violates their rights to free speech and free association under the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment.","Unions in both cases contended that mandatory agency fees are needed in order to eliminate the problem of what they call “free riders” ― non-members who benefit from union representation, for example through salary and working conditions obtained in collective bargaining ― without actually paying for it.","More than a hundred people loudly demonstrated outside the courthouse.","Jeralee Smith, a retired teacher, came out to support Janus in the case. “To force a person to pay for something with which we disagree is a travesty for democracy,” she said.","Dexter Guptill, a computer support technician for the American Federation of Teachers, said that if the justices rule against the unions, “my co-workers would wind up being forced to spend their effort representing essentially free riders.”","Twenty-four states have agency fee requirements. While 28 states have so-called right-to-work laws that prohibit mandatory agency fees, Wisconsin and Michigan have exceptions for police officers and firefighters that permit agency fees covering those workers. In those right-to-work states, unions still represent workers but membership rates are lower.","Federal employee unions cannot collect agency fees.","(Reporting by Lawrence Hurley; Additional reporting by Robert Iafolla and Andrew Chung; Editing by Will Dunham)"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a944bdd2000003800eb0015.jpeg?cache=FmcakSM9TX&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"BUSINESS","headline":"Weinstein Company To Seek Bankruptcy After Last-Ditch Sale Talks Collapse","authors":"Dominique Mosbergen","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/weinstein-company-bankruptcy_us_5a93cd2be4b03b55731db73c","short_description":"The board of disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein's former company ended negotiations to sell the studio for $500 million.","date":"2018-02-26"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Supreme Court Denies Trump Request To Hear Dreamer Lawsuit","authors":"Elise Foley and Roque Planas","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-daca_us_5a8dabdfe4b00a30a251c495","short_description":"The decision means the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program will remain in effect -- for now.","date":"2018-02-26"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Ivanka Trump Doesn't Know If Teachers Should Be Armed","authors":"Nick Visser","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ivanka-trump-teachers-armed_us_5a936fbee4b03b55731d79a6","short_description":"“I think that having a teacher who is armed ... is not a bad idea, but it is an idea that needs to be discussed.\"","date":"2018-02-26"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Florida Survivors Defend Sheriff Against Republican Calls To Oust Him","authors":"Willa Frej","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/florida-shooting-survivors-defend-sheriff_us_5a940f5ae4b03b55731e1682","short_description":"\"We don’t know about the 999 other times where they did do things to save us,” one student said.","date":"2018-02-26"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"QUEER VOICES","headline":"New Series Takes Hilarious And Unapologetic Look At Open Marriage","authors":"Curtis M.

Walkowiak, was “grateful” to the administrators at West Catholic High School for standing by the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church.","“As a mission of the Catholic Church, Catholic schools are places where students come to learn and know the Church’s teachings, one of which is the definition of marriage as a union between one man and one woman,” the statement read. “For this reason, Catholic school administrators, teachers, or staff members that persist in public acts that are contrary to Catholic teachings disqualify themselves from the opportunity to continue in their leadership role within a Catholic school.”","On Facebook, Nelson’s girlfriend, Maria Roberts, was critical of how the school treated her partner, saying that “this is not how God would treat someone.”","“Your students will remember this, their parents will remember this,” Roberts wrote on Facebook. “The players will remember how you pushed away their coach, how you ripped a role model from their lives, how you made it clear that you may preach love but contradict yourself time and time again.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a9488e61e0000fb077ace00.jpeg?cache=KdJJBeUZ9k&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"BLACK VOICES","headline":"BLM's Alicia Garza Launches Census Project To Mobilize Black Political Power","authors":"Taryn Finley","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/black-lives-matter-census-project-alicia-garza_us_5a9429fce4b02cb368c42d52","short_description":"The Black Census Project is the first initiative of Garza's Black Futures Lab.","date":"2018-02-26"},"articleContent":["Black Lives Matter co-founder Alicia Garza has created a new initiative aimed at helping black communities achieve greater political power.","Garza on Monday announced the launch of Black Futures Lab, which promises to “develop strategies that help Black people imagine the political, social and economic alternatives needed at the local, state, and federal level, while also building the political power needed to implement those alternatives.”","Conditions for black people in America are “incredibly dire,” and it’s important to have avenues for policy changes that benefit black communities, Garza told HuffPost.","“We have a president that is openly supportive of white nationalist groups and working alongside his administration to dismantle the tatters of what was left of a safety net in this country and also working hard to dismantle organizations that work for the end of economic and political and emotional support of black people,” Garza said.","“Coming out of the 2016 election there was a few things that became really clear,” she continued. “One, that black people deserve to have vehicles that represent the breadth of our interests.

The project aims to capture the range of issues black people are facing in their lives ― something the U.S. Census is limited in doing.","Survey questions include such subjects as political attitudes and participation, organization affiliation, experiences with racism and police violence, perceptions of social movements, access to adequate health care and economic well being.","“We really have a wide breadth of questions that we’re asking folks to tell us more about and the census doesn’t really do that,” Garza said. “There’s a lot of questions about what a census will be under the Trump administration and so, data is not neutral. Our data is also not neutral. We want to know about the full breadth of experiences that black folks are having, and we also are asking about our business and what it is we want to see happen in order to address the problems in our communities.”","The project’s goal is 200,000 completed surveys before Aug. 1. In addition to an online survey, representatives will collect responses door to door. The Black Census Project will target 20 states, looking at urban and rural communities as well as neighborhoods with a high population of LGBTQ people, immigrants, and incarcerated people.","“It’s time for a survey that really captures the experiences that black people are facing in these communities and it’s time to do that in a way that also captures the diversity of communities that black folks are living in,” Garza said. “We really want to capture the breadth and the complexity of who are communities are and we plan to use that information to influence decisions that are made about us.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a944b99210000ed066025a3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Donald Trump's Personal Pilot Reportedly On Shortlist To Run FAA","authors":"Nick Visser","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-john-dunkin-faa_us_5a938efce4b01e9e56bd20f0","short_description":"“John Dunkin isn’t just a pilot,” a White House source told Axios.","date":"2018-02-26"},"articleContent":["President Donald Trump’s personal pilot is reportedly one of several people under consideration to lead the Federal Aviation Administration.","Axios was the first to report that John Dunkin, who has worked for Trump since before he became president, was on a shortlist to lead the FAA.

Martin’s fantasy world. But in real life, he has been delving into Catholic religious history ― in particular the works of Teilhard, who was part of the Jesuit religious order and studied paleontology.","Last week, Bentley presented his research, including the long-unseen document, at Scotland’s University of Edinburgh. He also staged a reading of “Inquisition,” a play he wrote about the moral dilemma Teilhard faced before signing that document.","Teilhard’s theological writings were heavily influenced by his beliefs about evolution. The priest, who was born in 1881, attempted to blend modern science with the teachings of Christianity, arguing that evolution was progressing toward a final point of unity that would bring all creation closer to God and usher in the second coming of Christ.","Teilhard’s belief in a “cosmic redemption” didn’t sit well with the Catholic Church of his time. In 1925, he was asked to sign a document affirming six traditional church teachings about the Biblical creation story. As Bentley explained to the Scottish Catholic Observer, Teilhard acquiesced to five of the six theological statements, but struggled with one because of his scientific convictions.","“He had to sign up to all six and he was prepared to sign five of the six, but the fourth proposition he felt he couldn’t sign up to because, as a scientist, he didn’t believe it was true,” the actor said.","Eventually, Teilhard signed and affirmed all of propositions.","But even after he signed the six propositions, he faced pushback from the church for his beliefs. In 1962, the Vatican office now known as the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith issued a monitum, an official warning, against unquestioning acceptance of Teilhard’s ideas. The Jesuits banned his major works from publication during his lifetime.","After Teilhard’s death in 1955, his works began to grow in popularity among the faithful. The priest was praised by Pope Benedict XVI and even cited in Pope Francis’ encyclical on the environment, “Laudato Si.” Last November, the Vatican’s Council for Culture asked Francis to revoke the monitum imposed on Teilhard’s work.","Bentley, who had been seeking the 1925 document for some time, hunted through “folder after folder” in the Jesuit Archives before finding the six propositions, the Observer reports."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a946ec72000003800eb004c.jpeg?cache=FkURr9wjOK&ops=crop_14_0_1750_1797%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Tammy Baldwin Aims To Win Back Rural Trump Country Running As A Progressive","authors":"Amanda Terkel","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tammy-baldwin-progressive_us_5a8f5c33e4b01e9e56b9ed11","short_description":"\"If your solutions are progressive solutions, I think that’s OK.\"","date":"2018-02-26"},"articleContent":["STOCKHOLM, Wis. ― On a cold, icy day in February, a couple dozen people were tucked into the Stockholm Pie and General Store, the heart of this tiny village along the Mississippi River. The gathering was actually sizable, considering the population of Stockholm is just 66.","Stockholm is right in Donald Trump country. Pepin County went for Trump by a solid 25 points in the last election, the first time it backed a Republican presidential candidate since 1972.","But Pepin County also voted for Democrat Tammy Baldwin by 3 percentage points, when she ran for Wisconsin’s open U.S. Senate seat in 2012. So for now, Pepin is also Baldwin territory, and the people who turned out on Presidents Day were there to meet with her and figure out how they can help her get re-elected in November.","Pepin is one of 13 unusual counties in Wisconsin that voted for Trump and Sen. Ron Johnson (R) in 2016; President Barack Obama in both 2008 and 2012; Gov. Scott Walker (R) in 2010, 2012 and 2014; and Baldwin in 2012. More than any other place in the state, they have gone back and forth between parties in recent years.","Pepin County and other rural areas in the western part of Wisconsin may not seem like fertile land for one of the Senate’s most liberal members. But they’re key to Baldwin’s re-election strategy this year.","Tony Bowe, a dairy farmer in Chippewa Falls, is the type of voter Baldwin needs. Bowe voted for Trump, but he said he’s also backing Baldwin, who has visited his farm in the past.","“I think she’s been working real well, especially trying to get the Dairy Pride Act passed through,” Bowe said after a roundtable discussion on dairy farming in Altoona with Baldwin.","Bowe, who said he backed Trump “because the Democrats didn’t have a good candidate,” chuckled when asked how he thinks the president is doing.","“It’s hard to say,” he said. “One day he’s one way, the next day he’s the other way.”","Baldwin is not like most of her Democratic Senate colleagues who are up for re-election from states that went to Trump and are known as moderate or conservative Democrats.","The site FiveThirtyEight, which tracks how often members of Congress vote with Trump, found that Baldwin is near the bottom ― right along with Democratic senators from significantly bluer states such as Massachusetts, New York and California.","So when Trump was looking for Senate Democrats from states he carried to potentially cross the aisle and back the tax bill, he wasn’t looking toward Baldwin.","“If your solutions are progressive solutions, I think that’s OK,” Baldwin told HuffPost in an interview.","Wisconsinites in the western part of the state who like Baldwin, however, rarely mentioned her progressive bonafides when they were naming reasons they support her. Over and over, they said she’s responsive and willing to work with others. She is, in other words, typically Midwestern nice. (Being nice is so prized that one woman at the Stockholm meet-and-greet objected to the term “Minnesota nice,” saying that state shouldn’t get to own the quality.)","“Her reaching out across the aisle to work on bills is really important...because that shows she’s hopefully able to bridge that divide,” said Todd Macklem, a teacher in Cameron who attended a gathering of local Democrats and grassroots activists for Baldwin in Rice Lake Monday night.","Many of the issues that Baldwin emphasizes when she’s back home aren’t traditionally partisan either. With the dairy farmers in Altoona, talk centered around her Dairy Pride Act ― which would bar competitive products like almond and soy milk from being labeled “milk” ― and an amendment she successfully included in the recent budget deal that provides help for dairy farmers.","She and her staff also promote her “Buy America” legislation that would require the federal government to use U.S. manufacturers for certain public projects. Trump has said he backs this idea, lending some bipartisan bonafides to Baldwin’s bill ― but the senator is always quick to note her position has nothing to do with the president.","“I have worked on ‘Buy America’ since back when Donald Trump ran beauty pageants,” Baldwin said to the crowd at Rice Lake.","Baldwin told HuffPost she thought it was “pretty great” that Trump touted the legislation, which she told the president about when she first met him. But she’s skeptical anything more will happen on his side.","“Again, I’m willing to sit down with anyone who wants to solve problems. But he’s a lot of words and no action,” she told HuffPost. “He’s never taken a follow-up of calling [Republican congressional leaders] Mitch McConnell or Paul Ryan and saying, let’s work together on getting this through. Then his infrastructure plan came out with no mention of Buy America, which is horrifying to me.”","It isn’t all local, nonpartisan issues. She often stresses the importance of Obamacare and criticizes the recent Republican tax law.","Baldwin said she has no problem criticizing Trump. But she isn’t making him a focus of her campaign, and she’s not bringing him up every chance she gets. Indeed, during her three-stop swing through western Wisconsin last week, she mentioned Trump only once or twice by name, although she referenced “the president” a few other times. For one of the most liberal members of the Senate, Baldwin hardly talked fiery resistance rhetoric all day long.","“I’m not afraid to stand up to anyone who’s trying to rig the system. And I’m not afraid to sit down with anyone who can help come up with solutions,” Baldwin said.","As of now, two Republicans are duking it out in the primary to face Baldwin in November. Leah Vukmir is a conservative member of the state Senate who has won endorsements from powerful Wisconsin GOP politicians.","She’s up against Kevin Nicholson, a veteran with degrees from Ivy League universities who also presents himself as a conservative. Nicholson is, however, also the former president of the national College Democrats of America who spoke at the 2000 Democratic National Convention. Supporters say he’s a fresh face who came around to the power of conservative ideas, while detractors say he’s an opportunist who can’t be trusted.","But in addition to running for re-election in a state that has been trending Republican, Baldwin is up against an enormous amount of conservative spending and the political machine of the state’s Republican governor, who is also on the ballot this year.","Conservative groups have so far spent at least $3.1 million against Baldwin, which is more than what all the other Democratic Senate incumbents on the ballot this year have faced combined (under $550,000), according to a Center for Responsive Politics report in November.","Those figures reflect what these groups have publicly reported to the Federal Election Commission. But the Baldwin campaign has tracked the spending on ads ― which so-called dark money groups don’t necessarily have to report to the FEC ― and found there’s even more money flowing into the state.","According to data from the Baldwin campaign, outside groups have spent $6.3 million against her. About $3.1 million of that has come from groups connected to Illinois billionaire Dick Uihlein, who is supporting Nicholson. And $3 million has come from groups affiliated with the conservative megadonors, Charles and David Koch.","Liberal groups, meanwhile, have spent about $3.1 million to support Baldwin.","It’s not a fluke that there’s so much money on the air now against Baldwin, one of the last remaining Democrats serving statewide. The Koch brothers have made clear that their strategy is to go up early, to shape voters’ opinions long before the election.","But expect this dark money to stay on the air until the end too. In 2016, when much of the GOP establishment stopped investing in the race, because it figured Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) would lose, conservative super PACs stayed on the air. Ultimately, all that money helped him pull off a surprise upset of his Democratic opponent, Russ Feingold.","“Special interests have special interests, and I stand up to them,” Baldwin said, on why she’s facing so much conservative spending. “It sometimes defies the imagination how much change we’ve seen with regard to spending on campaigns.”","Republican ads against Baldwin initially focused on her support for Obamacare, but as that issue has receded for Republicans, they’ve focused more on her opposition to the tax law and on a scandal at the Veterans Affairs’ medical center in Tomah, Wisconsin, which is likely to come up more throughout the race.","The GOP has accused Baldwin of not acting aggressively enough to address the overprescription of opioids at the facility, where the Center for Investigative Reporting has noted there have been dozens of suspicious deaths.","Baldwin ended up firing an aide and disciplined three others over the controversy and introduced legislation intended to address opiate drug prescriptions at the VA.\n\nVoteVets, a progressive group, recently went up with an ad trying to counter some of the Republican messaging on Tomah.","One major thing Baldwin has going for her this time is the energy of the resistance on the left. Baldwin said the difference between this year and her run in 2012 is “night and day” in terms of the grassroots help she’s getting.","That energy showed its force in Wisconsin state Senate district 10. Democrat Patty Schachtner pulled off a surprise victory in a special election in this district bordering Minnesota in January, winning by 11 percentage points.","The seat was solidly red in recent years. A Republican, who left to join Walker’s Cabinet, had held the state Senate seat since 2001. Trump won the district by 17 points. Walker called Schachtner’s win a “wake-up call” for his party.","Schachtner said she never expected to win. She figured that if she lost by 10 points, it would be considered a successful race.","She credited her victory, in part, to the volunteers who promoted her candidacy: Groups like the Forward Action Wisconsin Network and Indivisible chapters were incredibly active. Schachtner also said she appreciated the support of Postcards to Voters ― a national network of volunteers who handwrite personal postcards to voters in districts all over the country. She said people in her district who received those postcards really appreciated them.","“That big money machine is going to be there, but it’s really that grassroots network ― it’s really there,” Schachtner said.","Schachtner said she knew of plenty of folks who voted for Trump; but they told her they backed her because they knew and trusted her. She didn’t talk about Walker or Trump in her race.","Her advice to Baldwin on how much to mention the president? “Never.”","“I think there are a group of people who voted for him just because they couldn’t vote for Hillary,” she added, “and now they feel somewhat responsible for all the angst that’s going on, and they don’t want it rubbed in their face.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8f5cd42000002d00eafb85.jpeg?cache=OyKNzTlf6x&ops=crop_0_9_4032_2748%2Cscalefit_1280_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Heather Locklear Arrested For Alleged Domestic Violence Against Her Boyfriend","authors":"Jenna Amatulli","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/heather-locklear-arrested-domestic-violence_us_5a943a55e4b01f65f598eb65","short_description":"The actress is also accused of battering three deputies when they tried to take her away.","date":"2018-02-26"},"articleContent":["Heather Locklear was arrested for felony domestic violence as well as battery on a police officer on Sunday night.","Law enforcement told TMZ and ET Online that a call was received about a domestic disturbance at a residence in Thousand Oaks, California.

With that goal in mind, right after the 2016 election we were inspired to create the first version of The Flipside as a tool with a very simple premise: to allow readers to explore the diversity of stories trending on Twitter at any given time on a handful of topics.","Shortly after the initial launch in April of 2017, our team evaluated performance along with user feedback, and immediately identified areas of improvement. In addition to some design and functionality issues, we also realized the experience was not ideal for mobile users.","Taking in all these lessons learned, we reimagined and rebuilt The Flipside from the ground up. We’re proud to introduce this new and improved version today.

We then parse the tweets for those that contain links to entries from those news sources we’re interested in, and then we list the most recent tweet and stories.","Regarding the methodology: Ideological rankings come from a 2016 study on the political stances of news outlets by the American Association for Public Opinion Research. Not all of the news organizations featured in The Flipside were ranked in this study, so the tool does not include the toggle for those sources.","The Flipside experience is a brand-sponsored initiative which will launch in conjunction with the premiere of the upcoming Hulu Original, ‘The Looming Tower’.

Since the Feb. 14 shooting that killed 17 people, Gonzalez has been an outspoken critic of the National Rifle Association and legislators who take money from the gun rights group.","Gonzalez began her essay by listing a few qualities about herself: She’s Cuban-American, bisexual and loves to sew, embroider and paint. Anything, she says, she can do while watching Netflix. But that doesn’t matter, Gonzalez points out. What does matter is swift and targeted action against senseless gun violence.","“What matters is that the majority of American people have become complacent in a senseless injustice that occurs all around them,” she wrote. “What matters is that most American politicians have become more easily swayed by money than by the people who voted them into office. What matters is that my friends are dead, along with hundreds upon hundreds of others all over the United States.”","The South Florida attack at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School is the 17th school shooting in 2018 alone, according to Everytown for Gun Safety, based on reports of any type of gunfire at or near a school. Since then, student activists including Gonzalez have organized, rallied and called on lawmakers to enact stricter gun laws.","Gonzalez reiterated that students who survived the shooting are “tired of being ignored.”\n\n“We are speaking up for those who don’t have anyone listening to them, for those who can’t talk about it just yet, and for those who will never speak again,” she wrote. “We are grieving, we are furious, and we are using our words fiercely and desperately because that’s the only thing standing between us and this happening again.”\n\nShe chastised those who have criticized her and her fellow teen activists for being too emotional.\n\n“Adults are saying that children are emotional,” she wrote. “I should hope so ― some of our closest friends were taken before their time because of a senseless act of violence that should never have occurred. If we weren’t emotional, they would criticize us for that, as well.”\n\nAnd she had a clear message for any adults who believe her and the other teens are being disrespectful.\n\n“Adults are saying that children are disrespectful. But how can we respect people who don’t respect us? We have always been told that if we see something wrong, we need to speak up; but now that we are, all we’re getting is disrespect from the people who made the rules in the first place. Adults like us when we have strong test scores, but they hate us when we have strong opinions.”","The high school senior also pointed out how problematic it is that President Donald Trump suggested addressing gun violence by arming teachers.","“Teachers do not need to be armed with guns to protect their classes, they need to be armed with a solid education in order to teach their classes,” she wrote. “That’s the only thing that needs to be in their job description.”","Gonzalez concluded her essay with a powerful metaphor: “It should not be easier to purchase a gun than it is to obtain a driver’s license, and military-grade weapons should not be accessible in civilian settings. You don’t drive a NASCAR on the street, no matter how fun it might be, just like you don’t need an AR-15 to protect yourself when walking home at night. No one does.”","","The most important takeaway, she noted, is that the survivors of this tragedy can hope to do what the victims are not able to do: return to a safe school to continue their education.","","“We want to know that when we walk onto campus, we won’t have to worry about the possibility of staring down the barrel of a gun. We want to fix this problem so it doesn’t occur again, but mostly we want people to forget about us once this is over,” Gonzalez wrote. “We want to go back to our lives and live them to the fullest in respect for the dead.”","Head over to Harper’s Bazaar to read Gonzalez’s full essay."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a947b652000003800eb005c.jpeg?cache=Xk81rdM64Y&ops=crop_0_174_5886_3863%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"'Notting Hill' Actress Emma Chambers Dead At 53","authors":"Cole Delbyck","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/notting-hill-actress-emma-chambers-dead-at-53_us_5a940c41e4b01e9e56bda9b1","short_description":"Co-star Hugh Grant remembered her as a \"hilarious and a very warm person.\"","date":"2018-02-26"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Watergate Figure John Dean Says Rick Gates' Testimony Could Be The End Of The Trump Presidency","authors":"Ed Mazza","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-dean-gates-trump_us_5a938492e4b03b55731d85ce","short_description":"\"Increasingly it appears Manafort is the link to Russian collusion.\"","date":"2018-02-26"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"SPORTS","headline":"Influential NBA Agent Dan Fegan Dead In Car Crash","authors":"","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dan-fegan-dead-nba-agent_us_5a93b187e4b03b55731da2f6","short_description":"Two passengers riding with Fegan, his 5-year-old son and a 29-year-old California woman, sustained serious injuries and were airlifted to a hospital in Denver.","date":"2018-02-26"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Bill Cosby's Daughter Ensa Dies At Age 44","authors":"Gina Cherelus, Reuters","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bill-cosby-daughter-ensa-dies-44_us_5a946b22e4b01f65f59937e9","short_description":"Bill Cosby’s daughter, Ensa Cosby, died from a chronic kidney disease.","date":"2018-02-26"},"articleContent":["NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bill Cosby’s daughter, Ensa Cosby, who came to her father’s defense last year against accusations that he had sexually assaulted numerous women, has died at age 44 from a chronic kidney disease, a family spokesman said on Monday.\n\nEnsa Cosby, the second-youngest of the entertainer’s five children and the third of his four daughters, died from renal disease, according to the spokesman, Andrew Wyatt.

That’s just superfluous action taking away from the real point of the show, which was saying goodbye to Carl, who is pretty definitely dead.","After the younger Grimes shared some emotional moments with various characters, including his baby sister, and schooled his dad, Rick (Andrew Lincoln), with a speech on making the world a better place and not just murdering all the Saviors, we hear a gunshot as Carl takes his own life offscreen. Cut to seeing him under a sheet as Michonne (Danai Gurira) and Rick prepare to bury him.","Sure, he might show up in future dream sequences or hallucinations, but that’s basically it for the character.","Riggs said his farewell in a tweet.","Plus, AMC probably wouldn’t have sent out these delicious pudding bars if Carl was gonna survive.","I actually wish they’d kill Carl every week, if it means more pudding bars. But for others, the gesture wasn’t so sweet.","Truly, the backlash to Carl’s death has been going on since the Season 8 midseason finale late last year, when fans learned he was suffering from a zombie bite and would likely die in the next episode.","The character is pivotal in the comics ― and still has a lot of storylines that the show hasn’t explored ― so viewers were livid, calling for showrunner Scott Gimple to be fired. Even Chandler Riggs’ father posted (and later deleted) a scathing Facebook comment about Gimple after Carl’s upcoming death was revealed. (Riggs’ father did not reply to HuffPost’s request for comment.)","In a conference call a few days before Sunday’s episode, Riggs gave his response to the intense fan reaction and his thoughts on his character’s impending death.","“When [the midseason finale] first aired, the amount of messages that I got on Reddit, the amount of comments that I got on Instagram and then Twitter and everything, it was really just kind of overwhelming to see the amount of support from fans that were super sad to see my character go,” he said. “But the majority of them were just really, really excited to see where I go next, and that’s kind of the attitude that I had towards it, and I’m really happy that a lot of my fans had the same attitude towards it as well.”","More upsetting than his character dying is the manner in which Carl got the zombie bite, which was objectively pretty lame. After surviving seven seasons of zombies and making it out of impossible situations, Carl decides to try to kill a small group of walkers with the help of Siddiq (Avi Nash). After struggling with a one of them, he falls over. And boom. A bite. Oh, and he had a gun, so he could’ve just shot them the whole time.","Riggs himself joked about the death on Twitter.","Regardless, he claims he’s not salty. During the conference call, he explained how the death and the speech he gave to Rick will affect the show in the future.","“I’m not bitter about it. It’s such, like, an innocent way to go out, and it’s kind of what Carl’s really embodying in these last episodes and kind of sums up Carl as a whole and proves that he knows that there is something after the war. It’s not just killing and killing and killing and killing. There’s got to be some sort of hope for Judith and for Maggie’s baby and anyone,” he said.","In an interview with HuffPost late last year, we asked Gimple (the man who had the final word on Carl’s death sentence) about fans’ responses to the reveal, and he admitted, yeah, it’s been rough.","“I’m focused more on the show itself. I’m just thinking about Chandler, and the cast and crew and all the people put together, but it’s tough,” he said. “I knew it would be tough for the people who have been following the story for so long, and it’s the kind of turns the story takes that are so painful.”","Gimple also stressed that the events of the midseason premiere were critical to the “whole story” and how it will affect the other characters.","“This is just the start of that,” he said. “I really hope people see that as well.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a907c821e000046057acab1.jpeg?ops=crop_16_439_1064_911%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"WEIRD NEWS","headline":"News Anchor Has To Wing It When Pink Bird Flies On Her Head","authors":"David Moye","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nichelle-medina-pink-bird-on-head_us_5a94513ae4b01f65f599075b","short_description":"This is one bird-brained blooper.","date":"2018-02-26"},"articleContent":["TV news is really for the birds sometimes.","Just ask Nichelle Medina, who co-hosts the morning news on San Diego station KFMB.","On Friday, Medina was doing a tease for an upcoming segment with the San Diego Zoo Safari Park when one of the guests literally flew in for a cameo right on cue, according to Inside Edition.","The unexpected guest was “Sophie,” a 10-year-old scarlet Ibis who flew in when Medina said: “Good for weeding your garden of bugs.”","When the bird landed on her noggin, she immediately winged this line: “Or flying onto my head.”","Medina’s co-anchor, Eric Kahnert, was impressed by the bird’s impeccable timing.","“How’s that for an introduction?” he asked.","Sophie managed to be removed from Medina’s head before it could build a nest.","For her part, the anchorwoman tried to see the positives from her impromptu Ibis interaction by pointing out it was a nice scalp massage.","“I needed that,” she quipped.","The video has started to go viral, something that Kahnert thought was ironic."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a9452552000007d06eb002c.png?cache=6YyAEQJPFm&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"LATINO VOICES","headline":"Akon Says His Bid To Restore Puerto Rico’s Power Was Rejected","authors":"Princess-India Alexander","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/akon-puerto-rico-power_us_5a9439b5e4b0699553caed58","short_description":"\"They don't care about the people,\" the rapper and co-founder of Akon Lighting Africa told TMZ.","date":"2018-02-26"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Trump, Who Cited Bone Spurs To Avoid Military Service, Claims He Would Have Fought Off Parkland Shooter Without A Weapon","authors":"Marina Fang","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-parkland-school-shooting_us_5a94341ce4b02cb368c44ab3","short_description":"“I really believe I’d run in there even if I didn’t have a weapon.\"","date":"2018-02-26"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Kanye West, Kim Kardashian Film 'Family Feud' Episode","authors":"David Moye","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kanye-west-kim-kardashian-family-feud_us_5a943504e4b01f65f598e1a4","short_description":"When host Steve Harvey asked Kardashian, \"What is a body part that you’re constantly bumping into things with?” she reportedly said, \"My butt.\"","date":"2018-02-26"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"WORLD NEWS","headline":"Colosseum In Rome Turns Red In Protest Of Pakistan's Blasphemy Law","authors":"Philip Pullella, Reuters","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/colosseum-rome-red-persecuted-christians_us_5a925d50e4b03b55731cdac8","short_description":"The ancient amphitheater was illuminated on Saturday to highlight the plight of persecuted Christians.","date":"2018-02-25"},"articleContent":["ROME (Reuters) ― Rome’s ancient Colosseum was lit in red on Saturday in solidarity with persecuted Christians, particularly Asia Bibi, a woman condemned to death under Pakistan’s blasphemy laws.","Hundreds gathered on a rainy night outside the Roman amphitheater that is a symbol of the martyrdom of early Christians to hear the husband and daughter of Asia Bibi.","The Catholic woman has been living on death row in Pakistan since 2010, when she was condemned for allegedly making derogatory remarks about Islam after neighbors objected to her drinking water from their glass because she was not Muslim.","Human rights groups such as Amnesty International say the blasphemy law is increasingly exploited by religious extremists as well as ordinary Pakistanis to settle personal scores.","“The aim of the blasphemy laws is crush people who believe differently,” Archbishop Nunzio Galantino, secretary-general of the Italian bishops conference, told the gathering.","The law does not define blasphemy and evidence might not be reproduced in court for fear of committing a fresh offense.

It said the proposal had been made by the party’s Central Committee, the largest of its elite ruling bodies. The proposal also covers the vice president position.\n\nXi, 64, is currently required by China’s constitution to step down as president after two five-year terms. Nearing the end of his first term, he will be formally elected to a second at the annual meeting of China’s largely rubber-stamp parliament opening on March 5.\n\nThere is no limit on his tenure as the party and military chief, though a maximum 10-year term is the norm. He began his second term as head of the party and military in October at the end of a party congress held once every five years.\n\nZhang Lifan, a historian and political commentator, said the news was not unexpected, and it was hard to predict exactly how long Xi could stay on in power.\n\n“In theory he could serve longer than Mugabe but in reality, no one is sure exactly what will happen,” Zhang said, referring to Zimbabwe’s former president whose four decades in office ended in November, after the army and his former political allies moved to force him out.\n\nThough positive remarks filled the comments section under the pages of main state media outlets like the People’s Daily, the move was not welcomed by everyone on China’s Twitter-like Weibo service,\n\n“If two terms are not enough, then they can write in a third term, but there needs to be a limit. Getting rid of it is not good!,” wrote one Weibo user.\n\nEMPEROR XI\n\nConstitutional reform needs to be approved by parliament, which is stacked with members chosen for their loyalty to the party - meaning the reform will not be blocked.\n\nThere has been persistent speculation that Xi wants to stay on in office past the customary two five-year terms.\n\nThe October party congress ended without appointing a clear eventual successor for Xi.\n\nHowever, the role of party chief is more senior than that of president. At some point, Xi could be given a party position that also enables him to stay on as long as he likes.\n\nXi is currently the party’s general secretary, but not chairman. China’s first three leaders after the founding of the People’s Republic in 1949 all carried the title party chairman -Mao Zedong, Hua Guofeng and then Hu Yaobang. It has not been used since.\n\n“Whether Xi ends up being Party Chairman or just remains Party Secretary doesn’t really matter. What matters is whether he holds onto power,” said Zhang Ming, a professor of political science at Renmin University of China in Beijing.\n\n“Titles don’t matter as much in China as they do in the West. Here what matters is whether you are the emperor,” he added. “In China, ordinary people already consider Xi Jinping to be the emperor.”\n\nEYES ON VICE PRESIDENT\n\nMao, the founder of Communist China and still held in god-like awe by many Chinese, died while still Communist Party chairman in 1976, having never retired.\n\nState media has also increasingly been using the term “lingxiu” to refer to Xi, which means “leader”. Distinct from the standard usage of “lingdao” for leader, “lingxiu” evokes grander, almost spiritual, connotations.\n\nMao, for example, was referred to as “lingxiu”, but Xi’s two immediate predecessors, Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, were not.\n\nIn a Sunday commentary on its WeChat account, state television said: “The people love the people’s ‘lingxiu’!”, above a picture of Xi being greeted by an adoring crowd in Sichuan province earlier this month.\n\nThe move to lift the presidential term limits is not unexpected. The party has been laying the groundwork for Xi not to have to go.\n\nOne of Xi’s closest political allies, former top graft buster Wang Qishan, stepped down from the party’s Standing Committee - the seven-man body that runs China - in October.\n\nAged 69, Wang had reached the age at which top officials tend to retire. But he has been chosen as a parliament delegate this year and is likely to become vice president, sources with ties to the leadership and diplomats say.\n\nThe move is significant because if Wang does not retire, that would set a precedent for Xi to stay on in power too after he reaches what is normally considered retirement age.\n\nThe Central Committee also proposed other changes to the country’s constitution, including inserting “Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era” into the constitution, referring to Xi’s rather wordy guiding political thought that is already in the party constitution.\n\nThe constitution will further ensure that party control over the country is not in any doubt, too, strengthening existing clauses about the leading role of the Communist Party in China.\n\n“The leadership of the Communist Party of China is the defining feature of socialism with Chinese characteristics,” Xinhua cited one of the proposed new clauses as saying.\n\n(Reporting by Ben Blanchard and Sue-Lin Wong;

Dr. Gabriel Salguero, president of the National Latino Evangelical Coalition.","The “Prayers and Action” campaign is organized by Rev. Rob Schenck, an evangelical preacher from Washington, D.C.","Because of his background as a militant anti-abortion activist, Schenck is a controversial figure in progressive circles. Some have questioned his commitment to gun control, given his past statements and lifetime membership in the National Rifle Association ― which Schenck justifies by saying it was a gift from a financial supporter of his ministry and something he uses to “listen and learn” about the ideologies of those involved in popular gun culture.","But he says he’s modified his stance on gun legislation and become an ally in the fight for stricter gun laws. For years, he’s tried to encourage his faith community to break from its longstanding support of gun rights.","It’s a difficult task, but Schenck is optimistic. “I believe there is a change happening among evangelicals,” the preacher told HuffPost. “We will see a tipping point when many evangelicals will begin advocating for sensible gun safety measures.”","The ‘Prayers And Action’ Campaign","Schenck’s petition for gun reform started circulating in the evangelical community after a mass shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas, last November. It was released widely on Monday and has gathered over 200 signatures by Friday, according to the campaign’s site. Only a handful of those names are publicly listed on the site. The rest of the signatures are being funneled into a database that will be used to keep signers up to date with future actions, Schenck said.","The pastor told HuffPost that he wants to keep the petition an “evangelical family matter” and is hesitant to expose the signers to criticism from the larger faith community. His first purpose is to “find friends” in the community who care about gun reform.","And he thinks framing gun reform as an effort to “protect life” could help swing the conversation for evangelical Christians.","“Evangelicals believe deeply in the sanctity of every human life. Any public policy that contributes to a disregard for human life is a violation of this tenet,” Schenck told HuffPost. “The lives of children are especially precious to God and should always be for Christians.”","A Deep Loyalty To Guns","The task of rallying evangelical support for stricter gun control legislation is bound to be an uphill battle. As a whole, white American evangelicals are some of the strongest supporters of gun rights. A 2017 Pew Research Center survey found that 41 percent of white evangelicals own guns, more than members of other faith groups.","Pew could not break out black evangelical Protestants in the survey, due to a small sample size. However, the researchers did conclude that only 29 percent of a larger category, black Protestants, own a gun. (An estimated two-thirds of black Protestants identify as evangelicals.)","White evangelicals are more likely than most Americans to say that their right to own guns is essential to their sense of freedom (70 percent vs. 47 percent). Twenty-four percent of black Protestants said the same. White evangelicals also said that they are satisfied with gun laws in this country (44 percent). Sixteen percent of black Protestants agreed.","In addition, a 2013 survey from the Public Religion Research Institute found that many evangelicals don’t see a contradiction in labeling themselves “pro-life” while opposing gun control. In fact, among the white evangelical Protestants who said the term “pro-life” described them very well, a majority (64 percent) also said they opposed stricter gun control laws.","Schenck’s experiences have taught him that for many evangelicals, guns are a “volatile issue.” He believes evangelicals’ loyalty towards guns stems from deep-seated distrust of the government.","“Evangelicals have long felt like a persecuted minority, even though we enjoy some of the largest, most influential, and wealthiest churches and institutions in the country. This misperception makes many in my community fearful of government oppression,” he said.","“There is a deep emotional and psychological bond between people that are fearful and the instruments they feel will protect them, their loved ones, and their way of life,” Schenck told HuffPost.","A Broader ‘Pro-Life’ Movement","At the same time, Schenck senses that a change is brewing in some communities ― people are becoming increasingly concerned and anxious about gun violence, particularly mass shootings.","“More and more voices calling for restrictions on gun access are being heard. We are trying to curate those voices and give them a united platform to speak from,” Schenck told HuffPost about his campaign.","“We’ve been actively reaching out to evangelical leaders, mostly behind the scenes, and are finding many that are distressed by our seemingly unrestrained enthusiasm for easy gun access — and the perception that all evangelicals have a kind of bloodlust for firearms,” he added. “That’s not true, particularly when it comes to under-40 evangelicals and their pastors.”","The U.S. “right-to-life” movement is most closely associated with attempts to restrict women’s access to abortion and other forms of contraceptive care. But in recent years, certain factions of that movement are seeking to expand its goals. For some, that means advocating for refugees and immigrants. For others, that means standing against economic injustice and racism.","Kathryn Freeman, director of public policy for the ethics commission of the Baptist General Convention of Texas, is one of the evangelical leaders who publicly signed Schenck’s petition (although she pointed out she is not speaking on behalf of her organization). Freeman says she believes in working to support human flourishing “from the womb to the tomb.” For her, that includes supporting “common-sense gun legislation.”","“I am concerned about gun violence in this country, because I think to do nothing is to devalue human life, to treat that which God deems of ultimate value as of no value at all,” the Baptist leader told HuffPost. “Reducing gun violence is part of what it means to love God’s people and want them to flourish.”","For These Strange Bedfellows, The Ends Justify The Means","Over the years, Schenck has gone through an evolution in his views about gun reform. When he first began speaking up about this issue, he didn’t think the answer to gun violence would be found in more federal laws. In 2015, he claimed it wasn’t an issue about “gun control, but of self-control.”","Today, Schenck says he’s still hesitant about the phrase “gun control,” since it suggests to gun owners that the government is seeking to “control” their personal behavior. He prefers the phrase “gun regulation.”","He’s also hesitant about pushing for more federal controls, preferring that local and state governments take the lead. But he told HuffPost he now realizes that there are important instances when federal laws are needed ― such as when it comes to closing the gun show loophole and making sure all firearm purchases are routed through federal background checks.","“You have to deal with reality and the reality is that in many of these instances, the only remedy is on the federal level. I’ve acquiesced to that,” he said.","But the pastor is still a controversial figure on both sides of the debate about gun control. He’s faced criticism from conservatives for supporting stricter gun legislation at all. At the same time, progressives have questioned his background ― he helped organize the anti-abortion movement in the 1990s, at one point bringing a preserved fetus to a rally outside an abortion clinic. He also organized protests against the removal of Ten Commandments monuments from government property.","Lucy McBath is a faith and outreach leader for the gun control advocacy groups Everytown for Gun Safety and Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. She told HuffPost she’s known and worked with Schenck for about four years. The pair were the subjects of the documentary “Armor of Light,” a 2015 documentary about the evangelical response to gun violence.","McBath identifies as an evangelical Christian herself, but supports women’s right to make their own choices about their reproductive health. Although she and Schenck don’t see eye to eye on abortion, McBath said she supports Schenck’s efforts to rally the evangelical community around gun control. Not everyone in her movement is going to be happy with that stance, she said, but she believes people on opposite ends of the political spectrum are going to need to come together to try to solve the issue of gun violence.","“What I like to say to people is we need everybody,” McBath told HuffPost. “We need gun owners, we need non-gun owners, we need people of faith, people of no faith. We need everybody because gun violence is a nonpartisan issue. We all have to be able to come to some common ground to work together to make sure we’re changing this dangerous gun culture.”","Other gun control advocates seem to agree. The Rev. Jim Atwood, a board member of Coalition to Stop Gun Violence and a retired Presbyterian minister, said that he would welcomes the activism of Schenck and other evangelical Christians who want to fight for gun reform.","“I can’t speak for everybody but I would think that’s what we need to do,” Atwood told HuffPost. “We need to cross boundaries, cross lines of different political entities and work together.”","Looking at the list of prominent evangelicals who have publicly signed Schenck’s petition, McBath said she’s excited about the potential in that group. In her years as an activist, she said she’s never seen this level of support from evangelical leaders.","McBath hopes to see more of it.","“We need to see this kind of solidarity across denominational lines,” she said. “Because the end goal is saving lives.”","A Growing Sense Of Urgency","Dr. Jamie Aten, one of the signers of Schenck’s petition, is the executive director of the Humanitarian Disaster Institute at Wheaton College, an evangelical Christian institution. In that role, Aten helps churches prepare to respond to disasters in their communities, including mass shootings.","In the past, he said that he tried to avoid controversial topics like this. But now he believes that “silence only divides people further.”","“I think we owe it to the victims and survivors of mass shootings, and to each other, to do what we can to try and prevent this from happening again and prioritizing that in our policies,” Aten said.","After the shooting at the church in Sutherland Springs, congregations around the country grew increasingly worried about security. But unless sensible gun laws are passed, Aten worries that churches’ preparedness efforts will fall short. As it stands, he believes evangelical Christians’ affinity for gun culture “does more to protect our fear than it does the lives of innocent people.”","Rev. Dr. Joel Hunter, a former megachurch pastor from Florida who served as one of President Barack Obama’s spiritual advisers, also signed Schenck’s petition. He believes that a “pro-life ethic” is the key ingredient needed to move the needle on evangelicals’ beliefs about gun control. Hunter is optimistic that more members of his faith community will sign on to Schenck’s campaign after witnessing teenage activists protesting against guns since the Florida school shooting.","“I think the connection will be made, the more carnage that is accumulated,” Hunter said. “I think people will begin to see this as a life and death issue.”","Schenck said that as a pastor, he understands the strong emotions that evangelicals associated with gun rights ― particularly the fear they have about any supposed threats to those rights. But in the end, he hopes that his community will be patient and “listen before they judge.”","“I think we all want the same things, which is a safer world, a safer country, safer schools and communities, especially for our children,” Schenck said. “Nobody wants children to die. We have to find the best way to protect them, a way that is consistent with our core Christian convictions. That’s what we’re searching for.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8f2573210000c3006020b2.jpeg?cache=h6ukOjEaki&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"The RNC Asked Tweeters To Tell Donald Trump Their Priorities.

Hello, Bachelor World.","date":"2018-02-24"},"articleContent":["“The Bachelor Winter Games” was the spinoff we weren’t sure we wanted. Set up as counter-programming to NBC’s actual Winter Olympics and amid ABC’s own “Bachelor” season, the two-week show aired two nights a week, two hours per episode. The finale aired at the same time as the women’s figure-skating free skate, an event many in the “Bachelor” demographic surely hoped to catch.","And yet, despite all the annoyances of the “Winter Games,” which were many, we freaking loved it.","What made “The Bachelor Winter Games” so utterly winning? We have some theories: The international “Bachelor” stars injected some new personalities and refreshing genuineness into the house dynamic. Moving away from the competitive structure of “The Bachelor” and the musical-chairs structure of “Bachelor in Paradise” allowed relationships to solidify and bloom. People look adorable in sweaters and parkas.","By the time the finale rolled around, we found ourselves genuinely rooting for the couples that had emerged from the two-week series ― and one surprise couple who found true love after filming stopped.","We discussed our puppy love for “The Bachelor Winter Games” with writer Megan Angelo, who spent some time on the show’s Vermont set for a New York Times article.","Claire Fallon: Did this show work? Is this what they wanted to accomplish?","Emma Gray: I think it worked so well. I think they were looking for something that would be fun, exciting, that would inject some sort of new energy into the franchise and also just be good counter-programming while they know they’re gonna lose in the ratings because NBC has the Olympics. I feel like they really hit all of that. It was really refreshing to see a cast of people ― many who are a little older, a little more settled in their lives than what we’ve traditionally seen on “The Bachelor,” and coming from different cultures! Coming with different experiences. It just was more interesting to watch. The relationships that came out of it felt pretty authentic. I’m a sucker for this show! Megan, you were actually there for a couple of days!","Megan: I was there! Up in Vermont! I think what we saw on TV was really true to what I saw, which is the internationals are so ― they’re a breath of fresh air. They speak like real people. I just feel like, watching them I’m watching real people, I’m not watching people who have watched “The Bachelor” for two decades.","Emma: You mean they had vocabulary other than “amazing”?","Megan: There wasn’t a lot of, “I like this.” “I love that.” They’re talking! They’re real people. I hope they do the show again. There was sort of an authenticity to it that is missing from the main franchise sometimes.","Claire: It creates its own failure eventually. If New Zealand keeps having “The Bachelor,” you have to imagine eventually they will be as savvy about it as Luke Pell or whoever. No Bachelor here would be insane enough to allow it to become publicly known that he flipped a coin to pick his final person [like Jordan Mauger did]. I don’t think it’s a great thing to do, but it does show that sort of naivety about what the show is and can do to people, and how you have to present yourself. And the same thing happens with a new show like “[Bachelor in] Paradise” or “Winter Games,” is, the first season, people don’t really know what to expect who are on the show, so that shapes how they act. Some people stayed longer because they thought new people were gonna be brought in, which turned out not to happen. Next time they do it, that assumption won’t be there. So, eventually, it all ends up getting calcified in this way that makes us feel more cynical.","Emma: That was gonna be my next question. Do we think if they make this a yearly thing, it would sour pretty quickly? At first I loved “Paradise,” and then it’s gotten more exhausting as it has gone on. And we can’t fault people for understanding the bounds of what they’re stepping into. I would want to also.","I wonder if having internationals you might be able to drag out that excitement for a little bit longer just because you’re creating these cultural ― not conflicts, but this meeting of various cultural expectations.","Megan: I think if ABC does the show again, they would probably stretch out the format a little bit. Because unless you have the Olympics going on, it’s kind of awkward to just have two weeks, four episodes. So then I feel like they’re gonna get tempted to do the rolling cast thing where they bring it more cast. But I think that’s what brings sort of the cynical element. Because once new people start coming in, everyone’s like, “How am i gonna stay?” And it’s not as much about dating.","Claire: That’s the thing that brings in the relationship drama on “Paradise” ― people getting distracted by newer, more exciting, hotter cast members. And people being like, I wanna keep my options open. That doesn’t happen on “Winter Games,” because you know your options, you picked the best one.","Emma: I hope they don’t start bringing in the rolling cast! Not to say that it doesn’t work on a show like “Paradise,” but if you’re trying to do something different, do something different and stick to that.","Claire: [“Winter Games”] brought in one new cast member late, Jordan, because of his visa issues, and instead of creating drama, it sort of fixed the drama in this serendipitous way that probably would never happen again. Bibiana [Julian] had just been dumped, it seemed like pretty amicably, for Ashley [Iaconetti] by Kevin [Wendt], and then immediately was like, “this Jordan guy’s even better!” Which is amazing.","Emma: On “The Bachelor,” you’re waiting for your time all the time. Whereas on “Winter Games,” it’s a little more natural. I’ve gone away with a group of friends to a winter house where we play board games and go out in the snow, and some people make out with each other, and that felt like what this was.","Claire: You’ve always had experiences that are very similar to this show, and I’m like, people do that stuff? That’s great!","Emma: It’s just me trying to re-create my summer camp days all the time.","Claire: Someone said ― it was probably Robert Mills on Juliet’s podcast ― that they purposely didn’t bring in new cast members to make it more of a solidarity throughout the world like the Olympics thing, which is a nice sentiment. But I have to imagine they’re gonna be really tempted to start throwing in the elements that have worked for them in the past. And two weeks is not enough time to have a rolling cast coming through.","Emma: “Winter Games” felt different. It felt really fun. Well done, “Bachelor” franchise. I suppose.","To hear more about “The Bachelor Winter Games,” check out the full episode:","Subscribe to “Here to Make Friends”: Apple Podcasts / Acast / RadioPublic / Google Play / Stitcher / RSS","Do people love “The Bachelor,” “The Bachelorette” and “Bachelor in Paradise,” or do they love to hate these shows?

And then I’d like him to look at my record and see what I did,” Steele added. “I can’t believe an official of CPAC would go onstage in front of an audience and say something like that. I’ve been a strong supporter of CPAC for many years and I thought they raised them better than that here.”","Later Friday evening, Walters called Steele in an attempt to apologize.","In a phone interview afterward on MSNBC’s “Last Word with Lawrence O’Donnell,” Steele said Walters “related it back to Barack Obama’s election” in a call with Steele.","“That’s not acceptable, it’s not enough,” Steele told guest host Joy-Ann Reid.","Steele, now a pundit and political consultant, elaborated on his criticism of Walters’ comment on Saturday morning.","“It’s the groupthink that has emerged within the party that has now poisoned the national dialogue as we saw play out in the campaign of 2016,” Steele said on a special episode of his SiriusXM radio show “Steele and Ungar.”","Steele also said the fact that Walters is a person of color himself makes what he said “even crazier.”","Later in the day, Steele confronted Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union, which organizes CPAC, about the remarks in an interview on his SiriusXM show.","The interview took a tense turn when Schlapp characterized Walters’ comments as “unfortunate words.”","“They were stupid. It’s not ‘unfortunate.’ Call it what it is,” Steele said. “It is stupid to sit there and say that we elected a black man chairman of the party and that was a mistake.

The party swept the 2010 midterm elections and took back the House of Representatives under Steele’s watch.","But Steele displeased Republican donors and operatives with how he led the RNC’s finances, amassing $21 million in debt.

But they didn’t leave the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang empty-handed.","After picking up bobsledding skills only 15 months prior to competing, Seun Adigun, Akuoma Omeoga and Ngozi Onwumere’s green and white Nigerian flags are flying high with pride in South Korea. These women have done something no one else has done before.","On Tuesday, the trio became the first Olympic bobsled team in history to represent an African nation. And they didn’t take their accomplishment lightly.","Adigun, the driver, recalls watching Simone Biles, Ibtihaj Muhammad and other black athletes break barriers at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Brazil and feeling inspired.","“I got chills on my skin,” she told HuffPost in December during an event for the team’s partnership with Visa. “I remember how it made me feel seeing them and knowing the molds that were being broken by their perseverance and by their just dominance in whatever sport it was that they were competing in.”","The Nigerian-American athlete, who represented the U.S. track and field team in the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, recruited Omeoga and Onwumere and set out to make a mark after realizing that no African nation had ever had a bobsled representative at the 2018 Games.","The trio, who grew up in the U.S and all have a background in track and field, trained in Houston. They crafted a sleigh and dubbed it the Mayflower. Their fast-track training, combined with sponsors who donated to their GoFundMe, earned them a spot in the 2018 Winter Olympics.","Adigun and Omeoga competed in Tuesday’s two-woman bobsled event, finishing the heat in 52.21 seconds. Though they finished in 20th place out of 20, the time was a personal best for them at the Olympics and a reason for further celebration.","Onwumere said she believes it’s important “to represent not only people of color but Africa... we represent so many things in one and to be able to positively represent that says something.”","They have had a lot to celebrate, even months before they first qualified for the 2018 Games in November. They’ve been featured in headlines and in viral dancing videos, as fans and admirers beam with pride at the door they flung open. It created a ripple as the trio inspired Simidele Adeagbo to break a barrier of her own, becoming the first skeleton racer to represent Nigeria at this year’s Olympics.","“Growing up as a little kid, you always look for people who either represent you in some sort of fashion,” Omeoga told HuffPost. “Whether that be the clothes they wear, whether that be the way that they talk, anything like that so to see that we could be that… that aha moment for certain people, that’s absolutely amazing to me.”","The team made their final run on Wednesday. Though they didn’t earn any medals, they were still victorious in showing the world another form of black girl magic it’s never seen.","“This is the first,” Onwumere said. “This is gonna go down in history.”","They hope to inspire others, especially from the continent, to take on this and other winter sports in the future.","“It takes a special type of individual to take on a fear of the unknown. And that is exactly what we are trying to show people that you can do,” Adigun said. “[People from] a sub-Saharan climate can do anything.

It was the result of deliberate efforts by the Russian government to hurt Clinton and help Donald Trump win the presidency ― efforts that included the targeting of young African-Americans like Bentley’s son.","“Defendants and their co-conspirators began to encourage U.S. minority groups not to vote in the 2016 U.S. presidential election or to vote for a third-party U.S. presidential candidate,” according to a Feb. 16 grand jury indictment obtained by Mueller.","In fact, the day before Obama visited Jacksonville, Florida, to support Clinton, Russians purchased an ad for the Instagram account of a fake group called Blacktivist. It urged African-Americans to vote for a third-party candidate. “Choose peace and vote for Jill Stein. Trust me, it’s not a wasted vote,” the ad read, according to Mueller’s indictment.","It is impossible to know precisely how many voters nationally stayed home or voted for a third-party candidate because of the Russians’ social media campaign. Nevertheless, the details from the indictment raise new questions about the legitimacy of Trump’s victory.","While Trump maintains there is no proof that the Russian assistance affected the election, the contours of that final month of campaigning and the closeness of the tally suggest that the opposite is true: that it is highly unlikely the Russian efforts did not affect the outcome.","“There’s no question that it mattered,” said Democratic pollster Mark Mellman. “There’s no question that they thought it mattered. There’s no question that the Hillary Clinton folks thought it mattered.”","Over the entire final month of the race, Trump essentially centered his campaign on talking about the emails stolen by Russian intelligence and then released through its allied group WikiLeaks. The messages, which were sent to and from Clinton campaign chair John Podesta, cast Clinton in a bad light. “We love WikiLeaks!” Trump would tell his rally crowds and live TV audiences, urging them to go to the website and read the emails for themselves. “Boy, do we love WikiLeaks.”","Democrats and even some Republican consultants said the Trump campaign would not have based its closing strategy on that theme if it were not working.","“You clearly wouldn’t do that if you didn’t think that was effective,” said Rick Tyler, a GOP consultant who worked for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz’s presidential campaign during the primaries.","Although Trump lost the popular tally by nearly 3 million votes nationally, he won three states that most observers expected to go to Clinton by a total margin of 77,744. Were the Russian efforts enough to have moved 77,744 votes in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania?","Clinton supporters argue that when an election is that close, every factor is potentially a game-changer. For example, shifts in polling numbers suggest that former FBI Director James Comey’s letters reopening, and then reclosing, the investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email server when she was secretary of state could also have cost her the election ― an argument Clinton herself has made.","One Republican-leaning pollster, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the question is impossible to quantify with any certainty. To move that many votes in those three states, the pollster said, would mean moving about 600,000 votes nationally ― or about half a percentage point. That said, he added that Trump’s success in using WikiLeaks to hammer on about emails and thereby remind voters of Clinton’s biggest vulnerability ― the FBI probe into her emails ― clearly makes that kind of vote shift plausible.","“I’m much more open to the notion that it mattered,” he said.","Exit polling suggests that voters’ concern about Clinton and emails — and Trump’s pounding on that theme with the help of WikiLeaks in the final weeks — indeed made a difference.","In Michigan, for instance, 60 percent of the electorate was bothered by the email issue, and 75 percent of those voters supported Trump. Relatedly, a quarter of Michigan voters settled on a candidate in the final month. That group broke for Trump 52 to 37 percent, while those who decided earlier voted for Clinton 50 to 47 percent.","Trump has been deeply sensitive to the appearance that he did not earn the presidency on his own. That’s one of the reasons, according to those close to him, why he has repeatedly pushed the false claim that he lost the popular vote because “millions” of undocumented immigrants supposedly cast ballots for Clinton. It is also why Trump has resisted admitting that Russians interfered in the election at all, let alone tried to boost his candidacy, sources close to him told HuffPost on condition of anonymity.","The fact of Russian interference in the election and Russian President Vladimir Putin’s preference for Trump was detailed in a Jan. 6, 2017, report released by the U.S. intelligence agencies. That conclusion was reinforced by Mueller’s Feb. 16, 2018, indictment.","“They engaged in operations primarily intended to communicate derogatory information about Hillary Clinton, to denigrate other candidates such as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, and to support Bernie Sanders and then-candidate Donald Trump,” the indictment states.","For over a year, Trump questioned the conclusion of U.S. intelligence, as he continued to play up the possibility that the culprit in the hacking of Democratic National Committee emails was someone other than Russia. At various times, he suggested it might have been China, a 400-pound guy in his bed or someone from New Jersey.","At last, he appears to have abandoned that argument in the wake of Mueller’s indictment against 13 actual Russians and a Russian government-run group that employs hundreds of internet “trolls” who create and disseminate propaganda to influence foreign elections. Instead, the president turned to claiming that the Russian assistance did not have any effect.","“The results of the election were not impacted,” Trump wrote the afternoon the indictment was released.","The following day, he chided his national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, for not making that assertion at a conference in Europe where McMaster acknowledged that it was now “incontrovertible” that Russia had interfered in the election. “General McMaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians,” Trump tweeted ― and then proceeded to cite a string of conspiracy theories promoted by Fox News that he believed McMaster also should have mentioned.","Some Trump supporters argue that the value of the ads the Russians bought on Facebook and other social media platforms was a pittance compared to the total amount of money spent on the race, so they couldn’t have mattered at all. Others simply insist there is no proof that American voters were affected by the thousands of fake news posts written by Russians and then spread via fake accounts and computer programs.","And former Trump campaign aides, speaking on condition of anonymity, said neither Trump nor campaign officials were measuring the effect of his WikiLeaks speeches.","“Just trolling,” said one aide. “What we know worked was ‘Crooked Hillary.’ ‘Clinton Cash’ had impact on Dems ― Bernie ‘Bros’ ― and independents.” The aide added that the only emails WikiLeaks had were “BS Podesta and DNC.”","But Mellman, the Democratic pollster, said it is disingenuous to draw distinctions between the DNC emails released by WikiLeaks and the separate State Department emails when the average voter was aware only that Clinton had been under investigation for something to do with emails.","“There’s no question that the whole email controversy did damage Hillary Clinton,” he said, adding that many voters found the issue confusing and that Trump took advantage of that confusion. “If the press was talking about emails, it was bad for Hillary Clinton.”","Tyler, the Republican consultant, wonders how Trump supporters can argue that the social media ads and fake stories had no impact, when it was exactly the sort of thing the Trump campaign was doing itself. “You can’t say that what you were doing was effective, but what the Russians were doing wasn’t effective,” he said."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a909a0c2000008806eafd48.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"The Teens Are Coming For The NRA, And They Can't Be Stopped","authors":"Sebastian Murdock","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-teens-are-coming-for-the-nra-and-they-cant-be-stopped_us_5a919197e4b03b55731ca1ba","short_description":"We are witnessing history.","date":"2018-02-24"},"articleContent":["The most powerful gun lobby in the U.S. is facing its greatest threat yet: Generation Z.","Less than two weeks after a deadly school shooting in Parkland, Florida, left 17 dead and more than a dozen injured at Stoneman Douglas High School, teens across the country have made a simple request to the nation: They don’t want to fear getting shot in their schools. And they’re fighting like hell to make sure we know it.","The National Rifle Association and the politicians who pocket money from them likely hoped talk of gun control would simmer down as the days went on, but it has not.","Instead, students are continuing the fight to make sure they and those who died stay in the headlines.","School Walkouts","Two days after their friends were slaughtered by a gunman with an AR-15, a group of about 50 teenagers walked out of South Broward High School in Florida to protest for better gun control laws. It was just the beginning.","This week, students left their schools in droves across the country to protest the NRA. Hundreds of students staged walkouts in Florida as others headed to the State Capitol in Tallahassee to pressure lawmakers.","In Washington, D.C., dozens of student activists gathered in front of the White House to make their voices heard.","Students in states including Arizona, Illinois, Kentucky, Minnesota, and Colorado ― among others ― showed solidarity with the victims and students of Douglas High by also leaving classes to demand that no civilian gets access to a weapon of war.","From Children To Leaders","“I’m 17, but in a matter of days have aged decades,” Douglas High student Delaney Tarr said during a protest in Florida last week.","It’s been a sentiment echoed by many of the survivors who have been forced to grow up faster than they should have. Yet somehow, they’ve found a way to turn their immense grief into actionable change.","Dozens of student leaders — whose numbers keep growing — from Douglas High have been organizing protests while delivering impassioned, articulate arguments as to why they want better gun control.","At the same protest as Tarr, student leader Emma Gonzalez spit fire at the NRA.","“Politicians who sit in their gilded House and Senate seats funded by the NRA telling us nothing could have been done to prevent this: We call BS!” Gonzalez said.","Gonzalez ― along with other student activists including Cameron Kasky and David Hogg ― is just one of many new leaders who have sacrificed their own childhoods to fight the NRA. Students swayed President Donald Trump into attending a listening session. Others have met with politicians to voice their concerns. Students all over are grabbing the media spotlight not because they want it, but because they refuse to let the movement decay.","Social Media Savants","No one knows how to hurt feelings more than a pissed-off teenager. Some people in power ― including NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch ― are learning that the hard way. Observe:","Teenagers from Douglas High are using social media to elevate their platform in incredible ways. Gonzalez has amassed more than 500,000 Twitter followers since the tragedy, and Twitter has proactively verified many of the Parkland students raising their voices. Students are reaching politicians and celebrities who are helping to further elevate their platform. And amidst all of that, they’re actively fighting trolls and conspiracy theorists convinced the children of a school shooting are “crisis actors.”","“The students on Twitter have been a wonderful counterpoint to what we have seen as this machine of right-wing propaganda,” Jen Golbeck, an associate professor at the University of Maryland’s College of Information Studies, told NBC News.","Challenging Politicians","It’s bad time to be Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio.","At a CNN Town Hall on Wednesday, Douglas High junior Kasky had a simple question for Rubio:","“Can you tell me right now that you will not accept a single donation from the NRA?” he asked.","Rubio fumbled the question, eventually saying he would continue to receive NRA money because “people buy into my agenda.” He has so far accepted $3,303,355 in donations from the NRA in his political career.","Children are challenging and embarrassing politicians who refuse to act on responsible gun control. In Florida, protestors made clear they plan to vote out any elected officials who take NRA money.\n\nDuring the president’s listening session on Wednesday, Douglas student Sam Zeif tearfully asked the president how an AR-15 could come into someone’s hands.\n\n“I turned 18 the day after, woke up to the news my best friend was gone,” Zeif said. “I don’t understand why I can still go in a store and buy a weapon of war, an AR. How is it that easy to buy this type of weapon? How have we not stopped this after Columbine, after Sandy Hook? I’m sitting with a mother who lost her son. It’s still happening.”\n\nInstead of stricter gun laws, the president has suggested arming teachers. Students of Douglas high ― along with teachers themselves ― have blasted the absurd solution.\n\nBecause of newly increased pressure, the Justice Department must now look again at bump stocks, a device that enables a shooter to fire a gun as if it were automatic and was used in last year’s Las Vegas mass shooting. Even hard-line Florida Republican Gov. Rick Scott has broken with Trump and other GOP lawmakers by announcing a proposal Friday that would raise the age of buying a gun in Florida to 21 and to strengthen background checks.\n\nLast week, Al Hoffman Jr., a top Republican political donor in Florida, announced he would no longer give money to politicians that did not support a ban of AR-15s.\n\n“For how many years now have we been doing this — having these experiences of terrorism, mass killings — and how many years has it been that nothing’s been done?” Hoffman told The New York Times. “It’s the end of the road for me.”\n\nSponsorships Dropping For NRA\n\nThis week, the NRA has seen their corporate sponsors jumping ship in record numbers, dealing what might ultimately be the heaviest blow to the organization.\n\nBecause of the student activism in Parkland and beyond, companies from airlines to banks have made clear that they will cut ties with the NRA for the foreseeable future. The First Bank of Omaha announced Thursday that because of increased pressure from customers, they would no longer support gun lobbyists.\n\n“Customer feedback has caused us to review our relationship with the NRA. As a result, First National Bank of Omaha will not renew its contract with the National Rifle Association to issue the NRA Visa Card,” a First National Bank spokesman told HuffPost.\n\nInsurance company MetLife has followed suit, along with airlines Delta and United, cybersecurity company Symantec, multiple car rental companies and more. The list continues to grow.\n\nAnd for those companies still linked to the NRA, don’t worry. HuffPost is keeping track.\n\nGet Ready To March\n\nIt all leads to this: On March 24, a “March For Our Lives” will be held across the country to demand that lawmakers enact meaningful gun control legislation. A group of student activists from Douglas High have organized what is likely to be a massive event, and will be marching in the country’s capital.","“In every single city, we are going to be marching together as students begging for our lives,” Kasky said on ABC. “This isn’t about the GOP.

Security Council on Friday delayed a vote on a demand for a 30-day ceasefire in Syria, where pro-government warplanes have been pounding the last rebel bastion near Damascus in one of the deadliest bombing campaigns of the seven-year civil war.","A draft resolution aimed at ending the carnage in the eastern Ghouta district and elsewhere inSyria will be put up for a vote in the 15-member council at noon (1700 GMT) on Saturday, Kuwait’s U.N. Ambassador Mansour Ayyad Al-Otaibi said.","The 24-hour delay followed a flurry of last-minute negotiations on the text drafted by Sweden and Kuwait after Russia, a veto-holding ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, proposed new amendments on Friday.","“Unbelievable that Russia is stalling a vote on a ceasefire allowing humanitarian access in Syria,” U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley posted on Twitter.","Talks have centered on the paragraph demanding a cessation of hostilities for 30 days to allow aid access and medical evacuations. A proposal for the truce to start 72 hours after the resolution’s adoption has been watered-down to instead demand it start “without delay” in a bid to win Russian support.","Diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Moscow does not want to specify when a truce should start. It was not immediately clear how Russia would vote on Saturday. A resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by Russia, China, the United States, Britain and France to be adopted.","“We’re not going to give up. ... I hope that we will adopt something forceful, meaningful, impactful tomorrow,” Olof Skoog, Sweden’s U.N. ambassador, told reporters.","Previous ceasefires, however, have had a poor record of ending fighting in Syria, where Assad’s forces have gained the upper hand.","The towns and farms of eastern Ghouta have been under government siege since 2013, with shortages of food, water and electricity that worsened last year. Earlier on Friday, the densely populated enclave was bombed for a sixth straight day, witnesses said.","The civilian casualties and devastation there are among the worst in Syria since the government captured rebel-held parts of Aleppo in 2016. At least 462 people have been killed, including at least 99 children, and many hundreds injured, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said on Friday.","Syrian state media reported one person was killed and 58 injured in rebel shelling of sites in Damascus, including a hospital.","Clouding any potential ceasefire is the Syrian government’s frequently used tactic of pushing rebels to surrender their strongholds after long sieges and military offensives.","Insurgents in eastern Ghouta have vowed not to accept such a fate, ruling out an evacuation of fighters, their families and other civilians of the kind that ended rebellions in Aleppo and Homs after heavy bombardment in earlier years.","“We refuse categorically any initiative that includes getting the residents out of their homes and moving them elsewhere,” Ghouta rebel factions wrote in a letter to the Security Council.","Eastern Ghouta has 400,000 people spread over a larger area than other enclaves the government has recaptured. Late on Thursday, government aircraft dropped leaflets urging civilians to depart and hand themselves over to the Syrian army, marking corridors through which they could leave safely.","PRESSURE ON RUSSIA","Leading up to the Security Council vote, all eyes have been on Russia. Moscow has a history of standing in the way of Security Council measures that would harm Assad’s interests.","Germany and France were among the nations to ratchet up the pressure on Russia, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron asking Russian President Vladimir Putin to support the resolution.","Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow wanted guarantees that rebel fighters will not shoot at residential areas in Damascus.","Damascus and Moscow say they only target militants. They have said their main aim is to stop rebel shelling of the capital, and have accused insurgents in Ghouta of holding residents as human shields.","The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said government planes and artillery hit Douma, Zamalka and other towns across the enclave in the early hours of Friday.","There was no immediate comment from the Syrian military.","Medical charities say more than a dozen hospitals were hit, making it nearly impossible to treat the wounded.","A witness in Douma who asked not to be identified said by telephone that the early morning bombing was the most intense so far. Another resident, in the town of Hamouriyeh, said the assault had continued “like the other days.”","“Whenever the bombing stops for some moments, the Civil Defence vehicles go out to the targeted places. They work to remove the debris from the road,” Bilal Abu Salah said.","The Civil Defence there said its rescuers rushed to help the wounded after strikes on Hamouriyeh and Saqba. The emergency service, which operates in rebel territory, says it has pulled hundreds of people out from under rubble in recent days.","Hamza Birqdar, the military spokesman for the Jaish al-Islam rebel faction, said it had thwarted nine attacks by pro-government militias trying to storm a front in the southeast of Ghouta.","(Reporting by Ellen Francis in Beirut and Michelle Nichols at the United Nations; Additional reporting by Dahlia Nehme in Beirut and Stephanie Nebehay in Geneva; Writing by Ellen Francis and Paul Simao; Editing by James Dalgleish, Will Dunham and Lisa Shumaker)"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a9067201e000008087aca99.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"SPORTS","headline":"Exclusive: Federal Documents Detail Sweeping Potential NCAA Violations Involving High-Profile Players, Schools","authors":"Pat Forde and Pete Thamel, Yahoo!

They include expense reports and balance sheets that list cash advances, as well as entertainment and travel expenses for high school and college prospects and their families.","Yahoo Sports viewed hundreds of pages of documents from the years-long probe that had federal authorities monitoring multiple targets and intercepting more than 4,000 calls across 330 days, providing a clear-eyed view into the pervasive nature of the game’s underground economy.","While three criminal cases tied to the investigation may take years to play out, the documents viewed by Yahoo revealed the extent of the potential NCAA ramifications from the case. The documents show an underground recruiting operation that could create NCAA rules issues – both current and retroactive – for at least 20 Division I basketball programs and more than 25 players.","The documents tie some of the biggest names and programs in the sport to activity that appears to violate the NCAA’s amateurism rules. This could end up casting a pall over the NCAA tournament because of eligibility issues. (NCAA officials declined a request for comment.) There’s potential impermissible benefits and preferential treatment for players and families of players at Duke, North Carolina, Texas, Kentucky, Michigan State, USC, Alabama and a host of other schools. The documents link some of the sport’s biggest current stars – Michigan State’s Miles Bridges, Alabama’s Collin Sexton and Duke’s Wendell Carter – to specific potential extra benefits for either the athletes or their family members. The amounts tied to players in the case range from basic meals to tens of thousands of dollars.","An ASM balance sheet in the hands of federal investigators shows accounts through Dec. 31, 2015, with the subheading, “Loan to Players.” It listed several who were in high school or college as receiving four-figure and five-figure payments from ASM Sports. Among the largest listed loans:","Dennis Smith, who would go on to play at North Carolina State in 2016-17, received $43,500 according to the documents. Another document headed “Pina,” for ASM agent Stephen Pina, says Smith received a total of $73,500 in loans, and includes notes about “options to recoup the money” when Smith did not sign with ASM.\nIsaiah Whitehead, at the time a freshman at Seton Hall, received $26,136 according to the documents. The “Pina” document says Whitehead received $37,657 and was “setting up payment plan.” Whitehead signed with ASM but later left the agency for Roc Nation.\nTim Quarterman, at the time a junior at LSU, received at least $16,000 according to the balance sheet.\nDiamond Stone, at the time a freshman at Maryland, received $14,303 according to the documents.\nA listing that refers to “BAM” for $12,000 is later identified in the documents as Edrice “Bam” Adebayo, who would go on to play at Kentucky in 2016-17. He did not sign with ASM. There’s a later reference to Adebayo that says he received $36,500. “Bad loan,” reads the document.\nMarkelle Fultz, who would go on to play at Washington and become the No. 1 pick in the 2017 draft, received $10,000 according to the documents. He did not sign with ASM.","Yahoo Sports reached out to officials at N.C. State, Seton Hall, Maryland, Kentucky and Washington. They all declined comment or did not return correspondence.","In addition, Dawkins filed expense reports seeking reimbursement for thousands of dollars that he reported as being paid to college and high school players and their families. Several players, families of players or handlers received more than $1,000 in payments from ASM Sports before turning professional:","Current USC player Bennie Boatwright and/or his father, Bennie Sr. (According to documents, they received at least $2,000.)\nCurrent USC player Chimezie Metu and/or adviser, Johnnie Parker. (According to documents, they received $2,000.)\nCurrent Texas player Eric Davis. (According to documents, he received $1,500.)\nCurrent South Carolina player Brian Bowen, who was ensnared in the initial federal investigation and started his career at Louisville last fall until the school withheld him from competition. His father, Brian Sr., also received money, according to the documents. (Dawkins’ expense reports also list more than $1,500 in plane tickets for Bowen, his father and his mother. He and his family received at least $7,000 in benefits, according to the documents.)\nFormer Utah star Kyle Kuzma received at least $9,500 while in school, according to the documents.\nFormer South Carolina player P.J. Dozier received at least $6,115 while in school, according to the documents.\nFormer Xavier player Edmond Sumner and/or his father, Ernest. Documents show they received at least $7,000 in advances while Edmond was in school.\nFormer Wichita State player Fred VanVleet. Documents show he received at least $1,000.\nFormer Clemson player Jaron Blossomgame received a payment by Venmo while in school for $1,100 according to the documents.\nApples Jones, the mother of former Kansas player Josh Jackson, received $2,700 according to documents.","Among those receiving hundreds of dollars in advances, according to Dawkins’ expense reports:","The mother of current Michigan State player Miles Bridges.","Additional Dawkins expense reports list meals and meetings with players or their families while in college or high school, and before they turned pro. While small amounts, these could be categorized as extra benefits under NCAA rules. It appears Dawkins paid for the meals, which could be an important distinction.","“There’s nothing wrong with meeting with an agent,” said Atlanta-based lawyer Stu Brown, a veteran of representing schools and coaches in NCAA compliance cases. “But then it becomes a question of who pays for the meal.”","Among the players and/or families who are listed as meeting with or having meals with Dawkins:","Current Alabama player Collin Sexton.\nCurrent Duke player Wendell Carter.\nCurrent Kentucky player Kevin Knox.\nFormer North Carolina player Tony Bradley.\nFormer Creighton player Justin Patton.\nFormer Texas player Prince Ibeh.\nFormer Notre Dame player Demetrius Jackson.\nFormer Vanderbilt player Wade Baldwin.\nFormer Virginia player Malcolm Brogdon.\nFormer Iowa State player Monte Morris.","The breadth of names, schools and current players could offer a vexing test for both university compliance offices and the NCAA’s enforcement division. The sheer number of potential cases and varying degrees of potential violations are vast. There’s also an overriding factor of the ongoing criminal investigations. A complicating facet to it will be the NCAA’s potential inability to view key documents related to this case, because those details not in the criminal complaints are sealed under protective order. In terms of eligibility, the NCAA and the institution may be prohibited from interviewing people associated with the case because of the parallel criminal cases. (The initial onus to decide is almost always on the school in an eligibility case.)","No one is certain how the NCAA enforcement office would potentially handle the cases. The NCAA has been in constant contact with the feds but so far has had minimal direct involvement with the case, as they’ve been careful to respect the boundaries of the criminal investigations. The likely scenario, according to Brown, would be for the schools to assess the credibility of what’s in the documents and the severity of the potential violations.","“There’s potential for chaos, as it depends on the number of cases and the amount of information that’s released,” Brown said. “There could be inconsistency as a subset of chaos, as different schools may very validly assess the credibility of [the cases] differently.”","Yahoo did not view all of the documents in the three criminal cases tied to the investigation, but the records show an uncommon amount of detail for activities that have come under federal scrutiny.","For example, the expense reports have hundreds of lines like:","Feb. 10, 2016: “Flight for Brian Bowen mom. Flight for Brian Bowen. Flight for Brian Bowen dad.” They totaled more than $1,500.","Feb. 1, 2016: “Advance to Apples Jones (Josh Jackson) $1,700.”","Jan. 13, 2016: “ATM withdrawl: Advance to Fred Van Vleet $483.”","May 3, 2016: “Redwood Lodge. Lunch w/Miles Bridges Parents. $70.05.”","May 3, 2016: “ATM Withdrawl: Miles Bridges mom advance. $400”","According to the documents, Dawkins has dinners listed with plenty of boldface names in the sport – Tom Izzo, “Villanova coaches,” Fultz and the family of wayward five-star prospect Mitchell Robinson.","Along the way, a portrait emerges of the inner-workings of the office of Miller, who relinquished his NBA Players Association agent certification in the wake of the probe. Miller has yet to be charged in the case, and it’s widely believed he’s cooperating with the government. Dawkins’ lawyer, Steve Haney, told Yahoo Sports earlier in the week it was “utter hypocrisy” that an underling like Dawkins and the four assistant coaches were charged in the case and their superiors have gone unscathed. Haney added on Thursday night in an email statement: “These are college eligibility issues and agent licensing issues, not matters of national security that deserve this level of FBI involvement and taxpayer resources…..it has reached a degree of being ridiculous.”","Dawkins, the 24-year-old former business associate, was arrested on Sept. 26 and faces felony charges of wire fraud and bribery in two of the three criminal cases tied to the investigation. He ended up on federal wiretaps and, soon after the case broke in late September, his rise became a cautionary tale for how vulnerable top coaches and programs are to the agent world.","Yahoo Sports reached out to a dozen programs tied to the documents late Thursday. Only Xavier coach Chris Mack elected to release a statement. He said: “I have no relationship with Andy Miller or any of his associates. He plays no role in the recruitment of potential student athletes on Xavier’s behalf. Beyond that, our staff has never created a path for him to foster a relationship with any of our student-athletes while enrolled at Xavier. Any suggestion that I or anyone on my staff utilized Andy Miller to provide even the slightest of financial benefits to a Xavier student-athlete is grossly misinformed. We are prepared to cooperate with any and all investigations at any level.”","With an ongoing investigation, the chance looms there could be more charges and arrests. So far, four former assistant college basketball coaches have been arrested: Tony Bland of USC, Chuck Person of Auburn, Emanuel Richardson of Arizona and Lamont Evans of Oklahoma State. Six other assorted participants in the basketball underworld also have been arrested: Dawkins; former sneaker executives James Gatto and Merl Code; financial adviser Munish Sood; clothier and former referee Rashan Michel; and Florida AAU coach Brad Augustine. Charges against Augustine earlier were dismissed without explanation.","The case has also cost Louisville coach Rick Pitino his job, as the school parted ways with the Hall of Famer soon after the details of the program’s involvement in a six-figure agreement to sign five-star recruit Brian Bowen went public. Louisville athletic director Tom Jurich also was dismissed. At Auburn, two players and two members of the basketball support staff have been suspended. USC is withholding star point guard De’Anthony Melton from competition this season as well.","More from Yahoo Sports:\n• Disgusted Olympian quickly casts aside silver\n• Vonn’s final tribute to late grandfather in South Korea\n• Dominant Belarus biathlete’s secret past","This story was originally published on Yahoo Sports."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a902849210000c30060220a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"WORLD NEWS","headline":"Australia's Deputy Prime Minister Resigns Amid Mounting Scandals","authors":"Eoin Blackwell and Josh Butler","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/australia-deputy-prime-minister-resigning_us_5a8f7268e4b0ee6416a1795f","short_description":"Barnaby Joyce says he will step down following weeks of pressure over an affair and claims of sexual harassment and corruption.","date":"2018-02-23"},"articleContent":["Australia’s Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce will resign from the leadership position after weeks of scandal over his long-term affair with a former staffer and new allegations of sexual harassment.","Joyce, who once threatened to kill Johnny Depp’s dogs, will officially resign Monday as deputy prime minister as well as leader of the National Party, the junior partner in Australia’s coalition government. He said he will resign the leadership positions but remain in the Parliament as a local member.","“This current cacophony of issues has to be set aside,” Joyce told reporters.","Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is currently in Washington, D.C., for meetings with President Donald Trump and other high-level U.S. officials. Turnbull refused to back his deputy on Thursday morning.","The announcement comes after weeks of speculation about the future of the outspoken member of Parliament as tensions between the two parties that form Australia’s ruling coalition flared.","In early February, it was revealed that Joyce, 50, had been engaged in a months-long relationship with his former media adviser, Vikki Campion, 33, who is expecting a baby in April.","The affair reportedly began while she worked for him. Campion was later shunted between the offices of different government politicians as the affair became more widely known, provoking claims of nepotism, favoritism and corruption.","Ministers’ relatives and partners are not allowed to be appointed to executive government offices without approval from the prime minister, but Joyce battled the calls for his resignation by claiming Campion was not technically his partner at the time she was appointed to the various roles.","The pair moved in together after Joyce separated from his wife last year. Journalists and politicians have described the affair as being an open secret in political circles for many months, but it was reported publicly only recently.","“I’d like to say that it’s absolutely important, it’s incredibly important that there be a circuit breaker, not just for the Parliament but, more importantly, a circuit breaker for Vikki, for my unborn child, my daughters and for Nat,” Joyce said during his news conference. Natalie Joyce, his estranged wife, who responded earlier this month that she felt “deceived and hurt” when she saw a picture of a pregnant Campion.","Earlier this week, allegations surfaced that Joyce had drunkenly pinched a woman’s buttock at a 2011 event, a claim that he he called defamatory. It was also reported that he had purchased land along the route of a planned rail link without disclosing it to the Cabinet.","Joyce, who holds the rural New South Wales electorate of New England, has been an outspoken member of Parliament since 2005 and was elected leader of the National Party, and therefore deputy prime minister, in 2016.","Joyce’s woes — and his seeming determination to hold on — led to surreal political theater and mounting tensions between Joyce and Turnbull.","Last week Turnbull slammed Joyce for the “terrible hurt and humiliation” he had inflicted on his family and his new partner, saying his deputy had made “a shocking error of judgment” and “appalled all of us.”","Joyce responded by calling Turnbull’s comments about his personal life “inept” and “unhelpful.”","In Australia’s media landscape, the personal lives of politicians are generally left alone. Joyce’s woes have sparked debate about how his relationship was revealed. However questions have also been raised about Campion’s role as a government adviser.","Joyce has been embroiled in other controversies, most notably for the revelation last August that he had New Zealand citizenship, which led to his expulsion from Parliament and ineligibility to run for election (the Australian Constitution bans dual citizens from running for election). Joyce renounced his New Zealand citizenship and successfully regained his seat, returning to Parliament late last year.","He made international headlines last year when he threatened to execute actor Johnny Depp’s dogs Pistol and Boo after the actor and then-girlfriend Amber Heard smuggled their terriers into the country, avoiding Australia’s tough quarantine laws.","Depp called Joyce “inbred with a tomato”; Joyce made his own tomato jokes; Depp and Heard were forced to make an insane apology video; Joyce then claimed Depp might be open to perjury charges.","Joyce has said he will remain in Parliament, protecting Turnbull’s narrow one-seat majority."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8f731b2000002d00eafb8f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"WORLD NEWS","headline":"As The U.S. Looks To Australia For Hope On Guns, Its Laws Are Being Quietly Pulled Back","authors":"Josh Butler","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/australia-gun-laws-weakening_us_5a8cfd99e4b00a30a2509c3f","short_description":"Fears that Australian lawmakers are becoming \"complacent\" and allowing gun lobbyists to water down laws.","date":"2018-02-23"},"articleContent":["In the wake of several mass shootings in the United States, including last week’s massacre of 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida, gun control advocates often point to Australia as an example of how a country can implement strong firearm laws to try to stop such carnage.","But while Australia has virtually eliminated mass shootings since the landmark 1996 firearms laws were enacted days after the Port Arthur massacre in Tasmania ― in which 35 people were killed by a gunman wielding AR-15 and L1A1 rifles in what remains the worst single mass attack in modern Australian history ― gun control advocates say politicians and the general public have become “complacent,” allowing the gun lobby to push for a weakening of several important planks of protection as compliance with the laws has slipped across the nation.","“While Australians strongly support gun laws, many are of the view that everything was set in stone in 1996, but it wasn’t. Firearms laws are a political hot potato, and the Australian public isn’t aware gun laws are in trouble,” Sam Lee, head of Gun Control Australia, told HuffPost.","Following the Port Arthur massacre, the federal government swiftly passed new laws and state governments signed up to a new National Firearms Agreement, which all but banned semiautomatic weapons and pump-action shotguns.","Other parts of the legislation instituted far stricter rules governing storage of weapons and obligated people applying for guns licenses to demonstrate a “genuine need” to own a firearm ― self-defense was not permitted as a reason ― and to undertake a safety course. Also instituted was a new 28-day waiting period for licenses and new weapons, restrictions on the amount of ammunition that could be purchased and new conditions around “a mental or physical condition which would render the applicant unsuitable for owning, possessing or using a firearm.”","The gunman in the Port Arthur massacre was mentally impaired.","The government also instituted a buyback system in which those who possessed the newly-banned weapons would be compensated for handing them in to be destroyed. More than 640,000 firearms were bought back from owners by the government from October 1996 to September 1997, while many tens of thousands of still legal weapons, such as handguns, were voluntarily surrendered, for a total of more than 700,000 firearms handed over to authorities.","In the 12 years before the new laws, Australia experienced at least 12 mass shootings in which at least five people died. In the 22 years since, only three incidents could be classified as mass shootings: an incident at Monash University in 2002, known as the only shooting at an Australian education facility, in which two people were killed and five were wounded; a siege at Hectorville in 2011, in which three people were killed and three wounded; and a domestic-related incident at a farm in Lockhart in 2014, when a man shot dead his wife and three children before turning the gun on himself.","After the 1996 laws, homicide and suicide by firearm decreased, according to the Australian Institute of Criminology. From the 1995-96 fiscal year to 2013-14, firearm-related homicides dropped from 67 to 32 annually, the crime institute reported. Since 2003-04, no year has had more than 40 firearm-related homicides. In the U.S. in 2014, more than 11,000 firearm-related homicides were reported, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.","However, Gun Control Australia estimated in 2016 there were “as many guns in private hands in Australia as there was at the time of the Port Arthur massacre,” and in 2017, authorities estimated there were up to 260,000 illegal or unregistered firearms in the country. There are currently 730,000 licensed gun owners in Australia and 2.75 million registered firearms. Another gun amnesty, the first since Port Arthur, saw 26,000 firearms handed in last year.","A 2017 review of the National Firearms Agreement found no state had actually complied with all parts of the agreement and that most states had significantly loosened and weakened their gun laws in the two decades since Port Arthur.","“Every jurisdiction has slipped backwards by varying degrees. [New South Wales] is the most obvious example of compliance ‘slippage,’” wrote the report’s author, University of Sydney adjunct associate professor Philip Alpers.","New South Wales, Australia’s most populous state, has recently permitted gun silencers, extended the availability of semiautomatic weapons and eased restrictions on licensing, the report said. Also of concern is that “every State and Territory allows minors to possess and use firearms,” with licensing ages ranging from 10 to 16 years, while some jurisdictions allow people to be trained in firearm use without first obtaining a license. Some states have relaxed restrictions on purchasing multiple firearms and ammunition, wound back licensing regulations, or relaxed rules on safe storage and background checks.","“Non-compliance from day one, and two decades of political pressure, have steadily reduced restrictions and undermined the NFA’s original intent,” the report said.","Gun control experts concur.","“Our gun laws are in a bit of trouble here. We can’t be complacent,” Gun Control Australia’s Sam Lee told HuffPost.","She said that, although background checks for an initial firearm license or purchase remained stringent, there were no further checks when someone wanted to purchase a second weapon, meaning that criminal offenses committed after the purchase of a first weapon might not be picked up. She said a national firearm registry, one of the recommendations of the National Firearms Agreement, was never implemented.","“We don’t know what happened in that time [between purchases]. People are falling through the gaps. We don’t have a national system to track the movement of firearms and licence holders, which is a problem with any criminal activity,” she said.","Lee Rhiannon is a senator for New South Wales and a member of the Greens party, the third-largest in the federal Parliament. Ond one of her portfolio responsibilities is gun control. Rhiannon told HuffPost she was trying to combat the complacency around firearms laws.","“The National Firearms Agreement hasn’t kept up with the modernization of guns,” she said, citing how dealers are attempting to import new rapid-fire weapons into the country, such as the Pardus shotgun (below), and technology that allows 3-D printing of weapons.","“I’ve been following the horror in the United States, and I’ve been impressed with the young people taking a stand and that they’re looking to Australia for laws. Hopefully they start having the conversation and moving toward gun control, and there are fine lessons to learn from Australia, but our system isn’t perfect. It can be tighter.”","On a political level, Rhiannon cited the rising power of the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers Party in the New South Wales state parliament (it holds the balance of power in the upper house). The party supports gun rights and land access, and it has been working to slowly relax gun laws.","For example, in 2013, the Shooters Party negotiated exemptions to hunt feral animals in NSW national parks in exchange for its support for government plans to privatize the state’s electricity system.","Rhiannon said she was also concerned about the rising influence of gun lobbyists, along with moves to overturn a ban on the Adler 110 lever-action shotgun.","Former Prime Minister John Howard, who introduced the 1996 laws, warned against voting for the Shooters Party at a recent NSW state election.","“The Shooters Party is standing and hoping to win seats in state elections, and they’re becoming important for major parties as the government will depend on them to get their legislation through. They’re making it easier for people to use a gun, which goes against the whole tenor of the NFA,” she said.","“The public hasn’t gone easy on guns.

The date is set to coincide with the 70th anniversary of Israel declaring its independence on May 14.","The rapid timeline means the U.S. will not immediately build a new embassy in the city, which would take years of planning and require extensive security preparations. Instead, the State Department confirmed that consular offices in Jerusalem will be renovated and given the title of “embassy.”","Retrofitting existing diplomatic facilities is a cheaper option for the U.S., but there are currently no consulates that match the capacity of the current embassy in Tel Aviv. The cost of relocation is a concern for the White House, even to the point that it has reportedly considered taking donations from pro-Israel, billionaire Republican donor Sheldon Adelson.","Early this year, multiple media outlets reported that the State Department was looking at plans to convert a consular complex in the Jerusalem neighborhood of Arnona into the new embassy. The Arnona location is a newer facility near the Green Line that marked Israel’s borders prior to the 1967 Arab-Israeli war when Israel took over de facto control of the city.","The State Department’s announcement on Friday confirmed that the Arnona facility will be the temporary site of the embassy and contain office space for Ambassador David Friedman. Officials will continue to search for a permanent site elsewhere.","The expected embassy move is likely to further strain the already crippled Israeli-Palestinian peace process, which has further deteriorated under President Donald Trump’s administration. Both Palestinians and Israelis consider Jerusalem to be their capital, and most United Nations members hold that the city’s final status shouldn’t be decided until a peace agreement is reached.","Trump’s December decision to relocate the embassy and recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital defied decades of U.S. policy and ran contrary to the position of the vast majority of the international community. It also sparked days of Palestinian protests, rebukes from prominent allies and a U.N. General Assembly vote that denounced the U.S. action.","Palestinian officials also condemned Trump’s Israel policies and said after his announcement in December they would no longer recognize the U.S. as an honest broker in the peace process and instead will only agree to negotiations under international leadership.","For Trump, moving the embassy fulfilled a campaign promise that appealed to pro-Israel conservatives and evangelical voters. Both George W. Bush and Bill Clinton also vowed to move the embassy during their campaigns for president, but both changed tack once in office when confronted with the political reality of the situation. Trump touted taking action on the issue as a mark of his administration’s success while speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Friday.","“Every president campaigned on ‘we’re going to make Jerusalem the capital,’ and then they never pulled it off,” Trump said during his CPAC speech. “Every president really lied.”","Congress passed a law in 1995 that required the embassy to be relocated to Jerusalem, but since then each president has signed a waiver twice a year delaying the move for another six months. The current waiver deadline is in May."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a904a4e2000002d00eafcda.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"SPORTS","headline":"Mirai Nagasu Says Her Parents' Hard Work In Restaurant Inspires Her Discipline On Ice","authors":"Kimberly Yam","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mirai-nagasu-credits-her-parents-hard-work-in-restaurant-for-her-own-work-ethic_us_5a8f2a99e4b0ee6416a11a17","short_description":"Vincent Zhou, who became the first skater to land a quad lutz at the Olympics, described Nagasu as “the hardest worker I know.”","date":"2018-02-23"},"articleContent":["It’s no secret figure skater Mirai Nagasu is a hard worker.

She even slept in the establishment many nights as her parents worked.","During that time, she picked up some important life skills.","“I have a great work ethic because I’ve watched my parents work super hard,” the figure skater said, according to The Washington Post.","She added, “I’m also great at dishwashing because of the restaurant, as well!”","Nagasu’s father Kiyoto refused to take vacations, missing many of the skater’s competitions. The Los Angeles Times noted that Kiyoto refrained from taking time off since closing the restaurant would mean, his employees would go without pay. In fact, when the skater performed her historic triple axel, the parents were working the dinner rush at their restaurant, Kiyosuzu. Mirai’s jump helped propel Team USA to a bronze medal in skating. Ikuko, the skater’s mother, told USA Today Sports that they’d watch her performance later that night on DVR.","“Wow, can you believe it? Her child wins a medal and she’s still here — working, working,” patron Helen Lee told The Los Angeles Times. “It’s surprising, but I really respect that she stays with her responsibilities, running a business.”","The couple did make a rare exception to their work schedule for the later portion of their daughter’s performances in the Olympics.","“The business is important, but it is special to be able to watch Mirai,” Ikuko told USA Today. “We will shut the restaurant, go quickly, and come back quickly.”","The 24-year-old’s credits her parents’ drive as her inspiration.

Republicans, targeting low-profile state races in 2010, won those races and were able to draw congressional and statewide lines that significantly benefited the party. Congressional redistricting is only done once each decade, so control over the process has enduring consequences. The Brennan Center for Justice estimates Republicans hold an additional 16 seats to 17 seats in Congress because of gerrymandered maps.","During a press conference on Friday, Govs. Jay Inslee (Wash.), Dannel Malloy (Conn.) and Tom Wolf (Penn.) said the money would be spent in eight states: Colorado, Nevada, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Maine and Florida. The governors were in the nation’s capital Friday for the National Governors Association winter meeting, which hosts governors from both parties.","“There is a cancer on our democracy right now, and it’s called gerrymandering. And we know that there has to be a cure to that. And we know that the best cure is to elect Democratic governors who can stop this assault on democracy,” Inslee, the current DGA chairman, said.","When asked whether the DGA has already raised the $20 million, Inslee said, “Our contributions are growing so rapidly. We’re very confident we’ll be able to finance this.”","In most states, lawmakers and the governor must agree on redistricting plans, meaning that a party can wield massive influence if it controls both the legislature and the governor’s mansion. Malloy said Friday that targeting governors’ races was an effective way to increase Democratic influence over redistricting because many state legislative seats remained gerrymandered from 2010 midterms.","Even though the Democratic governors want more control over the redistricting process, they say they would use their power to make elections more fair, not to benefit Democrats. While Republicans enjoy a significant advantage from the last round of redistricting, there are some states, like Maryland and Illinois, where the process has benefited Democrats.","“This is not about our desire to rig the map,” Malloy said.","Pressed on whether the DGA was endorsing nonpartisan redistricting processes as a matter of policy, Inslee said that it was not.","But speaking individually, Inslee said that he would prefer a “more nonpartisan system.” Wolf voiced his agreement.","The new funding initiative came as the U.S. Supreme Court is considering two cases dealing with partisan gerrymandering. The court has never articulated a standard for when partisan gerrymandering is unconstitutional, but could do so in June. Even if the court does come up with a unprecedented standard, it is unlikely that it would order states to redraw fairer maps in 2018 because the midterm elections are so close.","Wolf, one of the rare Democratic governors elected in 2014, is fresh off of a successful court battle with his Republican legislature that resulted in a dramatic redrawing of the state’s congressional districts. He dismissed Republican lawmakers’ threats to impeach the state Supreme Court justices that redrew the map as “nonsense” that lacked “credibility.”","Wolf paraphrased the film “Animal House” when a reporter asked him to explain his political adversaries’ motives.","“Some folks have figured this is a situation that calls for an entirely futile gesture on someone’s part, and they feel they’re just the folks to do it,” he said.","Malloy said that Democrats should have moved more quickly to challenge the maps and have been more aggressive in 2010 to have more control over the redistricting process.","“One of the lessons we’ve learned is that we should have been in the courts a lot sooner after the last set of maps were drawn. It was part of falling asleep at the wheel quite frankly,” he said."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a907a832000007d06eafd2c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"U.S. Treasury Announces Most Aggressive Sanctions To Date On North Korea","authors":"Willa Frej","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-new-sanctions-north-korea_us_5a9025d2e4b01e9e56bafcc2","short_description":"\"The United States will continue targeting persons, wherever located, who facilitate North Korea’s illicit shipping practices.”","date":"2018-02-23"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Despite Attacking Renewables, Trump Team Says It Loves All Energy Sources","authors":"Chris D'Angelo","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/energy-cpac-zinke-perry_us_5a901ab6e4b03b55731b57b9","short_description":"\"As long as it’s made in America, I’m good with it,\" Secretary Ryan Zinke said Friday.","date":"2018-02-23"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"WORLD NEWS","headline":"Trump To Announce New Sanctions Against North Korea As South Prepares For Talks","authors":"Christine Kim and Steve Holland, Reuters","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-north-korea-sanctions-south-korea-talks_us_5a90193fe4b01e9e56baecb7","short_description":"Tougher sanctions may jeopardize the latest detente between the two Koreas, amid preparations for talks about a possible summit between Kim Jong Un and Moon Jae-in.","date":"2018-02-23"},"articleContent":["SEOUL/WASHINGTON, Feb 23 (Reuters) - The United States is due to announce its largest package of sanctions against North Korea to pressure the reclusive country into giving up its nuclear and missile programs, as South Korea readies itself for further talks with its leaders.","Tougher sanctions may jeopardize the latest detente between the two Koreas, illustrated by the North’s participation in the Winter Olympics in the South, amid preparations for talks about a possible summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in.","A senior U.S. administration official, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, called the new penalties “the largest package of new sanctions against the North Korea regime,” without giving details.","U.S. Vice President Mike Pence had hinted at such a plan two weeks ago during a stop in Tokyo that preceded his visit to South Korea for the Pyeongchang Olympics.","North Korea last year conducted dozens of missile launches and its sixth and largest nuclear test in defiance of U.N.

But despite Trump’s best efforts, most Americans don’t even know that.","Just 40 percent of the public knows — or acknowledges — that the market is up from a year ago, with 18 percent saying that it’s currently about the same, and 23 percent that it’s lower, according to a HuffPost/YouGov survey taken earlier this month. The rest aren’t sure.","Americans who view the stock market as relevant to their own finances are likelier to have the correct answer, as are wealthier Americans and those with college degrees.","But there’s also a political effect: Although two-thirds of Trump voters correctly say that the stock market has risen, just 35 percent of Hillary Clinton voters say the same.","Those results tie into a larger pattern in which views of the economy are filtered through a distinctly partisan lens. Trump voters don’t realize that 2017 didn’t outpace 2016 for job creation. And polling during Barack Obama’s presidency found that, when Obama’s name was mentioned, Republicans grew more likely to say the economy, and their own finances, had declined, while Democrats shied away from noting a rise in income inequality.","It’s possible that like Obama before him, Trump generates sufficiently polarized feelings that rather than views of the economy shaping Americans’ views of Trump’s presidency, their views of his presidency are instead shaping their perspective on objective facts about the economy ― or at least the way they describe it to pollsters.\n\nThat’s especially true in cases involving specific statistics, like the performance of the stock market or the unemployment rate, which many people may not have a personal sense for or any reason to commit to memory. But it’s also true of the way people perceive broader trends. Merely days after Trump was elected, Gallup found, Republicans’ ratings of the current state of the economy soared, while Democrats’ plummeted ― despite the fact that Trump was still months from taking office, let alone crafting policies that would shape the nation’s economy.","And the latest HuffPost/YouGov survey finds those divides persisting. Eighty-four percent of Trump voters, but just 37 percent of Clinton voters and a third of everyone else, pronounce themselves satisfied with the current state of the economy, a wider gap than between the richest and poorest Americans, or between those working full-time jobs and those currently unemployed. Nearly half of Trump voters, but just 5 percent of Clinton voters and 15 percent of non-voters and third party voters, think the stock market will continue to climb during the next year.","Although the tendency to view economics through a partisan lens didn’t start under Trump, it perhaps ties into the unusual difficulty he saw throughout most of his first year in converting the strength of the economy into support for his work as president. Traditionally, strong economic numbers are a pretty good gauge of presidential approval, but Trump has consistently underperformed his economic indicators, failing to win much support beyond his own party.","One reason may have simply been that, in his first months in office, most people didn’t think Trump bore responsibility for the state of the economy. But at least when it comes to the stock market, Americans give Trump more credit than Obama for the performance of the stock market. Thirty-seven percent of Americans hand Trump responsibility for the stock market’s performance, while 12 percent say it’s mostly due to Obama. Another third say it’s “just the regular ups and downs of the market,” with the remainder unsure.","Nearly 70 percent of Trump’s supporters name the current president as responsible for the market’s performance. In contrast, just 16 percent of Clinton voters ― largely, those who believed the stock market was doing poorly ― think that Trump is responsible.","The public is divided over how much the performance of the markets actually matter to the nation. About a third said the stock market is a good indicator of the economy, about a third that it isn’t and the remaining third that they don’t know. Americans are also divided over how much the stock market matters to them personally, with 42 percent saying it matters somewhat or a lot to their personal finances, and 45 percent that it matters not much or not at all.","The splits are both financial and political. Two-thirds of Americans in households making $100,000 or more annually say that the stock market affects their finances at least somewhat, while half of those making $50,000 to $100,000, and a third of those making less than $50,000, say the same. A 52 percent majority of those in the highest-earning group, but just 28 percent of the lowest earners, think the stock market reflects the overall economy.","Trump voters are only slightly likelier than Clinton voters, 53 percent to 46 percent, to say the markets have some bearing on their own finances. But they’re about twice as likely as Clinton voters, 51 percent to 25 percent, to consider the stock market a good economic indicator.","Use the widget below to further explore the results of the HuffPost/YouGov survey, using the menu at the top to select survey questions and the buttons at the bottom to filter the data by subgroups:","The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Feb. 5-7 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.","HuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

Best known for his work with Boy George, Bjork, Kylie Minogue and Neneh Cherry, the famed tastemaker was beloved by innovative artists and contemporaries, some of whom paid tribute to him on social media when they heard the news.","A cultural tastemaker whose influence began in the 1980s New Romantic era, Blame (née Chris Barnes) has created punk DIY aesthetics for artists for decades. He was a fan of silverware, chains, keys, buttons and safety pins and would often say, “If you don’t have it; make it.”","“It was a big age to experiment,” he told Interview. “To go out to nightclubs, we didn’t have much money, so I started making jewelry to change my outfit every week.”","He ran away from home (the Devonshire countryside) and spent a few years in Manchester.","“Manchester had a brilliant punk scene,” he told 023c in 2003. “There were a lot of bands, a lot of graphic people, a lot of creative people experimenting. We couldn’t really afford the Seditionaries clothes or whatever, so we would do the jumble sale, buy a suit, throw a bucket of paint over it, cut it up, join it back together with safety pins – it was much more homemade. It was better for me.”","Eventually, he found himself in London, becoming part an influential collective, The House of Beauty and Culture. Along with androgynous model Scarlett Cannon and the rest of The Blitz Kids, Blame came to run a popular night, Cha-Cha Club, at London’s gay bar Heaven, where he became a staple of the nightlife scene.","Soon after, he started styling Boy George, and helped to steer the art and fashion direction for i-D magazine. He famously styled Bjork for her “Debut” album cover, and worked with artists like Massive Attack, Kylie Minogue, Duran Duran and frequent collaborator Neneh Cherry. He was always unapologetic; openly gay and unwilling to closet himself no matter who his clients were.","“The business is very homophobic,” Blame told Lucy Brien, author of the book She Bop II: The Definitive History of Women in Rock, Pop and Soul. “Most people see me as a Queen Bitch, don’t mess with him. I promote the image, otherwise they just think you’re a nancy, and a lot of men feel intimidated.”","“Once Judy traveled to Iceland with me under the guise of doing wardrobe. I saw Judy at the side of the stage before I went on, he was wearing high heels and a monocle,” George said in 2016. “Judy is such an important creative force and being sober and clear-headed serves him and us because we can see how utterly genius he is. He is a game changer; he is ‘Ziggy Stylist.’ He can place a safety pin on a jacket and make it radiate cool. He’s a juxtaposer and a fashion humorist; he has this innate sense of absurdity. I have a ton of his creations and I’m keeping them!”","“The most generous thing Judy Blame gave me as a shy insecure beginner, was that I was enough and that my own taste and character should simply be enforced,” Bjork said. “Judy is not just a stylist but someone who sees the whole picture and the potential of what people and situations could become. I remember witnessing him switching roles very easily and simply watching a shoot, and whatever it needed he selflessly became that. Like a true catalyst. And often it wasn’t the garment at all…”","In 2016, London’s ICA held a retrospective of Blame’s work, which included pieces from his earlier pieces to the work he did with and for Comme des Garçons, Leigh Bowery, Helmut Lang, Alexander McQueen, Marc Jacobs, Jean-Baptiste Mondino, Kim Jones for Louis Vuitton, Gareth Pugh, and Christopher Shannon. He had an innate way of queering style; of integrating punk into high-fashion with an eye for the beautiful absurd. He made the ’80s and ’90s more colorful, his influence felt by new generations and those still to come. He was a fan of genderfuckery, of idiosyncrasy, and of reinvention.","In a previously unpublished interview just published by i-D, Blame spoke about the retrospective and how he felt about seeing his life’s work culled together.","“It makes a difference to others, not to me. If you look at the work, and what I’ve tried to do throughout my career, I’ve never put boundaries around myself,” he says. “So yes, I work in fashion, from styling, to making things, to catwalks, to working with designers. I’ve never bordered myself in. But it means something to others, it gives a different audience access to what I do — the art crowd. But it didn’t change the way I think about the work, because at my age, the work just flows out of me, and I try to turn it into something. I don’t separate things, it’s one thing that comes out of me.”","Judy Blame’s life is difficult to sum up, as he was not only prolific but incredibly quotable. He shared so much with friends and the public at large, and his presence will be missed by those who didn’t even know they knew him.","“Queens are good at blocking things out, aren’t we?” he once posed. “If it’s not too fabulous then you just don’t think about it.”","Images via Getty and ICA"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8f126b1e000031007ac8bd.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"SPORTS","headline":"Russian Bobsledder Nadezhda Sergeeva Fails Doping Test","authors":"","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nadezhda-sergeeva-doping-russia_us_5a8feba8e4b0ee6416a1eac3","short_description":"A Russian curler had earlier lost his bronze medal over doping charges.","date":"2018-02-23"},"articleContent":["PYEONGCHANG, South Korea (Reuters) - Russian Olympic bobsledder Nadezhda Sergeeva has tested positive for a banned performance-enhancing drug, the Russian bobsleigh federation said in a statement on Friday.","The federation said in a post on its official Facebook page that the athlete had tested positive on Feb. 18, five days after a previous doping test returned a negative result for her.","Aleksandr Krushelnitckii, a Russian Olympic curler, was on Thursday stripped of his bronze medal after failing a doping test.","(Reporting by Gabrielle Tetrault-Farber and Karolos Grohmann; Editing by Mark Bendeich)"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8fed0d210000ed0660218b.jpeg?cache=zoCHGhKwL5&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Journalist Sues St. Louis Police For Assaulting Him During Unconstitutional Crackdown","authors":"Ryan J.

That night, St. Louis police officers chanted that the streets belonged to them, and the head of the police department declared they “owned” the night.","The lawsuit, filed on Friday, alleged that police violated Faulk’s rights under the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth amendments.","“Mr. Faulk’s unlawful arrest and assault by the SLMPD resulted in Mr. Faulk spending 13 hours in the St. Louis City jail and has caused continuing psychological and professional distress,” his attorneys said in the lawsuit.","The American Civil Liberties Union had also filed a suit on behalf of several clients over the tactics police employed. It also obtained a preliminary injunction from a federal judge who found that the plaintiffs were likely to prevail in proving police violated their rights protected by the First and Fourth amendments. U.S. District Judge Catherine Perry said in a November ruling that the evidence illustrated that St. Louis Metropolitan Police officers “exercised their discretion in an arbitrary and retaliatory fashion to punish protesters for voicing criticism of police or recording police conduct.”","This lawsuit was filed on Faulk’s behalf by attorney David Nelson as well as lawyers with ArchCity Defenders, an St. Louis organization, which has done extensive work to fix the fractured and troubled court system in the region.","Faulk, according to the suit, was “raised with a tremendous respect for law enforcement and the justice system,” as his mother served in as district attorney in Alabama. Faulk had “previously covered mass demonstrations in the U.S., Nicaragua, and Honduras” but had never been arrested.","That changed in downtown St. Louis. The suit alleges that officers used their full weight to tackle Faulk to the ground and that he sustained injuries to his neck, shoulders, hips and legs.","“One of the Defendant Doe Police Officers... placed his boot onto Mr. Faulk’s head and used his weight to press Mr. Faulk’s head into the asphalt of the street. Despite cries of pain from Mr. Faulk, the officer continued to press Mr. Faulk’s head against the ground,” lawyers said in the lawsuit.","Faulk was then directly pepper sprayed in the face, they said, and the “excruciating pain” made it impossible for him to see for two hours.","The lawsuit alleges that Faulk saw officers giving high-fives and smoking cigars. “We arrested more than 100 of you clowns tonight,” one officer reportedly said.","The Post-Dispatch, according to the lawsuit prohibited Faulk from reporting on the protests or on any police departments.","“Mr. Faulk now believes that it is unlikely that he can continue his journalistic career in St. Louis because editors concerned about a perceived conflict of interest will not permit him to report on the broad scope of governmental issues for which he was hired. Further, he is significantly less likely to cover protests in the future for fear of assault by police,” according to the lawsuit.","Faulk, like other arrestees, is still facing a pending “failure to disperse” charge. The Post-Dispatch has called on prosecutors to drop the charges.","Read the lawsuit below."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a907937210000a0076022c9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"QUEER VOICES","headline":"Why Queers Love The World Of Disney","authors":"INTO, Editorial Partner","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-queers-love-the-world-of-disney_us_5a905a28e4b0b8607fdc03e0","short_description":"I promise we aren’t all just duped by capitalism, nor are we clueless victims of childhood nostalgia.","date":"2018-02-23"},"articleContent":["by Sassafrass Lowrey","When you enter the gates of Magic Kingdom, you pass under a sign that says “Here You Leave Today And Enter The World Of Yesterday, Tomorrow And Fantasy.”","No one does immersive world building as well as Disney, and when I’m at Disneyland I feel accepted and safe in ways I don’t usually experience out in the world. Disney is a special place for my partner and I; a place where I can be my authentic weird queer self, wearing mouse ears and my “I’m celebrating my dreams coming true” button that Disney gifted me the first day ― not to mention our free upgrade to a royal princess room and watching the fireworks over Cinderella’s castle. All of this got me thinking about how important Disney and its magic is not just to me and my family, but also to so many other queer folks.","Why is it that so many queers love Disney? I promise we aren’t all just duped by capitalism, nor are we clueless victims of childhood nostalgia. Growing up, I enjoyed Disney as much as the next kid of the ’90s, but it wasn’t until adulthood that it became so important to me. There is something special and magical about Disney stories and the immersive world building they create in their parks that lends itself to LGBTQs.","“My experience with Disney parks as an adult has also been super queer,” says Melanie Alatras a genderqueer tenderqueer living in Portland. “Going for Gay Days Anaheim has been delightful. Last year, my sweetie and I happened upon meeting the Evil Queen [from “Snow White”], who was mean to us and made our super Disney-appropriate kinky dreams come true.”","Disney theme parks are one of the few places where my queer family goes to vacation where even as visibly queer folks. I feel not just safe but truly embraced as my little self. I’ve had my own share of very queer interactions with Disney characters in the parks. One of my favorite memories was meeting Chip & Dale at Disney World a few years ago. The Chipmunks spent an extra long time with me and my partner, taking photos and signing our autograph book. Then Dale took my rainbow Mickey bracelet off my hand and put it on his own nose. I’m pretty sure that was Dale coming out to me. There was also the time where Captain Hook held my face and offered to pierce me with his hook ― so kinky.","For some LGBTQ people, loving Disney is about remembering the ways in which the stories helped them through challenging times. Growing up in rural southern Oklahoma, Ari, a pansexual, polyamorous, non-binary person tells INTO, “the transformative power of love in nearly every film was one of the few things that got me through my adolescent and young adult years.”","“Even now,” Ari continues, “I find myself picking up ‘Mulan’ [or] ‘Hercules’ ― and though those characters aren’t transgender, they do change. First for someone else, then for themselves. I’ve ventured into anime and other animated genres, but the classics never lose their shine.”","Disney’s animated movies and characters gave many LGBTQs a window to understand themselves.","“Ariel [from ‘The Little Mermaid’] gave me some of my first trans inklings,” says Rebecca (last name withheld), a trans lesbian from Virginia.","For other LGBTQ Disney lovers, Disney has central to building a kind of life that they never experienced as children.","“It’s an indulgence of an innocence I don’t remember having in childhood,” says Liz Hart, a queer Disney fan in Oregon. “I do think it can be judged as silly or tacky or uncool by a lot of the LGBTQ community, though, which makes me sad.”","Hart says she identifies with the themes in Disney films.","“Like not having both/any parents, being brave when I don’t want to, and believing in myself, as well as loving to sing all the time like some butchy Snow White,” Hart says. “But when I’m at a Disney park I have no fear, I always have a smile, and the outside world is dead to me.”","Disney recently delighted LGBTQ fans with the brief but powerful inclusion of gay character Lefou in last year’s live action release of “Beauty & The Beast.” I cried the first time I saw it in the theater, and the audience cheered when Lefou danced with another man at the end of the film. I haven’t met Lefou in the parks yet, but I hope to someday.","There are so many LGBTQ people who feel a deep connection to Disney since 1991 there has been an annual large LGBTQ meet-up in the parks called Gay Days. During Gay Days, attendees are encouraged to wear red shirts, and many include rainbow mickeys or other queer coded images. Although Gay Days is not officially sponsored by Disney, they are considered unofficially official because characters and cast members are aware of what the red shirts mean, and are known for paying special attention to LGBTQ visitors during Gay Days.","It’s worth noting Disney also sells many rainbow/pride souvenirs available in the parks year round. That kind of celebration adds an integral sense of safety that many LGBTQ people find within Disneyland and World.","“Disney is my safe haven,” says Nat Le Brun. “It’s happy and magical and, as a Little, gives me somewhere to dive right in and feel that beauty of innocence that I never had as a child. As a non-binary Aspie physically disabled lesbian in a very neurotypical heteronormative world it helps me break down barriers.”","“I visit Disneyland a fair amount and I love seeing the baby queers there with their chosen families,” says Rizzo, a Mexican, agender queer femme in the Bay Area. “It is a sacred space where we can be who we are in all our flamboyant queerness and feel like nothing bad will happen. I have seen princesses even treat queers a little more special, cooing over their magical green hair or their pretty clothing. And queers beam, and I have held friends as they cried because, unlike so many other people in their lives, a princess recognized their queer magic and accepted it.”","As the song goes: “When you wish upon a star, makes no difference who you are.

Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.), a loudly pro-Russia lawmaker who has drawn the attention of Mueller and congressional investigators probing Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.","Mueller has not yet interviewed Rohrabacher, the congressman’s spokesman told HuffPost on Friday in a message that also confirmed the 2013 meeting with Manafort. But Mueller’s team wanted to interview Rohrabacher as of late last year, according to news reports, and the criminal information released in advance of Gates’ plea suggests they were asking about Rohrabacher recently. The congressman has already been interviewed by the House and Senate Intelligence committees.","Gates has told a court that he lied to federal investigators on Feb. 1, 2018, about his knowledge of the meeting between Rohrabacher, Manafort and lobbyist Vin Weber when he falsely claimed he did not know Ukraine was discussed. Ukraine is one of the top foreign policy concerns of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Manafort spent years working for Ukrainian politicians close to Moscow. And Rohrabacher was one of only a few U.S. lawmakers to oppose American assistance to a new government in Ukraine established in 2014 after protests against Putin’s allies in that country.","Rohrabacher has become notorious for being what The New York Times calls “an apologist” for Putin. “There’s two people I think Putin pays: Rohrabacher and Trump,” House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said during a 2016 meeting of the GOP’s top brass, according to a secret recording shared with The Washington Post. (McCarthy later said he was joking.) Russian intelligence officials gave Rohrabacher a code name because they viewed him as a valuable source, The New York Times revealed last year.","Rohrabacher maintains that he is simply motivated by a sincere desire for better relations between Washington and Moscow. In a 2014 Twitter exchange, the congressman wrote, “Have known Manafort 35 years. As in all matters, I make up mind based on truth & right, not donations or even friendship.”","Officials speaking with The New York Times last year said they did not believe Rohrabacher was actively working with the Russians.","As both chair of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee covering Europe and a former anti-Soviet hawk, the congressman argues that the two countries with the world’s largest nuclear arsenals need to get along and that Americans should have more sympathy for Russia’s priorities and its fears of Western encirclement.","His team said that Friday’s news does not show any wrongdoing.","“As the congressman has acknowledged before, the meeting was a dinner with two longtime acquaintances ― Manafort and Weber ― from back in his White House and early congressional days. The three reminisced and talked mostly about politics. The subject of Ukraine came up in passing,” Ken Grubbs, Rohrabacher’s spokesman, told HuffPost in an email. “It is no secret that Manafort represented [pro-Putin Ukrainian President] Viktor Yanukovych’s interests, but as chairman of the relevant European subcommittee, the congressman has listened to all points of view on Ukraine. We may only speculate that Manafort needed to report back to his client that Ukraine was discussed.”","Still, Rohrabacher has emerged as an important figure in the investigations into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian efforts to help President Donald Trump and hurt his rival Hillary Clinton.","One of a mere handful of well-known GOP figures in Washington who were enthusiastic about Trump before his election victory, Rohrabacher was once under consideration to be the new administration’s secretary of state. He has cast doubt on the conclusions of the U.S. intelligence community about the election and said voters benefited from the hacks of Clinton campaign messages. Last year, he met with Julian Assange of WikiLeaks, the group that released the stolen Clinton materials, and said he wanted to give Trump information proving the hack was not committed by Russia. Soon afterward, top Republicans curtailed his powers on his influential subcommittee. And in 2016, Rohrabacher had meetings with Trump adviser Michael Flynn ― who is now cooperating with Mueller ― and with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya ― who is known for a Trump Tower meeting she had with Donald Trump Jr., Manafort and others hoping that Russia would share information damaging to Clinton.","The 15-term congressman is courting controversy even as he faces what observers describe as his toughest re-election race yet in a California district that seems to be turning more liberal. He appears unfazed.","“My constituents couldn’t care less about this,” Rohrabacher told The New York Times last year. “They are not concerned about Russia.”","Ryan J.

The queens create two looks: a soup can (in tribute to Warhol’s Campbell’s Soup Cans) that shows off their brand, and a Studio 54-inspired disco look. But while a couple of the girls channel their inner “ARTPOP,” others simply turn into art flops.","Trixie Mattel, who briefly saw the eyes of God as Shangela faked her out during last week’s elimination, heads into this week confident ― but not cocky. She loves design and branding, and so the Warhol Ball seems right up her alley. Indeed, as soon as her “Pep/Abysmal” soup can hits the runway, it’s clear she’s won the challenge. Her voiceover paired with the can is reminiscent of her creative partner Katya’s best All Stars work: “Just like my soup, I’m inspired by rainbows, little birdies, and the reemerging dark recesses of a rocky childhood.”","Even more impressive, though, is the Disco Barbie look she puts together. Her neon pink jumpsuit perfectly fits both the challenge brief and her frame. It’s maybe the best Trixie has ever looked — and it’s a look she put together on the spot! I’d never have guessed comedy queen Trixie would bomb “Snatch Game” and win a design challenge, but props to her for beating the odds and coming out on top.","Joining her in the top two is secret 10th queen Bebe Zahara Benet, who also takes her first win. There’s a splash of drama during critiques, as Ru asks Bebe if she made the outfit herself, to which Bebe responds affirmatively. However, we see during the workroom segment that Aja heavily assisted Bebe with sewing. Aja visibly reacts negatively when Bebe doesn’t credit her, and understandably so. Quite frankly, the design — a fringe-heavy affair perfectly paired with big hair and a face beat for the gods — likely would’ve given Bebe the win even if she were honest about Aja’s help. As a result, our original queen just looks ungenerous.","That isn’t the end of the Aja drama, though. Despite a beautifully constructed runway look, Aja gets knocked for the period-inappropriateness of it, and she really fumbles her explanation. First, she doesn’t know how to pronounce her design inspiration France Joli, saying it “Frances Jolie” instead. Then, she incorrectly cites Brigitte Bardot as a ’70s inspiration, which Ru corrects her as being more ’60s.","“You’re 23 years old, right?” Ru asks Aja. “Obviously, you weren’t here for a lot of history of humans on this planet. But we’re queens. It’s important to know pop culture and things like that. I just expect queens to do a bit more research.”","That’s a tough lecture to receive. Aja’s been doing remarkably well in this competition considering how poorly she fared in Season 9. But here, Ru knocks her not for just a simple error or slip-up. She’s saying Aja hasn’t prepared when it comes to her history, and that’s something that takes more time to fix. It’s a tough break for the comeback kid, but Ru’s criticism is very fair.","Shock of all shocks, BenDeLaCreme doesn’t win this week! She’s merely safe for her genius can and too-pedestrian disco look, and quite frankly, she looks over it on the runway. Both judges and fellow queen Kennedy Davenport note how tired Ben seems. Her response to this is an odd mix of whiny and resigned. I’m not sure where this Ben edit is headed, to tell you the truth. She seems to be put out by what “All Stars” expects of her — performing well every week, sending girls home — and yet she still wants to win. I’d not be stunned if she doesn’t make it to the finale. That’d be a shame, considering how extraordinarily she’s performed this season, but something smells fishy.","I don’t have much to say about either Kennedy or Shangela this week, largely because their efforts are mostly middle of the road. Shangela’s Halleloops soup can is perfect, and Kennedy’s disco diva look is flawless. But Kennedy’s soup can is more of a character-based item than the judges would like, and Shangela’s disco diva look is a mess of gold tinsel strips and fake records. The latter is more offensive (though not the worst look ever seen on “Drag Race,” as Trixie hyperbolically calls it), which puts Shangela in the bottom for the first time this season. But to be honest, it never feels like she’s in real danger of going home. Last week she just saved Trixie, who would look like a real heel if she chopped Shangela the very next challenge. Bebe, on the other hand, adores Shangela. In some universe, she may have sent Shangie home, but not this one.","The lip sync is set to Diana Ross’ “The Boss,” and in telling you that, I’ve already told you who won. Trixie puts up a good fight, but Bebe just is Diana Ross. She’s got the dress, she’s got the hair, she’s got the perfect facial expressions and movements. It’s like when Ru gave Latrice Royale an Aretha Franklin song: Sometimes, one queen is just set up to slay.","During deliberations, Aja notes that Bebe isn’t letting her get a word in edgewise, and I don’t think that was a mistake. Like I said, Bebe wasn’t going to send Shangela home. Better to give Aja a monologue about how much she’s grown than let her argument to stay fall on deaf ears. So the Season 9 queen sashays away. She’s got nothing to be ashamed of, though — she’s grown exponentially in an incredibly short period of time. With a little more experience, she’ll be known as one of the modern drag greats. I’m absolutely sure of that.","You want final thoughts? I’ve got plenty!","There was a mini-challenge this episode, for the first time since the premiere! Aja won it for a perfect pop art Polaroid look. I feel like most mini-challenges are arbitrarily decided (save Reading Is Fundamental), but Aja looked great, so this was a good choice, and a good note for her to go home on.\nThe queens have nothing but kind words for Chi Chi DeVayne as they wipe away her mirror message at the top of this episode, a nice change of pace from the more tense post-elimination chats the last two episodes. Chi Chi is truly a class act.\nI like knowing which queens actually watch “Drag Race.” Raven, for example, is a loud-and-proud “Drag Race” fan who watches every episode and spouts trivia with the best of them on her webseries “Fashion Photo Ruview.” So it’s fun to hear Bebe tell Aja she watched season nine. The OG has her eye on these younger girls.\n“On Season 7, I lost a lip sync to Pearl. Do you know what it’s like to lose a lip sync to a partially sedated twink from Brooklyn?” TRIXIE! When I tell you I screamed!\nWith this latest loss, Trixie’s “Drag Race” lip sync record is 0-3. Trixie now has the worst lip sync record in “Drag Race” herstory, beating Carmen Carrera’s two losses and one tie. Both share the distinction of lip syncing three times without ever sending home another queen.\nGuest judges Shay Mitchell and Tituss Burgess both acquit themselves well this week, particularly the latter. His “Peeno Noir” banter with Ru is an episode highlight. They also benefit from an episode that feels nowhere near as rushed as last week’s.\nWith three episodes left of “All Stars” Season 3, I’d say Shangela is best-positioned to win at this point, assuming this Ben edit is indeed going somewhere. But if Trixie and/or Bebe can rack up at least one more win, they’ll be in solid shape headed into the finale.\nBebe mole update: According to the original theorist’s logic, Bebe was never supposed to win a challenge. Giving her power to make an elimination choice feels like it debunks the theory. Ah, well — it was fun while it lasted.","Next week’s episode promises the payoff of the “Handmaid’s Tale”-themed twist of the season. Who returns, if anyone? Who goes home?

A cycle of mishaps and ludicrous misunderstandings followed: The pair landed in jail, fended off a second leopard, chased after a troublemaking terrier, dismantled a collection of dinosaur fossils and broke up the paleontologist’s engagement so they could be together ― all in less than two hours’ runtime.","We tend to think of the screwball as a relic of Hollywood’s Golden Age, specifically the Depression-era ’30s and ’40s, when romantic comedies blended the silent era’s slapstick bombast with breakneck repartee and ever-escalating plots that would be at home in action movies.","But screwball sensibilities haven’t gone anywhere; they’ve simply morphed into chaos comedies like “Game Night,” which opens this weekend on a gargantuan 3,500 screens.","You’ll recognize “Game Night” because its concept has been transposed onto a smattering of recent studio films: what starts as a routine evening in the company of lovers or colleagues or old friends or siblings results in a mix-up that yields car chases, people falling through ceilings, misplaced cellphones, arrests, strippers inadvertently dying, overwhelmingly potent drugs, henchmen, trickery, animals stuck in the wrong place at the wrong time, and any number of riotous happenstances not mentioned here.","I’m talking about “Date Night,” “The Night Before,” “Office Christmas Party,” “Rough Night,” “Sisters,” “Snatched.” In a way, these are the 2010s’ screwball larks, perhaps better described as comedies of errors. They twist the courtship device of classic screwballs, building on a different sort of romance: Two or more characters who’ve hit a roadblock in their (sometimes platonic) relationship get wrapped up in craaazy-wild frolics, forcing them to work together to escape the scenario. No matter the nature of their connection, they are seeking to reaffirm their value to one another’s lives. Instead of Hepburn wooing Grant away from his fiancée in a battle of the sexes, these characters are wooing one another away from the monotony of adult routines, marital discord or corporate greed.","In the 2010s’ first chaos comedy, “Date Night,” Tina Fey and Steve Carell are fatigued, sexless parents who finally get a fancy dinner out ― except they’ve stolen a reservation that belongs to another couple who happen to be entangled with gangsters who show up at the restaurant with guns and demands. Similar entanglements — guns and demands, that is — recur in “Rough Night” and “Game Night.” So many nights!","At its zenith, the screwball adhered to Hollywood’s self-regulated morality rulebook by cloaking tame sexual tension in rapid-fire antics. But when the industry laid its so-called Production Code ― a rubric that ensured movies were “wholesome” ― to rest in the late ’60s, the genre’s romance ploy became less limiting. Things got louder, bawdier. Still, certain Golden Age hallmarks remained, namely mistaken identities of the Shakespearean variety and quirky action sequences that bordered on the absurd. Both are tropes that define chaos comedies like “Game Night” and its predecessors.","“What’s Up, Doc?,” the 1972 caper starring Barbra Streisand and Ryan O’Neal, revolves around four identical bags of luggage ― one of which contains classified government documents and another that’s carrying coveted jewels ― getting jumbled up at a hotel, leading to a frenzied car chase through the streets of San Francisco. Fast forward to 1987, and we get the Coen brothers’ “Raising Arizona,” a madcap escapade in which Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter play newly married Reagan-era bumpkins who steal a baby and wind up squaring off with a grenade-toting bounty hunter. Veering away from the matchmaking concept, 1988′s lively “Big Business” featured Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin as two pairs of identical twins ― one wealthy, one poor ― who were mismatched at birth. By 2008, George Clooney gave us “Screwball: Sports Edition,” better known as “Leatherheads,” co-starring Renée Zellweger.","In the case of “Game Night,” an amusing farce whose second half grows more convoluted by the minute, it’s an intimate murder mystery party among friends that leads to mistaken identities ... and a car chase ... and a jewel heist ... and an FBI hunt ... and a shootout on an airport runway ... and a lot of fast-tongued dialogue in which characters misinterpret one another’s words. If “Bringing Up Baby” coasts on brisk banter, so does “Game Night” ― but in a contemporary style, with endless pop-culture references that span Marilyn Manson, the Baldwin brothers, “Pulp Fiction” and “Murder She Wrote.”","All this from one suburban night in, as a group of 30-somethings contend with quotidian circumstances like dating, fertility, marriage and sibling rivalry ― the same topics that fueled “Bringing Up Baby,” “It Happened One Night,” “His Girl Friday,” “The Palm Beach Story” and “The More the Merrier.”","“Game Night” starts with a meet-cute between cutthroat trivia hounds (Rachel McAdams and Jason Bateman), then skips ahead to their domestic bustle (they’re struggling to get pregnant) and regular competitive social gatherings ― including the night’s murder mystery proceedings. Once the central clique has mistaken a real murder for a component of the game they’re playing, the events that ensue form a gallery of unfortunate decisions and kinetic confusions.","There’s even a class critique ― a screwball-comedy staple ― at play: Bateman’s character feels inferior compared to his wealthier older brother (Kyle Chandler), who drives a slicker car and owns a house that’s four times as large. And it’s just as political as the housing-shortage crisis in “The More the Merrier” and the stolen federal paperwork in “What’s Up, Doc?” Wait till you see McAdams begrudgingly use an alt-right militia website to learn how to remove a bullet from Bateman’s arm. (No, really. It’s uproarious.)","Aside from Depression-era clichés about why screwballs were fashionable to begin with ― one theory: middle-class Americans enjoyed laughing at pratfalls involving the rich ― part of why these comedies of errors abandoned their simpler roots is obvious: production budgets have ballooned, and romantic comedies are no longer trendy. Instead, today’s visual effects encourage directors to stuff projects with the more, more, more-ness that concludes “Game Night.” Production-code sexcapades are refracted into any number of shenanigans, and movies front-loaded with enticing ensembles and voluminous sight gags ostensibly provide more bang for your ticket-buying buck.","After the crushingly daft “Sisters” and “Snatched,” it’s encouraging that “Game Night” ― written by Mark Perez (“The Country Bears”) and co-directed by John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein (“Vacation”) ― is among the decade’s better chaos comedies. The gags, however preposterous, inspire sequences almost as delightful as Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant weaseling their way out of prison. See, for instance, an unbroken scene that snakes through a mansion where the cast is chasing after a Fabergé egg that could be a ticket out of their situation. See, also, MVP Jesse Plemons, who plays the weirdo loner next door with a dryness that gives his character’s raw emotions a touch of irony. At last, these aren’t just antics for antics’ sake.","Now all we need is a leopard, and the screwball circle will be complete."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8f145a210000a007602095.jpeg?cache=2DMdpIm8Rf&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"EDUCATION","headline":"West Virginia Teachers Are Making Sure Their Students Get Fed While They're On Strike","authors":"Dave Jamieson","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/west-virginia-teachers-strike_us_5a90442de4b0ee6416a2e325","short_description":"A lot of kids would go hungry if not for school.

This week, teachers and administrators increased the number of packs and left them out on Wednesday, so kids could make it through the strike on Thursday and Friday, then on through the weekend, without hunger pangs.","“Even when we know a big snow is coming, we [make sure] those kids will get those backpacks,” said Megan Meadows, a counselor at the school, which is in Kanawha County.","The teachers would have caught state officials off guard if they’d walked off the job with little notice. Instead, they announced their two-day walkout five days ahead of time ― in part so that undernourished students wouldn’t be left in the lurch. Roughly 1 child in 4 in the state lives in poverty, one of the highest rates in the country.","“One the reasons that we didn’t just go out overnight was to give people time to plan, to think about this food issue, and to also allow parents time to sort out what they would do with their children for two days,” said Kym Randolph, spokeswoman for the West Virginia Education Association, one of the unions leading the two-day strike. “We tried to make allowances so that no one would go hungry.”","As ABC7 reported, teachers and volunteers filled a gymnasium in Martinsburg ahead of the strike, packing donations from local food pantries to give to students on Wednesday.","“For a lot of our children, the meals they get at school are the only meals they get for the day,” Christine Campbell, president of the American Federation of Teachers-West Virginia, told HuffPost.","Teachers and other public employees in all of West Virginia’s 55 counties are taking part in the walkout. Teachers have not seen an across-the-board raise since 2014, and rising health care costs mean that some teachers have actually seen their take-home pay go down. They are demanding salary raises and a fix to the state’s public employee health insurance fund so premiums don’t continue to rise.","Only three states in the country have lower teacher pay than West Virginia, according to the National Education Association. HuffPost recently spoke to one elementary school teacher who needs to work at Hardee’s on the weekends to cover her family’s bills.","Public-sector employees in West Virginia don’t have the same collective bargaining rights that workers do in most other states. The state’s two teachers unions cannot bargain directly over wages, but instead must lobby the state legislature to pass legislation regarding wages and benefits. They also do not have the explicit right to strike, although they have done so before, most recently in 1990. West Virginia’s attorney general declared this week that any walkouts would be illegal, but as of Thursday night, the state had not filed for a court injunction to order teachers back to work, according to Randolph.","Teachers plan to return to work Monday, but it’s possible the unions will continue with isolated rolling strikes, with certain counties having to shut down schools periodically if teachers’ demands aren’t met. That, in turn, would mean more meal planning.","In addition to packing food bags, Nitro High School staff also collaborated with Cross Lanes Baptist Church to host pizza lunches at the school and the church on Thursday and Friday during the closure. Some students ended up coming out to the church to help feed other students. Members of the church took pizza out to the teachers who were on picket lines.","“We want to make sure the kids are not hungry, and the teachers are appreciated,” said Brandon Carter, associate pastor at the church. “We’re not in the political fray. They’ve made a decision they need to make for their livelihoods. We’re not concerned with that. We’re just letting them know we care about them and support them.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a905ad91e000017087aca86.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Variable Speed Limits: Improving Safety Or Confusing Motorists?","authors":"Stateline, Editorial Partner","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/variable-speed-limits-improving-safety-or-confusing_us_5a9037b8e4b0a49d395e0e8e","short_description":"A growing number of states are using changeable speed limits when there is stop-and-go traffic or inclement weather, but some critics view them as speed traps.","date":"2018-02-23"},"articleContent":["By Jenni Bergal","When nasty weather or heavy traffic congestion pops up ahead, drivers in a growing number of states may see electronic signs showing speed limits that are lower than usual.","The idea behind these variable speed limits, which can change depending on road, weather or traffic conditions and can get lower as drivers reach the problem area, is to make traffic flow more smoothly and give drivers more time to react to changing conditions. That would help prevent accidents such as rear-end or lane-changing collisions.","Some states say the high-tech systems have helped curb congestion and make the roads safer. But some critics question whether the costly technology is worth the investment, while others view the signs as speed traps. At least one state — Missouri — dumped variable speed limits after drivers and law enforcement gave them a thumbs down.","“There are a lot of pros and cons,” said Amy Ford, a spokeswoman for the Colorado Department of Transportation, which uses variable speed limits primarily when there are crashes. “The trick is getting drivers to comply and understand the idea of smoothing out speeds. It’s a difficult concept to try to communicate to people.”","More than a decade ago, only a small number of states used variable speed limits. Today, at least 15 states, from Maine to Washington, deploy them on certain highways when there is congestion, inclement weather or both.","Here’s how they work: Road sensors gather information about traffic speed, volume, weather and road conditions. The data is transmitted to a traffic operations center and analyzed using an algorithm or a review by staffers, who make decisions about what speed limits should be posted.","In some states, transportation officials have the authority to decide whether to adopt these changeable speed limits on their own. In others, they need legislative approval.","Last year, the Ohio Legislature authorized the state transportation department to use them in certain locations for inclement weather or congestion. And during a November storm, the agency deployed variable speed limits on an interstate near Cleveland.","In South Dakota, the state House last month passed a measure that would have allowed temporary variable speed limits on some interstates, but it died in the Senate last week. Some senators felt the signs were unnecessary or unfair to motorists who may miss them and get penalized because they didn’t know they were speeding.","Road Safety","Some states say variable speed limits have improved road safety.","In Wyoming, which started using them in 2009 during winter storms or vehicle emergencies, the changeable signs made a “dramatic difference” within a year, said Vince Garcia, a state Department of Transportation program manager.","“We have a lot of severe weather conditions and we were consistently having a number of large, multi-vehicle crashes in certain trouble-spot areas,” said Garcia, who pointed to a 2010 University of Wyoming study that found road closures had dropped and crashes were the lowest in 10 years in the year after the signs were installed.","The program was so successful that the state expanded it to several other highways over the next seven years, Garcia said. And the public hasn’t raised a stink about the signs, which can gradually reduce the speed on some interstates from 75 mph to 45 mph in a bad storm, he said. “When people can see a reason for a speed reduction, they’re more tolerant.”","But getting drivers to comply has been a challenge in some states, especially when changeable speed limits are used for traffic congestion.","“When there is weather ahead, drivers are more likely to slow down,” said Mena Lockwood, assistant state traffic engineer for the Virginia Department of Transportation, which uses variable speed limits on some highways. “When there is congestion ahead, they’re less inclined because they can’t see it.”","A 2017 Federal Highway Administration study found that using variable speed limits in heavy traffic or adverse weather can improve safety and eliminate bottlenecks. The agency has helped fund variable speed limit programs in some states.","But the study also noted that the programs rely heavily on driver compliance and in many states are only advisory, which means police can’t issue tickets. In other states, the law allows the changeable speed limits to be enforced.","Shelia Dunn, spokeswoman for the Wisconsin-based National Motorists Association, a drivers’ rights group, said variable speed limits are “very confusing” to motorists and some consider them nothing more than a speed trap.","“You’re going down the highway at 65 and you see the variable speed limit sign and think it’s just a suggestion and not an actual speed limit, and all of a sudden you’re pulled over,” she said. “You don’t even realize you’ve done something wrong.”","Enforcement has been a challenge for police, the federal study found. Officers sometimes are unsure of the speed limit or fear there isn’t enough supporting evidence to issue speeding citations.","And the systems can be expensive. The federal report estimated that deploying them along a route can cost anywhere from under $10 million to nearly $40 million. It noted that there is limited information about whether a system’s benefits equal or outweigh its costs.","Thumbs Down in Missouri","While more states are turning to changeable speed limits, Missouri decided to back away.","Under a pilot program launched in 2008 aimed at reducing congestion and improving safety, the state installed 70 solar-powered variable speed limit signs along 35 miles of highway in the St. Louis area.","At first, police enforced the speed limits, but they became reluctant to continue because they were unsure of what the speed limit was at any given time, as they often were parked downstream of the signs.","The state commissioned a study in 2010, which concluded that while the signs had helped cut the number of crashes along the corridor, they hadn’t improved congestion.","Researchers also surveyed the driving public and law enforcement and found wide dissatisfaction. The majority of respondents agreed the program should be eliminated.","In 2011, Missouri officials decided to make variable speed limits advisory instead of enforceable. Two years later, they ended the experiment, removing the signs altogether.","“The feedback we got from citizens and law enforcement partners was nobody was noticing any difference,” said Tom Blair, a district engineer for the Missouri Department of Transportation. “Motorists thought of it as a speed trap. They were always questioning whether law enforcement was out to get them.”","Blair said Missouri spent about $900,000 for the program, considerably less than many other states.","“We walked away from it because we couldn’t prove we had dramatically reduced the number of crashes or decreased traffic congestion,” he said. “We didn’t want to spend a lot more money on it.”","Stateline home page","Sign up for exclusive state policy reporting and research"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a9038571e000034007aca32.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Emily Ratajkowski Marries Sebastian Bear-McClard In Surprise City Hall Ceremony","authors":"Carly Ledbetter","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/emily-ratajkowski-married-sebastian-bear-mcclard_us_5a908a69e4b03b55731c2d59","short_description":"The two have reportedly been dating for a few weeks.","date":"2018-02-23"},"articleContent":["Emily Ratajkowski is a married woman!","The 26-year-old model announced on Instagram Friday that she had married her boyfriend, producer and actor Sebastian Bear-McClard.

And if the ATF stumbles, it could mean serious consequences for public safety.","Production at U.S. gun companies more than doubled under the Obama administration, with manufacturing totals going from 5.5 million firearms in 2009 to 11.5 million in 2016, the latest year for which federal data are available. Gun sales appeared to go up by similar margins over that period. At the same time, the number of federally licensed gun dealers increased by about 9,000, topping out at 56,754 in 2016, while the number of federally licensed firearms manufacturers more than tripled, according to the ATF.","The ATF’s budget, which includes funds for monitoring the network of gun manufacturers, wholesalers and dealers, has increased only slightly amid the recent boom, and it has remained unchanged at $1.25 billion over the last few years. The agency hasn’t had a Senate-confirmed director since 2015, and, as The New York Times reported on Thursday, the National Rifle Association has been part of a campaign to ensure that the ATF remains a small agency grappling with a wide-reaching set of duties, including prosecuting gun crimes, combating gun violence and trafficking, and regulating firearm commerce in the U.S.","“As an organization, personnel wise, ATF is smaller than the Broward County Sheriff’s department, which would be law enforcement in the Miami area,” said David Chipman, a former ATF agent who now serves as senior policy adviser for the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. “The last aircraft carrier cost $13 billion, so that’d be like 10 years of ATF budgets.”","In 2016, the ATF employed 821 industry operations investigators, who were in charge of regulating more than 100,000 federal firearms licensees, or FFLs. These agents periodically inspect gun dealers and manufacturers to make sure their businesses comply with federal law. ATF investigators review paperwork at gun stores to confirm sales have been legally conducted and properly recorded, so firearms can be traced if they’re used in a crime. For gun manufacturers, the ATF examines inventory and transaction records to make sure the company has distributed its products according to the law.","“The inspector comes in, they take a sample of the forms ― the key is it’s got to be a random sample because they’re not looking at them all ― he looks for troubling answers that shouldn’t be there. If he finds them, he tries to get them resolved or he refers them to law enforcement to get resolved,” said Howard Wolfe, a former ATF supervisor.","By catching illegal sales, straw purchases and other improper dealings, these inspections keep guns out of the hands of those who are not allowed to own them. The inspections also allow the ATF to proactively identify and crack down on the relatively small number of bad actors who are responsible for a disproportionate number of crime guns.","“Although most gun dealers are law abiding and their compliance is pretty good, when you have a dirty dealer, they can push out so many guns into the criminal market quickly, so you’d want to be on top of that immediately,” Chipman said.","But with meager resources and no law specifying how frequently the ATF must inspect firearms licensees, or even mandating that it conduct the inspections at all, the agency is fighting to keep up. From 2007 to 2012, the ATF failed to inspect 58 percent of all FFLs, according to a 2013 Office of the Inspector General report. In 2016, the agency estimated that it conducted 9,790 inspections, only about 7 percent of the 137,464 active licensees.","“You’ve got many dealers that haven’t been inspected in five or 10 years, and that can have dramatic impacts,” Chipman said. “I don’t know about you, but I’d probably shy away from eating at a restaurant that was only health-inspected once a year.”","Of those 137,000 federal licensees, more than 57,000 are firearms collectors. The ATF’s failure to inspect those collectors is less of a concern to Wolfe, because they’re rarely the source of guns used in crimes. But Wolfe admitted that keeping tabs on gun dealers alone remains difficult.","“The FFL license is good for three years, so ATF’s goal is to get each dealer inspected once every three years, but I doubt if they’re making it because there are just way more firearms licensees than there are inspectors,” he said. “The more records an inspector has to look at, the harder his job is. He’s got to do more statistical sampling, he’s got to cut back to a number of records he can actually look at, which increases the chances that he could miss something.”","Although there has been some discussion of mandating routine ATF inspections for each licensee over a certain period, Wolfe said that it would be impossible for inspectors to abide by such a standard with the agency in its current financial shape.","“The powers that be need to realize that if they demand a higher number of inspections with the same number of people, they’re going to get lower quality inspections, and that means things are going to get missed,” he said.","The ATF has pleaded for more funding over the past few years in order to patch up some of these holes.","“The growth in firearms commerce is an external challenge that has strained ATF’s ability to meet the needs of the firearms industry and the citizens of the United States,” the agency wrote in a recent budget request for fiscal year 2019.","“As the volume of firearms commerce continues to increase, the number of individual firearms records and transactions that FFLs maintain has significantly increased, leading to lengthier inspection times,” the document explained.","In its request, the ATF calls specific attention to the lack of timely inspections of FFLs, saying it “presents a significant risk to public safety.”","For the time being, however, the agency doesn’t appear to be getting much help on the regulatory front.","President Donald Trump’s recently released 2019 budget proposal requests an additional $66.6 million for the ATF. The largest increase would go to bolstering the agency’s ability to process applications for equipment regulated under the 1934 National Firearms Act. These items include gun silencers, machine guns and short-barreled rifles, which have surged in popularity in the last decade.","If the federal government is truly committed to addressing gun violence and responsibly regulating a rapidly growing gun industry, it could start by investing in the ATF, Chipman said.","“We can’t have a strategy of trying to win gunfights and punishing people who do bad things really seriously. We have to be on the front end and work together to make sure these guns never get into the wrong hands in the first place.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8f60ad1e0000fb077ac91b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Florida Shooting Survivor Suggests Calling AR-15 Rifles 'Marco Rubios'","authors":"David Moye","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ar-15-marco-rubio-florida-shooting_us_5a90478ae4b03b55731bd4d3","short_description":"They're both \"so easy to buy,\" she said.","date":"2018-02-23"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"The Parkland Teens Are Giving These Columbine Survivors Hope","authors":"Maxwell Strachan","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/parkland-teens-columbine_us_5a8f4dede4b01e9e56b9e156","short_description":"“I’m so proud of them, and I don’t even know them.”","date":"2018-02-23"},"articleContent":["Last week, Austin Eubanks had just wrapped up his speech at a school in Colorado when he noticed he had a message on his phone. It was from a local news station asking to talk. He didn’t need to ask what about.","“I just wrote back, ‘How bad is it?’” Eubanks said.","It was bad. Down in Parkland, Florida, a lone gunman had shot and killed 17 people inside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, a death toll higher than the one inside Eubanks’ own high school that was targeted by two gunmen when he was a teenager.","The attack on Columbine High School in 1999 left 15 dead and forever altered the lives of countless others. It was, at that time, the deadliest school shooting in modern U.S. history. Blame was omnidirectional ― at the parents of the shooters, at the community they grew up in, even at the musicians they listened to and the video games they played.","In the almost two decades since that day, the students of Columbine High School have grown up. They’re adults now, some with children of their own. Alongside them, attacks like the one at Columbine have grown, too, transforming from unfathomable occurrences to the sort of thing you would expect to see on CNN every now and then.","“It’s become a fact of life,” said Samantha Haviland, another Columbine survivor, with a note of resignation in her voice.","Today, Columbine no longer even ranks among the top 10 deadliest shootings in modern U.S. history. That the government has done so little to reduce the frequency of shootings like the one they experienced has become a source of frustration, anger and, occasionally, cynicism among five Columbine survivors who spoke with HuffPost.","But in the last week, something has changed. Watching the Stoneman Douglas students scream for gun control ever since the attack on their own school in Florida, some of the survivors of the Columbine attack have found a renewed sense of hope they didn’t expect to feel again for some time.","“I actually got almost excited with anticipation that this might be the change that we’ve all tried for for so long,” said Anne Marie Hochhalter, who was paralyzed at Columbine after being shot in the back.","“Maybe this will be the answer,” she added. “Maybe this will finally spur on these lawmakers to do something. Just do something.”","Hochhalter had wanted to trust lawmakers after the Columbine attack. “In the beginning, I thought that it would not happen again,” Hochhalter said. “I was like, ‘Oh yeah, I mean, the lawmakers will take care of this. They’ll change things, right?’”","Because of that trust, she said, she didn’t feel a need to enter the political fray. She wasn’t alone. Zachary Cartaya, who was stuck inside Columbine High School for three and a half hours the day of the attack, said many survivors just wanted to return to some semblance of a normal life. Few thought of joining the national conversation. What would they have said, anyway?","“When Columbine happened, none of us were prepared for anything close to advocacy because we had no frame of reference for what had transpired. We didn’t know what was happening. I mean, it was incomprehensible what had occurred,” said Eubanks, who lost his best friend in the Columbine attack and was himself shot multiple times.","Richard Castaldo, who was also paralyzed in the attack, took on some of his father’s political views. A year after Columbine, Castaldo’s father, Rick, stood before Congress and said it was “illogical” and “dishonest” to blame guns for the attack. “I wasn’t really politically active at the time,” Castaldo said. “I think he sort of talked me into that position.”","One student who did try to change things was Haviland, who joined the organization Crime Stoppers International. “I traveled internationally for four years ― tried to stop it from happening again,” she said. But she couldn’t. School shootings started to become the norm. So did mass shootings in public spaces. “It just kept happening and happening,” she said.","Haviland longed for change, but as the years passed, and the number of school shootings continued to grow in number, it became harder to believe it would happen. If anything, things got worse. In 2004, lawmakers allowed the federal ban on assault weapons to lapse, and the number of deaths from gun massacres jumped 239 percent over the next decade.","When former President Barack Obama couldn’t push through gun reform laws after a shooter killed 20 children at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, Haviland had a grim thought: How sad do we have to be before we change? Disillusioned, she decided it was time to admit to herself that nobody was ever going to do anything to seriously combat mass shootings.","She wasn’t alone in her cynicism. Castaldo eventually came to disagree with his father’s anti-gun control stance. He feels the country needs stronger background checks and a more rigorous system for selling high-powered guns. But he also felt the message always seemed to get lost after mass shootings. Cartaya felt that unless the country found a way to “remove all money from politics,” it would be difficult to move forward. Hochhalter lost trust in her lawmakers as she came to understand the true political power of the National Rifle Association.","“When I was younger, I really thought that things would change,” said Hochhalter. “And then, with each subsequent mass shooting, the hope slowly diminished.”","But shortly after the shooting, Haviland, Hochhalter, Eubanks, Cartaya and Castaldo all noticed that something different was happening. Rather than turn inward, the Stoneman Douglas high schoolers started to speak out ― first on Twitter, then on television, then at rallies, courthouses and CNN town halls. They asked the president to do more, pushed for gun control and against NRA talking points.","“It seems like they’re definitely determined to make sure something actually changes this time, which is good,” said Castaldo. “Which is great.”","Days after the shooting, Emma González, a senior at Stoneman Douglas, stepped in front of a microphone at a rally and made it clear she would not place the same faith in her lawmakers that Hochhalter once had. “The people in the government who are voted into power are lying to us,” she said. “And us kids seem to be the only ones who notice and are prepared to call B.S.”","Stoneman Douglas student Robert Bonczek echoed González over Twitter. “The one thing that bothers me the most about this whole situation is that we don’t have the time to grieve. We have such little faith in our politicians, and we know that if we are not constantly pleading for action nothing will get done.”","At a listening session held by President Donald Trump at the White House on Wednesday, another Stoneman Douglas student, Samuel Zeif, asked why the shooter was so easily able to obtain an AR-15-style weapon: “How is it this easy to buy this type of weapon? How have we not stopped this after Columbine, after Sandy Hook?”","It has been a startling departure from mass shootings of the past. Unshrinking from trolls on social media or Florida’s Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, the students of Stoneman Douglas have ripped control of the conversation away from the adults ― a feat that the Columbine survivors see as nothing short of miraculous.","“I’m so proud of them,” Cartaya said, “and I don’t even know them.”","The Stoneman Douglas survivors have grown up in a different world than the Columbine survivors did ― one in which school shootings are a fact of life. “I lived in a world that was so safe,” said Haviland of her suburban life in Colorado before the attack. “I did not expect gun violence in any of my environments ― let alone at my school.” Children coming of age today, however, have grown up in a world in which school shootings are an inevitability ― a matter of when and where, not if.","“These students weren’t even born when Columbine happened,” Eubanks said. “These students have grown up doing active shooters drills their entire lives, so when this happened, I don’t want to say they were prepared for it mentally ― [but] they knew immediately what it was.”","Worse still, he added, the weapons threatening them are even more powerful. “I mean, Columbine had two shooters, multiple weapons each and there were 13 people killed,” said Eubanks. “In this shooting, with the AR-15 involved, we had one shooter and there were 17 people killed.”","After the Columbine shooting, Haviland said, she and others spent a lot of time “pointing fingers.” But the political environment is different now, and that’s reflected in the actions of the Stoneman Douglas students. “It feels like instead of being victims, they’re going to be activists,” she said.","“It’s amazing to me,” agreed Hochhalter. “When we all went through it at Columbine, we were in a fog and a daze. And I’m sure that these kids are feeling that way, too, to some extent, but they’re putting their energy into activism, and I think that that’s a really healthy way to deal with the horrific emotions surrounding what they just went through.”","The Stoneman Douglas students have already faced the wrath of the country’s toxic political culture. People have accused them of mourning incorrectly or of being mouthpieces for the left. Conspiracy theorists have accused some of the students of being “crisis actors,” all to the disgust of the Columbine survivors. “Unless you have been there, shut up,” Eubanks said.","“They went through a tragedy, and now they’re being defamed for going through a tragedy,” said Castaldo. “I don’t understand that at all.”","Next month, the students of Stoneman Douglas plan to hold a national “March For Our Lives” to continue their campaign to put a stop to school shootings around the country, and the Columbine survivors are interested in participating or doing anything else they can. “Anything I can do, I definitely want to help,” Castaldo said. ”Because obviously it affected me. It affected me for the rest of my life, so I definitely want to do anything I can.”","As is to be expected in a swing state like Colorado, not every Columbine survivor is a proponent of gun control. One of them, Patrick Neville, is now a Republican Colorado House minority leader. Every year since 2014, he has put forth a bill that would allow people to legally bring guns to K-12 schools throughout the state. ”Time and time again we point to the one common theme with mass shootings, they occur in gun-free zones,” he said in an interview this week.","The Columbine survivors do have some concerns about the Parkland teens. They want to make sure the Stoneman Douglas students take time to seek professional counseling ― something they say too many Columbine students avoided for too long. “These kids may score a major political victory and, God help me, I hope they do,” said Cartaya. “But then what’s next?”","“It is a constant battle. And if you slip even a little bit you fall really hard, and that’s coming from experience,” he added.","All of the Columbine survivors have grappled with the attack in their own way. Cartaya was well on his way to a successful career in finance when he started having trouble sitting in conference rooms — claustrophobia brought on by the shooting, he later realized. Whenever he hears of a new attack, he said, “it’s always hard to not revert back to the 17-year-old me, who walked out of the school shaken and traumatized.” (He now works with other Columbine survivors to help people who went through similar attacks.)","Eubanks struggled with addiction for a decade after the attack before he got clean and started an addiction treatment center. Hochhalter said she still has trouble leaving her house after learning of any new mass shooting out of fear someone might open fire. She still has “flashbacks.”","“But it’s not like I’m back at Columbine when I get the flashbacks,” she said. “When I get them, I’m transported into where the shooting is.” After a shooter killed 58 people in Las Vegas last October, she decided to go back into counseling.","The survivors who spoke with HuffPost also made clear that, unlike some critics, they do not believe counseling and advocacy should be mutually exclusive. “I encourage their personal care, but also their outrage. They have every right to be pissed off,” Haviland said.","Asked what advice she had for them, she added, “Don’t let people forget.”","The students of Stoneman Douglas are trying to make sure people don’t. On Thursday morning, Stoneman Douglas student Carly Novell posted a message on Twitter that has since been retweeted more than 10,000 times. It’s point was clear.","“I don’t want [Stoneman Douglas] to be remembered as ‘the school that had the shooting,’” she wrote. “I want it to remembered as the school that started a revolution.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8f50051e0000fb077ac917.jpeg?cache=OQBG6n8wRP&ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"SPORTS","headline":"The Best Meme Of The Winter Olympics Belongs To Scott Moir","authors":"Lee Moran","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/scott-moir-meme-winter-olympics-canada_us_5a8fdbc3e4b03b55731abae9","short_description":"\"This should be one of those Canadian Heritage Moments.\"","date":"2018-02-23"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Terrorism Analyst Fired For Racist Tweet Mocking Chinese Government","authors":"Kimberly Yam","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/terrorism-analyst-fired-mocking-chinese-government_us_5a905226e4b0ee6416a2fd57","short_description":"Michael S.

The increase represents the biggest rise in this category since at least 2009, the earliest consecutive year for which we could find publicly reported numbers in this category.","The number of racial harassment discrimination complaints the department’s civil rights division receives has ebbed and flowed over the last nine years. It did not receive more than 600 complaints until fiscal year 2017, when the number climbed to 675, a nearly 25 percent increase from the previous year. Previously, the number had bounced between a low of 362 and a high of 577.","The Office for Civil Rights, or OCR, is charged with addressing complaints under Title VI, the federal law that protects students from discrimination based on race, color and national origin.","The Department of Education provided the numbers in response to an inquiry from HuffPost. A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Education did not respond to a request for comment when asked about potential reasons for this uptick, or to a request about numbers from earlier than 2009, by press time.","Catherine Lhamon, who ran OCR during the Obama administration, said she could not speculate on the reasons for this increase, but pointed to outside data showing a surge in hate crimes nationally.","“Our schools are places that encapsulate and reflect the national climate as well,” said Lhamon, who is now chair of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. “It is distressingly unsurprising that there might be an uptick in racial harassment complaints coming to OCR.”","Zoe Savitsky, deputy legal director at the Southern Poverty Law Center, pointed to the numbers as evidence that the Trump administration is creating a toxic national environment that is in turn affecting schools. In the wake of the 2016 presidential election, the Southern Poverty Law Center started surveying teachers about how the election had influenced their school’s climate. Many teachers reported seeing an increase in hateful language and attitudes toward marginalized student groups.","“I am saddened but not surprised,” said Savitsky of the rise in racial harassment complaints in schools.","In general, grievances regarding discrimination related to race and national origin appear to have mostly held steady between 2016 and 2017, per documents related to the department’s budget request released last week. But within that category, harassment complaints underwent a specific leap. Other types of complaints that involve race or national origin might cover disproportionate disciplining of minority students or segregation.","The record number of harassment complaints comes as OCR has begun scaling back its operations under the Trump administration. The Education Department recently announced that it would no longer deal with discrimination complaints involving transgender students’ use of bathrooms. Last June, OCR announced that its attorneys would spend less time searching for evidence of systemic discrimination at public schools and universities in order to work through a backlog of complaints. The administration’s proposed budget for next year, released earlier this month, indicates that it plans to significantly shrink the number of employees working at OCR.","Between 2016 and 2017, OCR saw a 23 percent drop in the number of complaints it received overall. This decrease, though, could be attributable to a single individual who filed over 6,000 complaints in 2016. Notwithstanding this complainant, the office actually saw a significant increase in overall complaints in 2017.","An Education Department spokesperson also provided HuffPost with numbers showing that complaints regarding incidents of sexual violence in schools, including at K-12 schools and universities, held mostly steady in 2017 after a huge uptick in 2016.","Notably, in 2017, OCR also provided fewer technical assistance sessions, in which education department staffers advise public school officials and other stakeholders about their obligations under civil rights law. OCR held 250 sessions in 2015 and 295 in 2016. In 2017, the office held only 188.","A spokesperson for the Education Department did not respond to inquiries about why this number might have decreased.","Lhamon said she found the decrease concerning.","“I was sick about how few technical assistance sessions we were able to offer in my time,” she said. “Reducing the number means OCR reaches fewer willing audiences about how to do what Congress has commanded and make sure students are safe.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8db57d2000002d00eaf8df.jpeg?cache=YmdGY5AvX0&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Laura Ingraham Says 'Liberals Are Kind Of Like Herpes' At CPAC","authors":"Alanna Vagianos","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/laura-ingraham-cpac-liberals-herpes_us_5a903271e4b0ee6416a2a396","short_description":"The Fox News host was riffing off a Tim Allen quote about the Clintons.","date":"2018-02-23"},"articleContent":["Laura Ingraham certainly knows how to light up a room with her controversial comments.","Speaking at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference on Friday morning in National Harbor, Maryland, the Fox News host compared progressives to herpes.","Ingraham said that a friend told her she needed to “have a good time” with the crowd at CPAC.

The Lodi, California-based organization provides grants to groups that work to improve food access, health and nutrition for Native American families.","Romero-Briones and her family received the food deliveries as part of the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR), a project of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Established in the 1970s, the program was conceived as an alternative to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), still often called food stamps, that would serve low-income households living on or near reservations. The delivery of uniform food boxes was presented as an option for reservations located in remote rural areas with few supermarkets. Recipients could choose whether they wanted to participate in FDPIR or SNAP.","FDPIR remains an option for Native Americans, although it is now administered locally by tribal organizations and state agencies. The program got $151 million in federal funding last year and serves about 90,000 low-income households every month. In 2009, the average FDPIR box was valued at about $78 per recipient per month.","The quality of the food and the way it’s distributed have improved on a number of reservations since Romero-Briones was a child, said Janie Hipp, director of the Indigenous Food and Agriculture Initiative at the University of Arkansas. But food security advocates contend the program still has a number of problems: Many of the products are high in salt and sugar, and there are few fresh fruits and vegetables. This is of particular concern in native communities, which face high rates of heart disease and obesity.","And now those problems could extend to millions of other low-income Americans if the Trump administration successfully overhauls SNAP as it proposed in its 2019 budget outline last week. The proposal calls for a 25 percent spending cut to SNAP and would partially replace food stamps with boxes of canned goods in a way that looks rather like the less desirable aspects of the program Romero-Briones remembers.","There are currently 42 million SNAP recipients, who receive an average voucher of $125 per person per month. Those vouchers can be redeemed for almost any food product in a grocery store, excluding things like liquor and hot, prepared meals. The program is credited with reducing the poverty rate from 15.4 percent to 12.8 percent in 2015, according to an Urban Institute report.","Under the Trump administration’s proposed program, households getting more than $90 per month in SNAP benefits would receive a portion of those benefits in the form of a food package, dubbed the “Harvest Box.”","White House budget director Mick Mulvaney likened the boxed food program to Blue Apron, a high-end subscription food service that delivers ingredients with recipes to people’s homes. But for those well-versed in government commodity programs, the proposal rings more of the problematic efforts of yesteryear.","Hipp said the idea is riddled with problems. In addition to the nutrition concerns and the fact that the boxed program wouldn’t give recipients much autonomy over their food choices, she noted there are logistical issues when it comes to moving this much food to this many people. FDPIR services about 90,000 households a month, a tiny fraction of the number that SNAP supports. There are also questions about how the boxed food program would handle recipients’ individual dietary restrictions.","Native American advocates have been working to move away from the delivered boxes and instead to set up FDPIR food sites that resemble grocery stores. They’re also trying to incorporate more staples of the native diet, such as wild rice, bison, salmon and blue corn.","Years of subsisting on the typical American diet has had devastating health effects on native populations. Fifty years ago, heart disease was a rarity among Native Americans. Today, it’s the leading cause of death. Native Americans also have a greater chance of developing diabetes than any other racial group in the U.S.","The Trump proposal listed a number of foods that a standard Harvest Box would include such as peanut butter, shelf-stable milk, beans and pasta. But it didn’t explain how it would tailor the boxes to, say, someone who has specific dietary needs.","“What do you do with people who have allergies or who can’t have gluten or who can’t have dairy?” Hipp asked. “The ‘one size fits all’ idea ― it’s not even regressive. It’s not matching up with what we already know in the science around how different people’s physiologies react to different foods.”","In the last decade, a number of tribes have transitioned from the delivered-box service to a supermarket-style program. An initiative in the Cherokee Nation of Northeastern Oklahoma serves about 11,000 recipients who have access to seven FDPIR locations that are modeled after grocery stores, said Chuck Hoskin Jr., the secretary of state for the Cherokee Nation.","The updated program gives people more control over their food choices, and the options themselves have improved over the years. Recipients can pick cartons of milk instead of just powdered milk, for example. They’re getting frozen or fresh pork chops, hamburger and bison instead of canned meat. There are also fresh fruits and vegetables, instead of the canned versions.","These food sites are strategically located near health centers, so that recipients can learn about the medical options available to them, and the sites host food seminars to teach people about healthy eating. At one recent event, 150 participants in Tahlequah, Oklahoma, received free blenders and smoothie recipes in exchange for attending the monthly workshop and tracking their exercise and nutrition.","“You can’t put that opportunity in a box,” Hoskin said.","The Trump administration argues that its proposed changes to SNAP would be a huge money-saver, shaving about $21 billion a year from the federal deficit over the next decade.","But Hipp wonders how such savings could even be possible, considering the logistical challenges and expense involved in getting these packages to people’s homes or drop-off locations. Delivering the food in a timely manner would be key, since perishables will expire. FDPIR has struggled with these issues over the years, prompting ongoing negotiation between the tribes and the federal government, Hipp said.","FDPIR still serves a critical purpose in rural areas where it’s simply not feasible to get to a supermarket that participates in SNAP. On the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota, for example, there are about 40,000 residents spread over some 3,500 square miles and just three supermarkets. Prices in those stores are often very high. The stores bring in goods from Rapid City or neighboring Nebraska, and store owners say fuel costs force them to set higher prices.","The FDPIR grocery-like sites that native advocates would prefer would require additional funding and infrastructure, which aren’t expected anytime soon, Hipp said.","The Harvest Box concept might not have much chance of moving forward in Congress, and Trump administration officials have suggested it was really meant to rile up liberals. But the proposal may have served to emphasize just how serious the administration is about pushing forward with $85 billion in other cuts to food assistance programs. Food security experts are urging advocates to focus less on the Harvest Box proposal and more on the bigger issue: the steep cuts to SNAP.","“I worry that all the attention to the Harvest Box distracts from the fact that this administration has proposed to shrink SNAP,” said Stacy Dean, vice president for food assistance policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. “It’s important for us to focus on that vision, one where millions of people lose benefits and benefits are slashed for those who remain. That’s deeply worrying.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8c44db2000003900eaf6b2.jpeg?cache=7bTM1dovGi&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Kim Cattrall’s 'Sex And The City' Boo Sides With Sarah Jessica Parker","authors":"Elyse Wanshel","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kim-cattrall-sex-in-the-city-boo-sides-with-sarah-jessica-parker_us_5a903044e4b03b55731b84f1","short_description":"Actor Jason Lewis, AKA Smith Jerrod, has spoken.","date":"2018-02-23"},"articleContent":["Smith Jerrod of “Sex and the City” would shave his head for Samantha Jones.

John Culberson (R). Her campaign has already garnered significant support, raising nearly $150,000 this year. But on Thursday, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee came out swinging against Moser’s bid, posting links that resemble opposition research meant to undermine her campaign, which some have called too liberal for what’s expected to be a contentious election.","“Voters in Houston have organized for over a year to hold Representative Culberson accountable and win this Clinton district,” Meredith Kelly, communications director for the DCCC, said in a statement provided to HuffPost. “Unfortunately, Laura Moser’s outright disgust for life in Texas disqualifies her as a general election candidate, and would rob voters of their opportunity to flip Texas’ 7th in November.”","Kelly then linked to a quote from a November 2014 article in which Moser said she’d rather have her “teeth pulled without anesthesia” than live in the town of Paris, Texas, where her grandparents once resided. The DCCC, did not, however, provide context to the quote or note that Paris doesn’t fall in the congressional district that Moser would represent if elected.","An email to the DCCC about the lack of context was not immediately answered.","Moser appeared to address the DCCC’s move on Twitter late Thursday with a simple post referencing former first lady Michelle Obama.","She expanded on her tweet later that day in a statement to the Texas Tribune, saying it was “disappointing to hear” the critiques.","“These kind of tactics are why people hate politics,” Moser told the news site. “The days where party bosses picked the candidates in their smoke filled rooms are over. DC needs to let Houston vote.”","Moser, a journalist based in Houston, is the founder of Daily Action, a text-alert calling system meant to energize fellow progressives to take political action themselves. Her campaign website lists her support for a bevy of progressive causes, including single-payer health care, paid parental leave and campaign finance reform.","She spent several years living in Washington, D.C., before returning to Texas, a point the DCCC has leveraged to call the candidate a “Washington insider.”","The 7th Congressional District includes parts of West Houston and was carried by Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election.

The revised statement is meant to reflect the guiding principles of the agency’s new director, L. Francis Cissna, who was picked by President Donald Trump. Cissna hopes to focus on “fairness, lawfulness and efficiency,” a spokesperson for USCIS told HuffPost.","USCIS is in charge of granting visas, residency and other permits that allow foreign citizens to visit, live and work in the United States.

Cissna has directed the agency’s employees to end the use of that term.","Referring to applicants as “customers” emphasizes the ultimate satisfaction of the applicant, Cissna wrote in an email to his staff, rather than the “correct adjudication” of the applications according to law.","“Use of the term leads to the erroneous belief that applicants and petitioners, rather than the American people, are whom we ultimately serve,” the director stated in the email, provided to HuffPost.","Cissna’s email did not address why the reference to America as a “nation of immigrants” was removed. However, the Trump administration has pushed forward a number of policies that have concerned immigration advocates.","During Trump’s State of the Union address last month, he proposed making drastic cuts to legal immigration. Last September, the president threw nearly 700,000 undocumented young people’s immigration status into jeopardy when he announced the end of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. The Trump administration also decided to terminate the temporary protective status that allowed thousands of immigrants from Haiti and El Salvador to remain in the U.S.","Trump has long pledged that he would prioritize the needs of native-born citizens.

Former staffers say otherwise.","date":"2018-02-23"},"articleContent":["By all outside appearances, 2016 was the year Revolution Messaging arrived. The upstart political firm, founded by alumni of Barack Obama’s presidential runs, was the mastermind behind the punk-rock vibe of Bernie Sanders’ campaign and helped him raise a staggering $218 million in small donations.","But inside the firm, the staff was in revolt.","Revolution forced out a female employee in early 2016, just two months after one of the company’s partners ― her supervisor ― had been accused of physically assaulting her at a company holiday function, several people with knowledge of the incident said. The firm had quickly fired the partner. But multiple Revolution employees worried that the woman’s departure was retaliatory ― and symptomatic of a workplace in which some women and people of color felt overlooked or marginalized.","By mid-February of that year, employees at the Washington, D.C., firm were circulating a draft letter to management demanding to know whether the woman had been forced out as an act of retaliation.","“If it is the case, as we fear, that [her] employment was involuntarily terminated just two months after being assaulted by her supervisor and a partner at the firm,” the letter read, “that would be untenable.”","The upheaval belied Revolution’s public image as a firm on the cutting edge of the progressive movement. Founder Scott Goodstein was a key member of Obama’s groundbreaking 2008 digital team. As the firm expanded, Goodstein brought on other Obama alumni like Arun Chaudhary, the White House’s first official videographer. The company’s clients included liberal stalwarts such as the Teamsters union and high-profile “resistance” players like Sen. Sanders (I-Vt.), the feminist advocacy group UltraViolet and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.). Revolution helped Chaudhary’s wife, Laura Moser, launch Daily Action, an app that encourages people to contact elected officials once a day. (Moser is now running for Congress in a Texas swing district that Democrats hope will be part of a 2018 wave.)","But Revolution’s leadership failed to live up to the ideals that are its stock in trade, according to nine former employees. They described a company where the most thankless positions were usually held by women and where people of color sometimes felt their opportunities for growth or visibility were constrained. “People were very frustrated by the hypocrisy of the leadership in the face of the values they espouse,” one former employee said.","Most of the former staffers who spoke for this story remained under non-disclosure agreements and feared legal repercussions if their names were revealed. None of these former employees suggested that Revolution’s clients ought to have known about the company’s troubled internal culture. Nor did they think their negative experiences were universal, given that the firm’s different departments are siloed and personality-driven.","Revolution disputes the former staffers’ description of the firm and of the circumstances of the former employee’s departure. A company spokeswoman, Moira Muntz, defended its handling of the alleged assault and denied that it fired the female employee in retaliation ― or that it forced her out at all.","But Revolution does not dispute the story of the alleged assault.","‘We Have A Serious Problem’","The incident occurred sometime in the early morning hours of Dec. 4, 2015. Revolution had rented an ivy-draped mansion in Washington’s Logan Circle neighborhood for out-of-town employees to stay with their spouses and domestic partners. After the holiday party ended, the afterparty moved there.","In an email sent to Goodstein around 5 a.m. with the subject line “We have a serious problem,” a male Revolution staffer wrote that he and other employees had seen the Revolution partner in question mixing alcohol with a prescription drug. The partner went upstairs several times, the male staffer wrote, to wake up Janson Hartliep, the female staffer’s boyfriend. “He was aggressive but unintelligible,” Hartliep told HuffPost.","Then, back downstairs, the Revolution partner allegedly pushed the female staffer against a wall and held her there. Hartliep was asleep, but the woman described the incident to him later that morning. “She felt threatened and unsafe,” he said.","The male staffer also didn’t witness that part of the incident, but he wrote that he saw the female staffer flee up the stairs, shouting, “Get the fuck away from me.” He wrote that the partner ordered him to “deal with her” and that the partner yelled the woman’s name up the stairs.","“I went upstairs to talk to her,” the male staffer added. “She was shaking and crying. She told me he pinned her to the wall and she was scared.” While they were talking, the male staffer wrote, a third Revolution employee texted to ask if the female staffer was OK. The female staffer told the male staffer that the third employee had witnessed the incident.","“We have built an environment of trust and freedom,” the male staffer wrote in the email to Goodstein. “We want to be more than co-workers. We want to be friends. Today, [that] freedom was abused. … I have no idea how these situations are best handled and only want to participate in the continuation of a safe, productive and fun working environment.”","The male staffer’s email arrived in Goodstein’s inbox at 5:17 a.m. Revolution stripped the partner of his role in the company within hours of receiving that message. (The former partner did not respond to HuffPost’s attempts to reach him through his personal website, on social media and at phone numbers listed in public directories.)","That same day, Chaudhary and Goodstein met with the female employee. “It means a great deal to feel heard,” she wrote to Chaudhary afterward. (Revolution shared her email.)","“Always. And 100 percent do not hesitate to reach out with anything,” Chaudhary replied. “There was no good outcome, but there was the right outcome, and making sure you are empowered and productive here has to be at the heart of what we do.”","In the weeks that followed, Revolution began to revamp its internal policies to prevent a similar incident from happening again, attempted to help the female staffer feel safe and supported — including by offering to connect her with medical or psychological services — and stressed that the incident wasn’t her fault, Muntz said.","But the partner’s termination wasn’t the end of the woman’s troubles with management. Two months later, she was gone as well — under circumstances that still aren’t clear.","‘Scott Called And Fired Me’","“We acted swiftly to fire the responsible employee within hours of receiving the complaint — before the following noon,” Muntz said, citing Revolution’s “zero tolerance policy” for inappropriate behavior. “Months later, the other employee left the firm. Her departure was completely unrelated to her previous complaint. Her departure was not forced. We supported her and did not want to see her go.”","The woman’s departure was a result of discussions she was having with Revolution about a new role there, the firm said. Rather than continue those conversations, the firm said, “she decided to move on, and as it turns out had already been interviewing for a new job.”","As evidence, Muntz provided the text of an email that the female employee addressed to Revolution’s staff. “I have decided to move on from Revolution Messaging,” the email reads.","But two former employees contradicted the company’s story, saying the female staffer told them she was being forced out. Nor did she immediately begin another job. Text messages and chat logs viewed by HuffPost back this up. “I do not have a job any longer,” the woman wrote in one such exchange. “Scott called and fired me.” The messages, in which she said she expected to negotiate for severance, were dated roughly two weeks before co-workers received her resignation note.","Erin Rappleye, the female staffer’s roommate, said they were both at home when the woman received the call. “She came out of the home office, obviously upset, and told me she had just been fired,” Rappleye said. Soon after the call, the female staffer, who worked remotely, was shut out of her Revolution accounts.","“If Revolution is characterizing her departure as voluntary, that’s not accurate,” said Hartliep, the female staffer’s boyfriend. He declined to elaborate on any conversations they had about her departure.","“We don’t know why anyone would characterize her departure this way [as involuntary],” Stacey Wharam, Revolution’s human resources officer, responded. “We wanted her to stay and the company went to every effort towards that end.”","In the weeks leading up to her exit, her former co-workers said, the woman felt as if she was under undue scrutiny because of the reported assault and the difficulties it had created for her team. The fired partner was replaced as her supervisor by an interim team leader, and there was friction as he adjusted to his new responsibilities.","At the time, the female staffer was playing a crucial role in Revolution’s work for the Sanders presidential campaign. It was her job to prioritize the flurry of requests other divisions made to the tech team ― for changes to the fundraising platform or the way Sanders’ website solicited emails – and to see that they became a reality. Colleagues were frustrated to lose her at a crucial moment in the race, just days after Sanders won the New Hampshire primary and days before the Democratic caucuses in Nevada.","“To lose that resource in between New Hampshire and Nevada? It made absolutely no sense,” said Michael Whitney, a former Revolution employee who agreed to speak on the record. “It was like having the rug pulled out from under us, forget that we were all friends and had a great rapport. It just felt like they were trying to get rid of a problem.”","The female staffer’s former colleagues passed around a draft letter demanding answers. Calling her “a pleasure to work with,” “hard­working” and “damned good at what she does,” the letter expressed admiration that the assault hadn’t affected her performance and disbelief that she could have been fired “for cause.”","“Revolution Messaging’s apparent treatment of [our co-worker] not only falls short of what would seem to be the obvious and proper course of action for any person who experienced such trauma, but directly contradicts the values of a progressive firm like ours,” the draft letter read.","Five employees — including Whitney, who coordinated the effort — agreed to sign the letter, although two said they would sign only if it garnered a certain number of signatures. But ultimately, the signers were too nervous about damaging their own prospects at the firm to send the letter.","“That is one of the most disappointing things,” Whitney said. “The fact was, people felt hesitant to sign because there was not an explicit culture at Rev that said it’s OK to speak out in order to make a better workplace together.”","Muntz confirmed that Revolution’s partners never received the draft letter and said they wished the employees had gone to human resources or management to voice their concerns. Whitney’s suggestion that the woman’s firing was retaliatory was “speculating,” the firm said. “Michael Whitney had no access to the communications between [the former female employee] and the firm and absolutely no first-hand knowledge of the circumstances of [her] departure,” Wharam said.","“The firm believed her and took immediate action to assist and support the female employee after receiving the complaint — asking if she wished to call the police or file a police report (she did not), asking if she was assaulted (she said she was not), offering her time off from work (she declined),” Muntz wrote in an email.","After HuffPost provided evidence that the woman had described the incident as an “assault” in contemporaneous accounts, Revolution said it would not dispute her characterization.","‘Hired To Not Fully Disrobe’","Overall, former employees linked Revolution’s personnel problems to the fact that it grew rapidly from a tiny upstart, under leaders who were close friends and gifted political operatives but weren’t experienced at running a full-fledged company. The number of people working there seemed to double every few years. In 2011, its website listed eight employees. By 2015, there were more than 30. Today, there are nearly 80.","“The company grew too fast and they really sort of liked being this there-are-no-rules, we’re-so-different place,” said one ex-employee. “But in the real world there are rules and processes, because otherwise shit gets out of control.”","And the female staffer’s departure was not the only incident that left some people at Revolution feeling uneasy.","Several former employees said Chaudhary employed a rotating cast of young female assistants whom he sometimes belittled and bullied in profanity-laced tirades. Former employees described the dynamic as a breach of normal workplace boundaries. Chaudhary’s outbursts were often followed by flattering apologies or claims that his behavior should be blamed on the pressure cooker of the campaign trail. (He and his assistants sometimes traveled together on a punishing schedule.) One former assistant compared working for Chaudhary to being in an emotionally abusive relationship.","HuffPost was able to independently corroborate specific examples of Chaudhary’s behavior, but is withholding the details to protect the privacy of the women involved.","In response, Revolution said that only one of Chaudhary’s assistants had left the position because she was overwhelmed or unhappy, and that both men and women have worked as his assistant. Chaudhary has also changed his management style and cut the responsibilities of his assistant in half based on employees’ feedback, the firm said.","“Trying to fill the shoes of my first assistant, who has since risen through the ranks and become our COO, was a challenge,” Chaudhary said in a statement. “There were times where my frustration was verbally demonstrated which, upon recognition, I followed with a strong and warranted apology.”","In 2012, according to a former female employee, Goodstein and partner Keegan Goudiss hired male strippers as a joke for Chaudhary’s birthday.","Revolution said that was “not quite right.” A group of men and women hired just one performer — the firm believes he worked for a candygram company and stripping was not part of the services he offered — to mark the launch of a book Chaudhary had written, Revolution said.","“This was back in the early days, several years ago,” Muntz said. “Arun was doing a lot of media interviews around his book launch and to celebrate this milestone — and poke fun at all the attention he was getting — a group of colleagues came up with the idea to hire a guy to come in looking like a reporter and then do a little partial strip tease. He was hired as a gag and did not fully disrobe and was specifically hired to not fully disrobe.”","She added that “it was regrettable and certainly not the kind of thing the firm would do today. These days the staff bonding activities involve trips to soup kitchens, cooking contests, and our annual agency sock design contest.”","‘I’ve Never Witnessed Anything But His Respect’","Former Revolution employees have also questioned the firm’s commitment to racial diversity. In a 2017 survey of 10 people of color employed at Revolution, which an employee conducted in secret, a majority were lukewarm when asked if they felt represented at the firm or believed that Revolution prioritized diversity in hiring. “We’re better at supporting it in theory but not practice,” one person wrote in the space provided for comments. “I don’t see a commitment to diversity especially in senior roles.” (All but a handful of Revolution’s senior leadership are white.)","A majority of the survey respondents thought that Revolution recognized their contributions, regardless of their backgrounds, and felt confident in voicing their opinions. But they were skeptical of the firm’s commitment to diversifying its ranks.","“We have whole departments without a single [person of color], and it seems like there have not been meaningful attempts to change that,” another person wrote. “Most often it is POC advocating to hire POC, while it’s merely something that managers consider but don’t actively do anything about.”","Revolution never saw those survey results, Muntz said. In an all-staff survey, initiated by Revolution and administered by an outside firm, 79 percent agreed with the statement “My organization is dedicated to diversity and inclusiveness.” Just four respondents disagreed. More than 90 percent agreed with the statements “Employees treat each other with respect,” “My organization has a safe work environment,” and “I am satisfied with the culture of my workplace.”","Today, women constitute 59 percent of its employees and hold 66 percent of its leadership positions, and it is in the process of selecting an outside diversity consulting firm, Revolution said.","“We have been deliberately and consistently growing and evolving our firm to more closely mirror the diverse America we fight for each day,” Goodstein said in a statement to HuffPost. “It’s a work in progress, but we are proud that the majority of our hires over the last two years have been women and people of color.”","Revolution asserts that it does practice its principles in private, even when doing so is potentially costly. The firm dropped Rep. Alan Grayson’s Senate campaign in 2016 immediately after reports surfaced that the Florida Democrat had abused his ex-wife, and Muntz said the firm has fired or declined to take on clients who have mistreated Revolution’s female employees.","Digital strategist Holly Fussell said the firm stood up for her when she publicly accused an outside Democratic strategist of rape. The partners vehemently defended her amid the backlash and offered her time off, public relations advice and legal resources. “Revolution Messaging was the only reason I wasn’t forced out of politics altogether,” she said.","Chaudhary was particularly vocal in his support, Fussell said.","“I’ve never witnessed anything but his respect for women and staff,” she said. “I’ve seen Arun interact with interns, senators, and high profile celebrities, and he greets each with the very same warmth, interest, and respect. In my years working with him, Arun has demonstrated time and time again that he is both committed to intersectional feminism and eager to grow as an ally.”","Amanda Terkel contributed reporting."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a85c8991e000046057abd28.jpeg?cache=BcVNPDA1pf&ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"COMEDY","headline":"Tomi Lahren Mocked As Right-Wing Crisis Actor In ‘Daily Show’ Conspiracy Spoof","authors":"Ed Mazza","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tomi-lahren-crisis-actor_us_5a8f7a6fe4b01e9e56ba0012","short_description":"Exposed!","date":"2018-02-23"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"CRIME","headline":"Why Schools Are Flooded With Threats After Mass Shootings","authors":"Carla Herreria","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/schools-threats-mass-shootings_us_5a891db7e4b05c2bcacbc182","short_description":"The arrest of dozens of students since the Florida massacre spotlights a mental health epidemic.","date":"2018-02-23"},"articleContent":["In the days since last week’s mass shooting at Florida’s Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, schools across the country have been receiving an onslaught of copycat threats.","Officials from Maryland to California, and all the way to Hawaii, have locked down campuses, closed entire school districts and arrested dozens of students.","As mass shootings soak deeper into America’s cultural pathology, so has the ritual surrounding them: unspeakable shock and grief, hollow promises from politicians ― and copycat threats.","A wave of threats flooded schools after the 2007 Virginia Tech shooting, and again after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012. Days after the Las Vegas massacre in October, a Nevada high school student threatened to “shoot up” her school.","Kids who make threats ― hoax and real ― after a mass murder reflect an endemic of poor mental health in young people and a lack of resources, according to Robert Myers, a professor and clinical psychologist who works with children and teens in Southern California.","“The kindling is there and the spark will get the fire going,” Myers said.","A day after the Parkland shooting, a South Carolina high school freshman was charged after posting a Snapchat photo of himself holding a rifle (later identified as an airsoft gun) with the caption, “Round 2 of Florida tomorrow.” The student claimed it was a joke.","The picture didn’t just prompt panic at one school. Students in other states used the same image to make threats at their own campuses, prompting arrests there, too.","In Brevard County, Florida, deputies arrested a 14-year-old girl who posted the photo to an Instagram account titled “brevard shooter,” targeting students in Space Coast Junior/Senior High School. She said she thought the post would be “funny.” Charges against her were later dropped.","An 11-year-old girl in Davie, Florida, wrote a threat on a piece of paper and slipped it under the assistant principal’s door. “I will bring a gun to school to kill all of you,” it said.","In Southern California, a school security guard foiled a potential attack after he overheard a high school student speaking of plans to shoot up the school. Police later found a cache of AR-15s, handguns and ammunition at the student’s home. Similar cases played out in Maryland and Pennsylvania, where students were arrested after officers found weapons while investigating threats.","The Imitation Game","Two types of school threats typically surface after a mass shooting, including last week’s in Florida: hoaxes made by students who claim they were joking, and threats made by people who are actually frustrated and upset.","Kids in the first group may “just have very poor judgment” and are looking for attention, according to Myers. He likened it to a common school prank: “Kids always set off fire alarms.”","But students in the second group are likely lashing out because the shooter’s anger mirrors their own frustrations at school or home, according to Myers. News of the violence inspires them to release their own feelings with a threat to do the same thing, he said.","A scientific paper on mass shootings, published less than two weeks before the Parkland shooting, calls these copycat attempts “generalized imitation.” The paper’s authors partially blamed exhaustive media coverage of school shooters for inspiring copycats.","Generalized imitation, the authors wrote, “explains how people can learn to imitate actions they see and hear.” They added: “When a mass killing occurs, there appears to be an increased risk that similar behaviors will occur.”","It could translate to another deadly event.","Studies have found that a mass shooting is likely to occur 13 days to 14 days, on average, after another one. “Essentially, one attack appears to induce another,” the researchers wrote. “There is an imitative or ‘contagion’ effect.”","Myers told HuffPost that the spike in student threats following a mass shooting suggests a dire need for mental health resources in schools.","If a student reacts to a mass shooting with threats, Myers said, it’s likely that the person is facing mental or behavioral issues, including depression, ADHD, autism spectrum disorders or conduct disorders.","It also could indicate that they’re generally distressed due to bullying, problems at home, struggles with schoolwork, or a feeling of being marginalized in some way. Even some kids who suffer from anxiety may respond with threats “as a means of protecting themselves,” said Myers.","Bullying of students already laboring with mental or behavioral issues can cause further distress, making it more likely that a mass shooting will provoke a reaction, Myers said. A troubled student can see a high-profile crime as a way to handle their own problems. If they’re already having violent thoughts, their motivation to act might increase.","“If [the shooting] coincides with their feelings of rejection or bullying, or they’re already angry at the school or angry at [a specific person], they’ll see this event and go, ’Oh, that’s what I’m going to do,” Myers said.","Kids Need Help That Schools Aren’t Offering","This copycat phenomenon sheds light on a larger problem: Students suffering from mental health issues or neurological disorders are not receiving help they need from their schools.","The Association for Children’s Mental Health estimates that one in five children have a “diagnosable emotional, behavioral or mental health disorder,” and one in 10 have a mental health challenge “that is severe enough to impair how they function at home, school or in the community.”","Much of that goes untreated. A 2015 report from the mental health nonprofit Child Mind Institute says 60 percent of kids with depression, 80 percent with anxiety disorder and 40 percent with ADHD aren’t receiving necessary treatment.","“It’s a huge issue,” Amanda Nickerson of the Alberti Center for Bullying Abuse Prevention told The Washington Post. “We do not have enough mental health professionals to meet the increasingly complex needs of the students that are walking through the door.”","The National Association of School Psychologists recommends one school psychologist for every 500 to 700 students, yet the U.S. student-to-psychologist ratio is estimated to be 1,381-to-1. School counselors are similarly overloaded. The American School Counselor Association recommends one counselor for every 250 students, but the current ratio stands at 1-to-491.","Even if a troubled student does receive some help in school, it may not be what they need. Some students may need therapy with an off-campus psychologist or child psychiatrist (who can prescribe medication), but there’s a shortage of those professionals outside of schools, too.","Myers said there are long waiting lists to see child psychologists, and access is even worse if families have Medicaid or rely on county agencies. There’s been a critical shortage of practicing child psychiatrists (and psychiatrists in general) for years.","While President Donald Trump advocates equipping teachers with firearms, teachers are calling for the administration to arm them with a team of mental health professionals.","Along with hiring more school psychologists and strengthening gun laws, Myers suggested mental health courses for students.","The Hawn Foundation, for example, developed the MindUP program ― a 15-lesson curriculum to teach students healthy social, emotional and self-regulation skills. Myers also suggested was Mental Health First Aid, a training program promoted by former President Barack Obama aimed at teaching adults how to identify and respond to children with mental health problems. It’s not unlike regulations that require teachers, coaches and flight attendants to take CPR and first-aid training.","“There are all kinds of stuff we can do to turn the culture around,” Myers said. “And it should start with the kids.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8f9ee41e0000fb077ac93a.png?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"BLACK VOICES","headline":"6 Things You Didn't Know About Michael B.

But when you’re speeding at 40,000 feet in the air, anxious fliers (we get you) might be bothered by this miniature hole. So, for all the nervous (and curious) travelers out there, we’re here to debunk some of these all-consuming fears.","No, the glass isn’t going to start breaking. No, you’re not going to get sucked through the window like some movies have suggested. And yes, every window on the plane shares the same minuscule hole.","The breather hole, or a bleeder hole, as some call it, wears a few hats. To understand how it works, firstly, it’s important to first understand how the window is engineered.","Composed of “acrylic materials,” the window of the plane has three panes. There is an outer pane, middle and inner pane, or the “scratch plane.” The breather hole is drilled into the middle pane. And along with the outer pane, the middle pane is one of the two most important layers of the window, according to Slate.","This video details the three panes:","When the plane takes off, the air pressure in the cabin and outside of the plane drops. In order to be able to breathe, the pressure inside the cabin must be maintained. Therefore, the hole is “used to regulate the amount of pressure that passes between the window’s inner and outer panes.”","According to Travel and Leisure, the breather hole is there to make sure the outer pane “bears” most of the pressure. In the unlikely case something happens, the outer pane would be the one to give out. And so, the passengers aboard the plane would still be able to breathe.","The second of the hole’s uses is to keep the window free of fog, condensation and other things that may impact visibility. By allowing warm air to infiltrate in between the two panes, the breather hole ensures the plane is ready for any type of climate.","Cool, right?","More from AOL.com:","14 World Heritage sites you need to see in your lifetime\nMontenegro is going to be Europe’s hottest new tourist destination ― here’s why\nThe safest countries in the world","This post was originally published on AOL.com."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a904fd52000007d06eafce7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"SPORTS","headline":"Russian Curlers To Return Bronze Medal After Failing Doping Test At Winter Olympics","authors":"Maxim Rodionov, Reuters","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/russian-curlers-to-return-bronze-medal-after-failing-doping-test-at-winter-olympics_us_5a8e18fee4b0161d43184c35","short_description":"The curler tested positive in both of the previous drug tests","date":"2018-02-22"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"COMEDY","headline":"Jimmy Kimmel's Fake Olympics Is Getting Too Painful To Watch","authors":"Lee Moran","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jimmy-kimmel-fake-olympics_us_5a8e8eefe4b0161d4318cbcd","short_description":"\"He'll need to put some ice on that.\"","date":"2018-02-22"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"SPORTS","headline":"Lindsey Vonn Falls Short In Likely Last Olympics Run","authors":"","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lindsey-vonn-olympics_us_5a8e76c0e4b077f5bfeb3ea4","short_description":"Her teammate Mikaela Shiffrin instead took silver in the women's combined.","date":"2018-02-22"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Pennsylvania GOP Pleads With SCOTUS Again To Let Them Use Gerrymandered Map","authors":"Sam Levine","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republicans-pennsylvania-gerrymandering_us_5a8d8885e4b03414379c2155","short_description":"Two days after the state Supreme Court issued a new congressional map that would make elections fairer, Republicans are suing.","date":"2018-02-22"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"GOP Doing All It Can To Keep Pennsylvania's Gerrymandered Congressional Map","authors":"Sam Levine","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pennsylvania-gerrymandering_us_5a8f3094e4b01e9e56b9b243","short_description":"Republicans are pursuing every possible legal avenue to try to keep a congressional map that benefits them.","date":"2018-02-22"},"articleContent":["Pennsylvania Republicans took another stab at blocking a court-ordered congressional map on Thursday by filing a new lawsuit that asks a three-judge federal panel to step in.","The suit comes one day after GOP leaders in the state said they had filed an emergency request asking the U.S. Supreme Court to block the new map. In January, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court struck down the congressional map that had been in place since 2011, saying it gave Republicans such a considerable advantage over Democrats that it violated the state’s constitution.","The state Supreme Court gave lawmakers and the governor three weeks to agree on a map, and then stepped in to draw its own when the two parties failed to do so.","In their appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court and in their Thursday suit, Republicans said the state Supreme Court didn’t give them a meaningful chance to come up with a new map and that its decision to draw its own plan was unlawful. They argued only the U.S. Constitution grants legislatures the ability to draw congressional maps, and said they want the federal court to instruct the state to use the 2011 map for congressional elections this year.","The U.S. Supreme Court rejected that argument earlier this month, when it declined to step in and block the state Supreme Court’s order. Republicans are hoping the courts might be willing to take another look now that the map is in place.","Wanda Murren, a spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania Department of State, said her agency was already working on implementing the court-ordered map and would continue to do so unless otherwise ordered by the courts.","Lawyers representing the 18 voters who got the 2011 map struck down say the officials have no case in federal court because the state Supreme Court struck down the congressional map based solely on Pennsylvania’s constitution. In a statement Wednesday, lawyers for the plaintiffs accused Republicans of taking frivolous legal action and wasting taxpayer money.","The Republicans are suing Robert Torres, the acting secretary of the commonwealth, and Jonathan Marks, the commissioner for the bureau of commissions, elections and legislation. Lawyers for Torres and Marks have said they can run elections smoothly and on schedule with the new congressional map, but Republicans say it will cause chaos. Nominating petitions for congressional races are set to go out on Feb. 27, so the Republicans are asking the court to step in immediately.","“Our concerns stem from the attack on the constitution initiated by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ― not the design of a map,” Pennsylvania Senate Majority Leader Jacob Corman (R), one of the people who filed the suit on Thursday, said in a statement. “What is at stake here is larger than the makeup of the Pennsylvania Congressional delegation.”","“We are unwilling to acquiesce to the court’s attempt to hijack the functions of the legislative and executive branches,” he added.","President Donald Trump also encouraged Republicans to challenge the new congressional map earlier this week.","The map the court drew is considerably more competitive than the 2011 plan the GOP is fighting for. Under that map, Republicans consistently won 13 of the state’s 18 congressional seats ― despite winning around 50 percent of the vote.","Republicans have expressed little interest in getting a new congressional map in place. Senate Majority Leader Joseph Scarnati (R) told the state Supreme Court that he wouldn’t hand over data it had asked for because he believed the court’s decision was unlawful. Republicans also moved to disqualify the vote of a Democratic judge on the court because he expressed opposition to gerrymandering when he was a candidate running for office.","Corman filed the federal suit on Thursday with state Sen.

The proposal, which its authors call “Medicare Extra for All,” would create a new public program, based on Medicare, that would be open to anybody.","The proposal, which Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar of The Associated Press first reported Wednesday evening, also calls for automatically enrolling the uninsured, among others, in this new program ― in the hopes of finally achieving universal coverage.","Some will call this plan a single-payer proposal, because it’s easy to imagine, someday, everybody being part of this new version of Medicare. Some will say it’s not a single-payer proposal, because it envisions a permanent, potentially large role for private insurance ― as a provider of highly regulated plans that would function more or less the way private plans for seniors on Medicare operate today.","But whatever the proposal’s label, it’s plainly a more ambitious ― and more progressive ― health plan than the Democratic Party’s most influential thinkers have embraced in the past. And that’s what makes it noteworthy.","It’s a reflection of how far the party’s internal conversation has shifted in the direction of government-run insurance ― even since the 2016 presidential campaign, when Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) made a pure single-payer system the cornerstone of his Democratic primary run. It’s also a leading indicator of how Democrats plan to approach health care as they start thinking about the 2020 presidential campaign.","The shift is real ― and an outgrowth of changing circumstances in politics and policy. For most of the last few years, and especially in 2017, Democrats were preoccupied with trying to defend the Affordable Care Act from repeal at the hands of the Republicans.","The architects of the 2010 health care law, including President Barack Obama, understood that it didn’t go far enough ― that it didn’t cover enough people and that it didn’t offer sufficiently good coverage to enough people.","They had hoped to revisit and improve the law, but never had the chance. Instead, they’ve ceded power to President Donald Trump and the Republicans, who, unable to wipe Obamacare off the books, have tried to undermine it instead. Amid that environment, many of the program’s problems have lingered ― and some have gotten worse.","But with the threat of full repeal receding, at least for the moment, Democrats are starting to think about what comes next. And increasingly they are thinking about public insurance as a supplement or substitute for private insurance.","Discussions are underway among wonks and scholars, including a group that the Century Foundation and American Prospect magazine convened last month for a day of intense policy discussion in Washington.","Discussions are also taking place in Congress, where some Democrats have proposed opening up Medicaid to more people, others are talking about doing the same for Medicare and a third of the Democratic caucus endorsed the latest proposal from Sanders ― which would actually eliminate private insurance altogether and give everybody a more generous version of Medicare.","Now comes the Center for American Progress, known for reflecting and shaping the Democratic Party’s consensus, with a proposal that would be among the more ambitious ideas out there ― while still less sweeping than what Sanders has in mind.","CAP’s plan envisions a public insurance program that looks vaguely like Medicare but with a more generous benefit structure. (Medicare doesn’t have a limit on out-of-pocket expenses, for example.) The new program would eventually absorb, through some kind of automatic enrollment, all Americans who have no insurance, are in Medicaid or buy private coverage on their own through HealthCare.gov or directly from insurers.","Employers could continue to offer coverage and, because of the plan’s structure, it’s likely most would ― at least for the short- to medium-term future. But employers would have the option to buy coverage from the new Medicare plan and, critically, individual employees could opt into the new plan even if their employers were offering coverage.","In these respects, CAP’s proposal bears more than a small resemblance to some other plans in circulation ― including one that Yale political scientist Jacob Hacker and the Economic Policy Institute first sketched out in 2007, as well as a scheme that writer Jon Walker put forward in the pages of Shadowproof just a year ago.","“There is a broad consensus within the broad progressive debate that health care is a right and that everybody should have health care,” Neera Tanden, president of CAP, told HuffPost. “And we recognize the virtue of a strong public plan available to all the people.”","The center’s plan has other provisions ― including a call to limit payments to the providers and producers of health care ― that would ultimately raise some of the same questions Sanders plan did during the campaign.","Cutting those payments too dramatically can cause major disruptions in the health care industry, but without those dramatic cuts, any plan can quickly become too expensive.","CAP’s idea does not envision everybody with private insurance giving up their current coverage, as Sanders has proposed, but at least some people would end up losing their existing coverage. If the experience with the Affordable Care Act proved anything, that transformation is frequently a traumatic experience ― for the people who go through it and for the political system as well.","The center’s plan is still just a vague framework, which means it leaves lots of unanswered questions ― starting with the exact financing mechanism. And to conservatives, of course, it would be exactly the wrong way to approach health care ― increasing spending, regulation and taxes, rather than decreasing all three.","But this may be a case in which a plan’s details matter less than the signal it sends ― about the future of the Democratic Party and maybe about the health care system as well."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8e548d1e000046057ac749.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"SPORTS","headline":"Fans Had Absolutely Zero Chill About America's Nail-Biting Hockey Win Over Canada","authors":"Lee Moran","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nail-biter-canada-team-usa-hockey-olympics_us_5a8e933ee4b077f5bfeb74a3","short_description":"\"Raise your hand if you're too pumped to go to sleep.\"","date":"2018-02-22"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"U.S. Special Counsel Files New Charges Against Trump Former Campaign Aides","authors":"Sarah N.

The agency was created by Congress in 2002 to assist states in complying with federalelection standards.","The action raises fresh questions over the degree to which Republican President Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans who control Congress are taking steps to protect the security of American elections, and some state officials have accused them of doing too little to address the threat.","U.S. voters in November will go to the polls in midterm elections, which American intelligence officials have warned could be targeted by Russia or others seeking to disrupt the process.","There is intense scrutiny of the security of U.S. election systems after a 2016 presidential race in which Russia interfered, according to American intelligence agencies, to try to help Trump win with presidency. Trump in the past has been publicly skeptical about Russian election meddling.","The reason for passing over Masterson and whether the decision originated with Ryan or the White House remained unclear. Some Republicans over the years have sought to eliminate or reduce the agency, arguing that it represents a federal overreach into the role of states in runningelections.","Masterson originally was picked by former Speaker John Boehner, a Republican and fellow Ohioan, and nominated by former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, before being confirmed unanimously by the U.S. Senate in 2014.","House speakers have discretion to make recommendations for certain federal positions, a Ryan spokeswoman said.

Twenty-one states experienced probing of their systems by Russian hackers during the 2016 election, according to U.S. officials.","Though a small number of networks were compromised, voting machines were not directly affected and there remains no evidence any vote was altered, according to U.S. officials and securityexperts.","“It is pretty remarkable that in this environment, given the importance of this issue, that the speaker would choose this moment to not reappoint the person doing the most work in this area,” said Judd Choate, Colorado’s election director and the immediate past president of the National Association of State Election Directors.","The commission was formed in the aftermath of the 2000 U.S. presidential election won by Republican George W. Bush that came down to disputed paper ballots cast in Florida. Its responsibilities include maintaining voluntary guidelines for voting systems, including cyber security standards, that most states use when purchasing new voting equipment.","Since the 2016 election, almost all 50 states have taken steps to purchase more secure equipment, expand the use of paper ballots, improve cyber training or seek federal assistance, according to groups that track election security.","U.S. intelligence officials have described the targeting of state election systems as part of a wide-ranging effort by Moscow that also included propaganda efforts and hacking to sow discord during the 2016 campaign, boost Trump and disparage his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton.","Special counsel Robert Mueller’s office last Friday indicted 13 Russians and three Russian companies for their alleged involvement in a criminal and espionage conspiracy to tamper with the 2016 election.","Under law, the Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate and House each recommend one commissioner to be nominated by the president to fill the agency’s four spots.

No one was hurt in the incident, but a police investigation was launched and the city reached out to the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force to evaluate security procedures.","“This incident, along with death threats to me and my family, is an unfortunate reminder that we need to take security seriously,” Bhalla said in the statement.","According to the city’s statement, the incident occurred just before 8 p.m. Thursday, when Bhalla was not in the office. A man reportedly passed through the metal detectors at Hoboken’s City Hall and told security officers he was going to the restroom. Later, Bhalla’s deputy chief of staff, Jason Freeman, saw that a “bag with an object” had been thrown at a secretary’s desk. Freeman made eye contact with the man, who then ran out of the mayor’s office. Officials did not disclose what was in the bag.","The mayor’s office has reportedly been working to implement the task force’s recommendations for “physical and procedural changes” to improve security in City Hall.","Hoboken police did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment about the incident.","“We take incidents like these incredibly seriously and will continue working to ensure the security of the mayor and everyone who visits City Hall,” Police Chief Kenneth Ferrante said in the city’s statement.\n\nThe nature of the death threats against Bhalla is unclear.\n\nIn an email, Bhalla told HuffPost that he cannot release further information about the death threats “because there are several active investigations into these matters by law enforcement agencies.”\n\nAs a Sikh American, Bhalla said in November, he had been a victim of religious discrimination in the past, including being bullied while growing up in New Jersey as a teen who wore a turban as a sign of devotion to his faith.

Saccone, who won during the Tea Party wave, still touts his fiscally conservative bona fides.","The ad notes that Lamb, by contrast, has refused to take campaign donations from corporate PACs.","“We’re committed to making sure voters know Lamb’s record of integrity and Saccone’s history of exploiting taxpayers,” said End Citizens United President Tiffany Muller in a statement about the ad.","The TV ad is due to appear on Monday and continue through March 4. The digital ads, which address similar themes, begin Friday and will continue through March 13, the day of the special election.","The ad buy makes End Citizens United the only outside group currently taking to the airwaves on Lamb’s behalf. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spent $224,000 on a television ad supporting Lamb in late January but has since been off the air.","End Citizens United, named for its opposition to a 2010 Supreme Court ruling that got rid of limits on corporate electoral spending, has also leveraged its sizable email list to raise $175,000 for Lamb’s bid. The group said it has 3,700 members in the southwest Pennsylvania district where Lamb is running.","Lamb, 33, needs all the help from outside groups that he can get. Although he has outraised Saccone, a 60-year-old former military intelligence officer and diplomat, GOP-aligned outside groups have poured millions into the race on Saccone’s behalf. As of earlier this month, four conservative groups, including the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC associated with House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), had outspent Democratic outside groups by a 17-to-one margin. They have tried to paint Lamb as a stooge for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), whom conservative voters loathe. Lamb has already said he opposes Pelosi as the party’s House leader.","However, the level of national Republican attention and resources flowing into the district reflect GOP leaders’ anxieties that a solid red district is so competitive.","President Donald Trump, who won the 18th District by nearly 20 percentage points in 2016, is due to campaign for Saccone between now and the election day. The president already plugged Saccone’s candidacy at a January visit to the district ostensibly aimed at promoting GOP tax cut legislation.","In a bid to win over swing voters in the blue-collar district, Lamb has mixed a kitchen table-pitch to protect Social Security and labor unions with more conservative stances on issues like gun control and coal energy. Thus far, Lamb has welcomed House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) and Rep. Joe Kennedy III (D-Mass.) to the district to campaign for him.","Former Vice President Joe Biden is also slated to hold a rally for Lamb in the district before the election.","If Lamb does not win this time around, he will have another shot at a House seat in a more competitive district in November. As a result of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s redrawing of the state’s congressional districts, Lamb now lives in the 17th District, where Rep. Keith Rothfus (R) is running for re-election. Trump won Rothfus’ old district by 21 percentage points, but would have carried the new one by just 3 points, according to The New York Times."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8dd90e2000008806eaf92d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"BLACK VOICES","headline":"Atlanta Airport Teases 'Black Panther' Fans With Flights To Wakanda","authors":"Princess-India Alexander","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/flights-to-wakanda-black-panther_us_5a8dd86ae4b0617d46395e51","short_description":"Our one-way ticket is booked.","date":"2018-02-22"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Missouri Gov.

Missouri law states that invasion of privacy laws include the taking of photos of a person without their consent while they’re in a state of full or partial nudity. Individuals can be charged with a misdemeanor if such images aren’t disseminated, but the charge is classified as a felony if the photos are distributed by any means.","Greiten’s indictment lists his charge as a Class D felony, which is punishable by up to four years in prison. It has a three-year statute of limitations.","“The defendant knowingly photographed [the victim] in a state of full or partial nudity without the knowledge and consent of [the victim] and in a place where a person would have a reasonable expectation of privacy,” the charge reads. “The defendant subsequently transmitted the image contained in the photograph in a manner that allowed access to that image via a computer.”","“As I have stated before, it is essential for residents of the City of St. Louis and our state to have confidence in our leaders,” St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardener said in a statement announcing the charges. “They must know that the Office of the Circuit Attorney will hold public officials accountable in the same manner as any other resident of our city.”","Greitens has so far rebuffed calls that he resign, even though several members of his party have told him to step aside after the blackmail allegations first surfaced.

A break in that trend, even if limited to just 14 states, has prompted cautious optimism among some public health experts.","“It could be welcome news,” said Caleb Alexander, an epidemiologist and co-director of Johns Hopkins University’s Center for Drug Safety and Effectiveness.","“If we’re truly at a plateau or inflection point, it would be the best news all year,” he said. “But we’re still seeing rates of overdose that are leaps and bounds higher than what we were seeing a decade ago and far beyond any other country in the world.”","The reported drop in overdose deaths occurred in Wyoming, Utah, Washington, Alaska, Montana, Mississippi, Kansas, Rhode Island, Oregon, California, Tennessee, Massachusetts, Arizona and Hawaii. That compares with declines in only three states — Nebraska, Washington and Wyoming — reported for an earlier 12-month period that ended in January 2017.","But even as more states saw a drop in deaths, several saw death spikes of more than 30 percent, most likely due to the increasing presence of the deadly synthetic drug fentanyl in the illicit drug supply, drug experts say. Those are Delaware, Florida, New Jersey, Ohio and Pennsylvania, along with the District of Columbia.","Published monthly since August, the new CDC statistics are a compilation of death certificate data from all 50 states for a rolling 12-month period ending seven months prior to release of each report. The seven-month delay is roughly the amount of time it takes for states to complete death investigations and report causes of death, and for the CDC to compile the data.","Previously, the CDC only made death data available once a year and it was 12 to 14 months behind. In a fast-moving opioid scourge, epidemiologists say the increased frequency of overdose death reporting is a welcome improvement.","Farida Ahmad, a public health expert with the CDC, cautioned that the monthly provisional death numbers are subject to change because as many as 2 percent of death certificates for the time period have not been reported. A final death count for 2017 will not be available until November, she said.","Increased Volatility","In Alaska, where deaths declined more than 11 percent between the 12-month period ending July 2016 and the 12-month period ending July 2017, the state’s public health chief, Jay Butler, said the trend has been cause for some optimism.","The greatest portion of that decline was in prescription opioids, drugs such as OxyContin, Percocet and Vicodin, Butler said.","“And we may be seeing a plateauing, if not a decline, in overdose deaths from heroin,” he added. “The bad news is that we’re seeing more deaths from fentanyl.”","Indeed, fentanyl-related deaths spiked more than 70 percent nationwide in the 12-month period ending July 2017, according to the report.","“Using illicit drugs has always been a game of roulette,” Butler said. “There’s just more bullets in the chamber now.","“When the epidemic was driven primarily by prescription opioids, we saw a smoldering and chronically escalating problem,” he said. “Now we’re seeing outbreaks and clusters of death resulting from bad batches of heroin or counterfeit pills laced with fentanyl.”","Still Rising","The recent drop in opioid deaths in some states might be significant, experts say, but they caution it should be seen in the context of the worst drug death epidemic in U.S. history.","In 2016, the annual overdose death count reached nearly 64,000, more than three times as many as in 1999. It surpassed the number of fatalities from automobile crashes and homicides, becoming the No. 1 cause of death among Americans 50 and younger.","Aside from the 14 states seeing declines, there are few signs of relief ahead.","Nationwide, the death toll is still rising, although possibly at a lower rate than in the past two years. According to the CDC’s current provisional report, the total number of overdose deaths increased 14 percent in the 12-month period ending in July 2017, compared to a 21 percent increase in the 12- month period that ended in January 2017.","One reason could be a decline in the availability of prescription painkillers. Even as overdose deaths spiraled over the last five years, the rate of prescribed opioid consumption began to decline.","That could mean lower rates of heroin use, addiction and overdose deaths in the future, Alexander said. A vast majority — 86 percent — of young, urban injection drug users started misusing prescription opioids before turning to heroin, according to surveys by the National Institute on Drug Abuse.","Another likely reason for a tapering in death counts is the widespread use of the overdose antidote naloxone, public health experts say.","“It’s hard to imagine how high the death toll would be without naloxone,” said Michael Kilkenny, the Cabell-Huntington public health director in West Virginia.","“It’s a little too soon to tell,” he said, “but we may be seeing the beginning of a decline in the number of deaths in Huntington,” a small city that has the highest overdose death rate in West Virginia, the state with the highest overdose death rate in the country.","Stateline home page","Sign up for exclusive state policy reporting and research"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8ef4551e000048057ac875.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Trump Invoked In 20 Percent Of Hate Crimes Against South Asians, Middle Easterners, Report Says","authors":"Kimberly Yam","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/saalt-hate-crimes-report_us_5a7390fee4b01ce33eb12ae4","short_description":"Sixty-three percent of the women targeted wore a hijab or head scarves.","date":"2018-02-22"},"articleContent":["In the year since the 2016 presidential election, one in five perpetrators of hate violence in the United States against various South Asian and Middle Eastern communities invoked President Donald Trump’s name, his administration’s policies or his campaign slogan during the attacks, a new report found.","The nonprofit group South Asian Americans Leading Together (SAALT) released the report last week, which detailed increasing instances of hate violence and xenophobic political rhetoric from Election Day 2016 to Election Day 2017. The group documented more than 300 reported incidents targeting South Asian, Muslim, Sikh, Hindu, Middle Eastern and Arab communities during that period.","“It’s heartbreaking.” Suman Raghunathan, executive director of SAALT, told HuffPost. “When you have people literally saying or leveraging the ‘Make America Great Again’ campaign slogan as they are violently assaulting our community members ― that for me draws a direct connection in a way that could not be clearer.”","SAALT documented 213 incidents of hate violence ― a more than 45 percent increase compared to the year leading up to the 2016 presidential election. The levels of violence mirror those seen the year after the 9/11 attacks, with 82 percent of the hate violence and xenophobic political rhetoric now motivated by Islamophobia, the group said.","Women who identify or are perceived as South Asian, Muslim, Sikh, Hindu, Middle Eastern or Arab represented 28 percent of the documented hate violence, the report noted. Sixty-three percent of the women targeted wore a hijab or head scarves.","Alongside the episodes of violence against these communities, SAALT looked at specific incidents of xenophobic political rhetoric, documenting 89 incidents it observed for the year, with 75 percent of those cases conveying anti-Muslim sentiment.","The report found that just over 40 percent of the xenophobic rhetoric came from white supremacist hate groups or individuals. The majority of incidents came from those in positions of political power, with about a third coming from either Trump or members of his administration, and another 22 percent associated with other elected officials and candidates. The remaining instances came from members of the media.","Among the incidents of xenophobic political rhetoric were Trump’s statements following the New York City attack in October that left eight people dead and 12 injured. The alleged perpetrator in the case, Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov, had legally immigrated from Uzbekistan and Trump tweeted that he’d “ordered Homeland Security to step up our already Extreme Vetting Program. Being politically correct is fine, but not for this!”","The president also said he’d end so-called “chain migration,” a term immigration restrictionists use to describe allowing immigrants to sponsor their family members to join them in the U.S. Immigration activists have long rejected the term, using “family reunification” instead.","While the rhetoric is troubling, it’s “really only a crucial and tragic portion of the problem,” Raghunathan said. The policies implemented and proposed under the Trump administration are even more alarming and reflective of this xenophobic sentiment, she said. She pointed to policies including the multiple iterations of the ban on immigration and travel from Muslim-majority countries and the termination of the Temporary Protected Status program for several countries.","″[The Trump administration] really operationalizes the divisive portrayal of all of our communities ― we’re being portrayed as others, as un-American, as terrorists, and as fundamentally out of step with ‘mainstream American culture,’” Raghunathan said.","However, Raghunathan noted that while attacks on South Asian, Muslim and other heavily immigrant communities have intensified under the Trump administration, policies from the Bush and Obama administrations paved the way for many of these policies.","She pointed out that following the 9/11 attacks, the Bush administration implemented a series of policies that targeted the same communities. From the Patriot Act, which expanded the government’s authority to surveil Americans, to the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System (NSEERS), a program for registering non-citizen visa holders, there were already existing policies that disproportionately targeted Arab and Muslim communities.","More than 80,000 men underwent registration under NSEERS and thousands were interrogated and detained. But the program failed to result in a single known terrorism-related conviction, according to a 2012 joint study by the Rights Working Group and the Center for Immigrants’ Rights at Penn State’s Dickinson School of Law.","For its part, the Obama administration championed the Countering Violent Extremism program, which provided grants to communities, religious leaders, law enforcement and other organizations to deter “at-risk” people from joining “violent extremist groups.” Civil liberties groups, including the Brennan Center For Justice, have argued that the program targeted Muslims and painted an entire community as suspects.","“The equation of violent extremism with Muslim communities in the U.S. really deepened and operationalized with the Obama administration,” Raghunathan told HuffPost.","Still, she said tensions in South Asian and other immigrant communities are running particularly high during the Trump administration, especially given its intensification of immigration enforcement.","The SAALT report argued that part of the current problem in addressing hate violence is that federal agencies are not properly addressing the issue or have underreported incidents. Citing a ProPublica report, the SAALT study noted that 120 federal agencies have not complied with mandates to submit hate crime data to the FBI.","“The current administration has shifted its focus away from holding law enforcement agencies accountable for documenting and addressing the hate violence our communities are facing,” the report said.","SAALT said that both communities and officials should take steps to combat hate violence and xenophobic political rhetoric, including by taking action against discriminatory policies like the travel ban, or passing legislation to end racial profiling.","The report also suggested that communities of color should form coalitions and participate in joint organizing, and that cities should implement bystander trainings to help build safe spaces for at-risk populations."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8f1cc81e000017087ac8cf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Chris Evans Shreds Right-Wing 'Pile Of Trash' Who Mocked School Shooting Survivors","authors":"Ed Mazza","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chris-evans-dinesh-dsouza_us_5a8e5b8de4b0161d43187a7c","short_description":"Captain America isn't having it.","date":"2018-02-22"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"QUEER VOICES","headline":"Orlando Foundation Releases Preview Art Of Interim Pulse Memorial","authors":"Curtis M.

The president recommended arming teachers, while one parent suggested that undercover police officers pose as teachers and school staff. Several parents called for more security officers at schools.","There’s scant evidence that more cops and security guards on campus actually stop school shootings. There’s an abundance of evidence suggesting that more school security means more vulnerable students getting funneled at an early age into the criminal justice system.","Black children are already more likely to get arrested at school. In 2012, black children represented only 16 percent of school-aged children, but 31 percent of those arrested.","And when more cops are in school, these arrests are more likely to take place, even for minor misbehaviors. It’s a phenomenon that advocates call the school-to-prison pipeline.","“The more we add security or police forces and so on to schools, the more likely it is the students who are already at risk of being seen as potential trouble makers get swept up into the justice system or suspended and pushed out of schools,” said Aaron Kupchik, a professor at the University of Delaware, who studies this issue. “The risks are even higher for students who are already more vulnerable.”","There have been scattered instances in which school security has helped foil an armed intruder. And some studies have found clear benefits of having cops in schools, as these schools are more likely to have emergency crisis plans in place and receive regular safety inspections. But these benefits come at a steep price ― one that could disproportionately impact black and brown students who are already more likely to face overly harsh discipline.","One study found that schools with police are more likely to refer students to outside law enforcement for a range of behaviors ― including offenses that are more minor, like vandalism. Another study found that schools with cops had more school arrests for minor misbehaviors like disorderly conduct.","And there is also the possibility of police brutality. A HuffPost investigation previously found schools with cops had officers that used Tasers over 80 times on children between 2011 and 2016.","The instinct to increase school security after shootings makes sense University of Florida professor Jason Nance previously told HuffPost. Adding measures of security is a “tangible” action that “school authorities can do to demonstrate to a worried constituency that they are trying to make schools safer.”","“However, so far we don’t have any hard evidence that more police officers in schools make schools safer,” said Nance.","Judith Browne Dianis is the executive director of The Advancement Project, a civil rights group that works to curb the school-to-prison pipeline. She said enhanced security measures at schools can make buildings look more like war zones and prisons than nurturing environments.","“We’re worried this continues to be the knee-jerk reaction that politicians have after a school shooting -– to not deal with the gun violence issue but instead to throw more money at law enforcement giving parents the perception of safety, instead of getting at the root cause of the violence,” Dianis said."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8ee869210000eb0660204b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Cops And Educators Agree: Arming Teachers Is A Terrible Idea","authors":"Rebecca Klein","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/arming-teachers_us_5a8f0d48e4b0664343555886","short_description":"President Trump says more teachers should carry weapons.

Two weeks ago, the city began a two-year pilot project using its own funds to provide free rides on Saturdays.","For seven years, local authorities have been trying to provide unlimited public transport, free at the point of access, for a flat 15-euro monthly tax for all residents, Mayor Boris Palmer explained. To do so would require a change in law.","“We already have a decent system in Tübingen, with 89,000 inhabitants and 20 million rides a year,” explained Palmer, who doesn’t own a car. “One in three people uses public transport regularly; a third sometimes; and we are looking at the third that never uses it.”","“If you ask them, they don’t know how the system works and are not prepared to pay 5 euros when they have a car in the garage and can ‘do it free.’ In attracting these people, the price barrier is very important.”","The aim in Tübingen, he says, is twofold: to lower emissions and reduce travel costs for people on low incomes. A municipal memo reportedly put the cost of zero-fee public transport for all at 14.5 million euros ($18 million).","There is a proposal to test free public transport in four other cities in Germany, which faces EU fines for breaking air pollution laws.","So, could this simple — but costly — measure work for other cities, using free buses, trams and trains to help cut private car use, reduce emissions and make cities less congested and more livable? The question takes on more urgency in Europe, where the European Commission found in November 2017 that 400,000 citizens die prematurely every year due to poor air quality.","Estonia’s capital city, Tallinn, introduced fareless public transport for residents in 2013, although people from outside the city and tourists must still pay. Allan Alaküla, head of the Tallinn EU office and official spokesman for the project, says that five years later, “no one seriously thinks it can be reversed.” There are 140 million trips a year, the vast majority by Tallinn’s 450,000 residents.","Introduced by populist mayor Edgar Savisaar after a referendum, the measure is viable because under the country’s fiscal law, Tallinn gets 1,000 euros of each resident’s income tax each year. And as a result of the transit program, population numbers have increased.","“The lost ticket revenue from residents is 12 million euros ($15 million), and the gain from additional revenues from the increase in the residential population, at the most conservative estimate, is well above 20 million euros ($25 million),” Alaküla explained. “So the city budget has gained, service quality has improved constantly and in the surroundings of Tallinn, the demand for public transport has increased.”","So much so that on July 1, the whole country will roll out free bus travel thanks to central government subsidies making Estonia, Alaküla says, “the first public transport nation.”","But while the city center has benefited from reduced congestion, and people who could not afford public transport before have greater access to jobs, shopping and leisure facilities, says Alaküla, there are downsides.","Alaküla said Tallinn’s free transportation has resulted in a 10 percent decrease in traffic in the city centre. “But at the same time, we have observed a slight increase around the city center,” he said.","Contrary to what you might think, people also walk less. “Particularly in the city center, where the tram stops frequently, some people are taking the tram out of convenience instead of walking,” he said.","Dr. Oded Cats, assistant professor in transport and planning at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, who has studied Tallinn’s project, said it has achieved two goals: to increase the mobility of the unemployed and low-income groups and the city’s total residents.","“However, there is no evidence suggesting there has been a shift from car to public transport usage,” he said. “We do see an increase in public transport usage, though, from people who would otherwise walk, which is not necessarily desirable.”","He is doubtful that free public transport in Germany would do anything to reduce car use or emissions. “We know car users are very sensitive to the price of the car trip, not public transport prices, so increasing parking fees or congestion charges would be more efficient,” he said.","Environmentally speaking, he adds, cities should invest in a mix of transport options and encourage conscious choices: “Walking and cycling are unbeatable, and public transport should take longer distance trips or [transport] groups that cannot walk.”","Norman Garrick, visiting professor in transportation at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, believes that to tempt people onto public transport, it must be time-efficient, convenient and comfortable — not just free. “It’s also to do with how cities are designed,” he said. “If you widen streets to accept cars, that’s what you are going to get. Longer term, you could convert cities to places where you don’t need to get a car.”","The cost is another potential dealbreaker. No details have emerged about how Germany might fund its free city transport.","The city of Hasselt in Belgium had to reintroduce fares after 16 years of free rides because it became impossible to support financially. Cost was also given as the reason for Seattle’s decision to shut down its 40-year-old free downtown bus service in 2012.","But back in Tübingen, the mayor is optimistic. “The public discussion has been intense and 70% of people support [the German government’s idea],” he said. “The debate has created a pressure not to do nothing, and my intention is to be on board and convince them.”","Clarification: After publication, Alaküla contacted HuffPost to say that a quote about “contamination from traffic” as a main issue for changes to public transportation was in error. That part of the quote has been removed and the post updated accordingly.","For more content and to be part of the ‘This New World’ community, join our Facebook Group.","HuffPost’s ‘This New World’ series is funded by Partners for a New Economy and the Kendeda Fund.

The rest is 20-year-old history.","date":"2018-02-22"},"articleContent":["“Traveling, traveling / In the arms of unconsciousness,” Madonna cooed on the Björk-assisted single “Bedtime Story,” released in 1995. Overexposed and castigated after the ruckus surrounding “Erotica” and the carnal coffee-table book Sex, she’d forged a reverie about disconnecting from reality. “Today is the last day that I’m using words / They’ve gone out, lost their meaning.”","But by 1998, Madonna had awoken again. On “Sky Fits Heaven,” the seventh track from the enlightened electro-rock masterpiece “Ray of Light,” she repeated a familiar phrase ― except here it ended on an upbeat: “Traveling, traveling / Watching the signs as I go.” This time, pop music’s doyenne of reinvention was anything but unconscious.","Her footpath from the “Bedtime Story” era to “Ray of Light,” which turns 20 on Feb. 22, places Madonna at the nexus of celebrity culture circa 1997 (when she spent five months writing and recording the album) and early 1998 (when she released and promoted the album, which went on to win three Grammys and six MTV Video Music Awards). Nearing 40 and competing with a fresh generation of A&R-packaged teenyboppers, Madonna had risked aging out of mainstream stardom, one of the many sectors of society that isn’t kind to mature women. Instead, the ambient fizzes and mystical flurries on “Ray of Light” formed a cutting-edge benediction that rehabilitated Madonna’s image ― a coup few legacy acts could hope for today. She was a new mother, animated by Kabbalah and Ashtanga yoga, but uninterested in maternity leave.","Madonna’s late ’90s eminence can be further distilled through one morsel about the creation of “Ray of Light,” her seventh studio disc: On July 15, 1997, the day she recorded the gritty meditation “Swim,” Donatella Versace called Madonna to report that her brother Gianni had been shot outside his Miami mansion.","William Orbit, the English producer who helped shape “Ray of Light,” has related this anecdote at least twice. The first time was in 1998, during an interview with Music Week.","“The day she [recorded ‘Swim’] she got a call on the way to the studio that her next-door neighbor Versace had been murdered,” he said. “Lyrically it was written before that, but it is topical.”","And again in 2002.","“We were recording ‘Swim’ on the day Versace was murdered,” Orbit told Q magazine. “Madonna was very friendly with him and his sister, Donatella, who was in the street, distraught, on her cellphone to Madonna. But she did the vocal, which is probably why it has such an emotional impact.”","Earlier this month, I emailed Orbit to ask for more details. “There’s quite a story around that,” he confirmed, declining an interview in the same breath. Representatives for Madonna and Donatella Versace did not respond to my inquiries.","Madonna was famously chummy with the Calabria-born Versaces, first posing for their fashion line’s ad campaign in 1995 when, as Orbit indicates, she and Gianni both owned townhouses on 64th Street in Manhattan (though they weren’t next door to each other). A month and a half after recording “Swim,” she penned the couturier’s eulogy for Time magazine, recalling, among other lavish details, the days she borrowed his well-staffed Italian villa. “I’ve got a pocketful of memories in my Versace jeans, and they’re not going anywhere,” she wrote.","On the surface, as it relates to “Ray of Light,” Versace’s murder at the hands of spree killer Andrew Cunanan ― also chronicled in the ongoing season of Ryan Murphy’s stirring FX series “American Crime Story” ― is an ill-timed coincidence. Madonna didn’t compose “Swim” in response to Versace’s death, but she had to perform it ― an anthem about the world's \"sins\" ― on the day one of her most famous friends informed her that another of her most famous friends had lost his life. Madonna grieved in the studio, just like you or I must still show up to the office after awakening to bad news.","These events positioned her, however privately, at the center of an international tragedy ― just as she was throughout the AIDS crisis, when, for example, she crafted the “Erotica” balled “In This Life,” dedicated to her longtime chum and collaborator Martin Burgoyne, who’d died from the disease in 1986. Of all people, Donatella thought to call Madonna, a celebrity among celebrities, with the news of her brother’s scandalous death. And what episode of Madonna’s career better fits that narrative than the one dedicated to her spiritual fortification?","“Put your head on my shoulder, baby / Things can’t get any worse / Night is getting colder / Sometimes life feels like it’s a curse,” Madonna croons on “Swim,” which opens with a melancholic serenity and settles into a guttural anger that’s impossible to underestimate even without knowing Madonna’s mood on the day of its recording. “Swim” is one of the few “Ray of Light” tracks that doesn’t offer a glimmer of Zen in its heady rumination, so Madonna instead follows it with the glittering title song, whose lyrics become a salve: “Zephyr in the sky at night I wonder / Do my tears of mourning sink beneath the sun? / ... / She’s got herself a little piece of heaven / Waiting for the time when Earth shall be as one.”","Life will go on, despite the country’s anger at her provocations, despite Versace’s demise, despite the fact that the music industry is stacked against luminaries reaching arbitrary sell-by dates after being crowned American royalty when they were dewy teens or 20-somethings. (To that last point: Madonna had a Top 10 hit as recently as 2012. She was 54! Almost none of her peers can claim that feat at such an age.)","In fact, the entirety of “Ray of Light” feels like a renewal following some kind of death ― a tangible loss of her youth, a fleeting sense that her yearning to get into the groove had faded. (It would soon return, of course, because Madonna is nothing if not an expert in brand management.) That’s why her existential primping ― “Nothing takes the past away / Like the future / Nothing makes the darkness go / Like the light,” she sings on “Nothing Really Matters” ― further acts as a metamorphosis. Her interior life was laid bare, and the results were an extended tone poem.","But here’s something else that strikes me about this album: Even with a track that morphed into a response to a fellow artist’s death, Madonna didn’t find it as personal as the rest of us did. Because its lyrics were more sophisticated than, say, “Holiday” or “Lucky Star,” the fawning reception implied that the dance-floor invitations on which she’d built her career were too fluffy to be taken seriously ― a tired, vapid, persistent appraisal of female-fronted pop.","“But my other albums were personal too,” she told Spin magazine in a 1998 cover story. ”‘Bedtime Stories’ was personal, believe me. ‘Erotica’ was personal. Maybe I’m a better writer now. I hope so. I think on my last few records I’ve been operating from a place of anger and frustration and bitterness and feeling like a victim and being very defensive. I don’t feel that way right now.”","This quote mirrors something Madonna said when I interviewed her about her most recent album, “Rebel Heart,” in 2015: “A lot of people say, ‘Oh, you’ve written so many personal songs on this record,’ but I think that I wrote a lot of personal songs on my last record, [‘MDNA’], but people didn’t pay attention to it.

It’s overwhelming. So here’s some help.","If you’re planning to cut the cable, you’re probably considering making the switch to save money. Streamline has compiled a list that keeps in mind the different savings you can get if you unplug cable.","The list begins with the cheapest and jankiest method. If you’re so inclined, that suggestion simply involves some aluminum foil, cardboard and an extreme willingness to DIY. Perhaps you’ll end up making the best antenna in all the land.","Assuming you’re up for taking some of your savings from dropping cable and reinvesting the money in your new streaming setup, this list also has you covered. Basically, there are plenty of ways to spend your money.","This is part of Streamline, HuffPost’s weekly recommendation service for streaming shows and movies. Every Saturday, Streamline ranks the best shows to watch online, including a specific focus on Netflix.","Subscribe to the newsletter.","1. Get an HDTV antenna to simply capture a few channels.","Quite a few channels still transmit over the air and simply require an HDTV antenna for you to watch them.","If you want, this could be an extremely cheap option, albeit with a very untrustworthy solution. You can technically make your own HDTV antenna with basically just some aluminum foil and cardboard. Your creation probably won’t have the best signal, though.","Professionally made HDTV antennas aren’t too expensive. Wirecutter has a very comprehensive recommendation list. Since signals are different depending on which part of the country you live in, there isn’t an all-around best option. Regardless, it shouldn’t cost much more than about $50.","Beyond just having an antenna, you could also purchase a service like Plex that combines an HDTV antenna with a player that will record shows.","2. Forget about the main channels and subscribe to streaming services.","This is already a very popular option. If you have little to no use for live television, maybe you’re better off just subscribing to services like Netflix, Hulu or Amazon Prime. A streaming service like this will cost roughly $10 a month, but that price can go up.","Soon there will be even more streaming services from major companies, such as Facebook, Disney and Apple. If you want to always have a good movie or show to watch but don’t need live news or sports in your life, going this route makes a lot of sense.","And if you want help with what to watch every week, you can subscribe to the Streamline newsletter. It’s free! Wirecutter hasn’t recommended it yet as the best newsletter about streaming services, but it probably is up there.","3. Some channels let you subscribe a la carte.","This is perhaps the most dubious way to spend your money while cable-cutting. The value proposition of paying a monthly fee to basically just get CBS shows and a few original projects doesn’t seem worthwhile for most people, but maybe you really need your “NCIS.”","Going this route can make sense if you really love a certain channel. HBO is probably worthwhile although *cough* you probably don’t need to pay for that *cough.* The just-announced Fox News streaming service would be a good example of the hardest kind of pass.","Even when subscribing to some of these channels, you don’t actually get everything that airs on the channel. For example, the ESPN streaming service won’t have most of the live sports you’re probably using ESPN for in the first place.","So don’t bank on these options, but if you’re a super-fan of a particular channel, you can consider this as a side option.","4. Multiple companies are now offering live streaming services.","If you still want live television but just hate your cable company, you can subscribe to a digital streaming service.","There are plenty of options for this, including Sling, Hulu Live TV, Playstation Vue and YouTube TV. Although it comes from a more traditional company, DirecTV Now is also getting popular.","Unfortunately, there isn’t a clear consensus yet on which service is the best. Buffering issues can be typical, and many of these services aren’t exactly cheap (although still typically cheaper than cable packages).","You’ll have to shop around to see which service has the most channels that you want and which price works for you. But at least starting and stopping these services tend to be more flexible than having to work with a cable company, so it shouldn’t be too hard to find the right service for you. You also might be able to snag a free trial. Just make sure to remember to cancel if you end up underwhelmed.","5. Manage all your new subscriptions through a dedicated player.","If you’re using a television and end up subscribing to a few services, you’ll probably want some way to organize everything.","You could get a smart TV that comes with an internal organizing player (many television have this nowadays).","Or you could invest in a product like Roku, TiVo, Apple TV or Amazon Fire TV. Wirecutter recommends the Roku Streaming Stick+, which is about $70. With a device like this, you can have a remote and a simple interface on your television to watch shows on your selected services."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8b3a821e00002c007ac2d4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"COMEDY","headline":"Desus & Mero Help Jimmy Fallon Rename Winter Olympic Sports","authors":"Lee Moran","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/desus-mero-jimmy-fallon-olympics-sports_us_5a8d396ce4b0273053a617f6","short_description":"One sport is \"just aggressive janitoring.\"","date":"2018-02-21"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"SPORTS","headline":"Canadian Skier Suffers Possible Broken Pelvis In Olympic Horror Crash","authors":"Jack Tarrant, Reuters","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/christopher-delbosco-ski-cross-injury_us_5a8d7a56e4b00a30a25139c2","short_description":"Christopher Delbosco received lengthy medical treatment on the course, before being taken to hospital.","date":"2018-02-21"},"articleContent":["PYEONGCHANG, South Korea (Reuters) - Canada’s Christopher Delbosco suffered a possible broken pelvis and Terence Tchiknavorian of France was taken to hospital with a suspected fractured shin after a crash-ridden round of the men’s ski cross heats on Wednesday.","An Austrian team official said Christoph Wahrstoetter had suffered a concussion after colliding with Sweden’s Erik Mobaerg in heat six.","Mobaerg was able to walk away from the crash and was seen talking to reporters after the event.

The district attorney’s office said that the company “engaged in a pattern and practice of intentionally falsifying entries in inmate patient health care records.”","The company’s personnel, investigators say, falsely stated that they checked on Thomas, when surveillance video footage contradicts these accounts.

Other inmates nearby his cell said he begged for water in the days before he died.","“During my investigation into Mr. Thomas’ death, I determined that medical staff, employed by Armor Correctional, made multiple false entries in Mr. Thomas’ patient health care record,” Robert G. Stelter, an investigator with the district attorney’s office, wrote in a criminal compliant.","“I compared Criminal Justice Facility video surveillance footage of Mr. Thomas’ cell area with entries in Mr. Thomas’ patient health care records,” Stelter wrote. “That comparison showed Armor Correctional employees either walking by Mr. Thomas’ cell without stopping or never appearing at his cell at all, when at the same time, the employees recorded they medically assessed Mr. Thomas.”","One Armor Correctional Health Services employee even “fabricated blood pressure and pulse readings” that were never performed, Stelter wrote.","Erik J. Heipt, an attorney for the Thomas estate, told HuffPost that it was “beyond rare” for a company to face criminal charges in connection with a jail death. He added it was remarkable that prosecutors were alleging that the company had a corporate practice of falsifying medical records. Heipt is representing the Thomas estate in their lawsuit against Clarke over Thomas’ death.","Three other jail staffers are also facing charges in connection with the inmate’s death.","Armor Correctional Health Services said that they put patient care “first and foremost” and said the charges were isolated to the “alleged failures” of three people.","“This is not a reflection of Armor’s culture or representative of the many care-providers dedicated to providing medical and mental health treatment in the Milwaukee County Jail. At the jail, approximately 37,000 health screenings occur annually which facilitates an additional 90,000 medical, mental health, and dental patient encounters. The company intends to vigorously defend all claims,” Armor said in a statement.","“Although for privacy reasons we cannot comment directly on any current litigation, as we have stated before, any loss of life is tragic. The company and its employees remain committed to our core principles of consistent, compassionate, and quality patient care.”","Thomas’ death was one of several Milwaukee jail deaths that came under scrutiny in 2016 as Clarke raised his profile in the conservative media, spoke at the Republican National Convention and came under consideration for a prominent position in the Trump administration. Thomas’ death was one of more than 800 deaths that a HuffPost investigation into jail deaths captured across the county.","Clarke resigned from his post as Milwaukee County sheriff last year.

As accusations pile up, lawmakers are searching for ways to keep their most vulnerable workers safe.","date":"2018-02-21"},"articleContent":["By Jen Fifield","Near the end of the Colorado legislative session last year, one of Democratic state Rep. Dafna Michaelson Jenet’s interns revealed something she had been holding inside for months: A male lawmaker had been harassing her.","According to the then-18-year-old intern, who did not want to be named out of fear it would harm her job prospects, the male lawmaker’s unwanted comments and glances bothered her so much she stopped going to the Capitol. The experience led her to turn down another position in the Statehouse, and to drop her political science major.","The #MeToo movement has revealed a long-standing culture of harassment in state legislatures. Since October, about two dozen male state lawmakers have resigned, said they will resign, or been forced from their leadership roles after being accused of harassment or assault.","As legislative leaders grapple with how to create a safer environment for everyone, legislative interns remain among the most vulnerable and the least protected under workplace harassment laws.","In most states, unpaid interns — in legislatures or other workplaces — aren’t considered to be employees and therefore aren’t protected against workplace sexual harassment under the federal Civil Rights Act.","Some legislatures have sexual harassment policies that allow nonemployees to file claims to the legislature of sexual harassment against legislative staff and lawmakers, according to a Stateline review of policies from nearly all states. But only a handful of states specifically mention interns, and even when they do, that doesn’t necessarily give them legal standing for filing a civil lawsuit.","“The legislative policy could be used to discipline a legislator maybe, but probably doesn’t do anything for the victim,” said Minna Kotkin, director of the Employment Law Clinic at Brooklyn Law School.","In an effort to protect interns in all workplaces, at least seven states enacted laws between 2013 and 2015 that made all unpaid interns “employees” under the law.","This earlier movement began after a New York City judge in 2013 threw out a case in which an unpaid TV intern said a supervisor had assaulted her. The judge said because the intern wasn’t an employee, she wasn’t covered under the state’s civil rights protections.","State lawmakers at the time said the case revealed a loophole in the law concerning protections for unpaid interns. But the movement to pass this type of legislation has died down in the past couple of years, leaving unpaid interns in most states unable to collect legal damages for workplace harassment.","The lack of protections for young, unpaid female interns worries some advocates for women in politics, such as Erin Hottenstein, founder of Colorado 50-50, a group that tries to get women elected in Colorado. Women are more likely than men to take unpaid internships, according to a recent study by Intern Bridge, a national consulting group, and women also are more likely to be victims of harassment.","These women may be less likely to stay in politics if they experience harassment, Hottenstein said. And while most male lawmakers are well-behaved, she said, the culture needs to change.","“I find it very disconcerting to be encouraging women to run for office knowing that they are going to go into a cesspool where they may not be safe,” she said.","No Clear Protections","While there has been pushback about using unpaid interns, the practice is still common in governments and legislatures.","Whether interns qualify as employees, and therefore have legal protection against workplace harassment, depends on many factors. An intern is more likely to be considered an employee if she is guaranteed pay during the internship, or a job after her internship is over, or performs work normally done by an employee, according to guidance from the U.S. Department of Labor.","An intern who receives academic credit in exchange for her work is less likely to be classified as an employee with the normal workplace protections.","In Kansas, for example, college students who participate in a legislative internship program run through the University of Kansas receive academic credit as well as a $600 stipend for their twice-weekly work in the Capitol.","No interns have come forward with complaints of harassment in 30 years, according to Burdett Loomis, political science professor and internship coordinator at the university. Tom Day, director of legislative administrative services in Kansas, said the same.","Recent news reports, though, revealed that interns there have faced pervasive harassment in the Capitol. And Loomis said he would be naïve to think that interns haven’t been harassed. “It’s a pretty sexist place, and it has been historically and it still is now.”","Loomis said he has always talked to his students about harassment, but this year he is trying to be more vigilant.","“I think I’ll check back with my students in the first week in March,” he said. “I’ll say, ‘Without naming names, tell me how you sense this is all going. If you have specific issues, come and see me.’ ”","He said his program has high enrollment this year, despite allegations in statehouses, because students see the value in the program.","“They are doing real work,” Loomis said. “They are tallying surveys for legislatures. They are researching policy.”","Across the state line in Missouri, the Legislature made changes to try to prevent harassment two years ago. But Democratic state Rep. Courtney Allen Curtis is not happy with the progress. There have been six harassment complaints since then, he said.","In December, he proposed suspending the Legislature’s internship program, which he thought might “reset the culture.”","Interns’ yearning for status, he said, along with the power dynamics in the Legislature, creates an environment ripe for exploitation. While halting the program would decrease opportunities for aspiring politicos in the state, Curtis said it would be better than the alternative.","“If we could prevent other future leaders from being harassed — I felt it was our duty to do that,” he said.","Protecting Interns","Some states, such as New York and Washington, limit interactions between state lawmakers and interns, according to a recent review of legislative intern policies by the National Conference of State Legislatures. New York’s policy does not allow “fraternization.”","Other legislatures are reviewing their internship or page programs in response to ongoing allegations. In Rhode Island, the Senate chief legal counsel is conducting an immediate review of the page program after Republican state Sen. Nicholas Kettle was charged Monday with extorting sex from a teenage legislative page in 2011, according to the Providence Journal.","In Colorado, Robert Duffy, a political science professor at Colorado State University and the college’s legislative internship coordinator, said his students are shuttled to and from the state Capitol, which helps to keep them from attending after-hours events. He also is present in the Capitol when the students are there, which he said may make it less likely that lawmakers will misbehave.","But several lawmakers have been accused of harassment there in recent months. A letter addressed to the legislative council’s executive committee and signed by more than 40 interns and aides said that “aides and interns are often subject to abuses of power, sexual harassment being one.”","The aides and interns requested more security in the Capitol, especially around the offices of the accused lawmakers, and the installation of panic buttons in the Capitol and other legislative buildings.","“Please understand: we cannot work from home, we cannot avoid sitting in on a member’s committee or walking past a member’s office on our floor if that is what we have been asked to do,” they wrote.","Interns there were required to attend an anti-harassment training for the first time this year. The Legislature also hired a human resources director, hoping that a nonpolitical appointee would help women feel more comfortable and prevent retaliation.","Duffy said that while he has always talked to his interns about what appropriate behavior should look like, he has expanded on that discussion this year.","“I’ve told them we have a zero tolerance policy,” he said. “So if there is something going on with one of your colleagues or something that makes you uncomfortable, then bring it to me and we will take care of it.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8d8da61e00000a087ac60b.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"SPORTS","headline":"Lindsey Vonn Wins Bronze In What's Likely Her Last Olympic Downhill Race","authors":"Rebecca Shapiro","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lindsey-vonn-wins-bronze-pyeongchang_us_5a8cca4ee4b0273053a5b5ea","short_description":"\"I have no regrets; I’m really happy,\" she said.","date":"2018-02-21"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"RELIGION","headline":"Photos Of Billy Graham Through The Years Show How He Became 'America's Pastor'","authors":"Carol Kuruvilla","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/photos-of-billy-graham-through-the-years-americas-pastor_us_5a8d8bcfe4b0273053a692f2","short_description":"The famous evangelist died on Wednesday at the age of 99.","date":"2018-02-21"},"articleContent":["Billy Graham, the charismatic evangelist who came to be known as “America’s pastor,” started his life milking cows on his parents’ farm in North Carolina.","After his death at the age of 99 on Wednesday, Christians around the country are remembering the son of a dairy farmer who grew up to become the towering figure in American evangelicalism.","Graham was born on Nov. 7, 1918, to Reformed Presbyterian parents who raised him on their farm near Charlotte, North Carolina. His life changed in the fall of 1934, when he said he was saved during a revival meeting led by an itinerant preacher.","He soon felt that God was calling him to become a preacher. At Bible school, Graham would often close himself up in a tool shed and preach “to oil cans and lawnmowers,” according to his biographer, William C. Martin, who noted he would also preach to animals and trees while on solo canoe trips.","Graham graduated from Wheaton College in Illinois in 1943, where he received a degree in anthropology and met his future wife, Ruth. He tried leading a Baptist congregation in a Chicago suburb for a few years, but soon realized he wanted to reach a much larger audience.","He began preaching on a Chicago radio station and at Christian youth rallies. His life took a turn in 1949, when his electric personality and stage presence drew national media attention during a series of well-attended “Canvas Cathedral” rallies in Los Angeles.","Graham’s career quickly took off after that. His meetings started to attract hundreds of thousands of people. He served as an adviser to U.S. presidents and began preaching to audiences in more than 185 countries.","But his career also drew a fair share of controversy. Graham was not a vocal and active supporter of the civil rights movement. And he condemned queer relationships throughout his life.","He also held conservative views about women. His name is tied to the “Billy Graham” rule. These were loose guidelines he reportedly gave pastors working in his ministries instructing men not to travel, meet or eat alone with women other than their wives, under the presumption that simply being alone with women in this way would lead to sexual temptation.","Graham was also sharply criticized in 2002, after the release of a 1972 audiotape conversation he had with President Richard Nixon, in which he shared anti-Semitic views about Jews. He later issued a written apology.","To both his critics and admirers, Graham’s six decades as one of America’s best-known evangelists left an indelible mark on American society as a whole. For Christians, and particularly evangelical Christians, Graham’s death is an occasion to remember how his fiery preaching and religious convictions helped spark a spiritual revival in the hearts of thousands.","Scroll through the photos below to see glimpses of Graham’s career as an evangelist.","CORRECTION: A wire photo caption in a previous version of this story misstated a London venue in which Graham was preaching in 1955.

He and prosecutors have struggled to agree on bail terms to permit him to leave his home, though some of those details have remained under seal.","However, on Friday, Mueller’s office revealed that it is concerned about alleged bank fraud in connection with one of the properties that Manafort pledged as collateral.","In Friday’s filing, prosecutors claimed that Manafort secured his mortgage from the Chicago-based Federal Savings Bank by doctoring profit and loss statements from his lobbying firm and “overstating its income by millions of dollars.”","Prosecutors said they plan to offer the court more evidence about the alleged misconduct at the next bail hearing.","The Federal Savings Bank is led by Stephen Calk, who served on a Trump campaign economic advisory panel.

He would reverse the war policies of George W. Bush, deescalate the unbridled Global War on Terror, and right the ship of state. How’d that turn out?","In retrospect, though couched in a far more sophisticated and peaceable rhetoric than Bush’s, his moves would prove largely cosmetic when it came to this country’s forever wars: a significant reduction in the use of conventional ground troops, but more drones, more commandos, and yet more acts of ill-advised regime change. Don’t get me wrong: as a veteran of two of Washington’s wars, I was glad when “no-drama” Obama decreased the number of boots on the ground in the Middle East. It’s now obvious, however, that he left the basic infrastructure of eternal war firmly in place.","Enter The Donald.","For all his half-baked tweets, insults, and boasts, as well as his refusal to read anything of substance on issues of war and peace, some of candidate Trump’s foreign policy ideas seemed far saner than those of just about any other politician around or the previous two presidents. I mean, the Iraq War was dumb, and maybe it wasn’t the craziest idea for America’s allies to start thinking about defending themselves, and maybe Washington ought to put some time and diplomatic effort into avoiding a possibly catastrophic clash or set of clashes with Vladimir Putin’s Russia.","Unfortunately, the White House version of all this proved oh-so-familiar. President Trump’s decision, for instance, to double down on a losing bet in Afghanistan in spite of his “instincts” (and on similar bets in Somalia, Syria, and elsewhere) and his recently published National Defense Strategy (NDS) leave little doubt that he’s surrendered to Secretary of Defense James Mattis and National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster, the mainstream interventionists in his administration.","In truth, no one should be surprised. A hyper-interventionist, highly militarized foreign policy has defined Washington since at least the days of President Harry Truman ― the first in a long line of hawks to take the White House. In this context, an ever-expanding national security state has always put special effort into meeting the imagined needs (or rather desires) of its various component parts. The result: bloated budgets for which exaggerated threats, if not actual war, remain a necessity.","Without the threat of communism in the previous century and terrorism (as well as once again ascendant great powers) in this one, such bloated budgets would be hard to explain. And then, how would the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines get all the weaponized toys they desired? How would Congressional representatives in a post-industrial economy get all those attractive “defense” jobs for their districts and how would the weapons makers get the government cash they crave?","The 2-2-1 Threat Picture","With that in mind, let’s take a look at the newly released National Defense Strategy document. It offers a striking sense of how, magically enough, the Pentagon’s vision of future global policy manages to provide something for each of its services and their corporate backers.","Start with this: the NDS is to government documents what “A Nightmare on Elm Street” is to family films; it’s meant, that is, to scare the hell out of the casual reader. It makes the claim, for instance, that the global “security environment” has become “more complex and volatile than any we have experienced in recent memory.” In other words, be afraid, very afraid. But is it true? Is the world really more volatile now than it was when two nuclear superpowers with enough missiles to destroy the planet several times over faced off in a not-so-Cold War?","Admittedly, the NDS does list and elaborate some awesome threats ― and I think I know just where that list came from, too. When I went through the document, I realized that I had heard it all before. Back in 2015, when I taught history at West Point, a prominent departmental alumni ― a lieutenant general by the name of H.R. McMaster who, today, just happens to be President Trump’s national security advisor ― used to drop by occasionally. Back then, he commanded the Army Capabilities Integration Center, which was basically a future-planning outfit that, in its own words, “develops concepts, learns, and integrates capabilities to improve our Army.”","In 2015, McMaster gave us history instructors a memorable, impromptu sermon about the threats we’d face when we returned to the regular Army. He referred, if memory serves, to what he labeled the two big threats, two medium threats, and one persistent threat that will continue to haunt our all-American world. In translation: that’s China and Russia, Iran and North Korea, and last but not necessarily least Islamist terrorism. And honestly, if that isn’t a lineup that could get you anything you ever dreamed of in the way of weapons systems and the like, what is?","So can we be surprised that, in the age of McMaster and Mattis, the new NDS just happens to lay out the very same lineup of perils?","The Two Bigs: “Revisionist Powers”","The document kicks off with a pivot of sorts: forget (but not forever!) the ongoing war on terror. The U.S. military is on to even more fearsome things. “Inter-state strategic competition [which, in Pentagonese, means China and Russia], not terrorism, is now the primary concern in U.S. national security,” the document insists. Those two countries are ― the Pentagon’s most recent phrase of eternal damnation ― “revisionist powers” that “want to shape a world consistent with their authoritarian model.” In other words, they have the staggering audacity to actually want to assert global influence (the very definition of evil in any power other than you-know-who).","This section of the NDS reads like a piece of grim nostalgia, a plunge back into the pugnacious language of the long-gone Cold War. It’s meant to be scary reading. It’s not that Russian irredentism or Chinese bellicosity in the South China Sea aren’t matters for concern ― they are ― but do they really add up to a new Cold War?","Let’s begin, as the document does, with China, an East Asian menace “pursuing” that most terrifying of all goals, “military modernization” (as, of course, are we), and seeking as well “Indo-Pacific Regional hegemony” (as, of course, has... well, you know which other country).","The National Defense Straregy isn’t, however, keen on nuance. It prefers to style China unambiguously as a 10-foot-tall military behemoth. After all, countering a resurgent China in the Taiwan Straits and the South China Sea ensures a prominent role for the Navy and its own air force of carrier-based naval aviators. In fact, the military’s latest “AirSea Battle” doctrine hinges on a potential conflict in a place that bears a suspicious similarity to the Taiwan Straits (and thanks to the catchy name, the Air Force gets in on the action as well). Consider all of this a formula for more blue-water ships, more advanced fighter planes, and maybe even some extra amphibious Marine Corps brigades.","But what about the poor Army? Well, that’s where that other revisionist power, Russia, comes in. After all, Putin’s government is now seeking to “shatter” the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. No point, naturally, in reminding anyone that Washington was the country that expanded what was, by definition, an anti-Russian military alliance right up to Russia’s borders, despite promises made as the Soviet Union was collapsing. But this is no time to split hairs, so bottom line: the Russian threat ensures that the Army must send more combat troops to Europe. It may even have to dust off all those old Abrams tanks in order to “deter” Vladimir Putin’s Russia. Ka-ching! (Consider this, by the way, a form of collusion with Russia that Robert Mueller isn’t investigating.)","If you look at the Pentagon’s 11 “defense objectives” included in the National Defense Strategy document, you get a sense of just how expansive the one great non-revisionist power on the planet actually is. Yes, the first of those sounds reasonable enough: “defending the homeland from attack.” Skip down to number five, though ― “Maintaining favorable regional balances of power in the Indo-Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, and the Western Hemisphere” ― and you’re offered a vision of what an expansionist attitude really is. Although the NDS claims this country is threatened by the rise of Russia or China in just two of these areas (the Indo-Pacific and Europe), it asserts the need for favorable “balances of power” just about everywhere!","By definition, that’s an urge for hegemony, not defense! Imagine if China or Russia staked out such claims. An unbiased look at that set of objectives should make anyone (other than a general or an admiral) wonder which is really the “rogue regime” on this planet.","The Two Mediums: “Rogue States”","Now, on to the next group of threats, Uncle Sam’s favorite bad boys, North Korea and Iran. North Korea, we’re told, is a land of “outlaw actions” and “reckless rhetoric” (never to be compared to the statesmanlike “fire and fury” comments of President Donald Trump). And indeed, Kim Jong-Un’s brutal regime and the nuclear weapons program that goes with it are cause for concern ― but they also turn out to be deeply useful if you want to provide plenty of incentive for the funding of the Air Force’s and the Navy’s trillion dollar nuclear “modernization” effort (that already looks like it may actually cost more like $1.7 trillion). In other words, more nuclear subs, heavy bombers, and intercontinental ballistic missiles, not to speak of the immense cost of recent investments in such missile defense systems as Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) and Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD).","In this way, “rogue states” couldn’t be more helpful. Take Iran, which, according to the NDS, “remains the most significant challenge to Middle East stability.” Hmmm. It’s hard not to wonder why ISIS, Bashar al-Assad’s rump Syria, Saudi terror bombing in Yemen, even old-fashioned al-Qaeda (and its new-fashioned affiliates) don’t give Iran at least a run for its money when it comes to being the clearest-and-presentest danger to the region and to the United States. (And that’s assuming that, in the Middle East, the U.S. hasn’t been the greatest danger to itself. Exhibition one being the decision to invade Iraq in 2003.)","No matter. Anti-Iranian hysteria sells fabulously in Washington, so who wouldn’t want to run with it? In fact, the alleged Iranian threat to us is the gift that just keeps giving inside the Beltway. Iran’s nuclear threat ― though there’s no evidence that the Iranians have cheated on the nuclear deal President Obama signed with them in 2015 and that President Trump is so eager to abrogate ― guarantees yet another windfall for all the services. The Army’s air defense programs, for example, should get a long-needed shot in the arm; the Navy will clamor for more Aegis cruisers (with anti-ballistic systems on board); and the Air Force will certainly need yet more bombers for the potential preemptive strike against the nuclear threat that isn’t there. Everyone wins (except perhaps the Iranian people)!","One “Persistent Condition”: Terrorism","And then, of course, there’s terrorism or, to be more exact, Islamist terrorism, that surefire funder of the twenty-first century. It may no longer officially be the military’s top priority, but the National Defense Strategy assures us that it “remains a persistent condition” as long as terrorists “continue to murder the innocent.” The proper question, though, is: How big of a threat is it? As it turns out, not very big, not for Americans anyway. Any of us are so much more likely to choke to death or die in a bicycle or car accident than lose our lives at the hands of a foreign-born terrorist.","And here’s another relevant question: Is the U.S. military actually the correct tool with which to combat persistent terrorism? The answer, it seems, is no. Though U.S. Special Operations forces deployed to 75 percent of the world’s countries in 2017, the number of Islamist threat groups has only risen in certain areas like Africa thickest with those special operators. It turns out that all the advising and assisting, all the training and coaching, has only made matters worse. As for those overstretched forces, relentless deployments are evidently breaking them down as reports indicate that rates of mental distress and suicide are again on the rise among them.","Still, here’s the positive part of the NDS’s continuing emphasis on “degrading” terrorist groups and “countering extremism”: it ensures a financial and manpower bonanza for U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM). In the Obama years, that “elite” set of forces already experienced a leap in numbers to almost 70,000. (By the way, at what point in the escalation game do such troops stop being so “special”?) Since SOCOM, a joint command that’s home to personnel from all the services, hadn’t yet been dealt into this NDS version of largesse, it’s lucky that terrorism and the war on it isn’t going anywhere anytime soon, which means that SOCOM will never want for funds or stop growing.","Guns Versus Butter","In 1953, Republican President Dwight Eisenhower, a West Point graduate and retired five-star general, gave a speech that couldn’t have been more unexpected from a career military man. He reminded Americans that defense and social spending were always in conflict and that the “guns” versus “butter” tradeoff couldn’t be a more perilous one. Speaking of the growth of the defense budget in that tense Cold War moment, he asserted that:","“Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed... This is not a way of life at all, in any true sense. Under the cloud of threatening war, it is humanity hanging from a cross of iron.”","Those words still seem salient today. As Americans experience acute income inequality, the rising cost of a college education, and ongoing deindustrialization in the heartland, the country’s runaway spending continues to rise precipitously. The planned 2019 Pentagon budget is now expected to hit a staggering $716 billion ― more than much of the rest of the world’s defense spending combined.","The battle between “guns and butter” is still raging in the United States and, if the new NDS is any indicator, the guns are winning.","Major Danny Sjursen, a TomDispatch regular, is a U.S. Army officer and former history instructor at West Point.

It was arranged two weeks before Pence’s five-day trip across Asia after the CIA was informed the North Korean’s hoped to meet with the vice president, according to the Post.","However, North Korea decided to cancel the clandestine meeting just hours before it was set to take place at the South Korean president’s residence in Seoul. The country reportedly withdrew after Pence used his visit to repeatedly condemn North Korea, including through his meetings with defectors from the country, a visit to a memorial honoring South Koreans killed in 2010 and his hosting of Fred Warmbier at the Opening Ceremony, the father of the American student imprisoned for 17 months by the regime, who died last year soon after his return to the U.S.","Pence’s office defended his actions in a statement Tuesday and questioned the motives of the North Koreans, accusing the country of trying to “whitewash their murderous regime.”","“North Korea dangled a meeting in hopes of the Vice President softening his message, which would have ceded the world stage for their propaganda during the Olympics,” Nick Ayers, the vice president’s chief of staff, said in a statement obtained by HuffPost. “As we’ve said from day one about the trip: this administration will stand in the way of Kim’s desire to whitewash their murderous regime with nice photo ops at the Olympics. Perhaps that’s why they walked away from a meeting or perhaps they were never sincere about sitting down.”","Ayers noted that Trump agreed to the meeting but only to reiterate that the U.S. would be uncompromising in its calls for North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons programs, saying the president “made clear that until they agreed to complete denuclearization we weren’t going to change any of our positions or negotiate.”","Tuesday’s report follows a days-long campaign of icy disinterest between Pence and the North Koreans.

Everyone has a physical education class, called “phy-ed” here, at least twice a week. On top of that, there’s a daily lunch break that comes with time for kids to get outside and move around. Students can also choose from two additional exercise-focused electives — dance and personal fitness — which for some students can mean a 40-minute exercise period every day.","And the action doesn’t stop there. Teachers like Lisa Sackman in the sixth-grade wing offer “brain breaks” every 20 minutes. Teacher Travis Olsen has an exercise bike in the back of his seventh-grade science classroom that kids are welcome to use whenever they feel the need. And eighth-grade co-teachers Abby Jolma and Toni Giebel let kids sit on wobbly chairs — short stools with a curved base — yoga balls, or traditional chairs while they learn math and science.","“They need it,” Giebel says of the bouncing and fidgeting she now observes constantly during classes. “They need it so bad.”","Giebel said it’s clear to her that students concentrate better than they did three years ago when there were far fewer options for physical activity at school. But the kids themselves “don’t notice it,” she added. Indeed, students are mostly unimpressed with how much movement they get in their day.","During a group science lab in Giebel and Jolma’s class, Anna Wang, 13, sat on one of the wobbly chairs the school purchased for classrooms this year. “It was the only option,” Anna, 13, said with a shrug as she rocked back and forth on the chair, adding that she didn’t think the seating made any difference.","Despite her stated disinterest, the level of physical activity Anna and her classmates experience during their school day is unusual and probably beneficial. In the U.S., where 31 percent of children between the ages of 10 and 17 are obese, most school children move far too little, experts say. Thirty years of focus on increasing academic minutes in the school day has resulted in reduced recess and physical education time at many schools. The lack of physical activity is taking a toll on student fitness and that’s bad for growing brains, research shows.","But now a growing number of politicians and educators, like those in Appleton, have begun to heed the research and decided that to improve academic performance, they must do something about their students’ physical fitness as well.","As a result of this new attitude, at least 14 state legislatures considered new laws in 2016 that would increase the amount of physical education or recess schools are required to offer or raise the bar for qualifications for physical education teachers, according to a 2016 report by the Society for Health and Physical Educators (SHAPE). Some even took action. Florida and Rhode Island now mandate 20 minutes of recess time a day for elementary school students.","The new federal education law, the Every Student Succeeds Act, or ESSA, also provides increased access to funding for physical education by including the subject in its definition of a “well-rounded education.”","“At least we’re at the table now,” said Carly Wright, advocacy director for SHAPE. “It sends a message: The federal government does believe [physical education] should be part of a student’s education; it should be part of the school day.”","Charles Hillman, a kinesiology professor at Northeastern University in Boston who studies the connection between the body and the brain, says there’s strong evidence that supports making physical education and recess a priority in schools.","“The goal is to get kids moving throughout the school day,” Hillman said. While he grants that academic class time is also important, “clearly the academic at this point is at the cost of being physically active, and I think there has to be some level of accommodation.”","Hillman also cautions that physical activity alone has not been shown to increase cognitive performance. A slow walk for example, does little to make anyone smarter. What is definitely tied to brain health, Hillman said, is physical fitness.","“Effects are actually found in the brain,” Hillman said. “We find higher fit kids have differential brain function than lower fit kids.”","The prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus of physically fit children are better developed than those of less fit children, Hillman said. These two brain structures control many of the abilities that lead to high academic achievement: long-term memory, self-regulation and goal making, among other key functions.","Hillman, who is advising the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on the latest exercise research for the 2018 revision of the department’s recommendations for physical fitness, said that evidence of a connection between fitness and brain function has mounted steadily over the years.","A 2009 Stanford University study found that fifth, seventh and ninth grade students in California who passed the state physical fitness test and those whose fitness improved between fifth and seventh grade scored better than their less fit peers on the state’s standardized tests. A 2013 study of nearly 12,000 Nebraska students also found that aerobically fit students were more likely to pass the state’s standardized math and reading tests, regardless of their weight or socioeconomic status. Another 2013 study that randomly assigned 8- and 9-year-old Illinois children to a nine-month after-school fitness program found that the kids whose fitness improved also got better at paying attention and ignoring distractions. They also improved to young-adult levels in their ability to regulate their behavior.","School districts that have added more physical activity to their daily schedules in the hope of improving academic performance have also seen measurable changes. When a Ft. Worth, Texas school made a much-publicized switch for its kindergarten and first-grade students from one 20-minute recess a day to four 15-minute recesses — or an hour, total —it found that students were more focused in class and that teachers were able to move through curricular material faster. Off-task behaviors in class decreased by 25 to 35 percent and students’ body mass indexes (weight divided by height) stabilized or decreased, said Deborah Rhea, a professor at Texas Christian University and the lead researcher on the longer-recess initiative.","“We’re at least getting closer to a healthy environment that’s conducive to learning for teachers and for kids,” Rhea said of the multiple 15-minute breaks.","All of this research comes after nearly three decades of school policies that decreased recess time amidst fears that the unstructured time led to student fights or took time away from students’ focus on passing standardized tests. One 2007 survey by George Washington University found that 20 percent of a representative sample of districts had decreased recess time by an average of 50 minutes a week and 9 percent had reduced physical education time by an average of 40 minutes.","Today, middle and high schools are still the least likely to have daily physical education or recess. Forty-one states require physical education at the middle school level, according to the 2016 annual report by SHAPE, and 46 require it in high school. But only 15 states include a specific amount of time middle school kids must spend in physical education per week; only six states have a similar time requirement at the high school level. Most states don’t require middle or high schools to offer recess at all.","The idea that young children need to move a lot is fairly intuitive to anyone who has ever spent time in the company of a child under age eight. But older children need movement too — at least an hour a day according to federal guidelines — and they are getting a lot less of it. Fewer than one in three high school students — 27 percent in 2015 — are getting the recommended number of minutes of daily exercise, according to data from Child Trends, a nonprofit research organization focused on youth issues. Girls, black students and Hispanic students get less exercise than white boys.","Moreover, budgets for physical education equipment and supplies are tiny; the median is just $764 per year per school, according to SHAPE’s 2016 report.","Many blame the federal education law known as No Child Left Behind (NCLB), which was enacted under former President George W. Bush, for the dearth of physical education funds and focus. “There was no phys ed in NCLB,” Wright said. “Teachers were cut, budgets were cut, some states repealed state polices on phys ed. There were definitely some pretty serious unintended consequences.”","Several factors seem to be leading educators and policymakers to begin addressing those consequences: the current backlash against standardized testing, the ever-improving understanding of brain science and the influence of national campaigns like former First Lady Michelle Obama’s Let’s Move! and SHAPE’s efforts to influence national legislation, such as ESSA.","In Wisconsin, for example, the state education department oversees a program called Core 4+, which features inexpensive interventions to increase movement throughout the school day. The program is now in place at 450 schools serving over 300,000 students. Appleton, which has seen several of its schools receive national recognition for their efforts in this area, is one of the cities participating in Core 4+, better known by school leaders here as “active kids, active classrooms.”","The idea of adding so many minutes of movement to the day, especially during class, was initially met with some resistance, said Mikki Duran, who oversees Appleton’s physical education department. Teachers told her they didn’t have time. Duran’s answer was that taking time to move would actually result in more focused time to learn. Once they tried it, she said, most teachers became quick converts.","Today, every school in Appleton has its own program, each aimed at increasing physical activity and fitness. At Horizons Elementary, at least 40 of the school’s 350 kids start every day in the school gym playing a game like “Castle” — a kind of dodge ball, capture-the-flag mash-up. The gym stays open all day for teachers or aides wanting to bring kids down to run a lap and burn off some excess energy. There’s also a running club, and the teachers themselves often start staff meetings with a few laps around the school track.","The physical education teacher here, Carrie Michiels, has also introduced “Fit in 15” breaks for classroom teachers for the days their students aren’t scheduled to take a full physical education class.","“Kids are more alert, more involved” after the breaks, said fifth grade teacher Gina Dresang, a 23-year veteran. “It can be tricky. Once they get up, they can get silly and it takes time to get them back on task, but the benefits outweigh the downsides.”","For several educators in Appleton, the pursuit of better fitness has also become personal. After learning more about the effects of physical fitness on the brain a few years ago, Kaleidoscope principal Al Brant decided he needed to make a change. Heavy-set all his life, he opted for gastric bypass surgery, improved his diet and started exercising. He lost 120 pounds and spent part of last summer on a trip with his daughter to climb 19,300 feet to the top of Mt. Kilimanjaro. The photos of his trek decorate his office walls along with pictures of his bow-hunting expeditions.","“It changed my attitude about promoting phy-ed,” Brant said of his experience.","Now, he wants his students to know about personal fitness long before they become overweight adults. He has prioritized movement at his school, offering strong support to the physical education teachers here. Staff meetings are now regularly interrupted as teachers get up and move for a few seconds or minutes, just like the “brain breaks” offered in most classrooms. Brant has also fully bought-in to the idea of movement during class. Last spring, he authorized the $9,072 purchase of 144 wobbly chairs — the ones the kids appear to love even as they insist they don’t.","The change in students’ ability to focus, especially in the kids who struggle with attention deficit disorder, has been noticeable, he said. He advises other principals thinking of making a shift at their schools to find a few adult champions who can help explain the brain science and offer practical advice to other teachers on how to make movement a bigger part of the day. He also says it’s worth having physical education options with clear curricula and learning standards. The more kids understand about what they can do to be fit now, the more likely they’ll be able to stay fit as adults.","Indeed, said Wright, the national advocate from SHAPE, the biggest pay-off of more physical education and recess for America’s schoolchildren would be fitter adults.","“Students who are physically active and healthy have higher test scores, lower rates of discipline referrals and increased focus in the classroom,” she said. And while that’s important, Wright also emphasized the health and wellness value of high quality physical education: It teaches kids “how to be physically active for a lifetime.”","This story was produced by The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education.

But we cannot protect our guns before we protect our children.”","“Many students throughout the country can’t wait to go vote, can’t wait to run for office, to make a change, to make a safer world,” Florence said. “You adults have failed us by not creating a safe place for your children to go to school. So we ― the next generation ― will not fail our own kids.”","Inside the Capitol, other survivors from last week’s Parkland shooting held a press conference after meeting with lawmakers. Lorenzo Prado, a junior at the high school, described the harrowing experience of being mistaken for the gunman on the day of the shooting.","“I am here to demand change from our government because the lives lost, who shall not be lost in vain, shall then be used as a catalyst for change in our country today,” Prado said.","“We’ll make change in our country, and if not today, tomorrow. And if not tomorrow, the day after that and the day after that until we achieve the change that we want in this country — until the day that safety is preserved in all schools in our beloved country of America,” he continued. “We students will keep fighting for our right to live.”","Meanwhile, hundreds of students at schools in Florida’s Broward and Miami-Dade counties organized walkouts Wednesday in solidarity with the Parkland survivors.","Gov.

As it moved away from its chilly birth mom and into the Weddell Sea, a vast expanse of water saw the light for the first time in up to 120,000 years.","And this month, a team of scientists will venture to the long-ice-buried expanse to investigate the mysterious ecosystem that was hidden beneath the Antarctic ice shelf for so long.","The newly exposed seabed stretches across an area of about 2,246 square miles (5,818 square kilometers), according to the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), which is leading the expedition. The scientists consider their journey “urgent,” as they hope to document the system before sunlight begins to change at least the surface layers. [In Photos: Antarctica’s Larsen C Ice Shelf Through Time]","“The calving of [iceberg] A-68 [from the Larsen C Ice Shelf] provides us with a unique opportunity to study marine life as it responds to a dramatic environmental change. It’s important we get there quickly before the undersea environment changes as sunlight enters the water and new species begin to colonize,” Katrin Linse, of the British Antarctic Survey, said in a statement.","What lies beneath?","Scientists know little about the possibly alien-like life that has taken up residence beneath Antarctica’s ice shelf. What they do know comes from similar calving events in the past: Chunks of ice broke off the Larsen A and B shelves (located north of Larsen C on the Antarctic Peninsula) in 1995 and 2002, respectively. Two German expeditions to those “newly” exposed areas revealed sparse life. However, it took five to 12 years for the expeditions to make it to those areas, and by that time creatures from other areas had made their way to both spots, Live Science previously reported.","In other icy realms around Antarctica, some bizarre creatures have turned up. For instance, a bristled marine worm that lives in the Southern Ocean, and Live Science previously reported as looking like a “Christmas ornament from hell,” has an extendable throat tipped with pointy teeth. And some creatures have made a living under extreme conditions, including a crustacean called Lyssianasid amphipod, which was found thriving beneath the Ross Ice Shelf in western Antarctica. One of the more famous Antarctic animals, the icefish has natural antifreeze in its blood and body fluids, allowing it to survive the frigid temperatures of Earth’s chilly bottom.","To explore the once-hidden ecosystem, the scientists — hailing from nine research institutes — will set off from the Falkland Islands on Feb. 21. They plan to spend three weeks aboard the BAS research ship, the RRS James Clark Ross. To navigate the ice-filled water to the remote location, the ship will rely on satellite data, according to the BAS.","Once they arrive, the team plans to collect samples of life (seafloor animals, microbes, plankton and any other inhabitants) as well as sediments and water.","Stay tuned.","Originally published on Live Science.","Editor’s Recommendations","Gallery: Finding Life in a Buried Antarctic Lake\nExtreme Antarctica: Amazing Photos of Lake Ellsworth\nImages: Strange Life at Antarctic Seafloor","Copyright 2016 LiveScience, a Purch company.

It also reignited fierce debates on gun control across the country.","Lawmakers, often split along party lines, have debated whether strengthening restrictions on guns would curb America’s all-too-common mass shootings, or whether it would be more effective to increase the number of guns in schools and other soft targets. At the federal level, President Donald Trump announced on Tuesday that he’d ordered Attorney General Jeff Sessions to take steps to ban bump stocks, a device that allows a semiautomatic rifle to fire as quickly as a machine gun.","Here’s what some states have done, and not done, in the wake of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.","Florida","State lawmakers on Tuesday refused to debate a gun control measure that would have banned any “selective-fire firearm capable of fully automatic, semiautomatic or burst fire,” including the AR-15 rifle, the type used in the Parkland shooting. State Rep. Kionne McGhee (D) pushed to bring the bill out of committee and to the floor, but the proposal was rejected in a 36-71 procedural vote. A Florida Senate committee, however, endorsed a proposal to put law enforcement officers in every school in the state.","Hawaii","Lawmakers in Hawaii are considering a bill that would make it a felony to own or sell multi-burst triggers on firearms and other trigger modifications. H.B. 1908, introduced in January, has passed out of the state House Judiciary Committee, and a second hearing took place on Wednesday before the House Committee on Consumer Protection and Commerce. The bill would amend existing state law such that anyone who manufactures, imports into Hawaii, sells, or owns a bump stock could be charged with a felony.","Pennsylvania","Pennsylvania lawmakers have introduced 11 bills meant to curb gun violence in the week since the Parkland shooting. The measures covered by the bills range from making it harder for citizens to get access to assault-style weapons, like the one used in Parkland, to requiring background checks for all gun sales. State Rep. Warren Kampf (R) introduced seven of the 11 bills, including one to ban bump stocks. Several of the bills would make it possible for individuals to petition a court to remove someone’s guns if they show signs of violence.","Illinois","Illinois state Rep. Marty Moylan (D) introduced a bill two days after the Florida shooting to ban the manufacture, sale, purchase, and possession of “rate of fire enhancements,” a category of devices and accessories that includes bump stocks. Moylan and state Sen. Julie Morrison (D) have also doubled down on their calls to move forward gun control bills introduced before the Parkland shooting, including one to ban assault weapons and one to ban unregistered, often home-manufactured weapons known as “ghost guns.”","Wisconsin","Republican lawmakers on Tuesday blocked Democrats’ attempt to vote on a bill that would implement universal background checks for gun purchases in Wisconsin. Democratic lawmakers had attempted to bring the bill to the floor for a vote, but Republicans used a procedural tactic to avoid the vote and replace the measure with one to fund school grants to provide firearms to safety officers and curb illegal firearm purchases. Lawmakers approved that measure by a 71-24 vote.","Arizona","Republican state lawmakers on Tuesday blocked their Democratic colleagues’ attempt to push for a vote on a bill to ban bump stocks and other rate-of-fire modifications. Nearly a dozen other gun-related measures have stalled in the state legislature recently, only one of which has received a hearing. That bill, which passed out of a state House committee on the same day as the Parkland shooting, would end gun safety requirements previously imposed on foster parents; in other words, it represents an attempt to erode gun restrictions, not strengthen them.","South Carolina","Republicans and Democrats in South Carolina debated measures to curb gun violence in the wake of the Florida shooting. House Minority Leader Todd Rutherford (D) said he planned to introduce a bill to ban the sale of AR-15 rifles to anyone under the age of 20 ― a measure that Republican lawmakers in the state largely oppose. Instead, Republicans have pushed measures to arm teachers and allow concealed-weapon permit holders to carry their firearms in more locations.","Ohio","State Sens. Michael Skindell (D) and Charleta Tavares (D) this week proposed a ban on “assault weapons,” defined in the bill as any automatic or semiautomatic firearm with the capacity to accept 10 or more cartridges. The measure would require owners of assault-style weapons to dispose of the firearms, and would make it a felony to own such a gun.","Oregon","Gov. Kate Brown (D) spoke before the state Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, throwing her support behind a proposal to expand an existing ban on the purchase or possession of firearms or ammunition by people convicted of stalking or domestic violence or who have a restraining order against them. The state House approved the legislation on Feb. 15, a day after the Florida shooting. It is now being considered by the state Senate.","New Jersey","Gov. Phil Murphy (D) signaled his support on Tuesday for a number of bills currently moving through the state legislature, including measures to reduce the permitted size of ammunition magazines, require background checks for private gun sales, and ban certain types of firearms and ammunition.","Missouri","Republican lawmakers this week postponed hearings on six bills that would roll back restrictions on gun rights. The bills include measures to block colleges from banning firearms on campus; allow concealed-carry permit holders to bring their guns into churches and other houses of worship; and make it illegal to require electronic tracking systems for firearms.

The Billy Graham Evangelistic Association confirmed his death on Twitter.","Born in 1918 in Charlotte, North Carolina, William Franklin Graham Jr. was the oldest of the four children of William and Morrow Graham. He was raised on a dairy farm, and little in his childhood suggested he would become a world-renowned preacher.","Then at 16, Graham attended a series of revival meetings run by outspoken evangelist Mordecai Ham. The two months he spent listening to Ham’s sermons on sin sparked a spiritual awakening in Graham and prompted him to enroll at Bob Jones College. When the conservative Christian school’s strict doctrine didn’t align with his personal beliefs, he transferred to the Florida Bible Institute (now Trinity College of Florida) and joined a Southern Baptist Convention church. He was ordained in 1939.","Graham received additional training at Illinois’ Wheaton College, where he met his future wife, Ruth McCue Bell. They were married for 64 years, until her death in 2007, and had five children.","After serving briefly as the pastor of the First Baptist Church in Western Springs, Illinois, Graham launched his first radio program, “Songs in the Night,” in 1943. Although he left a year later, Graham liked the idea of sharing his message with a wide audience. As noted on his website, Graham took Jesus Christ literally when he said in Mark 16:15: “Go ye into all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature.”","Graham was still in his early 30s when entered the public spotlight by giving a series of well-attended “sin-smashing” revival meetings that were held under a circus tent in a Los Angeles parking lot. The press took interest in the charismatic young preacher and began writing articles about him. To get his message to even more people, Graham founded his own ministry, the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association.","Graham viewed the Bible as the infallible word of God. He believed that Jesus led a sinless life and that all men were lost and would face God’s judgment.","Such a strict interpretation of scripture also led him to condemn homosexual relationships.","More recently, detractors blasted Graham’s continued belief that homosexual behavior was a “sinister form of perversion,” and his intolerance against the very presence of gay and lesbian couples within Christianity.","“From Genesis on, the Bible praises the marriage of a man and a woman, but it speaks only negatively of homosexual behavior whenever it is mentioned,” Graham’s website states.","Graham’s sermons also promoted evangelism and railed against “godless communism,” drugs, sex and violence. He was convinced he must use “every modern means of communication available” to spread the Gospel throughout the world, and did so in print, on radio and television, online and in person.","And for the next five decades, his electric personality connected with audiences in more than 185 countries.","Graham was the first evangelist of note to speak behind the Iron Curtain, and during the Apartheid era he refused to visit South Africa until the government allowed integrated seating at his events. He published dozens of best-selling books, including Angels: God’s Secret Agents and The Jesus Generation, and wrote a weekly column that was syndicated in hundreds of newspapers.","Graham received numerous honors, including the Horatio Alger Award, the George Washington Honor Medal, the Ronald Reagan Freedom Award and the Congressional Gold Medal. A highway in Charlotte bears his name, as does part of Interstate 240 near his home in Asheville, North Carolina. In 1989, he became the first clergyman to be granted a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his work as a minister.","Graham also had a major effect on the civil rights movement of the 1950s and ’60s. His early crusades were segregated, but once the U.S. Supreme Court issued its landmark Brown v. Board of Education ruling in 1954, which found public school segregation unconstitutional, Graham integrated the seatings at his revival meetings.","Graham befriended the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. as well, and together they preached to more than 2 million people in New York City.","King once remarked on their partnership: “Had it not been for the ministry of my good friend Dr. Billy Graham, my work in the Civil Rights Movement would not have been as successful as it has been.”","When Graham was questioned about his views on faith and race, he argued there was no scriptural basis for segregation.","“Jesus was not a white man; He was not a black man. He came from that part of the world that touches Africa and Asia and Europe,” Graham once preached. “Christianity is not a white man’s religion, and don’t let anybody ever tell you that it’s white or black. Christ belongs to all people; He belongs to the whole world.”","As his message spread, Graham was granted personal audiences with royalty, dignitaries and many sitting presidents, from Harry S. Truman to Barack Obama. Three presidents were even on hand in 2007 for the dedication of the Billy Graham Library in Charlotte. Despite being a registered Democrat, Graham opposed the candidacy of John F. Kennedy, and actively encouraged other religious leaders to speak out about the dangers of having a Roman Catholic in the White House.","Though beloved by millions, Graham was not without his detractors. Some fundamentalist Christians took issue with his ecumenical approach to evangelism, and after his 1957 crusade in New York, opponents of Graham’s more liberal theology began calling him “the Antichrist.” According to the biography Billy: A Personal Look at Bill Graham, the World’s Best-Loved Evangelist by Sherwood Eliot Wirt, one Christian educator even said that Graham was “the worst thing to happen to the Christian church in two thousand years.”","As his health began to fail, Graham decided to announce his retirement in 2005. His final sermon, “The Cross ― Billy Graham’s Message To America,” called for a national spiritual awakening.","Nina Golgowski contributed reporting."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8d71ef1e000017087ac5cd.jpeg?cache=Xg6I8IvQTz&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"WOMEN","headline":"College’s ‘Women In Math’ Panel Features Only Male Speakers","authors":"Alanna Vagianos","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/colleges-women-in-math-panel-features-only-male-speakers-utah_us_5a8dcfa1e4b0273053a75035","short_description":"Who thought this was a good idea?","date":"2018-02-21"},"articleContent":["Ever wanted to learn about women in math, but from an entirely male perspective?

It was done with good intentions but with poor judgment and was not meant to be satire, though we did all get a good laugh here at the department,” the department’s statement reads. “The posters have been replaced with a more appropriate message. We very much value the Women in Math organization.”","Some current and former BYU students, however, were not satisfied.","“I’m confused,” Driggs tweeted in response to BYU’s statement. “Do they really think that the poster was the main issue here?”","At least two other students emailed the college to complain about the department’s lapse in judgement. BYU student Talia Ruth tweeted a screenshot of the email she sent the math department.","“It was a shock to see a poster advertising a conference of sorts regarding women in math showing only male faculty,” she wrote. “Women should be represented by women.

Claudia Tenney said.","date":"2018-02-21"},"articleContent":["WASHINGTON ― Rep. Claudia Tenney (R-N.Y.) claimed Wednesday that people who commit mass shootings are often Democrats.","The first-term Republican congresswoman made the comment at a discussion about last week’s Florida school shooting after criticizing the government for failing to act on several tips that might have prevented the deaths of 17 students and adults.","“It’s interesting that so many of these people that commit the mass murders end up being Democrats. But the media doesn’t talk about that either,” Tenney told WGDJ Talk1300 radio.","Although law enforcement officials said there were “no known ties” between Nikolas Cruz and a particular white supremacist group, the 19-year-old suspect in the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School massacre had repeatedly expressed racist, homophobic and anti-Semitic views in private group chats, CNN reported.","“I am fed up with the media and liberals attempting to politicize tragedies and demonize law-abiding gun owners and conservative Americans every time there is a horrible tragedy,” Tenney said in a subsequent statement on Wednesday. “While we know the perpetrators of these atrocities have a wide variety of political views, my comments are in response to a question about the failure to prosecute illegal gun crime. I will continue to stand up for law-abiding citizens who are smeared by anti-gun liberal elitists.”","The fact-checking site Snopes found that an online list purporting to show that assassins are more likely to be Democrats was, in fact, wildly flawed: Among other errors, it simply ignored any mass shooting known to be committed by someone with Republican or conservative views, and it identified shooters who were not Democrats as Democrats.","In her interview Wednesday, Tenney also lamented that legal gun owners might face restrictions after mass shootings.","“I think that’s what scares me most is, a lot of these legal gun areas are going to be targeted now,” she said. “In their demographic, they have the least amount of crime than virtually any other demographic.”","Tenney is a top-tier target of the Democratic Party in the 2018 midterm elections. She was criticized last week after she deplored the focus on domestic violence allegations against former White House staff secretary Rob Porter, who resigned after one of his ex-wives released photos of a black eye.","“I’m not saying he’s innocent, but I’m saying we don’t know,” Tenney said. “He could be the worst guy in the world, but now we’re getting into prosecution as far as I know. I guess there was an issue about, maybe the FBI knew about it, but really, is this what we’re talking about at this point?”","Evan Lukaske, a spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said Wednesday that Tenney’s comments will hurt her at the polls.","“Once again Congresswoman Tenney has demonstrated how completely unfit she is to serve in Congress,” Lukaske said in a statement. “Two weeks ago she called Democrats ‘un-American,’ last week she defended alleged domestic abuser Rob Porter, and now she blames Democrats for mass murder — she is an embarrassment to New York and our country.

No more pudding. No more cowboy hats. Carl is dead. He’s dead, dead, dead.","But a simple death is never enough for “The Walking Dead.”","They’re going to drag this one out.","We already know the show’s midseason premiere is going to be extra long ― reportedly 82 minutes ― and that it’s going to send Carl off into the sunset as he dies a slow, agonizing death from a zombie bite.","If that doesn’t sound cheery enough for you, there’s going to be a sad callback in the episode, too.","Carl got his deadly bite in Season 8, Episode 6, “The King, the Widow, and Rick,” when he was killing zombies with Siddiq (Avi Nash).","Siddiq’s mother apparently believed that killing zombies would free their souls, so Carl helps Siddiq kill some zombies in honor of his mother.","Unfortunately, Carl’s decision to do so leads to his demise.","On the surface, this seems like a really dumb way for Carl to die. After all, he’s been around since Season 1, and still has a lot of story from the comics that the show hasn’t yet touched on. If you dig just a little deeper, yes, the plot turn is still dumb (can’t fix that), but it also seems to have a connection to Carl’s mom, Lori Grimes (Sarah Wayne Callies).","You see, after learning that Siddiq kills zombies because of his mother’s beliefs, Carl asked, “Doing that, doesn’t it just make things harder for you while you’re trying to survive?”","Um, yeah, considering Carl’s bite, it clearly does.","But the line reminded us of when Lori died, and she told Carl to “always do what’s right,” even though it’s not easy. Does killing the zombies make it harder to survive? Yes, but it’s right, so that’s why he did it.","For those who don’t remember Lori’s death, you’re lucky.","In Season 3, a very-pregnant Lori went into labor, and Maggie (Lauren Cohan) had to perform a cesarean section on a dirty floor without pain meds or anesthetic. Baby Judith comes out fine, but Lori doesn’t make it, and Carl has to shoot her to ensure she doesn’t come back as a zombie, as people on “The Walking Dead” are known to do.","Before all that, she said goodbye to Carl, telling him he’s going to “beat this world” (a line that Carl repeats in the Season 8B trailer), adding:","You gotta do what’s right, baby. You promise me, you’ll always do what’s right. It’s so easy to do the wrong thing in this world. So don’t... so if it feels wrong, don’t do it, all right? If it feels easy, don’t do it. Don’t let the world spoil you. You’re so good.","During an interview with “Walking Dead” chief content officer Scott Gimple last year following the midseason finale, HuffPost asked if Carl’s fateful decision to go zombie-hunting was a callback to Lori’s final words.","“It was a story decision, and the only reason I can’t get into that part is I want the story to be told,” Gimple said.","“It’s funny that you bring up Lori. I will say there are parallels there, and it was very much in our mind,” he added. “Things we see even in the very next episode played into exactly what you’re talking about.”","What those things will look like remains to be seen; however, Riggs previously told The Hollywood Reporter that his character’s death turned him into a “humanitarian figure” meant to help Rick (Andrew Lincoln) see the good in people. Just as Lori died imploring Carl to do what’s right, it seems Carl might do the same for Rick.","The upcoming episode is going to be heavy. On the bright side of things, Rick’s ugly cry after Lori’s Season 3 death eventually led to all those Sad Rick/Coral memes. Maybe the next episode’s tragedy will make for another hilarious GIF.","We hope so. Yes, it’s the apocalypse, but would it kill anyone besides Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) to smile every once in a while?","“The Walking Dead” Season 8 returns Feb. 25 at 9 p.m. Eastern on AMC."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8c6e2c2000008806eaf707.jpeg?cache=jPJFCUb617&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Justin Bieber Brought Selena Gomez To Jamaica For His Dad’s Wedding","authors":"Cole Delbyck","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/selena-gomez-justin-bieber-dads-wedding_us_5a8d9fd7e4b00a30a251b3e1","short_description":"The maybe-couple attended the intimate ceremony with Bieber's family.","date":"2018-02-21"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Not Every Pennsylvania Democrat Benefited From Redistricting","authors":"Daniel Marans","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pennsylvania-democrats-gain-from-new-congressional-map_us_5a8d9fdfe4b00a30a251b3fc","short_description":"Here's a rundown of the winners and losers.","date":"2018-02-21"},"articleContent":["Pennsylvania’s Supreme Court prompted cheers from Democrats on Monday when it released the new boundaries it drew for the state’s 18 congressional districts.","The new map, which the court created after ruling earlier this month that the previous, GOP-gerrymandered map had unconstitutionally disenfranchised voters, gives Democrats the opportunity to compete in eight districts won by Hillary Clinton in 2016, compared with six she carried under the old map.","But in a central Pennsylvania district where two formidable Democratic hopefuls already have raised serious cash, the new electoral map is foreboding.","Pennsylvania’s 16th Congressional District, which leaned modestly Republican, is now the deep red 11th District.","While the previous district included the city of Lancaster, surrounding suburbs and the city of Reading ― which has a diverse population ― the more geographically contiguous new district excludes Reading and adds swaths of conservative, rural York County.","The result is that a district President Donald Trump won by 7 percentage points is now a district he would have carried by 26 points, according to calculations by the New York Times. (Further references to Trump’s margin in the new congressional districts is attributable to the Times.)","It also went from having an R+5 partisan voter index to R+14, according to the Cook Political Report, which compiles the figure to show how a district voted in the presidential election compared to the country as a whole.","“It would be hard to get people to invest further in that race,” a prominent Democrat familiar with the national party’s considerations said of the newly drawn 11th District. “The natural thing for several Democrats ... is either to move or drop out.”","Overall in Pennsylvania, Republicans hold 12 of the 18 U.S. House districts, with one seat that had been in GOP hands vacant. Trump carried the state by less than a percentage point. GOP leaders have indicated they will challenge the state Supreme Court’s redrawn map in federal court, but legal experts give them little chance of having it voided.","That’s good news in general for Democrats as they seek to win the House majority in this year’s midterm elections. Still, in the 11th District, the new boundaries are disruptive because of the heated state of the Democratic primary where many of the national divides between the party establishment and its more populist faction have begun to play out.","The two leading Democrats in the race are Christina Hartman, a former international development specialist running as a mainstream Democrat, and Jess King, a nonprofit leader who is running on a more populist, left-wing platform that includes support for “Medicare for all.”","King and Hartman had both raised more than $300,000 as of the end of 2017.","Upon learning of the new redistricting map, Hartman issued a brief Facebook statement praising the decision and saying she would be “studying these maps closely to determine our next moves.”","Hartman made clear in an interview with HuffPost that the new district, replete with Trump supporters, would make it harder for a Democrat to win the seat. Her victory strategy hinged in part on attracting the backing of moderate Republicans disenchanted with Trump.","She is seriously considering ending her bid, and said she will decide by the middle of next week.","“We have to look at the best strategy moving forward and figure out what that is for my district and for myself,” she said.","King sounded a more upbeat note in her response to the new map, claiming on Facebook that the tough nature of the race is “nothing new.”","“Our campaign has never been about Democrats versus Republicans,” King wrote. “Our campaign is about building an America that truly works all of us, not just for the rich and powerful who rig the game in Washington.”","King’s campaign communications director, Guido Girgenti, told HuffPost in an email on Wednesday afternoon that King walked into the office earlier in the day and said, “I’m all in.”","Girgenti also said that a phone-banking marathon to introduce King to new Democratic and independent constituents would continue as planned this weekend, manned by volunteers in 25 homes.","Meanwhile, an adjacent congressional district is suddenly within Democrats’ grasp. The former 4th Congressional District has become the 10th. With the addition of Hershey and previously excluded sections of Harrisburg, it went from a district Trump won by 21 percentage points to one he would have carried by 9 points.","Democrats Shavonnia Corbin-Johnson, a former Obama administration budget official, and retired career military officer George Scott are already vying to unseat Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) in the district. In light of the new map, Democrats have also approached Pennsylvania Auditor General Eugene DePasquale about jumping in the race.","Petitions for House candidates to be on the ballot are due in Pennsylvania by March 20 and DePasquale said on Twitter that he would make his decision before petition collection starts in earnest.","The biggest swings in Democrats favor were in eastern Pennsylvania districts where party leaders already liked their chances. In Philadelphia’s suburbs, the old 7th District ― infamously gerrymandered to look like “Goofy kicking Donald Duck” ― is now the 5th District.","Clinton won the old district by 2 percentage points, but would have carried the reconfigured one by a 28-point margin. And with the retirement of GOP Rep. Patrick Meehan amid sexual harassment allegations, the seat is now open. Democrat Rich Lazer, who has close ties to area labor unions, is considering a run for the seat, according to Daily Kos, which provided a rundown of other candidates as well.","Republican prospects also have been hurt in suburban Philadelphia’s 6th District, which now includes the heavily Democratic city of Reading. GOP Rep. Ryan Costello already faced a well-funded challenger in Democrat Chrissy Houlahan, a career naval officer, business executive and public school teacher. He must now defeat Houlahan in a district that would have gone for Clinton by 9 percentage points, compared with the 1 point victory she had in it.","In the Lehigh Valley north of Philadelphia, Democrats like their odds more in the new 7th District than they did in the old 15th. The retirement of Republican Rep. Charlie Dent, a popular moderate, had already sent Democrats scrambling to pick up the seat. With the addition of the city of Easton and Democratic-leaning towns in the Poconos region, the district went from one that Trump took by 8 percentage points to one where Clinton would have defeated him by a single point.","Democrats competing for the seat span the ideological spectrum. John Morganelli, a long-serving district attorney in the area who has praised Trump, is running as a self-described moderate. Under the new map, he noted in an email to supporters, the county where he is a prosecutor is now a larger part of the district.","Attorney Susan Wild and pastor Greg Edwards, a civil rights activist with the endorsement of national liberal groups, are vying for the progressive mantle. Thus far, Edwards has outraised Wild ― and his campaign believes the new district helps his chances in the primary.","“General election viability, which is often an excuse to dismiss progressive candidates, is really no longer in play” now that the district leans more Democratic, said Dan Friedman, an Edwards campaign spokesman.","And while the new district boundaries do not affect the March 13 special election for the vacant seat in southwest Pennsylvania’s 18th District, they could help Democrats in that area in November.","The home of Democrat Conor Lamb, a former federal prosecutor running in the special election, has been redistricted into the 17th District. Even if Lamb loses next month, he will have a chance to challenge Republican Rep. Keith Rothfus in the new 17th District that includes more Democratic-leaning Pittsburgh suburbs than before. Trump won Rothfus’ old district, which was then the 12th, by 21 percentage points, but would have carried the new one by just 3 points.","Finally, there is at least one Pennsylvania district where Democrats’ fortunes appear to remain almost exactly the same. Trump won what was the 17th District in northeast Pennsylvania’s by 10 percentage points, and that would have been his margin in what is now the 8th District.","Rep. Matt Cartwright, a liberal Democrat, was re-elected in 2016 by nearly 8 percentage points. His staff estimated that about 30,000 people in the district voted for him and Trump, Cartwright told HuffPost.","Cartwright may now face a tougher Republican opponent since the geography of the new district enables to former state Revenue Secretary Dan Meuser to jump in.","But Cartwright said he isn’t worried about the electoral impact of the changes.","He plans to hold a March 4 town hall in Pike County to introduce himself to new constituents. And one advantage of the geographically compact new district is that Cartwright’s new constituents were already in his campaign media market, he said.","“Even though they haven’t been represented by me, some of these people know me and know what I’m about,” he said.","This story has been updated to reflect Democrat Jess King’s confirmation that she will stay in the race in the new 11th District.","CORRECTION: A previous version of this story indicated that Rothfus’ old congressional district was the 11th.

Rents are spiraling out of control while incomes stagnate, with rents increasing at more than triple the rate of wages over the last 50 years.","The increasingly desperate situation has led nine U.S. foundations, including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Ford Foundation, to announce on Tuesday that they are launching a partnership to tackle systemic problems in the housing market. The aim: to ensure that the more than 11 million families across the country that spend more than half of their paycheck on rent and those who are homeless have access to safe, affordable housing.","The partnership, called Funders For Housing and Opportunity, has divided an initial $4.9 million in grant money between four nonprofits that tackle housing insecurity. This first tranche of money is aimed “mostly in the area of policy, advocacy and organizing,” said Susan Thomas, senior program officer at Melville Charitable Trust and chair of Funders for Housing and Opportunity.","Center for Community Change will get $750,000 to bolster its work with low-income communities, with a focus on California and Washington state. National Housing Trust and Enterprise Community Partners will receive just over $1 million to lead a community coalition to help residents get heard on housing issues. The California-based Partnership for Children and Youth will get $400,000 for its training and advocacy work in housing developments.","The largest grant, $2.7 million over three years, goes to the National Low Income Housing Coalition (NLIHC), which is working to launch a multi-sector housing campaign including organizations from across the health care, civil rights, education and anti-poverty fields.","“The research that’s been building shows us that when people are struggling so much just to afford their homes, they’re suffering in a multitude of ways,” said Diane Yentel, president and CEO of the NLIHC. “They have poor health, their kids are unable to do as well in school as their peers who are affordable housed, they have lower lifetime earnings and they even have have lower life expectancy.”","The NLIHC was behind stark research last year into rent affordability, which found that for those working a 40-hour week on the minimum wage, there is no state in the country where a modest two-bedroom rental home is affordable (defined as costing less than 30 percent of the renters’ income). A renter earning the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour would need to work 117 hours a week for a two-bedroom rental home to be affordable.","“I would say the affordable housing crisis has reached historic heights,” said Yentel, who pointed to research showing a shortage of 7.4 million affordable homes available for the lowest income people. “Another way of looking at it is for every 100 of the lowest income people in our country, there are just 35 homes that are affordable and available to them.”","At a time families are “making choices between their housing payments and buying healthy food, medicine or school supplies for their kids,” said Sue Henderson, Habitat for Humanity International’s vice president for the United States and Canada, this new partnership is to be welcomed.","“We need more funders at the table and more work boots on the ground,” she added.","The nearly $5 million initial purse is, of course, peanuts compared to the total resources of these foundations, which collectively manage assets of about $470 billion. But Thomas said this is just the start. More money will be available that will be focused on mobilizing and scaling grassroots projects that work “particularly in the areas at the intersections of housing and education and housing and health care. ... We really feel very strongly that this is a cross-sector issue; it’s not just a housing issue.”","The announcement comes at a time when President Donald Trump’s administration has just unveiled a proposed budget that hacks away at the funding available for affordable housing. “It looks really grim,” said Mary Cunningham, vice president of the Metropolitan Housing and Communities Policy Center at the Urban Institute. “I don’t think philanthropy will be able to make up the losses that we face from the federal budget but certainly getting smarter, targeting affordable housing and helping align the fields is really important work.”","She added, “We really know what the solutions are to ending the affordable housing crisis and ending homelessness and that is building more housing and we just haven’t figured out a way to pay for that.”","For more content and to be part of the “This New World” community, join our Facebook Group.","HuffPost’s “This New World” series is funded by Partners for a New Economy and the Kendeda Fund.

The group says more than 75,000 people have reached out online or by text to volunteer in the last week.","Local chapters of Moms Demand Action have also reported swelling attendance at events over the past few days, with anywhere from two to 10 times the usual number of people showing up at new member meetings, advocacy days and rallies.","For instance, a meeting in Maine that usually has about 20 attendees had over 250 people turn up on Sunday, a meeting in Raleigh that usually has two dozen participants had more than 350 on Monday, and an “advocacy day” calling for action from legislators in Missouri ― which about 150 people attended last year ― had more than 300 participants this week.","Shannon Watts, the founder of Moms Demand Action, said one of the most encouraging aspects of this influx has been how many new members are young students, mirroring the recent wave of teen activists mobilizing since the Parkland shooting. Students at Marjory Douglas Stoneman High School and beyond have been speaking to news outlets, pressuring legislators on social media and organizing national marches to call for lawmakers to take action on gun violence.","To meet these new members’ needs, Moms Demand Action has just launched a new initiative: Students Demand Action.","“When Sandy Hook happened, those were babies. They weren’t able to use their voices and express their outrage,” Watts told HuffPost on Tuesday. “These are kids who have come of age as the generation of lockdown drills. Our lawmakers are not standing up to the gun lobby, so our children are having to stand up to gunmen.”","The Parkland shooting was the 17th shooting incident at a U.S. school in 2018 alone, and it was also a turning point for 68-year-old Ilene Evanter Van Hoozer. She attended a Moms Demand Action event in Falls Church, Virginia, for the first time on Monday, and plans to continue being active with the group.","“In the wake of the tragedy of last week, there were no excuses that were good enough anymore,” Evanter told HuffPost Tuesday. “Feeling sad wasn’t enough. Feeling numb wasn’t enough. It was time to channel it.”","As a clinical social worker who has worked with children for decades, Evanter was most excited to hear students speaking at the event, which was held at a local high school. She plans to attend next month’s student-led March for Our Lives in Washington, D.C.","“I think we’re learning from the students in Florida ― they really are giving us energy and making us as adults look at ourselves and want to support them,” she added.","Moms Demand Action is excited to support the young activists organizing now, Watts said, and has already started mobilizing its more than 4 million members to attend the March for Our Lives.","Taking on gun reform in America is “a marathon, not a sprint,” Watts said, adding that local chapters in all 50 states that took years to build up have now been essential in absorbing the thousands of new people seeking to get involved in the gun reform movement.","Since Sandy Hook, the group has had key legislative victories ― such as getting background check laws passed in eight states ― but Watts noted that Moms Demand Action still hasn’t been able to push Congress to close the many loopholes in the country’s background check system. That’s another reason she’s encouraged by this new surge of young activists.","“I’m excited to let them lead and see where they’ll take us,” Watts said. “There is strength in numbers. We need every generation to get involved. It’s going to be up to the next generation to make sure this work gets finished. This is going to take a while ― and take every American.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8cc4d12000003800eaf766.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"RELIGION","headline":"Christians Wrestle With Billy Graham's Legacy","authors":"Carol Kuruvilla","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/christians-on-twitter-reflect-on-billy-grahams-influence-and-legacy_us_5a8dc4afe4b00a30a251fab3","short_description":"\"An imperfect but devoted servant whose preaching pointed so many to Jesus.\"","date":"2018-02-21"},"articleContent":["Rev.

Thousands responded to his altar call, often to the tune of one of his favorite old hymns, “Just As I Am.”","But the gospel of salvation that Graham preached never invited queer Americans to come the altar just as they were. The pastor also held conservative views about women. And while he opposed racial segregation, he was not as active as other Christian leaders during the 1960s civil rights era.","Still, with his crusades and fiery preaching, he inspired a spiritual revival in the lives of generations of Christians. He’s praised for being nonpartisan about politics, at least later on in his life ― meeting with every president from Harry Truman to Barack Obama.","On Wednesday, many reposted on Twitter a quote attributed to Graham, in which the pastor reveals his beliefs about death.","Others quoted a well-known Bible verse to honor Graham. In the parable, an employer congratulates his servant for wisely using the gifts given to him, saying, “Well done, good and faithful servant.”","The tributes poured in from prominent evangelical leaders ...","... and from other strains of American Christianity.","Some pointed out that his legacy was mixed, especially for LGBTQ Americans and others who are harmed by conservative interpretations of Christianity.","But many gave him his due as a towering figure in America’s religious history."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8de09e1e000008087ac6e4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"WEIRD NEWS","headline":"Exotic Dancers Show It's Easier To Get A Gun Than A Strippers' License In Tennessee","authors":"David Moye","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/exotic-dancers-deja-vu-ar-15-couch-dance_us_5a8dbdcce4b03414379cbf18","short_description":"The video they filmed angered a GOP politician in the state.","date":"2018-02-21"},"articleContent":["Two exotic dancers in Nashville, Tennessee, found a shocking way to spotlight the “strict” laws governing their profession ― comparing those rules with lax regulations for buying assault-style weapons in their state.","In an obviously staged video posted on Tuesday, the dancers, known professionally as Mary Jane Watson and Miss Pepper Pots, offer a potential “customer” couch dances for $15 or an AR-15 rifle for $1,100.","The young man, standing in front of the table the two women set up outside the club where they perform, asks if the gun sale is even legal.","Watson explains that, yes, yes it is.","“We can do a private firearms transfer,” she says.","Pots adds that they don’t need to see I.D. or do a background check on the man.","“You just give us $1,100 in cash and we give you the gun,” she says.","The customer acts shocked at how easy it is to get the gun ― the same type of weapon used in the Feb. 14 shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida, that killed 17 students and staff members ― and Watson agrees.","“That’s just how loose the privatized gun transfer law is in Tennessee,” she said. (State law does prohibit a person from “knowingly” selling a gun to someone “prohibited by state or federal law from owning, possessing or purchasing” a firearm.)","The man then asks about the couch dance option, and Watson and Pots detail the legal hoops they have to jump through to become exotic dancers.","“First of all, we have to get a background check,” Watson says.","“Then we have to go get our fingerprints done,” Pots adds.","Dancers in Tennessee are also required to supply two recent passport photos to the State’s Sexually Oriented Business Licensing Board. along with other paperwork, and then wait through a two-week background check period.","“And only then are we deemed safe to give you a [fully clothed] couch dance,” Watson says.","Watson and Pots don’t actually sell the AR-15 in the video, which was made to protest what they and their employer, Deja Vu Showgirls, deem to be excessive regulation of their business.","The video has been viewed on Facebook by less than 900 people as of Wednesday afternoon, but one of those was Joe Carr, a former Republican member of the Tennessee House who’s now running for the state Senate.","He’s not happy.","“All stunts are meant to generate publicity, and I think this is kind of tragic with what happened in Florida in the school down there and what has happened in a number of schools over the past few years,” Carr told local station WSMV-TV. “It should not be minimized by sensational antics by a handful of women in front of a gentleman’s club.”","RawStory notes that Carr promoted his own AR-15 rifle giveaway in June 2016, just three weeks after the Pulse Nightclub shooting in Orlando, Florida, in which a gunman killed 49 people.","Watson said she hopes the video gets people thinking.","“We could sell [the gun] to someone who uses it for God knows what, and yet we have to go through all of this just to give someone a dance?

He cut his arms and posted videos on Snapchat. He killed animals. He threatened fellow students. He hit his mother. He brought bullets to school. Someone close to him called the FBI to report his “desire to kill people, erratic behavior, and disturbing social media posts, as well as the potential of him conducting a school shooting.”","Despite this, Cruz, 19, was able to legally acquire an arsenal of firearms, including the AR-15 police say he used to slaughter 17 people last week at his former high school in Parkland, Florida.","Without a criminal record or a court declaring him mentally incompetent, Cruz was free to arm himself as heavily as he could afford in his home state.","This would not have been the case in the five states that allow law enforcement or family members to petition a court to temporarily remove guns from individuals who pose a threat to themselves or others.","The policy, alternately called a “red flag” law, “gun violence restraining order,” or “extreme risk protection order,” is getting more attention since the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.","Federal law prohibits some individuals from buying or owning guns: those who have been convicted of a felony or a domestic violence misdemeanor, are an undocumented immigrant or fugitive from justice, were dishonorably discharged from the military, or have been involuntarily committed to a mental institution.","Some states have gone further, passing laws to prevent individuals who are exhibiting red flags, but haven’t yet committed a crime, from possessing firearms, explained Robin Lloyd, the director of government affairs at Giffords, the gun violence prevention organization established by the former congresswoman and shooting survivor Gabrielle Giffords.","California, Washington, Oregon, Indiana and Connecticut have approved measures that allow a court to temporarily strip gun rights from people who show warning signs of violence.","While each state differs, here’s broadly how they work: A concerned family member or police officer asks a judge to remove guns from an individual they believe is at risk of hurting themselves or others.","A temporary order, which typically lasts for a few weeks, can be issued immediately if there’s evidence it’s needed to prevent imminent danger.","Individuals are given notice of a final hearing, where a judge will decide if they should be prohibited from gun possession for a longer period of time, generally a year. They may contest the evidence against them, and can appeal the decision.","In Cruz’s case, “it’s entirely possible that there could have been an intervention beforehand to remove firearms” if Florida had a red flag law, said Lloyd, noting that police responded to his family home on dozens of occasions. “We know this is a life-saving measure.”","California was the first state to allow family members to petition a court to remove guns from individuals who exhibit alarming warning signs.","The legislation was passed in 2014, a few months after the Isla Vista rampage, in which Elliot Rodger killed six people and injured 13. A month before the massacre, his mother contacted mental health officials, saying she was worried about disturbing videos he was posting to YouTube. Law enforcement performed a welfare check, but said their hands were tied. There was nothing legally preventing him from possessing a gun.","Similar legislation has been proposed in 18 other states this year. Elizabeth Avore, legal and policy director for Everytown for Gun Safety, said passing red flag laws was a top priority for her organization, even before the Florida mass shooting.","“We see over and over again that these mass shooters have demonstrated warning signs prior to the act of violence,” Avore said. “After the Florida school shooting, there is renewed interest ― and bipartisan interest ― in these laws.”","Florida state Rep. Lori Berman (D) introduced a red flag bill last year, and told HuffPost it received no bipartisan support at the time. Now, it seems like her bill may pick up steam. Prominent Florida Republicans, such as former presidential candidates Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush, have come out in support of the approach.","“We haven’t had a serious discussion about gun safety in the state of Florida,” Berman said, noting that she has introduced at least seven bills on gun violence prevention during her time in the legislature. None has ever even received a hearing.","“It saddens me that it took this event to have this discussion,” Berman said.","Rep. Salud Carbajal (D-Calif.) introduced federal legislation last year that would encourage states to adopt red flag laws with grant money. Carbajal said the approach is “sensible and reasonable,” and may have prevented Cruz from committing a mass shooting.","“The Second Amendment is important, but it doesn’t mean that we have to be extreme and permissive with the sale of guns to anyone and everyone,” Carbajal said. “There are reasonable parameters that can be enacted.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8d9eb4210000ed06601e46.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"This Neo-Nazi Speech Shows The Rally In Charlottesville Was Always Meant To Be Violent","authors":"Luke O'Brien and Jessica Schulberg","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/neo-nazi-video-charlottesville-violence_us_5a8ca5dce4b00a30a250606c","short_description":"The white supremacist organizers are hoping to fend off a conspiracy lawsuit.

Collectively, the series of 16 oil portraits reflects the gay artist’s “complicated relationship with masculinity” since childhood. (Watch a time-lapse clip of Richmond working on the series above.)","“It was assumed by almost everyone I met that I was, or should be, heterosexual, unemotional, aggressive and athletic ― none of which was remotely true,” Richmond said. “I felt like a failure because I didn’t live up to an archetype that I never signed up with to begin with.”","Richmond, whose work has been displayed in New York, San Francisco, Chicago and other cities, said “The Naked Eye” also reflects the generational shift in how masculinity is perceived, especially in the wake of the #MeToo movement and other cultural milestones.","“What it means to be a man in 2018 is different than what I was taught growing up in the early 1980s,” he said. “Today, masculinity often gets paired with words like ‘toxic’ or ‘fragile.’ I think both are a result of the narrow molds we’ve historically created for men, the incredible privilege afforded to those who fill them best, and the complete disregard for anything else that falls outside the lines.”","Many of “The Naked Eye” paintings also nod to recent events in Richmond’s life. The Ohio native relocated to Monterey, California, in 2016 in the days before the U.S. presidential election; his new home has been “a great catalyst for making creative strides,” he said.","Richmond’s father died suddenly as the new series was being created. One portrait, “A Space of Your Own,” is based on an old photograph of the elder Richmond, while “Lost to Myself” depicts the artist dealing with grief.","“I try to be truth, open and genuine in my work, so it’s very much shaped by the places and events of my life,” Richmond said.","As it turns out, the subversion of gender roles has become a staple of Richmond’s work. His popular “Cheesecake Boys” series took an “equal opportunity” approach to 1950s pinup culture, depicting queer celebrities like actor-comedian Alec Mapa, photographer Mike Ruiz, and New York nightlife icon James St. James striking Marilyn Monroe and Bettie Page-style poses in various stages of undress.","Though “The Naked Eye” is vastly different in style and tone, Richmond is confident that fans of his “Cheesecake Boys” will find something to admire in the new series, too.","“It’s like having a little dessert first,” he quipped, “but saving room for something more. I hope viewers come away with a deeper sense of wonder and appreciation for the complexity within us all.”","Paul Richmond’s “The Naked Eye” will be on display at the Faust Salon & Spa in Santa Cruz, California, through June 12.","Check out more images from the exhibit below."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8ca88e2000007d06eaf74c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Donald Trump Jr. Is Giving A Speech In India This Week -- About What, We Have No Idea","authors":"S.V.

He will speak just minutes before the prime minister of India. His remarks are titled “Reshaping Indo-Pacific Ties: The New Era of Cooperation.”","Will Donald Trump Jr. offer the country’s business leaders a peek into a new U.S.-India relationship in trade? Defense? Terrorism?","Don’t ask the United States government. It claims not to have any idea.","The State Department, usually an authority in matters concerning America’s relations with other countries, said it wasn’t involved with Trump Jr.’s trip, which appears to be primarily about marketing luxury apartments in new buildings that will be licensed to bear the Trump name.","“I’m not familiar with what is going to be the contents of the speech, or how it was put together,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said at a briefing Tuesday. “He is there as a private citizen, and I don’t have any comment beyond that.”","White House press secretary Sarah Sanders similarly said the trip is unrelated to government business. “My understanding is he is there in a personal capacity,” she said.","Critics of President Donald Trump’s ongoing ownership of his various branded businesses say the speech is a perfect example of the conflicts of interest he has created and that his family is taking advantage of.","“Don Jr. has continued to blur the lines between the Trump administration and the Trump Organization,” said Jordan Libowitz with Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a watchdog group. “He is touring Indian properties and selling off the opportunity to meet with him, while also delivering a speech on foreign policy at the same summit as the prime minister of India, all while under Secret Service protection on the taxpayer dime.”","Unlike previous presidents who placed their assets in a blind trust while in office to ensure that their decisions could not be affected by their personal financial interests, President Trump has refused to do so. Instead, he continues to profit from Trump properties such as the Trump International Hotel four blocks from the White House and his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida. The hotel routinely accommodates foreign delegations visiting the city, while Mar-a-Lago doubled its initiation fee to $200,000 after Trump’s election. When visiting the Florida resort, the president frequently mingles with paying guests while excluding the journalists assigned to travel with him.","Donald Trump Jr. is executive vice president of the Trump Organization, the family business that operates his father’s various for-profit enterprises. An official there, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the India trip is purely on behalf of the Trump Organization.","“Donald Trump Jr. is speaking to the Economic Times Global Business Summit in his capacity as a businessman. I believe there are other influential business leaders speaking such as the CEO of Uber and the founder of Netflix,” the official said. “Donald Jr. is not part of the administration.”","The official did not respond to a follow-up query asking what topics Trump Jr. would be covering in his remarks, which according to the schedule posted by the sponsor are to begin at 7:35 p.m. local time and last for 15 minutes. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to speak for half an hour that evening, beginning 10 minutes after Trump Jr. is finished.","Trump Jr. is attending marketing sessions in various Indian cities where apartment towers are being planned with the Trump brand attached. As has been the case with most Trump family construction projects since Donald Trump ran his casinos into bankruptcy in the 1990s and 2000s, other investors are financing the construction, while the Trump family is benefiting from licensing fees it charges to put the Trump name on the buildings.","Ads in Indian newspapers have been promising drinks and dinner with Trump Jr. if buyers make a down payment of 2.5 million rupees ― about $39,000 ― for an apartment. Flats in a tower being built in a New Delhi suburb are running for as much as $1.5 million.","In an interview with CNBC India upon his arrival in the country this week, Trump Jr. said he was impressed at how Indians always seem happy, despite living amid so much poverty. “You can see the poorest of the poor, and there is still a smile on a face,” he said. “I know some of the most successful people in the world and some of them are the most miserable people in the world, also, right?”","Libowitz said he’s not sure how and when Trump Jr.’s thoughts about “Indo-Pacific ties” became valuable enough to warrant a prestige speaking slot with India’s prime minister.","“We do not know when he became a foreign policy expert, but we would bet it had something to do with being the son of the president,” Libowitz said. “The big question is who will be paying for access to the president’s son.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8c9e56210000ed06601ceb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"SPORTS","headline":"U.S. Ice Dancing Team Breaks Down After 'Heartbreaking' Mistake","authors":"Rebecca Shapiro","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/us-ice-dancing-team-breaks-down-after-heartbreaking-mistake_us_5a8b9776e4b09fc01e02b021","short_description":"\"It's just kind of a given that you don’t fall,\" NBC's Terry Gannon says.","date":"2018-02-20"},"articleContent":["The dream of an Olympic medal came to a crashing end Tuesday for U.S. ice dancing team Madison Chock and Evan Bates.","The duo, who stood in seventh place heading into the medal competition, experienced what NBC commentators described as a “heartbreaking” and “obvious” mistake during their program, both falling in the middle of a turn element.","“That’s such an obvious mistake,” NBC’s Terry Gannon said. “It’s just kind of a given that you don’t fall if you’re going to challenge one of the top spots.” He later added, “I don’t know how you carry on with the rest of the program because you know your chance for a medal is gone.”","Midway through the free dance, Chock and Bates moved into a turn element when their skates clicked together at the very beginning of the spin, causing the athletes to tumble to the ice.

For one, the drug’s purported benefits ― increased blood flow and faster recovery after a workout ― don’t seem particularly necessary for curling, a sport in which some athletes were known to take smoke breaks mid-match.","Plus, Krushelnitsky, his managers and his doctors knew what the rest of the world knew going into the Winter Games: There’s a microscope on Russia because of revelations about its state-sponsored doping regime and its athletes’ taste for meldonium in particular. Tennis star Maria Sharapova admitted to taking meldonium at the 2016 Australian Open, which earned her a 15-month ban, and enough members of Russia’s under-18 hockey squad tested positive for the stuff that the team was replaced en masse before the 2016 world championships.","Perhaps most peculiar, though, is the fact that meldonium, a heart drug, was banned in the first place. The drug’s performance-enhancing properties have not actually been scientifically confirmed. But they never had to be, because Russian athletes were taking a lot of it, and that was enough to get the World Anti-Doping Agency’s attention.","WADA took aim at meldonium, developed in 1970 in Latvia, when it noticed that a number of professional athletes in the old Eastern Bloc were using it. A study of the 2015 European Games, published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, found a “high prevalence of meldonium use by athletes.” It found that 13 medal winners were on meldonium at the time, and 66 of 762 athletes tested positive for it.","Russians, meanwhile, were crazy for it. A study by the country’s anti-doping agency found that 17 percent of samples taken from 4,316 Russian athletes between October 2014 and February 2015 had traces of meldonium, according to the Times. When researchers looked at rugby players, that number skyrocketed to 53 percent.","WADA spent only a year monitoring the drug before banning it on Jan. 1, 2016. (By comparison, it’s taken years to ban other substances ― some drugs, like caffeine, sit on the monitoring list indefinitely.) After meldonium was banned, athletes largely from Eastern European countries failed more than 170 doping tests due to the drug, including Sharapova.","Dr. Olivier Rabin, WADA’s science director, noted that after the Sharapova scandal, the group banned meldonium in part because everyone was doing it.","“For meldonium, it quickly came to our attention that there were clear patterns of use by entire teams, which usually suggests a drug isn’t being taken for medical purposes,” he told NPR in 2016. “How could every member of a team need the same medical treatment?”","But although Rabin says there are studies suggesting the drug had a “potential performance-enhancing benefit,” there isn’t any preponderance of evidence that this is true. In fact, one study Rabin referred to actually states that “The evidence to demonstrate any performance enhancing effects of meldonium in the athlete population is limited.”","Of course, this didn’t need to be about performance enhancement. Before banning a drug, WADA also looks at other criteria, including health risks and an even wider catch-all, “whether taking the drug goes against the spirit of sport,” according to Rabin. Meldonium, apparently, falls into the latter category, since Radin previously noted that “meldonium is probably not a very toxic substance.”","Meldonium’s short history on the naughty list is a classic case of authorities post-hoc’ing their way through a drug war. A suspect class of people took a substance; the substance became suspect as a result.","“Here’s a situation where WADA has to play constant catch-up,” says John Hoberman, an Olympic historian and professor at the University of Texas at Austin. “They had to include related substances [on the banned substances list] as well, because some underground chemist would tweak the testosterone molecule that wasn’t covered by the statute. They have to react to events.”","In the case of meldonium, that meant banning a drug without conclusive evidence that it enhances athletic performance.","During the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, clean Russian athletes are only permitted to compete under a neutral flag and uniform as “Olympic Athletes from Russia.” The IOC banned 11 Russian athletes for life over allegations of state-sponsored doping and what the committee called “unprecedented systematic manipulation” of the anti-doping system at the 2014 Sochi Winter Games.","Russia ranked No. 1 in doping violations in 2013-2015, according to WADA, and the country has been implicated in doping scandals across many international sports in prior years.","This year, Putin admitted to “instances of doping” among his athletes, but also said, “There are many such examples around the world, but no one is making a big show of it.” (He’s not wrong in this. “Americans have a well-established doping regime, too; it’s just privatized and corporatized,” HuffPost’s Travis Waldron has written.)","It’s unclear what will happen to Krushelnitsky, or whether Russia will be reinstated as an Olympic competitor after the latest scandal. The IOC had previously suggested that it could lift its suspension on Russian athletes marching under their national flag for the closing ceremony, but IOC spokesman Mark Adams told The Associated Press that a failed doping test could prevent that."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8c26581e000046057ac409.jpeg?cache=hMeaovlIWA&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Sterling K.

If the teachers and other public employees go on strike Thursday and Friday as expected, it will be the first statewide work stoppage to hit West Virginia schools in nearly 30 years.","The state’s two teachers unions ― affiliates of the American Federation of Teachers and the National Education Association ― say workers in every county will take part in the strike, with most having voted in favor of it by overwhelming margins. They are hoping to send a strong message to the state legislature, which hasn’t funded the public employees’ health care program enough to curb rising premiums.","The last across-the-board raise for teachers and other public employees came in 2014. Coupled with increasing deductions for health premiums, that means some workers have actually seen their take-home pay go down in recent years, according to Christine Campbell, president of the American Federation of Teachers-West Virginia.","“I don’t think people recognize how dire it is, and how it directly impacts students’ learning,” Campbell said. “Teacher vacancies are increasing. There are classrooms with no teacher of record. ... We’ve actually been educating teachers at our universities in West Virginia and they’re not staying here.”","West Virginia ranked 48th out of 50 states and the District of Columbia in average teacher salaries in 2016, ahead of only Mississippi, Oklahoma and South Dakota, according to data from the National Education Association. It was one of just five states where average pay dropped from the previous year, to $45,622.","The state’s Republican governor, Jim Justice, proposed a 1 percent general increase in teacher pay each year for five years, a plan passed by the Republican-controlled state Senate. The Republican-controlled House of Delegates passed a plan that included a 2 percent raise followed by several 1 percent annual raises. The state’s unions have been critical of both proposals.","Don Scalise, a government and history teacher at Cabell Midland High School, said rising health care costs are a bigger problem than the salaries. If the state doesn’t fill a $39 million shortfall, premiums will rise again next year for workers on the state employee health plan. Scalise said the reasonable health care costs used to help make up for the low pay.","“In West Virginia, we know they weren’t known for having high salaries, but they were known for good health insurance,” he said. “That used to be something to attract people. Now that’s eroding.”","Scalise’s county was one of a handful where teachers went out on a one-day walkout last week, before the statewide strike was organized. He said legislators have underestimated how willing public employees are to use work stoppages to make their demands.","“We feel like we’ve been backed into a corner,” he said.","West Virginia public employees don’t enjoy the same collective bargaining rights that public sector workers do elsewhere. In most states, a local teachers union will negotiate with the school district to secure a contract spelling out wages and benefits. But in West Virginia, the general pay scale is set by the state legislature, with counties left to supplement those salaries to varying degrees.","Unions essentially lobby lawmakers to pass legislation improving pay and benefits, rather than bargain directly on behalf of members. While they can’t negotiate over wages, there’s precedent for West Virginia teachers to go on strike ― even though they could face court injunctions to return to work. (The state superintendent of schools has asserted that a strike would be illegal.) The last time teachers walked off the job in West Virginia was 1990, when they protested low pay. During that strike, workers in 47 of the state’s 55 counties participated.","Campbell said the state will continue to lose teachers in border areas where they can easily cross state lines for better pay. Virginia, Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Maryland all have higher average wages than West Virginia. According to Campbell, a lot of teachers feel torn between needing more money and wanting to stay loyal to the state they have always lived in.","“We’re not saying we want to be first in pay,” Campbell said. “It’s about actually having a living wage. We have to be able to survive. We have families. Our students are suffering because of the lack of an ability to attract and retain people.”","West Virginia has been dealing with a growing teacher shortage in recent years, with 700 vacancies around the state as of last spring. The board of education has proposed watering down some teacher training requirements in order to plug the gaps, including waiving the need to pass a basic knowledge test if a candidate had a certain grade point average.","Diamond said boosting pay would be one way to address the problem. With 19 years of teaching experience, she earns a salary of about $39,000. Her husband earns slightly more, thanks to having a master’s degree plus 30 credit hours. But even with two salaries, they live one paycheck to the next. She said her $8.75-per-hour shifts at Hardee’s help cover the costs of their children’s traveling sports teams.","She lives so close to Ohio that she shops for her groceries there. So far, she’s resisted looking for a better-paying job teaching on the other side of the Ohio River.","“I have lived in West Virginia my whole life,” she said. “I have two children who I don’t want to leave the state. I don’t want them to feel they can’t be productive. What I’m fighting for is the future of West Virginia.”","This story has been updated with details on the 1990 strike."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8c8bd32000003800eaf734.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"SPORTS","headline":"German Team Doctor Recommends Olympians Drink A Beer After Competing","authors":"Kevin Kaduk, Yahoo!

In 2016, the Rio state was home to more than 5,000 homicides, including nearly 1,000 killings committed by police.","Though it is far from Brazil’s most violent area, the second-largest but most prominent city in the country has become a barometer for the nation as a whole, which saw its number of homicides increase nearly 4 percent, to roughly 62,000, in 2016. (By comparison, in 2016, there were around 17,000 homicides in the United States, which has roughly 100 million more people than Brazil.)","There were another 688 shootings in Rio in January, but it is no coincidence that Temer made the announcement last week, at the close of Carnival. As the annual pre-Lent festival ended, videos of tourists being beaten and robbed on Rio’s streets and beaches circulated online and on Brazilian cable news, driving home the perception that violence in the city had spiraled out of control.","There is no doubt that Rio and Brazil in general are in dire need of a policy shift to address the outbreaks of violence.","But there is little reason for optimism that Temer’s plan to send in the big guns of the Brazilian military will work, and the concerns around his decision are plentiful and obvious. Most notably, allowing the military to take control of Rio for up to 10 months raises pertinent questions about the health of Brazil’s democracy some three decades after the end of the country’s military dictatorship: Since his announcement, there has been open worry in Rio and across Brazil that Temer’s military intervention could be a test run for more aggressive military involvement in policing and public security in the future.","And Temer’s escalation in policing is happening in a state with one of the deadliest police forces in a country with one of the world’s deadliest police forces. It’s folly, human rights groups and security experts say, to think the move will do anything but add to the bloodshed and put the lives and rights of Rio’s poorest and most vulnerable residents at even greater risk.","“It is the equivalent of a public-policy ‘Hail Mary,’ and the results are far from certain,” said Dr. Robert Muggah, a co-founder of the Igarapé Institute, a Rio-based public security think tank. “There is a real danger of militarizing public security in Rio de Janeiro even further.”","In 2016, Brazil law enforcement killed more than 4,200 people. Rio’s police, meanwhile, are among the deadliest even by the country’s standards. Police there killed 925 people in 2016, a 43 percent increase from the year prior, and an amount roughly equal to the number of people killed by police in the U.S. in the same year, even though the American population is nearly 20 times larger than the Rio state’s. The number of people killed by police in Rio likely topped 1,000 for 2017.","The violence has taken a toll on police officers, too. In 2016, more than 400 officers died on duty across Brazil, and police deaths rose 34 percent, to 132, in Rio state. But the vast majority of the victims of violent crime and homicide in Rio and across Brazil ― both by police and otherwise ― are not Carnival-going tourists or middle-class people, but the poor and mostly black residents of favelas, the informal, impoverished neighborhoods that have suffered decades of government neglect and are often controlled by drug gangs. Black Brazilians are 23.5 percent more likely to die in homicides than members of other racial groups, and more than three-quarters of the victims of police killings in 2016 were black.","Sending in a military that has little training in urban policing and virtually no time to plan for the complexities of Rio and its favela neighborhoods may only exacerbate those problems, human rights groups warn.","“The decision of the federal government to intervene in the state of Rio de Janeiro´s public security ... reinforces mistakes that have already been made in the past,” Jurema Werneck, the executive director of Amnesty International Brazil, said in a statement. “Rio de Janeiro state has already experienced actions of the Army, none of which have reduced homicides and aggravated human rights violations. The possible 10 months [of] federal intervention puts at risk mainly the lives of those living in the favelas and peripheries, [especially] black youth.”","The military has indeed proven unable to bring such areas under police control in previous, less-sweeping interventions.","In June 2015, the Brazilian army ended a 14-month occupation of the Complexo da Maré ― a sprawling favela network that is home to an estimated 140,000 people ― having done almost nothing to root out the drug gang that controls it or to curb the violence that plagues the daily lives of its residents. And last year, the military helped Rio police lock down Rocinha ― the largest of Brazil’s favelas ― after a sustained period of shootouts between police and rival drug gangs. The army left two weeks later with Rocinha still ringing with gunfire.","That has led to widespread opposition from favela residents and organizations that work within the neighborhoods. Over the weekend, they started an opposition campaign on social media that branded the intervention “a farce.”","“In our history, we’ve had one soldier for every 55 inhabitants, but we never had a doctor or a teacher for every 55 inhabitants,” said Gizele Martins, a journalist and community activist in the Maré favela. “We suffer with war tanks at our doorstep. Imagine having your house being searched everyday. [We have] many cases where people get murdered.”","“Now Rio is suffering again with military intervention,” Martins added. “So we that live in the favelas and the peripheries of Rio are completely opposed [to military intervention], because we suffer more than everybody.”","The way to curb the violence, human rights groups and favela residents argue, is not further military intervention, but comprehensive policies that would provide resources like education, health care, infrastructure and economic opportunities that the neighborhoods have long lacked.","“The public security crisis is structural,” Werneck, of Amnesty International, said. “Its not by increasing the number of weapons, militarization nor the continuation of the ‘war on drugs’ that we’ll overcome it.”","Jean Wyllys, a Rio congressman from the leftist Socialism and Freedom Party, echoed that sentiment on Twitter.","“The attack on public safety problems goes far beyond a police organ,” Wyllys said. “It goes through urban policies, the reaffirmation of citizenship of the most vulnerable populations, change in drug policy, improvement in public education and the end of underemployment.”","Political leaders in both Rio and Brazil, though, have had little interest in such efforts. The last major initiative aimed at reducing crime in the favelas ― a program called “pacification,” originally launched in 2008 ― collapsed shortly after the Olympics thanks to budgetary shortfalls. Once intended to deliver major social programs and reforms to the favelas, the primary legacy of pacification was instead widespread police corruption, an increase in violence and homicides (including those committed by police), and the further stigmatization of favela residents as little more than poor criminals.","And since he assumed office after the impeachment of former President Dilma Rousseff in 2016, Temer has pushed austerity policies that have cut health, education and welfare programs that once helped many of Brazil’s poorest residents escape poverty. Rio state Gov. Luiz Fernando Pezão and Rio Mayor Marcelo Crivella, meanwhile, “have shown little interest or appetite in developing and implementing a serious public security agenda” amid the outbreaks in violence, Muggah said.","And so Rio gets what it got on Friday, a decision based not in responsible or meaningful public policy, but in politics.","Temer has spent the last year pushing an unpopular overhaul of Brazil’s public pension system, and some have speculated that he is using the military intervention as a political smokescreen to distract attention from that legislation while he plots a path forward on how to pass it.","Meanwhile, polls have shown that violence and public security are among the chief concerns of voters heading into general elections later this year, when Brazilians will choose Temer’s successor. Temer won’t be a candidate for president, but with approval ratings that have languished in the single digits for more than a year, the intervention is an opportunity to show that he and the parties within his governing coalition are willing to adopt the tough-on-crime stance many Brazilians say they want.","But Temer’s plan also carries substantial risk, even beyond the most immediate human rights concerns, by creating a political vacuum for those advocating for even more aggressive methods. Rio congressman Jair Bolsonaro, for instance, has emerged as a popular presidential candidate on a platform of giving Brazilian police more leeway to shoot and kill criminals. Bolsonaro, a former army parachutist who has previously praised Brazil’s military dictatorship, blasted Temer’s intervention plan, suggesting that the military likewise won’t have enough latitude to conduct the sort of all-out war he believes the country needs to wage.","“Everyone says we’re at war. Rio is at war. But what kind of war can only one side fire?” Bolsonaro asked in an interview with a Brazilian web site, suggesting again that the police and military need more impunity to shoot and kill.","Polling in recent years has also shown increasing support for the idea of returning to military rule — a 2015 poll showed that 47.6 percent of Brazilians saw a military intervention as justifiable under certain circumstances of major governmental corruption, and support for democracy is among the lowest in the region — and Bolsonaro’s star continues to rise in pre-election surveys, largely on the back of his public security platform. So if Temer’s plan fails to reduce the violence, as it most likely will, the continued lack of a true strategy could further exacerbate the problem and the risk to the lives and human rights of poor, black Brazilians like those that populate Rio’s most dangerous areas.","“Putting the army in charge may win some votes in the short term,” Muggah said. “But the potential long-term consequences are exceedingly dangerous.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8c72d62000008806eaf70c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"WORLD NEWS","headline":"KFC Closes More Than Half Of Its UK Restaurants After Chicken Shortage","authors":"Nina Golgowski","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kfc-facing-chicken-shortage-uk_us_5a8c2490e4b0a1d0e12d2fd3","short_description":"As of Tuesday, 646 of the fast-food chain’s restaurants remain closed -- and people aren't taking it well.","date":"2018-02-20"},"articleContent":["KFC restaurants in the United Kingdom are facing an unprecedented problem: not enough chicken.","The shortage, which was blamed on delivery issues, has forced KFC to close more than half of its 900 British restaurants, leaving some of its customers clucking mad ― with some apparently even calling the police.","As of late Tuesday morning, 646 of the fast-food chain’s restaurants remained closed after its delivery contractor failed to make good on its orders, the BBC reported.","“The chicken crossed the road, just not to our restaurants,” KFC said on Twitter. “We’ve brought a new delivery partner onboard, but they’ve had a couple of teething problems ― getting fresh chicken out to 900 restaurants across the country is pretty complex!”","DHL reportedly took over responsibility for delivering chicken for the restaurant last week.

Modeling her “Against All” campaign on Trump’s anti-establishment politics, the 36-year-old socialite is a unique voice in Russia’s election season. Unlike Trump, however, she won’t come anywhere close to winning the presidency.","Putin, who doesn’t have to worry about criticism in Russia’s state-run media, enjoys remarkably high approval ratings. His victory is essentially a foregone conclusion. So why has Sobchak bothered to challenge him? In an election where nothing seems left to chance, the true goals of her candidacy have given analysts and pundits something to talk about.","Kremlin Ties","Russian opposition figures suspect Sobchak’s presidential bid is part of a thinly veiled Kremlin plot that serves three main purposes: to reduce voter apathy, divide support for Putin’s other opponents, and foster the illusion of a free and democratic election in a country plagued by widespread allegations of political corruption.","The TV anchor, journalist and actress is a household name in Russia, having risen to fame in 2004 as a reality show host. She has known Putin since she was a child ― he even attended her baptism ― but she has publicly opposed his rule for years.","Her father, Anatoly Sobchak, was Putin’s mentor. In 1999, after Sobchak came under investigation for the alleged misuse of funds during his time as mayor of St. Petersburg, then-Prime Minister Putin helped him return from exile. Sobchak died suddenly the following year, when his daughter was still a teenager, and Putin wept at his funeral.","The close ties between Ksenia Sobchak and Putin have led analysts to question her opposition credentials. Her candidacy is merely “a Kremlin-managed opportunity, simply to undermine [Putin’s rivals], and more to the point, to try to create some degree of excitement around the election,” according to Mark Galeotti, a senior researcher at the Institute of International Relations Prague.","“That’s pretty obvious,” Galeotti said in a video for The Moscow Times. “This is all an attempt to increase the turnout rate and increase the sense that this is a genuinely legitimate election.”","But Sobchak and Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov have fiercely denied such claims. She maintains that she simply wants to present a liberal alternative to the incumbent, although she believes the vote is already rigged in his favor.","“These elections, to my mind, are a kind of fake elections. They are not real. You can’t win in a casino — the casino always wins. In the same way, Putin always wins,” Sobchak told NPR during a visit to Washington this month.","The Alternative To The Alternative","Putin became Russia’s prime minister in 1999 and then first won the presidency in 2000, serving in that post until 2008. After four more years as prime minister, he was again elected president in 2012.","Sobchak told NPR she thinks Putin has not interfered with her candidacy ― as he is accused of doing to other presidential hopefuls ― because she appears to present less of a threat.","“I think Putin maybe underestimates me. Or he’s less afraid of me than, let’s say for example, [political activist] Alexei Navalny,” she said. “But that’s good for me, and that’s good for [the] opposition, because it gives us a chance to squeeze through all those restrictions.”","Navalny, perhaps the Russian president’s most vocal critic, was barred from registering as a candidate in this election because of a previous conviction in a fraud case, which itself was widely viewed as a move by Moscow to prevent him from running. But Navalny is not going quietly ― he is urging Russians across the country to boycott the vote in protest.","Over the years, Navalny has been jailed repeatedly for organizing public rallies. Now, rather than instructing his supporters to back Sobchak, the 41-year-old has lambasted her candidacy, saying in a YouTube video last year that Putin and his supporters “need a cartoonish liberal candidate at a time when they don’t want to allow me to enter the race.”","Eyes On The Prize","Sobchak will not win the presidency this year, but her campaign could boost her legitimacy in future runs for office. She told NPR that after the March 18 election, she plans to set her sights on a seat in the Russian Parliament. Russia observers suspect she could be positioning herself to run for president again in 2024 ― when Putin, who will be 72, will be constitutionally barred from seeking another consecutive term.","“We have to work hard for those six years to make [Putin] really go away and give his powers to a compromise figure between [the] opposition and his rule,” Sobchak told BuzzFeed this month. “I think that’s the only peaceful option ... but that’s a realistic option.”","With his ironclad grip on power, however, what incentive would Putin have to allow Sobchak to become his successor?","“The answer is simple,” according to New Yorker writer Masha Gessen, who has authored several books about Russia and Putin, and has reported on Sobchak for years. “[Putin] could trust [Sobchak] to protect him from prosecution the way that he once protected her father,” Gessen wrote recently, adding that it’s also possible that Putin might “try to stay in office indefinitely.”","Others like Paul Christensen, an expert in Russian domestic politics and a political science professor at Boston College, doubt that Sobchak would have a chance even in 2024.","“Unless something fundamental changes in the way Russian politics works, I don’t see that happening. ...

However, the educators working with these students are still overwhelmingly white and female. President Donald Trump’s immigration policies may only make this problem worse ― especially for Latinx students and teachers.","Latinx students are the largest ethnic minority in our nation’s schools, making up about a quarter of all students in kindergarten through 12th grade. On the other hand, less than 8 percent of the nation’s teachers identify as Latinx.","This problem is especially severe in certain states, per new data from the left-leaning Center for American Progress. In states such as California, about half of the school students are Latinx, yet there is a gap of more than 36 percentage points between the numbers of Latinx students and teachers.

Trump has rescinded DACA but given Congress a deadline to “fix” the program. So far, however, he has put obstacles in the path of several efforts to spare it.","And as the president generally maintains a contentious relationship with the nation’s immigrant and Latinx communities, teachers who understand these issues can be an important resource for students. Bilingual Latinx teachers could also play a key role in helping English language learners.","It’s an issue that has grown in urgency as teachers report watching their immigrant students experience increasing difficulty engaging in school amid what appears to be a more hostile national climate.","“Teacher diversity in general is an issue. The problems we face to attract Latino teachers has its own separate sphere of problems,” said Sarah Shapiro, a research assistant at the Center for American Progress who worked on the brief.","The Center for American Progress found that 40 of 41 states with available data had a Latinx student and teacher diversity gap.","“I’m hoping that in the coming years, people will begin to see DACA-mented teachers as the embodiment of the American dream.

It follows 16-year-old Rhiannon (played by Angourie Rice), whose life takes an unexpected turn when she falls in love with a mysterious soul known as A, who appears as a new person by inhabiting a different body each day.","In translating the book’s central conceit for the big screen, director Michael Sucsy cast 15 different actors in the role of A, allowing the character to appear as male, female and transgender over the course of the film, which opens Friday.","Paranormal circumstances aside, A and Rhiannon face the same challenges as most young, real-life couples. Both must let themselves be seen for who they are, and not be defined by what others think of them as, in order to experience true love.","Levithan, whose list of works include 2003’s Boy Meets Boy and 2013’s Two Boys Kissing, spoke with HuffPost about bringing his “extremely queer” story to the big screen, and shared his current picks for the best LGBTQ-inclusive books for young readers.","As an author, your creative job is done when the book gets published. What was your reaction to seeing your work on the big screen?","Levithan: It’s one thing as a novelist to describe a character in all these different bodies, but it’s another to actually see all these actors bring that character to life so seamlessly. It was extraordinary to see that conceit carried through so beautifully in the film.","The director, Michael Sucsy, encouraged the cast to read the entire script and not just their part. They had to understand who A was in all of the scenes in order to do their own scenes. There was a very concerted effort to make sure everybody knew each part of the character.","Below: Ian Alexander, who identifies as trans, is one of 15 actors to portray A.","Many of your books have dealt with LGBTQ themes. To what extent do you consider ‘Every Day’ to be a queer story?","I think it’s an extremely queer story. It’s about self-definition. It’s certainly about being agender, as well as aracial ― A’s name is a nod to that, in fact. A’s sensibility is, hopefully, something that’s very relatable to queer readers ― and to queer viewers now, too.","The ‘Every Day’ movie will introduce your work to a whole new audience. Who do you hope comes to see the movie?","One of the most amazing things about the book’s life, so far, is because of its paranormal conceit, a lot of people who would not otherwise gravitate toward a queer story come around to it. I hope the movie has that effect, too. I’d love young queer viewers to see themselves in it the same way that young queer readers have seen themselves in my book. I hope non-queer viewers will start to question the notion of gender and how we’re defined by our bodies after seeing the movie, too.","When you first wrote Boy Meets Boy in 2003, queer books for young readers were rare. Since then, a number of LGBTQ authors have emerged and written books specifically for young audiences. Which are your favorites?","I love so many of them! Will Walton has a book coming out this summer that I edited called I Felt a Funeral, in My Brain, which is this incredible prose-poetry novel about grief, loss and having an alcoholic mother. It’s unlike anything I’ve read before. It has a queer sensibility, but it’s not about being queer.","I think Billy Merrell’s Vanilla, which is about two boys who’ve been dating since eighth grade who get to their high school years and sex comes into the equation and throws them off, is brilliant. Probably my favorite queer book of the past couple years is Nina LaCour’s We Are Okay, which just won the [Michael L. Printz Award for Excellence in Young Adult Literature]. That was astonishing ― to see a queer book get the biggest young adult literature prize.","As a queer author, do you feel any responsibility to present the LGBTQ community in any specific way through your work?","Only realistically. I don’t think queer authors have to write queer stories, and I certainly don’t think queer writers have to write queer stories a certain way. For me, it’s all about trying to find aspects [of queer life] that haven’t been talked about and trying to reach young queer readers while making sure readers [who don’t identify as LGBTQ] feel welcome in my stories as well.","“Every Day” hits theaters Feb. 23.","This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8b92472100003800601b44.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Adam Rippon Loved Sally Field's 'Bold' Matchmaking Attempt","authors":"Elyse Wanshel","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/adam-rippon-sally-field-matchmaking-bold_us_5a8c6c2ce4b0273053a55048","short_description":"And the Olympic skater sent a sweet message to the actress’ son.","date":"2018-02-20"},"articleContent":["Olympic figure skater Adam Rippon responded to actress Sally Field’s earnest effort to make him her future son-in-law with surprise and admiration.","And he said he finds her matchmaking attempt pretty “bold.”","The Oscar-winning actress on Friday attempted to set up her son, Sam Greisman, with the popular American athlete, retweeting a text-message conversation between her and Greisman in which he admitted a crush on Rippon.

Insiders told SCNG that it’s somewhat common for coaches to have sexual relationships with their athletes, leading some to marry the swimmers they once coached.","Her accusation also comes on the heels of the recent USA Gymnastics sexual abuse scandal involving former team doctor and convicted pedophile Larry Nassar, and similarly argues that people in power only cared about winning and safeguarding the sport’s image, thus protecting and enabling an abuser.","Kukors spoke to HuffPost about what it’s been like to come forward with her story and the next steps in her fight against sexual abuse.","What has it been like to come forward with your story?","I didn’t realize until I hit “send” and we posted my story that every single word was therapy for me. My therapist has been asking me for months to start writing, and it was amazing what happened when I finally just sat down and let everything flow out onto the paper. The wave of emotions that I’ve gone through since then have been a lot ― in some ways, I’ve never felt more empowered and supported, and in other ways, I’ve never felt more vulnerable in my entire life, just spilling the darkest parts of myself in public.","I told myself if I’m going to go public with this, if I’m going to share, I have to go all in. I don’t even know what that looks like still. There’s no handbook to really understand how to do all of this.","I think my biggest thing right now is to just honor the truth of where I’m at. I keep telling people, I’m like, “I’m taking my life minute by minute right now.” Today, this morning, I got up and I went to a yoga class. I was so proud of myself for doing that because I’ve not been able to work out in few weeks. As silly as that sounds, but just being able to honor my truths and understand where I’m at with that process.","What do you hope people take away from your story?","The next phase is to really talk about grooming and talk about these sexual predators, and hopefully open up dialogue. My hope is to start to have conversations about how can we spot these signs of grooming, these signs of sexual abuse, before it’s too late.","I’ve received so many messages from parents who say we’ve talked about so many different things with their children, but this creates a whole new set of dialogue to understand what interactions are like between kids and adult figures in their life. What happens when somebody that you trust and that everyone in your family, in your community, trusts ― and that person betrays your trust right under your watch?","In my story, I wrote about Sean’s handshakes, how he made every athlete shake his hand after practice, and how that was part of his grooming process. I think a lot of people have been like, “Wait, handshakes are bad?” The thing I want to clarify is a handshake isn’t bad, but it’s the repetition of that when the person on the other end of the handshake is a predator, and they’re trying to gain your trust. They’re trying to make sure they’re looking at you in the eye, and you’re becoming even more comfortable with that interaction. My point in saying that is just to be able to be aware of everything and how these simple daily gestures can be abused and taken advantage of. I think it’s important to know.","What was it like for you, as an Olympic athlete, to see fellow Olympians Aly Raisman, McKayla Maroney, Gabby Douglas and more come forward with allegations of abuse against former USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar?","It was inspiring in so many ways to see. I could not take my eyes off the victim impact statements. I would just watch them hour by hour and was inspired; I was horrified and saddened beyond belief. But also, to watch these women stare at their abuser and speak their truth in their loudest voice for me was so important in every way. It continues to remind not only me, but so many others that it doesn’t matter what part of the journey you’re on. When you’re ready, you will be heard. You will have a voice. It doesn’t matter what part of the path you’re on, or what your name is.","Every single person has a story. Every single person has a voice, and through all of this, just watching them and just as a fellow abuse survivor, I’m just hoping that that was such a huge part of their healing process, because at the end of the day, that’s all we can hope for.","Nassar was a well-liked, respected and powerful figure within the gymnastics community. From what I’ve read, so was Hutchison. Do you think there are any similarities between your story and the stories of the Nassar survivors?","I don’t know if I can answer that specifically, other than when you have somebody who’s in place of power, my whole family respected Sean. My parents respected Sean and thought highly of him, and so, to have somebody like that who has worked with you from a young age, they program you and manipulate and control you in every way.","Not only was my personal life tied up with Sean, but my swimming career was, too. Looking back now, it’s been an incredibly hard process to try to unravel my swimming career from this man who controlled and programmed me.","The common thread that I keep seeing is somebody who is in power or the child looks up to. That’s why I think that one of my biggest hopes in this is just to create more dialogue. I’ve had so many parents who reached out, and I hope that parents continue to have dialogue with each other, that they’re watching what’s going on in the pool deck or the practice fields and talking to each other.","There’s so many times that I was in a hotel room by myself with Sean, just me and him behind a closed door. People knew this. The conversation was, “Ari’s the favorite,” or “Ari’s on the path to the Olympics.” My answer to that is let’s create dialogue, because at no point is that ever acceptable, no matter what part of your journey you’re on.","Have you been watching the Winter Olympics?","Yea, I’ve been able to tune into some of the events. I love ice dancing. That’s one of my favorites.","We’ve heard about the systemic problem of sexual abuse in a lot of Olympic sports, ones where kids start at a young age and basically give up their childhoods to become elite athletes. What has it been like, as a survivor, watching the Winter Olympics now?","I was watching ice dancing last night, and I’m so in awe of them. I have so much respect for these people who have sacrificed so much. Obviously, a thing like the Olympics is so close to my heart, but I think the same could be said for every industry where you have to sacrifice a lot.","My husband and I love to take in great music, and so I go to a concert, and I watch the pianist. I’m like, “Oh my gosh, the dedication that that person has had towards their craft.” Or a lot of the work that I’ve done in the last few years have been with high-level executives in corporations. I watch that, and I’m like, “Gosh, the sacrifice that they’ve made to really sharpen their tool.”","Then I look at so much that’s going on in the acting world today. I think the same could be said there, too. I have deep respect for people who are pushing the line day after day.","If you could say one thing to survivors of sexual assault who haven’t been able to speak out or are still struggling, what would it be?","I would tell them to hold onto their truth. And if they’re not at the place where they’re ready to vocalize it, I would just tell them that I see you, I feel you. I’m holding a space for you in my heart or in the public space. I’ve just found in the last week and a half that the next step in my healing was acknowledging what happened to me publicly, but I also have to pay respect to the fact that every single person is on their own journey.","When you come forward with your story, you want others to also speak up and validate your experience and Sean’s behavior. I’ve had so many people who have reached out privately, and the thing that I’ve really come to understand and respect is that every single person is on their own path of understanding.","I knew that I had to acknowledge what happened to me. I think the thing that I want people to know is that I am rooting for them so hard, and I’m lovingly holding a space of support and strength.","That’s the most important thing ― to respect the journey that you’re on, and show yourself some love if you can. I know how hard this is. I know how vulnerable you have to be. Just hold onto your truth with all your might.","This interview has been edited for clarity and length."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8c69a3210000eb06601c8d.jpeg?cache=BOZzQk3ZlV&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"EDUCATION","headline":"Company That Sells Bulletproof Gucci And Hermès Bags Sees Huge Sales In School Backpacks","authors":"Elise Solé, Yahoo Lifestyle","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/company-that-sells-bulletproof-gucci-and-herm%C3%A8s-bags-sees-huge-sales-in-school-backpacks_us_5a8c5017e4b0273053a52105","short_description":"The Florida school shooting that left 17 people dead has triggered a rise in the sales of bulletproof backpacks.

Curran became concerned about school security after the 1999 Columbine High School massacre in Littleton, Colo., during which teens Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed 13 students and injured 20 others.","But would be eight years and three more school shootings before Curran had the resources to go into business. “Virginia Tech was the final straw for me,” he tells Yahoo Lifestyle, referring to Virginia Polytechnic student Seung-Hui Cho, who killed 32 people on the Blacksburg, Va., campus before committing suicide in 2007. “I started asking local schools for their security plans in the event of armed intruders and there weren’t any concrete plans, so I wanted to promote the idea of kids protecting themselves.”","Bullet Blocker sells 11 backpacks, ranging in price from $210 to $490, including “My Child’s Pack,” a $199 sack (on sale from $210) weighing 2 pounds and available in pink or blue.","The latter looks like a standard school bag but it’s lined with knife-and-bulletproof material called Kevlar that’s approved by the National Institute of Justice, an organization that sets body armor standards for law enforcement. Specifically, the fabric “traps and slows down” bullets shot from a .357 Magnum, a .44 Magnum, a 9mm handgun, and a .45 caliber weapon.","“Recently, a woman in Hollywood, Calif., bought one for every child she knows, and the wife of a New England Patriots player ordered three for each of her children,” says Curran. “The idea is that kids can hold it up as a shield.”","The company has an in-house team that sews the bags from scratch and also retrofits existing bags, accessories such as notebooks, iPad cases, and three-ring binders, as well as clothing. For example, Curran recently outfitted a slew of Gucci products — a leather diaper bag for $3,100, a duffle bag for $4,250, and a zip-up jacket for $3,200 — a teal Hermès Evelyne III purse for $5,225, an Armani suit for $5,895, and a Saint Laurent moto jacket for $6,450.","Bullet Blocker is one of several companies specializing in bulletproof kidswear, including the Florida-based Guard Dog Security, which is donating 50 percent of its proceeds to the victims of the Parkland shooting, and a South Carolina outdoors company called Nichols Store, which sells bulletproof inserts and a class for parents on how to use them.","Curran acknowledges that his price point is high but says in the past, when parents couldn’t afford a backpack, “We took care of it.” He tells Yahoo Lifestyle, “I’m not getting rich doing this. But the peace of mind is huge.”","Read more from Yahoo Lifestyle:","Social media movement after Florida school shooting has students asking: #MeNext?\nWhat it’s like to be a nurse during a mass shooting: ‘What I saw was beyond anything I had to prepare for’\nWhy men are gaslighting this celeb for suggesting ‘boys are broken’ in the wake of Florida shooting","This post was originally published in Yahoo Lifestyle."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8c50952000003900eaf6dc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Chrissy Teigen Proves She Knows Almost Nothing About Her Husband’s Career","authors":"Elyse Wanshel","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chrissy-teigen-john-legend-ellen_us_5a8c3ff7e4b0f94c198eafba","short_description":"Ellen DeGeneres quizzed her about John Legend, and it... could have gone better.","date":"2018-02-20"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"WORLD NEWS","headline":"Richard Branson Wants To Build A High-Speed Hyperloop In India","authors":"Carol Kuruvilla","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/richard-branson-hyperloop-india_us_5a8b3afce4b0117adf70f7b2","short_description":"The proposed route between Mumbai and Pune could cut travel time from over three hours to 25 minutes.","date":"2018-02-20"},"articleContent":["British billionaire Richard Branson has announced plans to build a high-speed shuttle in India that could potentially revolutionize travel in the country.","The proposed hyperloop route between Mumbai and Pune, two major cities in the western state of Maharashtra, would reduce travel time from over three hours by train to just 25 minutes, according to a Virgin press release.","Branson, co-founder of the British multinational conglomerate, signed a preliminary agreement with Maharashtra’s government on Sunday, the Press Trust of India reports. The project will now undergo an extensive feasibility study.","“I believe Virgin Hyperloop One could have the same impact upon India in the 21st century as trains did in the 20th century,” Branson said in the press release. “The Pune-Mumbai route is an ideal first corridor as part of a national hyperloop network that will dramatically reduce travel times between most of India’s major cities to under two hours.”","The hyperloop will also connect passengers to the proposed Navi Mumbai International Airport, which is being built near Mumbai. Branson estimated that the shuttle would support 150 million passenger trips per year and “create a thriving, competitive megaregion.”","Entrepreneur Elon Musk first published a white paper outlining his vision for a vacuum-based, high-speed, underground shuttle system, or hyperloop, in 2013. Others picked up on the idea. Last October, Virgin partnered with Hyperloop One, a U.S. company attempting to build a full-system hyperloop.","The Virgin Hyperloop One project aims to “move people and things at airline speeds on the ground,” according to Virgin. Passengers and cargo would be loaded into pods, which would then be propelled through a low-pressure tube. Magnetic levitation would lift the pods above their tracks. Low aerodynamic drag would allow the pods to travel extraordinarily fast.","A functioning hyperloop would carry passengers at a top speed of 670 miles per hour, more than 10 times the speed of traditional rail services, according to a Virgin Hyperloop One frequently-asked-questions page. For passengers, it would feel like riding in a plane, the company claims.","In addition to India, the Virgin Hyperloop One team has been working on planned routes in the Middle East, Europe, Canada and the United States.

The “Shib Sibs,” who won the bronze medal at the Winter Olympics on Tuesday, also asked for some help from the band’s fiercely loyal fanbase, BTS Army, to get the gear to their beloved artists.","Fans flooded the duo with tips on how to reach BTS and send the Olympic hats. But Alex told People that they haven’t been able to get the hats to the band yet.","“We would like to get rid of them and give them to BTS. We really appreciate and respect their work that they do,” Alex said. “What they’ve done breaking through to Western pop culture is awesome.”","Alex explained to People that the love he and his sister share for the K-Pop stars comes from a personal place. He said he sees parallels between the sibs’ journey and that of BTS. In a way, he and his sister were “trailblazers” in Asian representation, as is the band, Alex said.","“We were the first ice dance team of Asian descent to win a medal in the Olympics, and so that was something that we’re really proud of.

The footage, published on news.com.au and assembled from about 200 videos recorded from 2012 to 2016, show multiple acts of hazing of male students from several dormitories.","Graphic videos show young men kneeling in front of older students and being made to drink alcohol poured along or atop genitalia. In other footage, published by news.com.au, students fitted with dog collars are made to drink from public dog bowls and have their heads crudely shaved. All the incidents take place during the day in public spaces.","Students also participate in binge-drinking competitions called “throwie cup,” in which the aim is to drink 24 beers in the fastest time ― and if a competitor throws up, he has to drink his own vomit to remain in the contest.","A former student, referred to only as Andrew, told news.com.au that each new student ― called a “fresher,” short for freshman ― is assigned to an older student.","″The returning student essentially treats their fresher like shit who internalises it all as a rite of passage: we treat you like shit and next year you get to treat someone else like shit. It’s a sick cycle,” Andrew said.","Nina Funnell, a member of the group End Rape on Campus Australia who published the news.com.au report, told the Hack radio program the rituals were dangerous. “I think it points to a pretty toxic culture where you have hypersexualised rituals meeting with alcohol at the same time. There is a lot of coercion, pressure and expectation of others, and it can be difficult for those who do want to say no. What we know is that this is not an isolated incident.”","Funnell added that the hazing happens “around the country ... this is a systemic problem that requires a systemic response.”","Other behavior at the university, captured on video, included students skateboarding naked in dormitory hallways and causing property damage. Older students were also shown bursting into the rooms of younger students and forcing them to drink alcohol, and images showed students being cling-wrapped to poles. None of the videos showed female students being hazed.","A University of Newcastle spokesperson told Fairfax they were “appalled” at the videos.","“The university takes all allegations of student misconduct seriously and acts swiftly to remove offensive behaviour from our campuses where it is reported,” the spokesperson told Fairfax. “Four years ago, the university took over additional management responsibilities of the residential colleges. Since that time, we have worked consistently to develop and implement targeted programs aimed at educating students and their support staff on the appropriate behaviours and our expectations of conduct in our community.","“As well as the education and preventative measures, students found to have behaved in this way are subject to severe penalties.”","Newcastle boasts on its website that its campus housing was “awarded the Asia Pacific Association for Student Housing award for Housing Operator of the Year in 2017 and Excellence in Student Experience in 2016.”","Australian universities, unlike those in America, do not have a fraternity or sorority culture. However, hazing rituals such as this ― often involving alcohol ― associated with university dormitories or amateur sporting teams are regularly uncovered in media coverage. The drinking age is 18 in Australia.","Other well-publicized hazing incidents have occurred in the emergency services and defense forces, which were investigated as part of a federal inquiry into child sexual abuse.","Extreme forms of hazing have been reported in the Australian navy, where cadets claimed they were raped by, or forced to rape, other new recruits, among other punishments.

But recently, he’s making people look at different foods with fresh eyes.","The restaurateur, best known as the founder of the Momofuku restaurant group, has been the champion of the #uglydelicious movement on social media since sometime in late 2016. He’s frequently posted photos of dishes ― many of which are ethnic cuisines ― that are not seen as aesthetically beautiful in the Western mainstream media, yet are absolutely, well, delicious. Chang has said that it’s a way to embrace foods like those home-cooked Korean foods he once found “uncool.”","The movement speaks to many Asian-Americans like myself, who grew up experiencing a tug between two cultures. So many of our childhood memories include trying to navigate between our sometimes secret love for our cultural foods while withstanding the contempt directed toward our immigrant families for our “weird” or “smelly” dishes.","#UglyDelicious is something that perfectly encapsulates that perpetual dichotomy. And it’s also a mark of unapologetic pride. Because damn, our food is delicious.","HuffPost recently sat down with the Chang, who’s gearing up for his new Netflix show, also titled “Ugly Delicious.” The show, which premiers on Feb. 23, explores the intersection of culture and food.","Chang talked to HuffPost about his connection to his Asian-American identity, what he learned while filming the series and also why kimchi ice cream should not be a thing.","Many of us grow up embarrassed about our ethnic foods but as we get older and learn more, we reclaim them and learn to embrace our identities. Has your perception of your family’s own Korean dishes changed over time?","Absolutely. That sentiment of being embarrassed about it and hiding it ― my story is not unique. The only thing that’s unique is that I’ve been given a platform to talk about it. It’s something that, from an Asian-American perspective, it’s important that these stories are told. I don’t know if these stories have been told, at least in a national media audience.","I’m 40 years old, and maybe it’s just the sheer passage of time, but I’m comfortable with this ― I’m not comfortable with being American, I’m not comfortable with being Korean, I’m OK with being something in between. This is what I like, and don’t tell me it’s not valid.","Have you also had that moment in the lunchroom during which you opened up your lunchbox and people gawked at your ethnic food or made fun of it?","Of course! Those are probably some of my most impressionable memories ― being vilified and made fun of and bullied for the food I was eating. It’s only natural I’m going to want to reject it as I grew up.","And there was a double standard. In my house, I loved it. Outside my house, I hated it.","So there’s been a lot of criticism from the Asian-American community toward non-Asians who are claiming our native foods or cuisines and labeling them as trendy and subsequently legitimizing them in a way. What’s your take on this?","Asian-American food, Asian food in general, is not the predominant food and it’s going to be widely misunderstood ... My viewpoints on it are changing. It’s about moving the conversation forward. If someone wants to talk about it, and promote it ― fine. All I ask is that it’s respectful. All I ask is that they pay tribute and understand it and [the food is] an homage to where it came from.","Do you think there’s a specific way to respectfully present kimchi, for example, from a white chef?","Yeah, I think people do it all the time. For me, my simple litmus test is ― if someone wants to make Korean food, great. Doesn’t mean they have to be Korean. But ... It’s like, hey, I’m not trying to make kimchi ice cream. [Laughs] It’s making a dish and using it in a way that’s going to be respectful of both cultures you’re trying to fuse together.","In the series, we see you and Ali Wong talking pho.

What’s your philosophy on that?","I think what Ali was saying is you can still have a very clean bathroom and have great pho but the point is, don’t lose sight on the food itself. “Rude” service at an Asian restaurant might not mean it’s rude service. It might not just be Western service ― it’s about looking at it in a different light. If you’re looking at things from a Eurocentric point of view, it’s going to look “weird.”","The series explores the cultures behind the food. But did you feel closer to your own culture as you were filming the series? Or did you learn more about yourself?","I think what changed was I tried to be more respectful and more empathetic and know that many of the things that I believe might be wrong.","My viewpoints, for instance, on New Orleans have changed. One of the episodes deals with shrimp and crawfish in Houston and New Orleans. It uses shrimp as a vehicle to talk about change and respect and tradition. New Orleans is centuries old and part of the reason why people go there is the French Quarter and history and lineage. It has to carry this old beautiful tradition that Houston doesn’t. Houston can do whatever it wants.\n\nWhen I initially finished the show I was thinking, “Houston to me is a better food town. It’s more interesting.” But for a lot of reasons, Houston is not beholden to history like New Orleans is ... Because I’m not from New Orleans, I don’t know what that’s like but for some chefs born and raised in New Orleans. That’s a burden they have to carry that I can never understand. I can’t be like, “Hey New Orleans, move faster.” Because they can’t. They have to be respectful. It’s wrong for me to be like, “New Orleans isn’t as good as Houston.”","What do you think Asian-American chefs are doing right, or what mistakes are they making? Do you have any advice?","My advice to Asian-American chefs is to find your own voice; find your own path. Because that can be a multitude of things. Don’t think it’s just one thing.","This interview has been edited for clarity and length."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8c7433210000eb06601c9b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Why ‘Cloud Seeding’ Is Increasingly Attractive To The Thirsty West","authors":"Stateline, Editorial Partner","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-cloud-seeding-is-increasingly-attractive-to-the_us_5a8c3acbe4b02f4fc98dbbea","short_description":"Eight states have active cloud seeding programs, and many districts in arid areas view the technology as an important tool.","date":"2018-02-20"},"articleContent":["By Sophie Quinton","CHEYENNE, Wyo. — Machines that prod clouds to make snow may sound like something out of an old science fiction movie. But worsening water scarcity, combined with new proof that “cloud seeding” actually works, is spurring more states, counties, water districts and power companies across the thirsty West to use the strategy.","Last month, a study funded by the National Science Foundation proved for the first time that the technology works in nature. That study, combined with other recent research, has helped make cloud seeding an attractive option for officials and companies desperate to increase the amount of water in rivers and reservoirs.","In Colorado alone, more than a hundred cloud seeding machines are set up in mountainside backyards, fields and meadows. Some older versions of the contraptions look like a large tin can perched on top of a propane tank. New ones are large metal boxes festooned with solar panels, weather sensors and a slim tower.","Their goal is the same: to “seed” clouds with particles of silver iodide, a compound that freezing water vapor easily attaches to. That makes ice crystals, which eventually become snowflakes.","Colorado’s $1 million a year program has been around since the 1970s and is paid for not just by the state, ski resorts, and local water users but also water districts as far away as Los Angeles that want to increase snowmelt into the Colorado River, which sustains over 30 million people across the Southwest. Currently, most of the river basin is experiencing a drought.","“Everyone starts to get nervous when there’s no snow in Colorado,” said Joe Busto, the scientist who oversees Colorado’s cloud seeding program.","Major urban water districts in Arizona, California and Nevada have funded cloud seeding in the Rocky Mountains for over 10 years and are now close to signing an agreement with officials in Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming to split the cost of nine more years of seeding.","Cloud seeding is a relatively cheap tool for bulking up the water supply in Lake Mead and other reservoirs, said Mohammed Mahmoud, a senior policy analyst for the Central Arizona Water Conservation District. The up to $500,000 annual commitment the district is making to the regional agreement comprises a tiny fraction of its budget, he said.","Yet it’s hard to tell how much additional precipitation cloud seeding creates or how much additional snow or rain eventually makes it into city water pipes. Cloud seeding only works when there are freezing, moist clouds in the air. And the technology can be controversial.","“The whole thing is propaganda,” said Jamie Kouba, 32, a farmer from Regent, North Dakota, who argues that cloud seeding is decreasing rainfall in his area, rather than increasing it. He’s organizing local farmers in a campaign against the practice.","A 20th Century Technology","Scientists discovered in the 1940s that certain molecules make a good foundation for snow. In one famous experiment, a chemist made it snow by dumping six pounds of dry ice out of an airplane over western Massachusetts.","It didn’t take long for states, localities and ski resorts to start experimenting. Colorado’s Vail ski area began cloud seeding in the 1970s, for instance. Today California, Idaho, Nevada, Utah and Wyoming have winter cloud seeding programs, and Texas and North Dakota have summer programs, which aim to increase rain and decrease hail.","Cloud seeding machines are nothing like the “snow guns” used to blast water over ski slopes. Instead, when they’re turned on they generate smoke that floats into the air like incense. Some state programs rely on ground-based machines. Others use airplanes to drop flares that generate silver iodide smoke into clouds, or to fly into a storm with flares strapped to their wings.","The January National Science Foundation-funded study, which was conducted in Idaho, was the first to show real-world observations of silver iodide forming ice crystals inside clouds and falling out as precipitation.","Such research has increased interest in cloud seeding, particularly among private companies and utilities, said Neil Brackin, president of Weather Modification Inc., a North Dakota company that does cloud seeding. “We’re able to now really demonstrate the technology, and they can see it’s not something conceptual that works in a lab — it’s measurable.”","Other recent studies have used computer modeling to estimate the increase in snowfall from cloud seeding. A 2014 study across two Wyoming mountain ranges found that cloud seeding could increase snowfall by 5 to 15 percent — but only when the right conditions for seeding were met, or during 30 percent of snow events.","Relatively small increases still matter. “People in the western United States — we’re always water-stressed out here,” said Frank McDonough, an atmospheric scientist in Nevada who oversees the cloud seeding program at the Desert Research Institute, part of the state university system. Along the Colorado River, more water is promised to people than is available.","Nevada’s cloud seeding program can increase the snowpack by up to 10 percent, McDonough said.","That translates into 80,000 more acre-feet a year of water, enough to sustain about 150,000 households.","Still, he said, cloud seeding programs are difficult to evaluate. “Ten percent of additional snowfall is within the natural variation of storms.”","Although it’s hard for scientists to gauge the effectiveness of cloud seeding, many water districts are willing to take a chance on the technology because cloud seeding is relatively cheap.","Idaho Power, which serves customers in Idaho and Oregon, has been using cloud seeding to boost the volume of water moving through its hydroelectric dams since 2003. The company’s representatives say the $3 million seeding program they oversee — which is partly funded by the state and other water users — generates billions of gallons of additional water for much less than 1 percent of the company’s operational budget.","“When you do the math, it turns out to be about $3.50 per acre-foot,” said Shaun Parkinson, water resources leader at Idaho Power. Renting water through a water supply bank — another way for irrigators to access more water — costs $17-21 an acre-foot, he said.","As the technology advances, cloud seeding could get even better results. In Colorado, Busto is adding more remote-controlled generators that can be driven high on a mountain, closer to clouds, and left there all winter. Currently, most cloud seeding machines in the state are installed on private property and manually operated by homeowners and farmers who are paid to turn them on when a storm comes.","Still, Busto warns that cloud seeding isn’t a cure for drought. Take this winter, which has been too warm and too dry for seeding. “We have not been able to run our cloud seeding machines because there’s been no storms coming through,” he said; the machines have only run a handful of times so far.","Challenges Remain","State lawmakers can be reluctant to spend money on cloud seeding technology, particularly during tight budget years.","Wyoming’s Legislature, for instance, put about $120,000 to $160,000 into the state’s cloud seeding program each year since it started in 2005. But now the state is running a deficit, and lawmakers want to cut next year’s funding to $80,000.","At a recent meeting at the Wyoming Water Development Office in Cheyenne, state engineer Patrick Tyrrell told cloud seeding company representatives and state and local officials from around the region that his team hasn’t yet found local funders, such as ski resorts, to step in to help pay for the program.","Kansas’ cloud seeding program has dwindled almost to nothing since the 1970s because of budget cuts. Nevada’s Legislature eliminated funding for cloud seeding during the 2008 budget shortfall, McDonough said. Lawmakers voted last year to resume funding.","Cloud seeding can also face public opposition. State officials who manage the programs are used to explaining the science to lawmakers, their governing boards, reporters and concerned citizens.","“Most people don’t understand the science very well, and they don’t understand who’s doing what and where,” Busto said. It’s easy to find websites and online videos dedicated to conspiracy theories, such as that cloud seeding caused last year’s hurricane and flooding in Houston, or that cloud seeding is part of a government plot that will inevitably poison all life on Earth.","Busto said he has been confronted by people who are worried that exposure to silver iodide will make them sick. But silver is a naturally occurring element that is not inherently harmful, he said. In the 2014 Wyoming study, scientists found that seeding added some silver iodide to the surrounding water and soil but far too little to pose a known threat to human health.","North Dakota’s Kouba is one of the skeptics. He has compiled state rainfall data going back to the 1970s and concluded that cloud seeding has decreased rainfall, particularly in counties that are downwind of seeding operations. “I’m in a downwind county, and we have lost considerably,” he said.","Last summer, when a drought seized western North Dakota, Kouba circulated a petition asking the Hettinger County Commission to file an injunction against a nearby county to stop cloud seeding there. He managed to get about half the county to sign on, he said. Recently, he presented his rainfall data to the state water commission.","North Dakota officials say there’s no evidence that cloud seeding caused last year’s drought. If anything, cloud seeding in one place leads to more precipitation downwind, not less, said Darin Langerud, who oversees cloud seeding for the North Dakota Atmospheric Resource Board.","Busto said actual science fiction — such as “Geostorm,” a 2017 movie about malfunctioning climate control satellites — fuels misperceptions about what states are really trying to do.","“Every time something like that comes out it feeds more conspiracy theories,” he said. “I’m just trying to make more snowflakes at a ski resort.”","Stateline home page","Sign up for exclusive state policy reporting and research"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8c3b522000003300eaf691.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Plot Twist: M. Night Shyamalan Probably Wanted To Stop Doing Plot Twists","authors":"Bill Bradley","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/plot-twist-m-night-shyamalan-james-newton-howard_us_5a6644eee4b0dc592a0b90a9","short_description":"Composer James Newton Howard talks 30 years of making music for movies.","date":"2018-02-20"},"articleContent":["Spoiler alert: Bruce Willis was dead the whole time.","It’s been almost 20 years, and it still feels weird to talk about the plot twist from “The Sixth Sense.” At least we waited two decades to ruin the movie for you. Meanwhile, the movie’s composer, James Newton Howard, didn’t even wait two minutes.","During a phone conversation with HuffPost, Howard recalled how one of the songs he included on the “Sixth Sense” soundtrack, which was released at the same time as the movie, was called “Malcolm Is Dead.” As you can tell, it pretty clearly stated that Bruce Willis’ character, Malcolm, was, in fact, dead.","“[Director M. Night Shyamalan] called me up kind of comically hysterical, saying, ‘James, you gave away the secret of the movie. You can’t say “Malcolm Is Dead!”’ But, of course, by the time the whole thing was out, we were laughing about it.”","Despite the soundtrack giveaway, Shyamalan’s unexpected ending helped launch his career. Malcolm’s big moment is still listed among the greatest surprises in movie history, and that, along with subsequent films, earned Shyamalan a reputation for delivering a well-executed plot twist. There’s even a “South Park” parody to prove it.","But all of that success seemed to lead up to the biggest twist of all.","Howard, a longtime collaborator who’s composed on nearly all of Shyamalan’s movies, said that he believes “The Sixth Sense” weighed on Shyamalan’s shoulders, so much so that the director became wary of his reputation for surprises.","“I think, in a way, for Night, that the success of that ‘Sixth Sense’ moment was so profound that it almost became such an expectation on the part of the audience that he was going to do that every time,” he said. “Night’s first consideration is storytelling, and he’s a great storyteller, but I think he felt the burden of that ... as some kind of identification that he was going to sort of have to bear for the rest of his entire career.”","“Often times, I think he wanted to get away from that,” he added, “and people didn’t like it. He tried to get away from it. They always wanted him to do a certain kind of thing.”","Though Shyamalan’s recent films — “Split” and “The Visit” — have been critical and commercial successes, the director also produced a string of twisty movies in the mid-2000s, including the abhorred psychological, uh, tree thriller, “The Happening,” that made critics and audiences wonder, “What’s happening?”","The movies make a little more sense now when you consider Shyamalan might have been reluctant to deliver them to audiences in the first place. (Reps for the director did not immediately return a request for comment.)","But if he did want to abandon the storytelling technique that made him famous, Shyamalan hasn’t done a very good job of that. Long after “Sixth Sense,” most of the director’s films still end in some kind of twist.","Being pigeonholed isn’t really something Howard himself has had to deal with. Over the course of his more than 30-year career, he’s amassed an eclectic archive of films, composing for “The Fugitive” and “The Dark Knight” ― even “Space Jam.”","The composer spoke with HuffPost about his past projects and condensing his musical catalog down to a multi-hour concert, which he toured across Europe late last year. There, audiences were treated to Howard’s music as well as movie clips and anecdotes from his three decades in film.","How’d you fit 30 years of music into one concert?","I was trying to balance things that I thought people would want to hear — would expect to hear — with music that I thought was perhaps worth hearing that they hadn’t heard. That was kind of what my goal was. And I guess I succeeded. They really received it so enthusiastically. I was quite moved, but it was very difficult because I have 130-some movies to pick from.","How’d you decide what stories and songs made the cut?","I could bore you for hours with all kinds of intrigue and funny things that happened.","I mean, bore away.","Collaborations are, by nature, complicated ― and whether it was on movies where I was on the verge of being fired, or I wanted to be fired and other people got fired. Just the nature of it was one of those things, there tends to be a lot of drama surrounding it. I try to stay clear of it and focused on the music, but it can get pretty extreme when you have studios making hundreds of millions of dollar investments and directors who are not in line with what the studios are feeling, but I’m really on the director’s side. I’m sort of really trying to be a mediator. It’s an adventure each time you step out on one of those things.","Speaking about possibly being fired, I know you’ve talked before about how stressful it was working on “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.” Was that a project you were worried about being taken off of?","No, I didn’t think I was going to be taken off, because I had written 80 percent of the score, which they loved. What I wanted to avoid was having “Hedwig’s Theme” be the main theme now for “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,” because that would make it bad, storytelling-wise. Because this story takes place 75 years before Harry’s even born, so how does “Hedwig” ― he’s not in the movie ― how does he figure?","I wanted to kick John Williams’ theme out the door. Nobody admires John Williams music more than me. I think he’s the greatest who ever did it, but one of my goals of doing that movie was to hopefully end up branding my own theme. I think there’s always going to be a little bit of “Hedwig’s Theme” in there somewhere, just as an homage to the fact that it’s in the “Harry Potter” universe, but the primary themes were definitely all new, which was very satisfying.","I’ve seen you say music is the final edit of a film. What music would you say changed a movie?","I think an interesting example is a couple years ago I did a movie called “Nightcrawler” with Dan Gilroy. In “Nightcrawler,“ Jake Gyllenhaal played a real psychopath nutcase. When I did my first pass on the movie, Dan said, “No, you’re playing it like he’s a psychopath.” I said, “Well, he is a psychopath.” He said, “Yeah, but he’s succeeding,” and he said, “I want you to do it from his point of view. I want you to pretend that this is your son and he’s achieving these things, and you’re proud of him.”","So I then turned around and wrote a score that was celebratory when he was arriving at a crash scene and moving bodies so he could get a better [photo] shot, which is a despicable thing to do. I was playing this kind of triumphant music, and it created a very strong dissonance. I think people were confused, but in the end really enjoyed that experience because it was unlike perhaps something they had seen before.","For the “Hunger Games” films, you worked on Jennifer Lawrence’s song, “The Hanging Tree,” which became huge. How did that happen?","It was [director Francis Lawrence’s] idea, I think. The lyric to that song appeared in the book, but there was never a melody. There was obviously, if you’re reading Suzanne Collins’ book, you’re reading, “Are you coming to the tree ... ” It was a nursery rhyme or something. Francis had the idea of contacting the guys in the Lumineers to write a melody, and then once he had a melody — and this is all going on unbeknownst to me — Francis said to Jennifer, “Can you sing this song?”","Francis then came to me and said, “James, can you turn this into an anthem or at least bring in harmony and give it some size and dimension ... so by the time it’s done, it reaches this big climax?” Which I did, so I wrote all the harmonies, and I did all the orchestration and kind of changed from the solo vocal to the version it became, and then the record company didn’t want to put it on the “Music Inspired By” album for some reason [...] they didn’t want Jennifer singing “The Hanging Tree.”","I said, “OK, wow, can I have it?” And they said, “Well, you better ask Jennifer,” so I contacted Jennifer through her agent, and Jennifer gave me permission to put that version on my album, my score album, with the one exception. She said, “You can have it as long as I never have to sing you that song as long as I live.” She didn’t enjoy singing. I don’t think she enjoys it even though she has a great voice. So I said, “Yeah, no problem. You certainly wont have to sing it again for me.” I took it and put it on my album and before you knew it, somebody put it on the radio, and it became this viral hit. But it was a complete accident.","What did you think when it took off?","It was fun. It was just hilarious. I felt wrong at first because it said, “‘The Hanging Tree’ by James Newton Howard.” What it should’ve said, and what it did say on the second release, was “‘The Hanging Tree’ by James Newton Howard featuring Jennifer Lawrence,” which they left out the first time. Jennifer, I don’t think, could’ve cared less, but I felt self-conscious about it, because it was obviously the two of us that made it happen.","Another movie you’ve done that has become more and more popular is “Space Jam.” What was it like looking back on it?","If you watch the old Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck cartoons, Warner Bros. cartoons, the music was extraordinary. It was very intricate, very fast and really inventive, and it was by this guy named Carl Stalling. Every time Tweety bird or the cat would tiptoe over ... it was really hard to do that virtuosic film writing. And so, when I got that movie, I thought that obviously that would have to happen. You need to speak in the vocabulary of the classic Warner Brothers cartoons, so I really had to learn. I had to take a Cliffs Notes class in Carl Stalling, and I found that a challenge. It was really, really hard writing that score. It was probably an hour and 45 minutes of very detailed, intricate music. It was hard, but it was fun.","[The film] has this kind of cult following ... my older son is 23. They grew up with that thing, too, and they all had “Space Jam” parties to get together and watch it.","One of the fun things of going on tour was these films have a life beyond their release, and people do really still enjoy them out there. In many cases, the music has really been a factor in their lives.","In terms of music that has had an impact on people’s lives, you also wrote the music for Harvey Dent in “The Dark Knight.”","I thought, for Harvey Dent, before he becomes the other character, that there was a nobility about expressing his character with brass, so I wrote a [Aaron] Copland-esque fanfare for him, and that really became his theme and of course that all changed and got very dark when he transformed into this other character. I was just portraying him as kind of a Western hero. I just thought that really worked. [Chris Nolan] liked the idea.","It was really nice, because all the orchestrations in “Batman Begins” and “The Dark Knight” are mostly kind of low, moody strings with that powerful French horn line. It was nice to kind of get up above middle C and write some music. It kind of felt like the sun had come out when we first met this character.","It’s interesting hearing that Harvey Dent was introduced like a Western hero. What are some things you would notice in your music ― unusual inspirations ― others wouldn’t?","Generally, it’s about tone. You’re trying to find ... I mean, I did the same kind of thing in a couple of Night’s movies. Think about “Unbreakable,” for instance. You had Bruce Willis, who, he’s a superhero and he doesn’t know it. When he acts in a heroic way, I presented him with a heroic theme, but in that case there was much more emotion attached to it because there was also the death of his wife, so there was a tragic side to it, and that’s my favorite kind of thing to do. I suppose that’s why I’m not as interested in doing superhero movies because I feel like they can be pretty one-dimensional, and they’re really fun. They’re great, but I tend to be more interested in complicated personalities where you can really play off of different aspects of who [the characters] are and highlight their weaknesses and their strengths.","You’re working on Disney’s “The Nutcracker.” What was it like adapting that music for a film?","My first idea is to use Tchaikovsky whenever possible. That’s No. 1. No. 2, to use Tchaikovsky in its purest form is not going to work in many cases in the movie as a storytelling device because you’re in a movie. You’re telling different stories, so in many cases Tchaikovsky has to be reorchestrated or restructured or just a small part of it, and then you add to it. The third part is just to make sure that the integrity of one of the greatest composers who ever lived is maintained to the greatest degree as possible.","It’s a very different story, because the funny thing about “The Nutcracker” is, if you watch “The Nutcracker,” there’s not a lot of story there. It’s not a story for a two-hour movie. Basically, a girl wakes up. The Nutcracker turns alive. There’s people dancing around, and then she wakes up, but there’s not a lot more to it than that. The music and the ballet are incredible works of art, but this is a different thing. This has been exploded into an adventure and a coming-of-age story and all kind of wonderful things. Tchaikovsky is ever-present, but I would say that it’s a good portion of original music that I’m trying to butt up against, in as graceful as possible way, to the other guy, Tchaikovsky.","This interview has been edited and condensed."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8ada712000003900eaf49a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Congressional Candidate Defends AR-15 Giveaway After School Shooting","authors":"David Moye","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kansas-candidate-ar15-gun-giveaway_us_5a8b6be2e4b0117adf710d9e","short_description":"Even a conservative talk radio host objects: \"Come on, man.

The challengers did not seek to invalidate the waiting period for everyone, just those who already owned guns and passed a background check.","Thomas scolded his colleagues.","“If a lower court treated another right so cavalierly, I have little doubt this court would intervene,” Thomas wrote. “But as evidenced by our continued inaction in this area, the Second Amendment is a disfavored right in this court.”","Thomas said he suspected the Supreme Court would readily hear cases involving potentially unconstitutional waiting periods if they involved abortion, racist publications or police traffic stops.","The Supreme Court has not taken up a major firearms case since issuing important gun rulings in 2008 and 2010 that established an individual right to own guns for self-defense.","‘EXTREME INTERPRETATION’","Gun control advocacy groups cheered Tuesday’s snub of the waiting period case.","“Once again the Supreme Court has refused to entertain the gun lobby’s extreme interpretation of the Second Amendment,” said Eric Tirschwell, litigation director for Everytown for Gun Safety, a group funded by billionaire businessman and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. “The courts are continuing to recognize that states have the authority to pass reasonable public safety laws to protect their citizens from gun violence.”","The states of California, Hawaii, Rhode Island, Illinois, Minnesota, Florida, Iowa, Maryland and New Jersey as well as Washington, D.C., have waiting periods that vary in duration and type of firearm, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.","The United States has among the world’s most lenient gun laws. With the U.S. Congress deeply divided over gun control, it has fallen to states and localities to impose firearms restrictions in recent years. Democratic-governed California has some of the broadest firearms measures of any state.","Mass shootings including one in which a gunman killed 17 people at a Parkland, Florida high school on Feb. 14 have added to the long-simmering U.S. debate over the availability of firearms.","Lead plaintiff Jeff Silvester, the Calguns Foundation and its executive director Brandon Combs, and the Second Amendment Foundation in 2011 challenged the 10-day waiting period between the purchase of a firearm and its actual delivery to the buyer.","Alan Gottlieb, founder of the Second Amendment Foundation, said in an interview he was disappointed with the decision. “The court should take these cases and give lower courts guidance because at the moment lower courts are all over the map on gun rights issues,” Gottlieb said.","The waiting period gives a gun buyer inclined to use it impulsively a “cooling off” period, which has been shown in studies to reduce handgun suicides and homicides, the state said in legal papers. The waiting period also gives officials time to run background checks and ensure that weapons being sold are not stolen or being purchased for someone prohibited from gun ownership, it added.","The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld California’s law in 2016, reversing a federal trial court that had ruled it unconstitutional.","(Reporting by Andrew Chung; Editing by Will Dunham)"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8c85da1e000017087ac4b7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"BLACK VOICES","headline":"R.

That includes pollution originating on land, like plastic bottles, shopping bags, crisp packets, cigarette lighters and cellophane wrappers.","But there is one great problem with international law: The commitments may be solemn and legally binding, but they are hard to uphold. There is no police force or prosecutor tasked with their enforcement. Only state parties to a treaty have the power to raise disputes against other parties, and they are generally reluctant to do so, for understandable reasons. They do not wish to disrupt harmonious diplomatic relations with their neighbors; they may fear the potential costs; and few governments are so perfect themselves as to have no worry of being at the receiving end of similar treatment.","As a result, states that disregard their legal obligations to protect the marine environment from ocean plastic and other assaults are not quaking in their boots. Even though they could in principle be hauled up before the International Tribunal of the Law of the Sea, which has the power to apply substantial penalties, costs and reparations against offending parties, they see no immediate prospect that his might actually happen. And they are almost certainly right.","That does not mean there is nothing to be done. On the contrary, naming and shaming is a powerful weapon for change. No government likes to be denounced for breaches of international law and other binding promises. Ocean plastic campaigners around the world can use the moral force of international law to pressure governments to fulfill environmental commitments, enter into compliance, and take serious action to drastically reduce plastic pollution to oceans.","The countries most responsible for marine plastic pollution should be at least a little worried. All it would take to establish that international law really does have teeth is a single small state whose beaches, tourism or fisheries are suffering from a tide of waste plastic to take legal action against countries where it is coming from. And while such a state may be fearful of acting on its own, if backed by a wider coalition like the Association Of Small Island States and supported by a union of conservation NGOs and civil society, that could very well change as the volume and impact of marine plastics increase.","And change is what we desperately need ― to stop the flow of plastic into our seas, currently estimated at some 8.8 millions tons a year; to save all the wondrous creatures and precious ecosystems the plastic tide is propelling into extinction; and to restore the wider health of our oceans, and the totality of life on Earth.","International Law and Marine Plastic Pollution: Holding Offenders Accountable is written by Oliver Tickell and published by Artists Project Earth.

The measure seeks to punish people for suggesting that Poland collaborated with the Nazis during World War II. Using phrases like “Polish death camp” to refer to concentration camps that were located in the country during the Holocaust could result in fines or up to three years of jail time.","Polish President Andrzej Duda signed the bill on Feb. 6. It will become law later this year, despite international condemnation.","Israeli journalist Ronen Bergman, the son of two Holocaust survivors, told Morawiecki that during the Holocaust, his mother’s Polish neighbors attempted to betray Jewish families who were in hiding to the Nazis.","“If I understand correctly, after this law is legislated ... I would be considered criminal for saying this,” Bergman told the Polish leader. He then asked, “What is the purpose? What is the message you’re trying to convey to the world?”","Morawiecki responded that “it’s extremely important to first understand that of course it’s not going to be punishable, not going to be seen as criminal to say that there were Polish perpetrators, as there were Jewish perpetrators, as there were Russian perpetrators as well as Ukrainian perpetrators — not only German perpetrators.”","He added that many Polish families helped to hide Jews from the Nazis, and that there were many Polish victims of the war, as well.","“There were Polish perpetrators,” Morawiecki said, “But we cannot agree with mixing perpetrators with victims, because this would be first of all an offense to all the Jews and all the Poles who suffered greatly during the second World War.”","He took exception to the phrases “Polish death camps” and “Polish concentration camps.”","“Well, ladies and gentlemen, there were no Polish death camps. ... There were German Nazi death camps.”","Watch the exchange below.","Nazi ideology deemed Poles as racially inferior, according to The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM). Nearly two million non-Jewish Polish civilians were killed by the Nazis, while millions of others were imprisoned or deported as forced laborers.","Thousands of Poles did in fact choose to help Jewish families survive the Holocaust. Yad Vashem, Israel’s Holocaust remembrance center, has recognized over 6,600 non-Jewish Poles with the distinction “Righteous Among the Nations” for saving Jews.","But many other Poles did collaborate with the Nazis. The USHMM said that the Nazis called on Polish police and railroad personnel to help guard Jewish ghettos and deport people to death camps. Individual Poles also helped identify Jewish families in hiding, or plundered their property.","According to the USHMM, there were some Jewish leaders who were forced to help the Nazis implement anti-Jewish policies. The Nazis formed local councils known as Judenrat to ensure that their orders were carried out. Before “liquidating” a Jewish ghetto, for example, the Nazis would ask the Judenrat to give them a list of Jewish residents for deportation.","Some Jewish leaders who refused to cooperate were killed by the Nazis. Others complied under duress, hoping that it would keep at least a portion of the population alive.","The Holocaust ultimately killed about 90 percent of Poland’s Jewish population, more than 3 million people.","The actions of the Judenrat must be examined in context, according to Havi Dreifuss, a professor of history at Tel Aviv University. Dreifuss told Haaretz that the phenomenon of Jews collaborating with Nazis was “marginal,” but the hostility of most Poles towards their Jewish neighbors was the “norm.”","In addition, she said, there’s a difference in motive.","“While most Jews collaborated hoping to save themselves, their family or part of their community – Poles helped Nazi Germany hunt Jews due to various reasons, among them hatred and financial benefits,” Dreifuss said."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8b04b72100005000601ad1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"SPORTS","headline":"U.S. Women’s Ice Hockey Team Crushes Finland, Heads To Olympic Finals","authors":"Dominique Mosbergen","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/women-ice-hockey-us-finland-semifinal-olympics_us_5a8a6ce3e4b05c2bcacc5e62","short_description":"This is the third Winter Olympics in a row that the U.S. women's ice hockey team has made it to the finals.","date":"2018-02-19"},"articleContent":["The U.S. women’s ice hockey team dominated on Monday, beating Finland 5-0 in the Winter Olympics semi-final in South Korea.","Team USA now progresses to the final, where it will meet either Canada or the Olympic Athletes from Russia (OAR) to battle for gold.","The U.S. lost to arch-rival Canada 2-1 last Thursday in a nail-biter of a game.

Big air, while already a highlight of the X Games, is a new addition to the Winter Olympics, making its debut in Pyeongchang, South Korea.","The event consists of one massive jump, with competitors starting at the top of an 160-foot ramp before hurtling down and trying to land their most spectacular trick.

Each competitor gets two jumps, and judges score their tricks. Riders advance based on their single best score. Slopestyle gold medallist Jamie Anderson scored 90 points, placing her sixth in the 26-woman field, while Japanese riders Yuka Fujimori and Reira Iwabuchi and Canada’s Laurie Blouin also impressed.

Just 22 percent currently say mass shootings are an unstoppable “fact of life in America today,” down from a record 37 percent last October, following the slaughter in Las Vegas.","And a 48 percent plurality of Americans say that members of Congress should take action to try to reduce mass shootings, while just a third believe mass shootings cannot be reduced through legislation. In three surveys last fall, Americans were close to evenly split between those two options.","Whether that change will last, let alone prove an impetus to political action, remains very much up in the air.","Some of the apparent shift may simply be due to normal fluctuations in polling. Other questions show less movement: the 54 percent majority who currently favor making gun laws more strict is well within the 48-to-55-percent range where it’s been in HuffPost/YouGov polls over the last few years.","Americans also remain roughly split on whether it’s politically possible to pass any new gun control laws. And just 16 percent rate gun policies as among their top concerns.","Still, the increase in concern about mass shootings and the desire for legislative action shown in the new poll represent more movement than was apparent in three HuffPost/YouGov polls taken at the end of last year. Those surveys were taken in the wake of the Las Vegas massacre and, barely more than a month later, a mass shooting at a Texas church. As we wrote at the time:","Mass shootings in America rarely lead to political change, but they often do result in a brief spike in support for gun control. But as new polling suggests, with opinions on the topic starkly divided along political lines, it’s not clear whether two of the most recent high-profile shootings did anything to change people’s minds. In the past two months, HuffPost polled opinions on gun control three times: immediately after the Las Vegas shooting at the beginning of October; toward the end of the month, when it had largely faded from the news; and in early November, following the Texas church shooting. It’s possible that the nation is now sufficiently numbed that such tragedies are no longer sufficient to provide a jolt to public opinion; it’s also possible that the fallow time between high-profile shootings has been so brief that opinions never had time to go down from their heightened state. Either way, the consistency on many of the questions asked is notable.","Views remain marked by the deep political divides that have characterized public opinion on guns dating back to the beginning of Barack Obama’s presidency. Ninety percent of Hillary Clinton voters favor stricter gun laws, as do 52 percent of non-voters and third-party voters, but they’re joined by just 21 percent of those who backed President Donald Trump in the 2016 election.","Clinton voters are 53 percentage points likelier than Trump voters to consider gun violence a “very serious” national issue, 44 points likelier to say it’s possible to enact new gun regulations while maintaining Americans’ right to bear arms and 63 points likelier to favor congressional action to help prevent mass shootings.","Last week’s Florida school shooting that claimed 17 lives galvanized some of its teen survivors, a group of whom who are planning a nationwide march to demand action on gun violence.","“This isn’t about the GOP. This isn’t about the Democrats. This is about the adults,” Cameron Kasky, a junior at the high school, told ABC. “We feel neglected. At this point, you’re either with us or you’re against us.”","The new poll doesn’t include non-adults. But it finds that younger adults, by most metrics, aren’t especially focused on gun control issues. Just 15 percent of adults under age 30 cite gun policies as a top issue, and just half favor stricter gun laws. One number, however, suggests more support among young adults for action: 56 percent believe members of Congress should work to reduce mass shootings, up from 39 percent last November.","The poll also doesn’t ask about specific proposals for new gun policies, many of which garner far greater support than the overall concept of gun regulation. In a survey taken in 2016, more than 80 percent of voters backed universal background checks, as well as preventing the sale of firearms to people on the FBI’s terrorist watch list, those who’ve been been reported as dangerous by a mental health provider, or who’ve been convicted of stalking or of violent misdemeanors like domestic assault.","According to the White House, Trump has signalled interest in a bipartisan proposal that seeks to address flaws in the national criminal background check database.","Use the widget below to further explore the results of the HuffPost/YouGov survey, using the menu at the top to select survey questions and the buttons at the bottom to filter the data by subgroups:","The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Feb. 15-17 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.","HuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

As The Washington Post reported in October, when Zinke enters the building, “a security staffer takes the elevator to the seventh floor, climbs the stairs to the roof and hoists a special secretarial flag.” When he goes home, the flag comes down.","“I had no idea there was a secretarial flag,” Jewell told HuffPost. “And if I had known there was a flag the last thing I would have done was to ever fly it.”","Leading Interior — an agency that manages some 500 million acres of federal land, roughly one-fifth of the United States — is a demanding job that requires “creating an inclusive atmosphere, making people feel how important they are to the American people,” Jewell said.","Zinke, a former Montana congressman and Navy SEAL, faced a barrage of criticism over the flag ritual, earning himself headlines like “Trump’s Interior Secretary Is Running His Agency Like He’s Queen Of England.” The move also violates the agency’s policy for displaying and flying flags, as HuffPost previously reported.","Interior spokeswoman Heather Swift has defended the arcane ritual, telling the Post at the time that it is “a major sign of transparency” and that Zinke “is restoring honor and tradition to the department.”\n\nBut one week after being sworn into his new post, Zinke sent staff scrambling when he inquired about redesigning the agency’s historic flag, as HuffPost first reported in November. And he succeeded in making flags larger, so that neither his secretarial flag nor the agency flag would be smaller than the United States flag that flies atop the department’s headquarters on C Street in Washington, D.C.\n\nIt is unclear how Zinke hoped to redesign the flag, which is emblazoned with a bison and has gone largely unchanged for a century.","Interior first adopted a flag in 1917. Over the last 100 years, the bison seal, and presumably the flag, have twice been replaced — first with an eagle in the 1920s, and later to an image of hands holding the sun, mountains and water in the late 1960s. But both times the flag has reverted to the bison.\n\nThe last person to make a change to the seal was James Watt, President Ronald Reagan’s controversial, pro-drilling Interior secretary, who in 1982 temporarily turned the bison so that it would face to the right — a move The New York Times described at the time as “a partisan posture in keeping with his conservative views.”\n\nIn a speech to staff his second day on the job, Zinke said he wanted to restore the public’s trust in Interior and for the agency “to be the best department in the government.” He stressed the importance of teamwork and said he doesn’t care about his employees’ political beliefs, only that they love America and the department.\n\nBut internal emails and interviews with current and former employees have done little to paint a picture of a happy workforce.\n\nZinke came under fire in September when, during a speech to an oil industry group, he said: “I got 30 percent of the crew that’s not loyal to the flag.” The comment was met with outrage, including from a trio of groups representing retired Interior employees, who called the remarks “disrespectful,” “divisive,” “ludicrous” and “deeply insulting.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8ae1e81e000046057ac214.jpeg?cache=ozAsOuiGfr&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"A Guy Dressed As Black Panther Proposed At A 'Black Panther' Screening","authors":"Cindy Arboleda, Yahoo Entertainment","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-guy-dressed-as-black-panther-proposed-at-a-black-panther-screening_us_5a8afb63e4b00bc49f471af2","short_description":"“She accepted and we brought the happy couple some Champagne for a toast,” says Sampson. “The gentleman wanted to let her","date":"2018-02-19"},"articleContent":["Marvel’s “Black Panther” is not just a movie, it’s a cultural moment.

At least 252 coaches and officials have been arrested, charged or disciplined by USA Swimming for sexual assault or sexual misconduct against athletes under the age of 18. In four of the past six years, “at least 20 swim coaches have been arrested, charged or convicted for sex crimes ranging from rape, sexually assaulting a 3-year-old and 8-year-old, statutory rape, child pornography to secretly videotaping underage swimmers in locker-rooms,” the report notes.\n\nAt least 30 USA swim coaches or officials have been “flagged” by USA Swimming after being accused of or arrested for sexual abuse or child pornography by law enforcement. Most of the coaches and officials on the flagged list were able to continue working in the swim world. Some officials were not banned from the sport even after they had been convicted of felonies.\n\nOver the years, USA Swimming has been quick to spend money to settle sexual abuse cases before they can hit the public radar. Between 2006 and 2016, USA Swimming spent $7,450,000 on legal fees. It’s not clear how much of that money was spent to settle sexual abuse cases, but SCNG notes that USA Swimming “arranged settlement agreements in at least three states with victims of alleged sexual abuse by swim coaches before the cases were even filed with a court.”\n\nUSA Swimming shelled out over $75,000 to lobbying firms to mobilize against California legislation that would have made it easer for sexual abuse survivors to sue their attackers and the organizations they worked for in civil suits.","Mike Saltzstein, a former member of USA Swimming’s board of directors, told SCNG that the organization’s goal is to ensure its brand stays clean at all costs.","“I’m not sure there’s the institutional incentive, intestinal fortitude, guts, if you will, to do what needs to be done,” he said. “Their attitude is let’s smooth things over. Let’s hide things.”","Former Olympic swimmer Ariana Kukors recently said that her longtime coach Sean Hutchison sexually abused her for nearly a decade. Kukors, now 28, said Hutchison began “grooming” her when she was 13, after he became her coach at King Aquatic, a swimming club in Seattle.","“I never thought I would share my story because, in so many ways, just surviving was enough,” Kukors said. “I was able to leave a horrible monster and build a life I could have never imagined for myself. But in time, I’ve realized that stories like my own are too important to go unwritten.”","Kukors said Hutchison waited to have sex with her until she was 18, and the two later moved in together. The swimmer described Hutchison as manipulative, jealous and verbally abusive. Hutchison has reportedly denied the allegations.\n\nNancy Hogshead-Makar, a former Olympic swimmer and founder of the advocacy group Champion Women, told SCNG it’s somewhat common for top coaches to marry swimmers they once coached. That culture, she says, is wildly problematic.\n\n“When the organization allows for marriages, allows for the 11-year-old to see her 18-year-old teammate who she thinks is a peer, she thinks they are the same, they go to the same meets, they’re staying in the same hotel, they are working out together, then she sees that [older swimmer] marrying their coach so she thinks this is true love and doesn’t recognize what an inappropriate situation this is,” Hogshead-Makar said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed a bill into law last week that aims to protect amateur athletes from sexual abuse by regulating the governing bodies of amateur athletics, like USA Swimming. The legislation requires coaches and other sport officials to report any abuse allegations to police within a 24-hour period, and extends the statute of limitations to up to 10 years after a person realizes they were abused. The bill also limits athletes under the age of 18 from being alone with an adult who isn’t their parent.\n\n“[This bill] goes across all amateur sports, not just gymnastics, not just swimming ― it’s all amateur sports to protect all kids,” Jeanette Antolin, a former gymnast who was abused by Nassar, told HuffPost in January. “Because all kids should be able to go and do sports without having to worry about adult predators.”\n\nHead over to the Orange County Register to read the report in full.","Need help?

If the Supreme Court gives him the chance to opt out, the Illinois state employee will gladly take the justices up on their offer.","So, too, could millions of other public sector workers across the country, which would be a huge blow to the U.S. labor movement and, by extension, the Democratic Party.","Janus, a child support specialist at the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services, is at the center of what could be the most consequential labor case the court has heard in years. He works under a contract negotiated between the state and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, a union he wants nothing to do with. But AFSCME has to advocate for Janus whether he wants it to or not, because the law requires a union to represent everyone in a bargaining unit equally.","The contract stipulates that each worker in Janus’ unit must chip in to cover the costs associated with collective bargaining ― commonly called “fair-share” or “agency” fees. No one can be forced to be a full-fledged member of a union or to help pay for its political activities. But in Illinois and many other states, workers like Janus can be required to pay these mandatory fees if a union represents them.","After Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner (R) tried to challenge the state’s law allowing fair-share fees, Janus joined the lawsuit as an injured party. The Supreme Court will hear his case, Janus v. American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, Council 31, on Feb. 26.","Although fair share fees have been upheld as legal for decades, the high court’s conservative majority is likely to strike them down as unconstitutional. If the court rules against AFSCME, the entire U.S. public sector would essentially be a “right-to-work” zone ― meaning employees could no longer be required to pay anything to the unions that bargain on their behalf. There are already 28 “right-to-work” states; the Janus case would affect the other 22 states, which have an estimated 5 million public sector workers.","A ruling in Janus’ favor would squeeze a critical revenue stream for organized labor at a time when overall union membership rates are already hovering near historic lows.","“I think for some unions it will be existential, in the sense that they haven’t prepared for it and don’t have the solidarity to survive it,” said Paul Secunda, a labor law professor at Marquette University Law School. “The unions that are run well and have dedicated members will come out okay, and those that are just relying upon the mandatory fees will not.”","Conservative groups have planned for this moment for years. Their chance nearly came in 2016, after the Supreme Court took up a similar case involving a group of public school teachers in California who were paying agency fees to their union. The death of Justice Antonin Scalia led to a deadlock on the court and a reprieve for labor. But the confirmation of President Donald Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch ― after the stonewalling of President Barack Obama’s nominee, Merrick Garland ― gave union opponents the conservative majority they needed for another shot.","Janus declined an interview request with HuffPost through his lawyer, Jacob Huebert, of the Liberty Justice Center, an Illinois legal group with libertarian leanings. According to Huebert, Janus doesn’t support AFSCME partly because he believes the union is trying to secure too much pay and benefits for workers like himself, at too great a cost to Illinois.","“I can’t speak for his political views,” Huebert said. “But I do know he objects to the positions AFSCME has taken in bargaining, in part because he thinks AFSCME demands would impose an unreasonable financial burden on the state, at a time when the state already can’t pay bills.”","“I’m definitely not anti-union. Unions have their place and many people like them. … I was never given a choice,” Janus told the Washington Free Beacon in October. “I really didn’t see that I was getting any benefit [from union membership]. I just don’t think I should be forced to pay a group for an association I don’t agree with.”","The Supreme Court upheld the legality of fair share fees in the landmark 1977 public sector union case Abood v. Detroit Board of Education. The court reasoned that since all workers in a bargaining unit benefit from union representation, then a contract can require all the workers to pony up for it. Such an arrangement, the court decided, would promote labor peace. What workers don’t have to pay for is the union’s political expenditures ― campaign donations, election canvassing and the like. That’s why workers can opt to pay only the fair share fees, which are normal dues minus the portion that would go to politics.","But the conservative groups that have funded the lawsuit and filed briefs in support of Janus argue that workers should not have to pay any fees at all on First Amendment grounds. Drawing a distinction between private-sector and public-sector unionism, they claim that collective bargaining for government workers is inherently political, as what the union bargains for ― salaries and benefits for their members ― impacts state budgets and the use of taxpayer dollars. Therefore, the reasoning goes, being required to pay fair share fees amounts to compelled speech.","If the court accepts that argument, it could be harder for public sector unions to survive.","There are plenty of reasons a worker might want to opt out of supporting a union that represents them. Maybe they don’t like the union’s politics. Maybe they think the union’s leadership is lousy. Maybe the union got them a weak contract. But there will be workers who know they benefit from the union but choose to opt out anyway, for the simple reason that it’s in their economic self-interest to do so. After all, the union will have to continue representing them whether they pay fees or not.","Unions call this the “free-rider” conundrum.","“It’s a collective action problem,” explained Martin Malin, a labor law expert at the Chicago-Kent College of Law. “It’s a rational decision ― even for someone who wants to be represented in collective bargaining ― to not become a member, because their dues wont make any [noticeable] difference, and the benefits of collective bargaining are collective goods.”","In other words, the real problem for unions is not workers like Mark Janus, whose personal aversion to AFSCME was strong enough to sustain a yearslong lawsuit. Unions could lose the much greater number of workers who are simply indifferent toward their union and suddenly have the chance to bow out.","Part of the problem for unions is that many of them have had a relatively easy road unionizing workers in the public sector. Local governments, particularly in labor-friendly strongholds like the Northeast, can be far less hostile to collective bargaining than private employers, who often spend large sums of money on union-busting consultants. So a lot of public employee unions haven’t had to continuously fight and organize the way, say, a union of meatpacking workers would have to in the South.","“When you organize so easily, you don’t really build a union. You’re not used to fighting the employer,” said Kate Bronfenbrenner, the director of labor research at Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations. “Now they are going to have to fight the employer. Now they are going to have to fight for every single member. And that’s like private-sector organizing. Their organizers are going to have to be trained. If they don’t do it, they are going to have a lot less money.”","For all the problems Janus’ case presents unions, a ruling against them could force them to be better at what they do. On that, both sides agree: If workers can stop paying fair-share fees, unions will have no choice but to prove their value to those workers. Inattentive and undemocratic unions could no longer afford to coast. The mere specter of Janus ― and the Friedrichs case before it ― has already compelled unions to reflect on their missions in a way many hadn’t before.","The largest public sector unions have undertaken “internal organizing” campaigns to prepare for the case, trying to make committed union members out of the workers they already represent. The hope is that engaging with these workers now will make them much more likely to support the union when they no longer have to.","“Would it have been better if people had taken the issues ― and I hold myself responsible, too ― of member engagement and community involvement as seriously 15 years ago as we are taking it right now? Yeah, of course,” said Randi Weingarten, president of the 1.7 million-member American Federation of Teachers, a prime target of the Janus case. But “people are pretty transformed by the experience right now.”","Peter MacKinnon, president of the Services Employees International Union Local 509, in Massachusetts, said his union has tried to touch base with every one of its 8,300 public sector members and have them sign “recommitment” cards to the union. So far, they have rounded up roughly 5,000 signatures. In many cases, the conversation has been as simple as asking a member what the union means to them and what it could be doing better.","“It’s a shift that’s been really, really helpful,” said MacKinnon, a social worker. “There’s been some skepticism with members: Wait, you’re actually asking me what I care about? Because we hadn’t done that. And I think that’s the case with a lot of unions. But members are seeing now that this is their union.”","For all the solidarity it builds, the internal organizing comes at a cost. Whatever resources unions are pouring into maintaining their current membership rolls are resources not put into growing them. Much like the state-level attacks organized labor has been fending off ― the rollback of public-sector collective bargaining in Wisconsin, and the right-to-work battles around the country ― a loss in the Janus case will force unions to devote time and money to holding onto the status quo.","And the status quo isn’t so rosy. A mere 10.7 percent of U.S. workers belong to a union now, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That’s roughly half the membership rate in 1983, the first year for which government data is available, and far below the rate in the 1950s, when roughly 1 in 3 workers were in a union. The particularly high rate of public sector union membership ― precisely what’s threatened by the Janus case ― has helped to prop up organized labor as a whole. The membership rate for government workers is a robust 34.4 percent, compared to just 6.5 percent in the private sector.","Driving those numbers down helps the Republican Party. Unions not only steer far more money to Democrats than to Republicans, they also provide a lot of the ground game for Democratic candidates, in the form of phone banking and get-out-the-vote operations. A new paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research suggests that right-to-work laws cost Democratic candidates dearly. Comparing presidential election results in adjacent counties across state lines, researchers found that the implementation of a right-to-work laws cuts Democrats’ share of the vote by 3.5 percentage points.","A weakened Democratic Party, in turn, puts unions in an even more precarious spot, as they have fewer defenders in Washington and in statehouses, making it easier for Republicans to pass laws that hurt labor. So as Janus looms, unions are rethinking not only what sort of candidates they need to support for office, but what exactly unions are supposed to be for their members.","“I think there are things we can do to not only survive but thrive, but it’s going to require changing what we do as a movement,” said MacKinnon. “If we’re viewed as more than just a contract enforcement organization ― as an organization that stands for the values our members care about ― then that’s where the hope is.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a873e71210000390060178e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Jennifer Lawrence Explains Why Her On-Set Nudity Made People 'Uncomfortable'","authors":"Carly Ledbetter","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jennifer-lawrence-explains-why-her-on-set-nudity-made-people-uncomfortable_us_5a8b1b6be4b05c2bcace1956","short_description":"Classic JLaw.","date":"2018-02-19"},"articleContent":["In the upcoming thriller “Red Sparrow,” Jennifer Lawrence plays a ballerina-turned-assassin who endures a “sadistic” training school to learn how to kill people.

It started in January 2015, when Phillips challenged what he said were “oppressive” contracts for the Fox series, and alleged the production company “manipulated” him into accepting jobs. 19 Entertainment then filed a complaint saying that Phillips owed it upwards of $1 million.","The two parties settled in 2017, allowing Phillips to officially begin work on new songs ― his first since 2014.","Now out with his third album, “Collateral,” Phillips is eager for a fresh start.","“It was scary at first … Before we released the first song — it was like, ‘God, are people going to care anymore?’ Then there are still some people who cared. So it felt good,” Phillips told HuffPost at Build Series.","But there was a point when Phillips didn’t know what his future would hold.","“I felt lost. You don’t know where to belong,” he revealed, adding, “It was a really tough time in my life … I was just sitting at home ... A few months go by, then a year goes by. I’m writing, but it was really tough to write at first because I knew what I was wanting to say, but I couldn’t really say it. I had this block. I got with a couple of people, a couple of people I trust, and we just started writing songs — songs that didn’t even make the album … And they really helped me get through that.”","Also on hand to guide him through the tough time was Phillips’ wife Hannah. The longtime couple tied the knot in 2015, and went through the lawsuit together.","“I look at that lawsuit stuff almost as a blessing in a way because a lot of couples go through that first year of marriage — and we’re really blessed to be where we’re at,” Phillips said. “Also, all we had was time … I was still writing, staying busy doing shows. But we were home a lot. We got to know each other in that first year of marriage really well … We got to figure out more things that we like and don’t like about each other.”","It was during that time that Phillips penned a love song for his wife called “Dance With Me,” which is included on “Collateral.”","“I wrote that for my wife for our first dance and she was crying like a baby,” he revealed. “So I won that one. I cried before that. I was crying when I was trying to read my vows, but I couldn’t make it through it. And she was like, ‘Suck it up. Stop crying. This is my moment.’ Then she was crying because it was the first time she heard the song. And I was like, ‘Stop crying. Suck it up. This is my moment.’”","Phillips has come a long way since appearing on “American Idol” in 2012. The “Home” singer said the series not only gave him a platform to showcase his skills, but also allowed him to grow as a performer. Still, he remembered the competition being very competitive.","“Some people are very cutthroat in that competition. I didn’t know what I was getting into. There have been people there that have tried out for it for many years. Some people are really hard core into it. It’s like ‘The Hunger Games.’ … For me, it was a good learning experience being on live television. I just went from playing fraternities and bars and anywhere else that would take me,” he said, adding, “It was a good step because I know what it was like to have no one there to go listen to you. I think it’s good … to know how it feels to suck and not have anyone to listen to you. Because it makes you appreciate when people show up and sing songs that you write.”","These days, Phillips’ fans come to his shows and sing along to his songs ― the new ones included. No longer stuck in a rut, Phillips plans to spend the bulk of 2018 on tour, with his wife by his side.","“I got married with a lawsuit.

Jeb Bush. “It’s the end of the road for me.”","Gun violence survivors, activists and others have been calling for stricter gun control laws this week in the wake of Wednesday’s mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, which left 17 people dead. The alleged gunman, 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz, used an AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle in the attack.","In 2013, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) introduced a bill that sought to ban military-style assault weapons including guns like the AR-15. The bill, which failed to pass in the Senate, was similar to the 1994 ban on assault weapons that expired in 2004.","Republican lawmakers have mostly expressed little interest this week in pursuing new gun control legislation. In a Saturday tweet, President Donald Trump blamed Democrats for the lack of gun control reform.","In his interview with the Times, Hoffman said that Republican lawmakers, who receive millions each year from the National Rifle Association, were unlikely to push for greater gun control.","The NRA spent $30 million supporting Trump’s campaign in the 2016 presidential election, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The group spent millions more that year supporting other Republican candidates, including Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.).","When asked by Vox this week if Congress should act to tighten gun laws in the wake of the Florida shooting, Blunt said that he didn’t know enough about the attack to “know if there’s a proper response or not.”","Rubio said on Thursday that he didn’t believe stricter gun laws would be effective in stopping would-be shooters from committing crimes.","“If someone’s decided, ‘I’m going to commit this crime,’ they’ll find a way to get the gun to do it,” said Rubio, who gun control activists protested this week in a campaign inspired by the film “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a892c5e2000002d00eaf2dd.jpeg?cache=EfBa10jeuU&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Trump Blames Democrats For Lack Of Gun Control Laws","authors":"Dominique Mosbergen","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-democrats-gun-control_us_5a88fb0fe4b004fc3192fbc0","short_description":"The president's comments come on the heels of a gun control rally in Florida, where protesters lambasted Trump for his support for the NRA.","date":"2018-02-18"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"SPORTS","headline":"French Biathlete Clinches Gold In One Nail-Biter Of A Finish","authors":"Nina Golgowski","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/biathlete-martin-fourcade-wins-gold_us_5a8981a1e4b00bc49f451d5a","short_description":"Martin Fourcade and Simon Schempp recorded the same time but only one left with the top medal.","date":"2018-02-18"},"articleContent":["When it comes to clinching gold at the Winter Olympics, sometimes every millimeter counts.","French biathlete Martin Fourcade captured the gold medal ― the fourth in his career ― in the men’s 15km mass start competition on Sunday in a dramatic neck-and-neck finish at the games in Peongchang, South Korea.","The 29-year-old crossed the end line just barely ahead of Simon Schempp of Germany.

However, while it may seem counterintuitive to the spirit of an athletic competition that awards medals for first, second and third place, ties actually do occur at the Olympics.","In fact, ties at the Olympics aren’t as rare as you might think. There have been nine ties for Winter Olympic medals since the 1998 Nagano Games, and while that may be a complicated experience for the athletes and nations involved, the protocol is actual quite simple.","If a pair of athletes or two teams tie for first-place, they each receive a gold medal, no one is awarded silver and the bronze is awarded to the runner-up. This was the case during the women’s downhill final at Sochi in 2014 when Slovenia’s Tina Maze and Switzerland’s Dominique Gisin both crossed the finish line with a time of 1:41.57. They were both awarded gold medals and the runner-up, Switzerland’s Lara Gut, took home bronze with her time of 1:41.67.","If a pair of athletes tie for second place, they are each awarded a silver medal and there is no bronze given out. This occurred most recently at the 2010 Vancouver Games in the men’s individual biathlon. Emil Hegle Svendsen of Norway finished with the best time to win gold. Both Sergey Novikov of Belarus and Ole Einar Bjørndalen of Norway finished with exactly the same second-place time, so they each won a silver medal and no bronze was awarded.","If a pair of athletes tie for third-place, they are each awarded a bronze medal and gold and silver are awarded as per usual to the first and second-place finishers. This situation played out in PyeongChang on Saturday when Norway’s Marit Bjørgen and Finland’s Krista Pärmäkoski both crossed the finish line with a third-place time of 25:32.4 in the women’s cross-country 10km freestyle. They each won bronze, Sweden’s Charlotte Kalla won the silver medal with a time of 25:20.8 and Nowary’s Ragnhild Haga won gold with a time of 25:00.5.","Read more from Yahoo Sports:","Adam Rippon to work for NBC for remainder of 2018 Olympic Games\n\nWhat’s working, and what’s not, for Canada after preliminary round\n\nMartin Fourcade takes gold in most thrilling win of PyeongChang Olympics","This story was originally published on Yahoo Sports."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8a035b2000002d00eaf399.jpeg?cache=icCokKVTG7&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"WORLD NEWS","headline":"All 65 Passengers, Crew Feared Dead In Iranian Plane Crash","authors":"","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/iran-plane-crash_us_5a896ecbe4b004fc319328a5","short_description":"The Aseman Airlines flight crashed near the town of Semirom, roughly 370 miles south of Tehran.","date":"2018-02-18"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Bernie Sanders On AR-15s: They’re 'Not For Hunting.

[with] one notable exception – guns.”","In Congress, he voted against a bill in the 1990s to require a five-day waiting periods to allow for criminal background checks before a gun could be purchased, voted to allow firearms on Amtrak, and came out against a lawsuit to hold gun manufacturers accountable for the 2012 at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. But he has also voted for universal background checks and an assault weapons ban.","Hunting is popular in Sanders’ home state of Vermont. Its gun laws are so permissive that an editor at the Burlington-based alt-weekly Seven Days detailed how he “bought an AR-15 in a Five Guys parking lot” in 2016. On Thursday, one day after the Florida shooting, Gov.

He stressed that the National Rifle Association has given him a D-minus rating on its ranking of federal lawmakers. He also reiterated his long-argued claim that the NRA’s support for his opponent cost him a statewide election in 1988, though The Washington Post cast doubt over how big a role the gun lobby’s endorsement played in Sanders’ defeat.","“We’ve got to take on the NRA,” Sanders said. “The tragedy we saw in Parkland is unspeakable, and all over this country parents are scared to death of what might happen when they send their kids to school.”","Earlier on “Meet the Press,” Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.), called for restricting people with criminal records or histories of mental illness from purchasing assault weapons. But he said it shouldn’t be made harder for others to do so.","“Some actually do hunt with an AR-15,” said Lankford, who received $5,000 in political contributions from the NRA in the 2016 campaign cycle.","CORRECTION: A previous version of this story stated that an editor at the Burlington-based alt-weekly Seven Days bought an AR-15 from five guys.

Nor will you find them in Las Vegas, where a heavily armed gunman opened fire on thousands of concertgoers in October, killing 58 and injuring hundreds more in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.","Beneath both of these incidents, however, is a harrowing realization that could be momentarily mistaken for the coldest of comfort: As horrific as these shootings were, the evidence suggests they could have been far worse.","This is in no way a cause for solace. Rather, it’s a disturbing reminder of the cards we’ve been dealt by feckless lawmakers who have failed to take any action whatsoever to prevent or even mitigate mass shootings. And it should serve as a warning that as long as we continue to do nothing, we are likely resigning ourselves to a fate of mass shootings more horrific than the ones we’ve experienced.","The Florida gunman reportedly entered Stoneman Douglas High on Wednesday with a legally purchased AR-15 semiautomatic rifle and “countless magazines,” each one holding 30 rounds. When he opened fire, the school went into an “active shooter” lockdown. Teachers and students barricaded doors and went into hiding. An armed school resource officer was on duty at the time but was unable to respond. By the time the shooting was over, the gunman had fired more than 100 rounds, authorities said. But for reasons we may never know, he appeared to stop shooting on his own accord.","“He tried blending into the crowd and was talking to one of my friends as he was exiting,” a student said of the shooter.","When police arrested the suspect, a former student, they found a number of loaded magazines in his backpack. On Friday, the FBI reported that it had failed to act after receiving a tip that the young man had expressed a “desire to kill people” and spoke about “the potential of him conducting a school shooting.”","In Las Vegas, the potential for further damage was far greater. The gunman in that shooting appears to have used more than a dozen assault-style rifles in the attack, many of them outfitted with 100-round magazines and bump stocks, after-market accessories that simulate automatic fire. Although fully automatic weapons are illegal under federal law unless specially registered, the gunman’s arsenal was completely legal. According to a subsequent report by the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, he “did not commit a crime until he fired the first round into the crowd.”","The gunman, shooting from the 32nd floor of a hotel, was ultimately able to fire more than 1,100 rounds into the crowd of helpless people, following a crude plan known as “the beaten zone” in military jargon, said Arthur Alphin, a ballistics expert and former West Point professor who has testified in a number of multiple shooting cases.","“This guy didn’t even have any sights on some of his guns. He wasn’t aiming them. He was just pouring bullets into that beaten zone of a couple football fields,” said Alphin. “If anybody thinks that the murdering bastard looked down there, identified a target and said, ‘That’s Sweet Pea from Arkansas. I’m going to shoot her,’ they’re full of it. He couldn’t see them, he couldn’t recognize them.”","In the end, the gunman stopped shooting of his own volition before fatally shooting himself.","When police finally breached his hotel room, the shooting had been over for more than an hour. Inside, investigators found a dozen additional firearms and more than 5,000 rounds of live ammunition.","Based on the gunman’s arsenal, it appears that he could have caused more destruction if he’d been intent on it, Alphin said.","“He could have planned it far, far better, absolutely no question,” he said. “He was clearly a lunatic. He clearly knew nothing about his guns. To him, ammo was ammo and guns were guns.”","Whatever relief we might feel at hearing that is a telling indictment of our approach to mass shootings. We’ve given people easy access to all the tools they need to inflict unimaginable violence on others, leaving ourselves simply to hope that nobody will use them for that purpose. And when this inevitably fails, we often end up having little choice but to hope that mass shooters will choose to limit their carnage themselves.","By taking no action in the face of these increasingly deadly and frequent mass shootings, we now find ourselves in an arrangement in which these death tolls are often limited only by a gunman’s depravity and choice of target. As we’ve found out again and again, there will always be a more heartless person with a more sadistic plot to slaughter innocent people."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8787e81e000037007abf6b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"SPORTS","headline":"Czech Ester Ledecka Stuns With Super-G Gold Medal Win","authors":"","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/vonn-misses-podium-super-g_us_5a87b083e4b004fc31923ec2","short_description":"American Lindsey Vonn missed the podium with a slip and near crash.","date":"2018-02-17"},"articleContent":["PYEONGCHANG, South Korea, Feb 17 (Reuters) ― Czech Ester Ledecka produced one of the biggest shocks in the history of the Winter Olympics when she tore down Jeongseon slope in bib number 26 to stun the pre-race favorites and win the women’s super-G on Saturday.","The 22-year-old was ranked 43rd in the World Cup standings in Super-G and was thought to have a better chance of gold in the snowboarding events she will also contest in Pyeongchang, an unprecedented doubling up.","Bib 26 was the starting position for a racer with only the slimmest chance of getting near the podium and the top contenders clearly thought the medals had been decided by skiers in the top 20 spots.","When Ledecka started her run, Austrian Anna Veith was at the bottom of the slope taking phone calls and preparing to celebrate becoming first woman to win back-to-back titles in the Olympic super-G.","The Czech’s run appeared at par with her starting position until halfway down the course but she carved up the bottom of the run to clock one minute 21.11 seconds.","Ledecka could barely believe it herself when the green light indicated she had bumped Veith out of the gold medal position by one hundredth of a second to give her country its first Alpine skiing gold medal.","“I was wondering what just happened.

Andrew Cuomo (D) on Thursday called the tax legislation a “federal economic assault” on New York.","But efforts to spare upper-middle-class taxpayers from the hit they would take from the reduced SALT deduction get complicated fast. For one thing, policy experts note that it would require state governments to bend over backwards to accommodate households with six-figure incomes that Democrats fret are already doing just fine.","“If your complaint about the tax bill was that it was too expensive and gave too many tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans, I’m not sure why you would double down with these SALT workarounds,” said Marc Goldwein, a senior fellow with the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, which opposed the tax bill because it will add to the national debt.","More insidiously, a major proposal in New York state to offset the lost deductions would deprive Social Security and Medicare Hospital Insurance of revenue they would otherwise receive under the current tax regime.","Cuomo’s main proposal would shift some of the burden of New York state’s income tax from individuals to their employers. The plan, which would be voluntary for businesses to join, would phase in a 5 percent tax on annual wages above $40,000 to be paid by employers. Businesses could then deduct those taxes off their federal returns, since they are still allowed to deduct compensation costs under the new tax law.","Meanwhile, workers in participating companies would be given an equivalent state income tax credit. In the end, the state would presumably receive the same amount of revenue from its income tax.","But there’s an unintended, albeit expected, wrinkle. Employers opting in to the Cuomo plan would likely respond to the new state-level payroll tax by reducing their employees’ gross pay by an amount commensurate to the new tax they would shoulder. The Cuomo administration argues that since the new state tax phases in over time, employers may choose to reduce annual wage increases rather than cutting current pay levels. Moreover, they say the state tax credits will ensure that workers still come out ahead.","By essentially encouraging employers to reduce their workers’ pre-tax pay, however, Cuomo’s plan would also reduce the amount of wages subject to the federal payroll taxes that fund Social Security and Medicare.","To pay the 5 percent tax on a worker earning $80,000, for instance, an employer might reduce wages by $2,000, meaning only $78,000 would be subject to federal payroll taxes. If that person continued to earn a similar salary until retirement, he or she would receive about $300 less in annual Social Security benefits, said Dean Baker, a labor expert with the liberal Center on Economic and Policy Research.","Baker downplays that possible effect. “I know that people opposed to it will complain about this, but the plausible impact on Social Security benefits is almost sure to be very trivial,” he said.","The Social Security trust fund overall could also take a hit, depending on how many blue states adopt such a plan ― if, say, New York, Illinois and California, all populous high-tax states, went this route. That effect could be limited, however, by the fact that Social Security taxes apply only to the first $128,400 of wages.","But there is no ceiling on pay subject to the Medicare portion of the federal payroll tax. That tax provides revenue to the Hospital Insurance trust fund, which pays for Medicare’s hospital coverage for seniors and people with disabilities. The Hospital Insurance trust fund is already under some strain. On its current course, it will be unable to fund 100 percent of benefits beginning in 2029.","“The Hospital Insurance trust fund would clearly lose,” said Paul Van de Water of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a progressive think tank.","Teresa Ghilarducci, a retirement security expert at the New School, was not particularly concerned about the Cuomo proposal’s impact on Social Security’s finances. She was more worried that the benefits of the plan would be hard to communicate.","“It’s brand-new and it will be hard to explain,” Ghilarducci said.","Another proposal within Cuomo’s plan, and one that Democrats in other states are also considering, is to allow taxpayers to make “charitable contributions” to the state in lieu of tax payments. Since people can still count charitable donations against their federal taxable income, this strategy would allow states to maintain their own revenue without their residents paying higher taxes overall.","Both the charitable donation strategy and the business payroll tax plan would face skepticism from the U.S. Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service, said Larry Zelenak, a tax professor at Duke University. On the question of payroll taxes, he said the IRS might want to classify something like the New York proposal as a disguised withholding of state income tax, which would need to be included in workers’ federal taxable wages.","“I can imagine even the Obama IRS saying this wouldn’t work,” Zelenak said.","The original idea of allowing people to deduct state taxes from their federal taxes was bad to begin with, said Matt Bruenig, founder of a progressive think tank called the People’s Policy Project. In an analysis published last month, he estimated that 70 percent of the benefits of that deduction went to people earning $200,000 or more.","If blue-state lawmakers are concerned that the reduced SALT deduction will turn influential, upper-middle-class taxpayers against generous state spending on schools and roads, they could simply reduce state taxes on those households and make up the difference with tax hikes on “even richer people,” Bruenig said.","But anything that serves to reduce federal payroll taxes at this point, he said, “is not good. In general, I think we need more payroll taxes to pay for more and more benefits.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8777b61e0000dc007abf62.jpeg?cache=oCGCbrHWLe&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"SPORTS","headline":"Winnie The Pooh Is Trending On Twitter For The Cutest Olympic Reason","authors":"Lee Moran","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/winnie-the-pooh-olympic-figure-skater_us_5a87f50ee4b004fc31927379","short_description":"Awww!","date":"2018-02-17"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"COMEDY","headline":"Bill Maher: Trump Is 'Plainly A Traitor Who Doesn't Defend His Own Country'","authors":"Lee Moran","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bill-maher-donald-trump-traitor_us_5a87d31fe4b00bc49f443610","short_description":"The \"Real Time\" host also posed a question for Trump's supporters.","date":"2018-02-17"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"SPORTS","headline":"Leslie Jones Is The Figure Skating Fashion Critic Everyone Needs","authors":"Ron Dicker","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/leslie-jones-is-the-figure-skating-fashion-critic-everyone-needs_us_5a87f151e4b004fc31926b0e","short_description":"The \"SNL\" comedian stepped up her Twitter game upon arrival at the Winter Olympics.","date":"2018-02-17"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"BLACK VOICES","headline":"Activists Launch Voter Registration Drive At 'Black Panther' Screenings","authors":"Philip Lewis","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/voter-registration-black-panther_us_5a88616ae4b05c2bcacb7088","short_description":"#WakandaTheVote 2018!","date":"2018-02-17"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"BLACK VOICES","headline":"Trolls Are Posting Fake Stories About Being Attacked At 'Black Panther' Showings","authors":"Hilary Hanson","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fake-stories-black-panther-attack-hoax_us_5a8857ebe4b05c2bcacb6d41","short_description":"Don't fall for them.","date":"2018-02-17"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Tweeters Rip Trump Over 'Tone Deaf' Thumbs-Up Pose With Florida First Responders","authors":"Lee Moran","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-thumbs-up-parkland-shooting_us_5a87dbf9e4b00bc49f4439e4","short_description":"\"To give a thumbs-up like you just had a great dinner.

Hours after the rest of her family had closed their eyes, she’d stay up in her darkened room, praying. When she finally slept, she often dreamt the same dream. Men dressed in black suits entered the home her family rented in a South Texas town and dragged her father away by his feet.","As Norma grew older, the nightmare changed. Sometimes the men in black chased her, too. Other times, she sensed a presence she couldn’t see. But she knew it was coming after her and she needed to run.","The fears that haunted Norma’s dreams spilled into her waking life. The image of her father being abducted popped up during job interviews. Paralyzing anxiety choked her when it came time to speak in public. Benign interactions with work colleagues left her feeling scared for her safety.","By early 2016, Norma, then 28, had started bringing up her fears with friends and family. One evening that February, she sat down with two good friends on the patio of an East Austin bar. Over Lone Stars and food from a nearby street truck, she told them she worried something wasn’t right in her head. The confession drew confused responses: She was young, had earned a master’s degree, was bringing in decent money, her friends argued. And after having lived most of her life as an undocumented immigrant, she was 10 days away from taking the oath of U.S. citizenship. Maybe she was complaining too much, she thought to herself. Eventually she dropped the subject.","But as Norma got into her car to leave the bar, her mind spun out of control. It was as if someone had thrown a firecracker into her brain, leaving her unable to think. She didn’t know what was wrong. She only knew she had to get to a hospital. She drove two and a half miles up the highway to St. David’s Medical Center, went inside to seek help, and then, panicked and confused, fled back to her car. A few minutes later, a police officer pulled Norma over.","She was relieved when she saw the blue and red lights. She stopped in an Applebee’s parking lot, jumped out of the car and ran toward the officer, pleading for help. This startled the officer, who ordered her to get back in the car and wait for him to speak to her.","He asked her to hand over her license and registration. He smelled beer on her breath. Norma kept insisting she needed medical attention. She admitted drinking a few beers before getting behind the wheel, but told the officer she’d just come from the hospital. He kept asking for her ID.","Swinging between tears and rage, she threw her purse, with her ID inside, on the ground — and then got out of the car to pick it up. According to the officer’s report, Norma lay “on the ground and threw her shoes away from her” and “curled up on the ground yelling and rocking herself.”","Then, she asked the officer whether he had his gun.","“Can you shoot me with it?” Norma said. When he refused, she charged at him with her hands raised. The officer grabbed her by the right wrist, handcuffed her and loaded her in the back of his car.","Instead of finding solace in a hospital bed, Norma ended up on suicide watch in Travis County Jail, facing a criminal charge.","But at least she would find out what was going on inside her brain.","As a kid, Norma made her bed every morning, tidily arranged her toys and shoes, and obsessed over her grades with such anxiety that it concerned her siblings. But they also recognized their sister was following a script her parents had etched into all their brains: Work hard, don’t complain, stay out of trouble.","That simple formula allowed her mother, a home health attendant, and her father, a laborer in the oil fields, to build the family’s life in South Texas for two decades despite their lack of legal immigration status. Before the night of her arrest, Norma never had so much as a speeding ticket.","Now, she was ensnared in the criminal justice system. Norma was booked into Travis County Jail in the early morning hours and charged with driving under the influence. At 6:42 p.m. that night, she was released to her sister on a personal recognizance bond, issued on the condition that she check into Brackenridge Hospital — an irony for someone who’d gotten into this legal mess because she was seeking medical attention.","After five days of inpatient psychiatric care, five weeks of outpatient therapy and a battery of questionnaires, Norma received multiple diagnoses: generalized anxiety disorder, recurrent major depression disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD.","The last one surprised her. She had filled out mental health questionnaires several times over the years and always ignored the questions about PTSD.","“I’d say, ‘Oh no, that’s for veterans or whatever,’ because my childhood didn’t fit neatly into that criteria,” she recalled. “When someone finally said that, I was like, ‘What? This whole time?’”","Many factors had taken a toll on Norma’s mental health. Her parents had so much trouble making ends meet when she was a child that sometimes she’d return home unsure whether the lights would be on or whether she’d have to boil water to bathe. Her youngest sister also suffers from a life-threatening illness that constantly worried the family.","But Norma’s condition was likely triggered ― at least in part, one of her doctors told her ― by the experience of living as an undocumented immigrant in the United States. Her recurring nightmares were a symptom of her illness.","Getting that diagnosis came at a high cost. A few weeks after she was released from jail, Norma received a call from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Her appointment to take the oath of citizenship had been canceled, pending the outcome of her criminal case. She’d been charged with driving under the influence. And although she has lawful permanent residency in the U.S. through a marriage to her high school sweetheart (which ended in an amicable divorce), a DUI conviction might bar her from reapplying for citizenship for five years. There was a chance it could disqualify her altogether.","Norma knew the fears that still kept her up at night weren’t irrational. Early one morning, when she was 14 years old, she experienced a real-life version of her worst nightmare. She was jolted awake at her family’s home in a town near the border when an immigration agent shined a flashlight in her face. Norma and her older sister, both undocumented at the time, watched alongside their father as agents escorted their mother to a white van outside and drove away. “It felt like I had imploded,” Norma said. “Nothing is safe.”","A few days later, Norma’s mother picked her up from school as if nothing had happened. Her mother remains undocumented and subject to deportation, but immigration authorities have allowed her to stay in the country and work legally so that she can care for Norma’s chronically ill younger sister, who is a U.S. citizen. Norma’s father, who was detained and put into deportation proceedings after a worksite raid in the late 1990s, was also given permission to stay in the U.S. on the same, common discretionary grounds.","Norma’s parents declined to speak on the record about that deportation, out of fear of jeopardizing their tenuous permission to remain in the country. But the event left a lasting impression on Norma’s family. Her parents started keeping the window blinds shut. Her youngest sister refused to go to school. Her oldest sister started having panic attacks.","And Norma often thought about her mother’s deportation. But she never realized that a trauma like that could play a role in provoking PTSD.","The disastrous mental health impact of growing up undocumented was extreme in Norma’s case. But it wasn’t unique. An emerging body of research indicates that just living in the United States without legal immigration status could be wreaking havoc on the mental health of hundreds of thousands of immigrants.","When human beings experience traumatic events — whether the violence of combat, sexual abuse, natural disasters or other frightening episodes — the mind can carry the burden long after the danger has passed. One of PTSD’s main triggers is chronic stress, which causes oversecretion of the hormones adrenaline and cortisol, leading to outsized emotional responses to even small occurrences — in a word, “hypervigilance.”","Hypervigilance makes people acutely aware of their surroundings, perpetually guarding against perceived threats and portents of danger. Unrelated events can send them mentally back to the moment they suffered a trauma.","As Norma entered treatment, the crises and neuroses that had bedeviled her for much of her twenties began to make more sense.","Norma had struggled with depression and anxiety since she was a child, but it was only when she moved to Austin, for graduate school, that she’d felt her grip on her mind begin to slip. Hispanics are by far the majority in the Rio Grande Valley, where she grew up. In Austin, she felt like a minority for the first time.","In graduate school, she clammed up when it came time to speak in class, frozen by feelings of inadequacy despite having earned a full-ride scholarship. At her new job, she sometimes worried that her co-workers were talking down to her, their sentences ending with a rising cadence the way someone speaks to a baby or a dog. She joked with her friends that white people made her uncomfortable. They laughed. The sentiment embarrassed her, but she meant it. She felt like she was in danger. But for years, she couldn’t understand why.","Now, armed with her new diagnosis, Norma could understand the source of her anxieties. The constant sense of foreboding, the extreme fear of speaking in class, the guardedness around her white colleagues — these were classic examples of PTSD-associated hypervigilance.","Feeling constantly on edge, as Norma did, repeatedly jolts the amygdala, the part of the brain that triggers fear. The resulting sensation, often referred to as the “fight or flight” response, is a normal evolutionary protection against danger. The pang of anxiety triggered by looking down off a high ledge or the jitters that shake us before a big public speech are the amygdala telling us to pay close attention to the world around us, because the stakes just got higher.","But the human body isn’t designed to live in a fight-or-flight state constantly. Over time, stress hormones get depleted. The first symptoms of that depletion are often physical ― stomach pains, headaches. As the condition progresses, mental disorders, like anxiety and clinical depression, become common. When compounded by trauma, like the deportation of your mother, hypervigilance can develop into full-blown PTSD, complete with nightmares, flashbacks and explosive reactions to events that trigger the worst memories.","That progression — from hypervigilance, to anxiety and depression, to PTSD — appears to be what happened to Norma.","Something similar is likely happening to many more immigrants as well. Nearly a quarter of the 248 undocumented immigrants interviewed for a study last year in one Southern California town showed signs of suffering a mental disorder ― most commonly major depressive disorder, followed by panic disorder and generalized anxiety, according to Rice University psychology researcher Luz Garcini. Both that study and a follow-up found that younger immigrants, those between the ages of 18 and 25, were more likely to show the most profound effects.","The personal histories Garcini took from her survey respondents also suggested that their mental health problems resulted from life here ― not in their country of origin. “What the data is showing us now is that, unfortunately, most of the trauma happened while living in the United States,” she told HuffPost.","European researchers reached similar conclusions in a 2012 study of 391 refugees who visited a free clinic in Italy. Some 10.2 percent of them suffered from PTSD. Some had migrated from war-torn countries. But the ones most likely to show symptoms of PTSD were those who hadn’t obtained permission to live legally in their new country, exposing them to unemployment, isolation and the persistent fear of arrest.","The growing consensus that undocumented immigrants face urgent mental health risks doesn’t surprise Luis Zayas, dean of social work at the University of Texas at Austin and an expert in trauma among recently arrived Central American immigrants. The constant fear of arrest or deportation predisposes undocumented immigrants to hypervigilance, he said.","“Imagine what it’s like to leave your home every day, looking over your shoulder, so to speak,” Zayas told HuffPost. “You’ve heard about men and women coming back from war and they hear a firecracker or a car sound? They might be brought back to a moment on the battlefield. Well, when you’ve had ongoing traumatic events, any new event could bring you back to it and you feel the same feelings. Your heart rate increases. You have wet palms. Your mouth dries up. … You have to imagine this on a daily basis. Most of us don’t see it because it’s not our experience.”","Conversely, protecting people from deportation can improve their mental health. In 2012, the Obama administration implemented the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which shielded young undocumented immigrants who’d entered the country as children from deportation and allowed them to work here legally. A 2016 statistical analysis of data from the U.S. National Health Interview survey showed that 40 percent of those eligible for DACA reported improvements to their mental health after the program began.\n","The negative effects of living without legal immigration status and the positive effects of DACA extend to the undocumented immigrants’ U.S.-born children as well, researchers have found. When parents suffer from mental health disorders like depression, their kids will often share the symptoms. They’ve internalized their parents’ fears.","“These are their protectors. These are people they love and admire,” Zayas said. “The fact that at any moment they can be taken away from you by a government agency because they don’t have papers ― that’s as damaging to the children as it is to the parent.”","Between the 11 million people currently living in the U.S. without legal immigration status and the roughly 5 million U.S. citizen children with at least one undocumented parent ― not to mention the adult citizens with undocumented loved ones ― nearly 1 in 20 people in the U.S. could be at risk for mental health problems related to immigration status.","Individuals react differently to chronic stress and trauma, so not all of those 16 million-plus people will struggle. But the level of mental health distress recorded in the studies so far is likely “the tip of the iceberg,” Atheendar Venkataramani, an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine and a co-author of last year’s DACA study, told HuffPost.","“We’re probably underestimating it,” he said. “And given the pervasiveness of the types of events that can trigger hypervigilance, perceptions of risk, trauma ― I think the burden could be quite deep.”","And the burden could be getting deeper. In January 2017, as Norma’s criminal case inched its way through court, President Donald Trump entered the White House, promising the harshest immigration crackdown in a generation.","Five days after taking office, Trump signed an executive order eliminating Obama-era guidelines that prioritized deporting people with criminal convictions. Soon after, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement began summarily deporting people who were showing up for routine check-ins ― people who, like Norma’s parents, had outstanding orders of removal but had previously been allowed to stay because they had largely clean criminal histories and family ties in the United States.","Stoking fear became a bigger part of ICE’s strategy. “If you’re in this country illegally and you committed a crime by entering this country, you should be uncomfortable,” acting ICE Director Thomas Homan told a congressional subcommittee in June. “You should look over your shoulder, and you need to be worried.” (In fact, many undocumented immigrants committed no crime when entering the United States. Norma, for example, came when she was 3 years old using a border-crossing card ― a visa that allows Mexican nationals to make repeated short trips to the U.S. Overstaying a visa is considered a civil infraction, not a crime, under U.S. law.)","In perhaps the most sweeping change, Trump announced the cancellation of DACA in September. It’s too soon to know whether the program will be phased out as the White House said. Several lawsuits in federal court may delay or overturn the president’s decision. But Venkataramani suspects the Trump administration’s loudly expressed agenda has already begun wiping away the mental health benefits his study documented.","“It’s a different climate,” Venkataramani said. “Around the time DACA repeal was being considered, every other day there was a news article that would quote someone ― a Dreamer or someone who knew a Dreamer ― that would mention the level of anxiety that these folks were facing. It’s not just journalists looking for an angle. It’s just scary to be in their world. I don’t think anyone would doubt that it influences their health.”","The Trump administration’s policies could make mental health disorders even more widespread among immigrant populations, according to Omar Martinez, a professor of social work at Temple University. He co-authored a 2015 study that found not only that immigrants without legal status were more likely to suffer from mental health disorders than the general public, but also that anti-immigrant rhetoric tended to dissuade people from seeking treatment and increased the stress that causes disorders like depression, anxiety and PTSD.","“There was a link between these policies and mental health outcomes,” Martinez told HuffPost. “What we’ve found is alarming. I don’t know what the cutoff is to call it a crisis. But it is definitely alarming and it will continue to increase as long as this anti-immigrant rhetoric continues.”","Norma expects to have nightmares for the rest of her life ― mental health treatment doesn’t erase trauma. But she’s learned to notice when her fears start rising to the surface and to disrupt the thoughts before they plunge her back into a crisis — a tactic that mental health professionals call “interrupt and redirect.” Most days, she can coach her mind into a state of calm, even optimism.","“I wouldn’t say I’m good at it, but I’m better than when I was younger,” Norma said.","She’s not afraid of telling her friends what’s going on in her head anymore, either. She’s more likely to overshare, sometimes telling new acquaintances about her PTSD.","“It’s such a loaded term,” she said. “I feel committed now to throwing out the term as much as I can and speaking about it calmly.”","Her work has become more rewarding too. She left her old job at the Texas state capitol at the end of 2016, knowing that the Republican-dominated legislature planned to pass a statewide immigration crackdown that mirrored Trump’s agenda. She now works in mental health and criminal justice advocacy with Austin-based Grassroots Leadership.","Last August, prosecutors went to Norma’s lawyer with a deal. In exchange for her using a breathalyzer five times a day for three months, taking alcohol awareness classes, continuing her psychological treatment and doing 60 hours of community service, they’d drop the DUI charge in 18 months. If all goes well, she’ll be able to reapply for citizenship next year.","But the underlying fears that led to Norma’s condition have grown worse. The threat of deportation still hangs over her parents. And her brother is among the 670,000 who stand to lose work authorization and protection from deportation if Trump’s plan to cancel DACA moves forward. (Congress has yet to move a bill that would restore DACA, although a nationwide injunction issued by a federal judge in California has stopped the White House from phasing out the program for now.)","Norma worries for her family. She also worries about the millions of other people who remain undocumented, as she once was — people who could be walking around with similarly rattled brains. At her worst moments, she feels again like the terrified 14-year-old who woke up to witness her mom’s arrest.","But she remembers that her hypervigilant brain, for all the pain it has caused her, keeps her on guard for a reason.","“There’s nothing wrong with me,” she says. “This is how I survived.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a7501082d000049009439de.jpeg?cache=dQ4xR3v3Hp&ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Black Panther's Powerful Vibranium Suit Explained With Real Science","authors":"Andy McDonald","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/black-panthers-powerful-vibranium-suit-explained-with-real-science_us_5a8872f2e4b00bc49f44ac22","short_description":"Basically, the more he gets hit, the stronger he becomes.","date":"2018-02-17"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"So, Your Obsession With Jennifer Aniston And Brad Pitt Is Back?

They had subsequent relationships (hi, Justin Theroux and Angelina Jolie), but their once-perfect union remained tabloid fodder throughout. People couldn’t help but fantasize about an eventual reunion.","Now, the dedicated enthusiasts who have obsessed over the ex-couple for the past two decades find themselves at a curious junction: Both Jen and Brad are single again. (Aniston announced her separation from Theroux on Thursday, while Pitt and Jolie split back in 2016.)","Like clockwork, these shippers came out of the woodwork this week to demand Aniston and Pitt reignite their flame. But why? What makes people feel so invested in the fate of these two once-wedded blonds? What do they think they’ll accomplish by tweet-begging for Brad to call Jen?","We weren’t sure. So we asked a few experts to help.","Dr. Kathryn Smerling, a New York-based psychotherapist focused on transitory and crisis phases of life, told HuffPost that people feel personally involved in the reunion of Aniston and Pitt because, well, “it’s all fantasy.”","“When there’s hope that love is possible for a once-shattered marriage like Brad and Jennifer’s, there’s this fairytale-like feeling that happily ever after is possible for all of us,” she said. “We all think that what’s happening to Hollywood couples is happening to us. We think to ourselves, ‘If they can get through it, maybe I can, too!’”","“Brad and Jennifer captured our hearts when they were together,” she added. “When we see a couple as admired as Jen and Brad were, it’s like seeing our role models fail ― in turn that leaves us vulnerable, saddened, and fearing the worst.”","Dr. Lindsay Henderson, PsyD, a psychologist who treats patients virtually via telehealth app LiveHealth Online, agrees. When something like a breakup or separation happens, she told HuffPost that the negative event “does not match up to the fantasy image we prefer to have of their lives that we hold on to. The joyous events fit much more neatly into the perfect image that we have already created in our minds.”","“Our over-identification with the celebrity ends up causing personal discomfort, and because we have elevated them to having achieved such enviable success, it can sometimes be more troubling to us when they fail than when people in our lives that we actually know and have relationships with fail,” Henderson said.","When Aniston and Pitt announced their separation back in January 2005, after nearly five years of marriage, the world mourned hard. Once news surfaced that Pitt had apparently fallen for his “Mr. and Mrs. Smith” co-star Jolie, and reportedly left Aniston as a result, media coverage spiraled out of control. Did Pitt cheat on Aniston? Did Jolie pressure him into getting a divorce? Was Aniston OK?","And it only escalated from there.","A few months after the breakup announcement, Pitt was pictured with Jolie and her adopted son Maddox on a beach in Kenya. A year later, the pair announced they were expecting a child together. The headlines read: “Angie’s Joy, Jen’s Pain,” “How She Stole Brad,” “Jen Breaks Down.” It was the “love triangle” heard ’round the world ― apparently, it still is.","On Thursday, Aniston and her husband Theroux ― who began dating in 2011 (“Jen Finds Happiness!”) and married in August 2015 (“Wedding And A Baby!”) ― announced they’ve been separated since last year. The news came a little over a year after Jolie filed for divorce from the father of her six children, Pitt, amid claims of child abuse. (He was eventually cleared of the charges against him.)","Cue the Pitt-Aniston reunion campaign on social media:","When asked why they craved another Jen-Brad romance, Twitter users happily provided their own answers.","“They look good together and seem like a good match,” Mike Starcher said. “We want them to be happy.”","“I honestly think that they have always still had feelings for each other,” Allison Alderton added.","“It’s obviously very private and none of our business but life would come to full circle for both of them,” Kushbu S. Mehta explained. “Blame the number of Mills and Boons I’ve read in school! #hopelessromantic.”","Before deleting their tweet, a user with the display name Pantera Negra said it simply: “Want two hot people to do it.”","And then there were the dissenters. Cherie MacDonald said, “He cheated on her, why would she want to be with him again? There is someone perfect out there for Jennifer but it’s not Brad in my opinion.”","“I would rather Angelina date Justin,” Will English joked over text, “or become BFF with Jen, like Debbie Reynolds and Liz Taylor.”","Ultimately, Smerling believes we get “hooked” on what happens next in a celebrity’s life in the same way we get hooked on soap operas or reality TV. “We’re obsessed with the drama and the scandal,” she said. “For some people, it ― albeit, unfortunately ― is like a drug. We as a society are addicted to escapism in many forms, and celebrity fanatics are no exception.”","But at the end of the day, it’s “damaging” for people to invest in a celebrity couple so passionately.","“The inclination to get wrapped up is totally natural. But our cardboard-cutout culture has de-humanized celebrities, to the point where they’re perfect in our eyes. That’s where it takes an unnatural turn,” she said. “We have forgotten that they’re human and experience real emotion, real depression and certainly real mental health issues. And it’s because we think they’re perfect that we lack sympathy, and automatically resort to feeling giddy when the plot thickens in their lives.”","Henderson agrees.","“It is good to remind ourselves that celebrities are normal people facing the same basic human emotions and struggles that everyone else does, especially if you find your emotional responses to events in their lives seeming a bit disproportionate,” she told HuffPost. “These are normal people who experience the same emotions as everyone else, but generally speaking with a much larger bank account with which to live their glamorous lives.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a872f732100003800601781.jpeg?cache=WWTaK1DTG7&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"SPORTS","headline":"U.S. Figure Skater Nathan Chen Is A Total Mess Again At Winter Olympics","authors":"Ron Dicker","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/us-figure-skater-nathan-chen-is-a-mess-again-at-winter-olympics_us_5a86a46fe4b004fc3190cf61","short_description":"\"I'm upset, obviously,\" he said after bombing in the men's short program.","date":"2018-02-16"},"articleContent":["U.S. figure skater Nathan Chen is falling short of the hype ― and just plain falling at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea.","The 18-year-old two-time U.S. champion struggled again on Friday, tumbling to 17th place in the men’s short program.","He crashed on a quad lutz, stepped out of a quad toeloop and stumbled on a triple axel, placing his hand on the ice, Reuters noted.","“I’m upset, obviously,” he said. “There’s nothing to do but move on from here.”","NBC commentator Tara Lipinski said Chen looked “nervous and tentative.”","In his Olympics debut last week, Chen also fell and made other mistakes during the team event.

The pair moved in together after Joyce separated from his wife last year. Journalists and politicians have described the affair as an open secret.","The recent reports exposed how Campion was shunted between the offices of different government politicians as the affair became more widely known, provoking claims of nepotism and favoritism. Ministers’ relatives and partners are not allowed to be appointed to executive government offices without approval from the prime minister.","Joyce has been under pressure to resign, and Turnbull under pressure to force him to leave, for the last two weeks. However, the governing coalition that includes both Turnbull and Joyce’s parties has only a one-seat majority in Parliament. If Joyce resigns, his party might not win the election for his vacated seat, and their coalition could lose the majority.","Turnbull is due to fly to the United States for a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump next week, which would have left Joyce filling in as acting prime minister. But Turnbull announced Thursday that Joyce would be taking a week of leave instead and that another government member would take the role.","Later on Thursday, Turnbull made a second surprise statement, announcing that the ministerial code would be updated to expressly forbid sexual relations between ministers and staff. (American lawmakers supported a similar initiative last week.)","When some Australian members of Parliament floated such a plan after the initial Joyce revelations, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop commented, “the Government has no business interfering into people’s personal lives and we wouldn’t want to cross the line” ― but by Thursday, Turnbull had seemingly come around to the concept when he said he would add new lines to the ministerial standards.","“Ministers, regardless of whether they are married or single, must not engage in sexual relations with their staff. Doing so will constitute a breach of the standards,” Turnbull said.","“There was a different culture here that had gone on for a long time. I think many women in this building, who work in this building, understand very powerfully what I am saying,” he added. “This is a change I am making from today. You can argue it should have been made years ago, but you can’t live your life backwards.”","Turnbull all but signaled that he would prefer for Joyce to resign, telling a packed media conference that Joyce had inflicted “terrible hurt and humiliation” on his family and new partner, had made “a shocking error of judgment” and “set off a world of woe for those women and appalled all of us.”","Joyce, meanwhile, called Turnbull’s response to the scandal “inept” in an extraordinary press conference on Friday morning.","“Comments by the prime minister yesterday at his press conference, with regards to that, I have to say that, in many instances ... they caused further harm,” he said. “I believe they were in many instances inept and most definitely in many instances unnecessary.”","Joyce has been embroiled in other controversies, most notably for the revelation that he had Kiwi citizenship, which led to his expulsion from Parliament and ineligibility to run for election (the Australian Constitution bans dual citizens from running for election). Joyce renounced his Kiwi citizenship and successfully regained his seat, returning to Parliament late last year.","He also attracted worldwide attention after threatening to euthanize Johnny Depp’s dogs when the actor’s then-wife Amber Heard smuggled two Yorkshire terriers into Australia while filming the latest “Pirates of the Caribbean” film in 2015."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a86231a2000004d00eaf047.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"WORLD NEWS","headline":"If Chloe Kim Had Grown Up In South Korea, Would She Have Won The Gold Medal?","authors":"Seungho Baek","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chloe-kim-grown-up-south-korea-speculation_us_5a870d2ee4b00bc49f43a253","short_description":"The story of the snowboarding phenom's upbringing sounds quite familiar to us in South Korea.","date":"2018-02-16"},"articleContent":["Snowboarding star Chloe Kim was born to Korean immigrant parents in the United States in 2000. Her father, Jong-jin Kim, had left South Korea in 1982 to study at the University of California.","When she was just 6 years old, Chloe won a junior snowboarding competition. Seeing his daughter’s great potential, her father quit his job to support her career. His reason was impressive. As Chloe told the Los Angeles Times, he announced to her mother, “I’m done working, I’m going to make my daughter an Olympian.”","“I’m not saying he forced me to snowboard, I genuinely love snowboarding, so it was nice he was that determined to bring me to the Olympics,” Chloe said in an interview with Reuters.","It was her father’s unconditional support combined with Chloe’s natural gift and hard work that ultimately led her to earn the title of the youngest Olympic gold medalist in women’s halfpipe snowboarding.","Chloe’s story sounds very familiar to us in South Korea.","It’s well known that world-class golfer Se-ri Pak’s golf teacher was her father. He saw her potential when she first visited a golf course in the sixth grade, and he started training her intensively. The lessons went on even in pouring rain; she once practiced putting over 300 times in the rain.","“I practiced very hard because I knew that I couldn’t be the best in the world if I took time off like others do,” Pak said in an interview with South Korea’s MBC. But her father was also always there.","The story is similar for Yuna Kim, the 2010 Olympic gold medalist in figure skating. “After discovering Yuna’s talent, I devoted my whole life to her skating career. Not only investing the majority of our time together, but also reorienting our lives around skating,” Kim’s mother, Mi-hee Park, said in an interview with Yeo-sung-dong-ah magazine. Park gave up her own life to support her daughter at Taereung Korea National Training Center and Gwacheon ice skating rink.","The father of Park Ji-sung, the former footballer at Manchester United, also quit his job to focus on supporting his son’s career. When there were rumors about Park’s relationships with actresses, his father said, “I can’t agree on accepting an actress as my daughter-in-law,” reflecting just how deeply he was involved in his son’s entire life.","Had she grown up in South Korea, would Chloe Kim and her family have had a story like these star athletes? Or would she have been a victim of Korea’s addiction to private, after-hours tutoring academies? People on Twitter seemed to have some opinions. A BBC article headlined “Would Chloe Kim have made it as a South Korean?” listed sample comments from the country’s largest portal website.","“If she grew up in South Korea, she would be stuck on the bus going to hagwon [private educational institutes] all day,” one user suggested, while another said, “If she grew up in South Korea, she would be serving at a ski resort restaurant.” The BBC article added that some Koreans were skeptical about fellow Koreans’ interest in Chloe now that she’s famous.","Any parent would want to support and develop special talents in their children, but this desire is especially strong among Korean parents. It is a very “Korean” way of raising children to register them at a number of private, after-hours tutoring academies in order to eventually send them to the top colleges, or for the parents to quit their jobs to focus on their children’s athletic careers. If her snowboarding talent were not discovered at such a young age, a born-in-South-Korea Chloe would have been forced to study hard. Korean children are expected to be subordinate to their parents to compensate for the sacrifices that their parents have made for them.","The BBC article points out a few reasons why Chloe’s being raised in the United States was not entirely irrelevant to her becoming a star snowboarder. South Korea is not the best place to pursue many sports. The estimated 2017 budget for the Korean Sport & Olympic Committee included 113 billion South Korean won (the local currency) allocated for grassroots sports, which is less than half the budget for elite sports (245 billion won), even though the committee’s total budget last year was increased by 53 percent compared to that of 2016.","If Chloe had not been born in the United States, where various sports activities are readily available, she might have had less chance of being exposed to snowboarding at such a young age. (Yuna Kim is an exceptional case in that she managed to become a figure skating star in South Korea, a desert of figure skating opportunities.)","In South Korea, if athletes prove their talent in one sport, they get a chance to pursue training at Taereung Korea National Training Center with other national team athletes and athletic hopefuls. Until a few years ago, athletes had to apologize for not winning a gold medal in international competitions. The pressure to be ranked within the top 10 in international competitions often led to violence within the national team. It is hard to think a person like Chloe would have maintained her interest in snowboarding in such an environment.","Another aspect of Korean society noted in the BBC article is the sense of hopelessness among South Korea’s young adults. If you don’t have a special talent or if your parents are not able to support you while you develop your talent, you are “stuck on the bus going to hagwon all day” or “serving at a ski resort restaurant.” Even if you graduate from college, it is never easy to get a job. Whether or not they could be Olympians, young adults in South Korea want more opportunity in their own country.","This story was first published by HuffPost Korea."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a870eed2100005000601735.jpeg?cache=wgcgzBIVX5&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"BLACK VOICES","headline":"Desegregating Blood: A Civil Rights Struggle To Remember","authors":"The Conversation US, Editorial Partner","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/desegregating-blood-a-civil-rights-struggle-to-remember_us_5a85fdb1e4b088d92ef35ab4","short_description":"African-Americans did – in the end – force the Red Cross to include them as donors.","date":"2018-02-16"},"articleContent":["By Thomas A Guglielmo , George Washington University, for The Conversation","In December 1941, a few days after the bombing of Pearl Harbor and the U.S. entry into World War II, a Detroit mother named Sylvia Tucker visited her local Red Cross donor center to give blood.","Having heard the “soul-stirring” appeals for blood donors on her radio, she was determined to do her part. But when she arrived at the center, the supervisor turned her away. “Orders from the National Offices,” he explained, “barred Negro blood donors at this time.”","“Shocked” and “grieved,” Tucker left in tears, later penning a letter of protest about the whole ordeal to first lady Eleanor Roosevelt.","Today, this discriminatory blood program and African-Americans’ determined opposition to it are long forgotten, despite the fact that a few scholars, including Spencie Love, Susan E. Lederer, Sarah E. Chinn, and myself, have explored the topic.","This history is worth remembering. It provides an antidote to facile, feel-good stories about the “Good War,” stories that scholars such as Michael C.C. Adams and Kenneth D. Rose have long refuted but that live on in museum exhibits, blockbuster films, best-selling books and war memorials.","The story of how blood got desegregated also reminds Americans that, as novelist Ralph Ellison wrote nearly a half-century ago, “The black American … puts pressure upon the nation to live up to its ideals.”","Historian Robin D.G. Kelley puts it more broadly: “The marginal and excluded have done the most to make democracy work in America.”","In an age of resurgent racism, Ellison’s and Kelley’s words are especially important and timely.","‘A tremendous thing’","The Red Cross Blood Donor Program began in early 1941 – and went on to collect blood from millions of Americans that the military shipped to soldiers fighting overseas.","“If I could reach all America,” asserted General Dwight D. Eisenhower at the end of the war, “there is one thing I would like to do – thank them for blood plasma and whole blood. It has been a tremendous thing.”","Tremendous indeed: The blood program saved many lives. But it also initially excluded African-American donors like Sylvia Tucker. When it did accept them, in January 1942, it did so on a segregated basis.","Never mind that scientists saw no relationship between race and blood and that one of the world’s leading authorities on blood banking at the time, and the director of the Red Cross’s pilot blood program, was an African-American scientist named Dr. Charles Drew. Never mind that Nazi Germany had its own Aryan-only blood policy or that America’s principal rhetorical war aims concerned democracy and freedom.","To what extent military commanders segregated blood in the field was, during the war and afterwards, a matter of some debate. Officially, at least, the distinction between bloods remained in place for years. It was not until 1950 that the Red Cross stopped requiring the segregation of so-called Negro blood. And it was not until the late 1960s and early 1970s that Southern states such as Arkansas and Louisiana overturned similar requirements.","A forgotten civil rights struggle","In one internal memorandum, the Red Cross called its donor program democratic, since “the point of view of the majority … ” – which its leaders assumed demanded blood segregation – “must be taken into account in a democracy.”","But many blacks and their allies had a very different idea about democracy, one that required all citizens be treated equally and without regard to race. They fought tirelessly throughout the war years to make that idea a reality, not simply in the military, in the workplace and in Hollywood films but also in the blood program.","These many battles constituted a nascent, surging, and, today, too-often-overlooked civil rights struggle that helped pave the way for the more famous movement of the postwar years.","Nearly all the major civil rights organizations of the day, including the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the March on Washington Movement and even the upstart Committee (later, Congress) of Racial Equality, made changing blood policy a top priority. One statement from a group of the nation’s most prominent black leaders put it this way:","“In justice to what we know to be the practically unanimous sentiment among Negroes in America, we affirm the need for alteration of the segregated blood plasma policy.”","Black newspapers, enormously popular and important at time, also protested blood segregation and exclusion, regularly featuring front-page stories, boldface headlines and blistering editorials on the subject.","In January 1942, for example, the African-American weekly the Cleveland Call and Post published an “editorial in rhyme”:","“The cross of Red, that burned so bright In fire, storm and flood Is now the crooked Nazi sign That spurns a Negro blood!”","Wide-ranging activists","Activism on this issue extended well beyond these traditional places.","Labor unions, Christian and Jewish groups, local interracial committees, scientific organizations and the New Jersey State Legislature all spoke out against blood segregation.","The Communist Party of Cuyahoga County in Ohio held a rally of 3,500 people, condemning blood policy as “Barbarian Hitlerism.”","An interracial group of precocious junior high schoolers at Harlem’s Public School 43 tested (with the help of their science teachers) the blood of a black student and of a white student. Finding no difference, they wrote an article in the school paper, made and distributed hundreds of posters, and held a public meeting – all in opposition to the Red Cross policy.","The most widespread form of protest, however, came from thousands of ordinary African-Americans who refused to donate blood and money to the Red Cross.","While roughly 10 percent of the U.S. population at the time, blacks made up less than 1 percent of all blood donors.","African-Americans contributed generously to the Treasury Department’s Defense Bonds: It is not a lack of patriotism that explains their halfhearted response to blood drives. The reason was a determined opposition to race-based exclusion and segregation.","Expressing these feelings best was a high school student from Cleveland named Geraldyne Ghess. Her poem appeared in the local black newspaper:","Had I wealth, I’d burn it all; Not one cent for the Red Cross call. Our money is good … our blood is bad. But, still that shouldn’t make us mad. Are they afraid they’ll all turn black? Is that why our blood they lack? Their skins are white as snow … it’s well.

They were charged because they, and the companies employing them, paid for propaganda to interfere in the election.","It is not illegal for a foreign national to voice an opinion on U.S. politics or candidates. If you aren’t a U.S. citizen and you want to tell your Twitter fam ― whether that’s 342 followers or 10,000 ― that people shouldn’t vote for Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton, that’s cool. You can even volunteer in real life if you want. It is, however, not cool if you spend money to promote that message through advertising on a digital platform.","That is partly what the Russians at the center of Friday’s indictment are accused of doing. The indictment states that the 13 Russians and the three companies employing them defrauded the U.S. government by inhibiting the functions of the Federal Election Commission, which oversees campaign finance law, and the Department of Justice, which enforces the Foreign Agent Registration Act.","“From at least April 2016 through November 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators, while concealing their Russian identities and ORGANIZATION affiliation through false personas, began to produce, purchase, and post advertisements on U.S. social media and other online sites expressly advocating for the election of then-candidate Trump or expressly opposing Clinton,” the indictment states. “Defendants and their co-conspirators did not report their expenditures to the Federal Election Commission, or register as foreign agents with the U.S. Department of Justice.”","By failing to register as foreign agents, as required for any foreign propaganda under the law, and disclose their election-related spending, as required for any domestic political propaganda, the Russians and their employers engaged in a conspiracy to prevent the enforcement of the law banning foreign nationals from independently spending money to promote or oppose a campaign, according to the indictment, and they stole the identities of Americans and used fraudulent identities to illegally open up bank accounts in the U.S. By September 2016, the interference campaign was costing $1.25 million per month, according to the filing.","“The foreign national ban applies to prohibit the foreign actor from making any independent expenditure or electioneering communication or any other expenditure for the purpose of influencing an election,” Brendan Fischer, a lawyer for the campaign finance watchdog Campaign Legal Center, told HuffPost.","In the indictment, special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating whether the Trump campaign conspired with the Russian government to influence the 2016 election, presented only paid digital advertisements that could be read as explicitly for or against a candidate. Many other advertisements, tweets and posts by the fake social media accounts, even those that may positively or negatively portray a candidate, would not implicate campaign finance laws.","“[Mueller] only focused in on the ads that expressly advocated,” Fischer said. “He didn’t get into the broader array of ads that didn’t mention a candidate or run near an election.”","The ads presented in the indictment included messages like, “You know a great number of black people support us saying that #HillaryClintonIsNotMyPresident,” “Ohio Wants Hillary 4 Prison,” Hillary is a Satan, and her crimes and lies had proved just how evil she is,” and “Trump is our only hope for a better future!”","But there are a number of ways to craft an advertisement to avoid legal problems. Just ask the billionaire Koch brothers. And that matters for the future enforcement of these laws as foreign nationals continue to wage similar paid influence campaigns on digital platforms.","“The concern is that the signal this indictment sends is that foreign nationals are only prohibited from running digital political ads that expressly advocate for or against candidates,” Fischer said, adding that “we’ve just signaled to foreign nationals about how they can word their candidate and election ads next time and avoid breaking the law.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8752f01e000037007abf52.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"QUEER VOICES","headline":"Advertisers Drop Daily Mail After Homophobic Column About Tom Daley Baby News","authors":"Curtis M.

The court said the map was designed to benefit Republicans so severely that it violated the state’s constitution.","The court-drawn map was a last resort after the state Supreme Court ruled Jan. 22 that the one in place was unconstitutional. The court gave the legislature and governor about three weeks to agree on a map, and said it would draw its own if they did not. Republican leaders put forward a proposal that the legislature didn’t vote on and that Gov. Tom Wolf (D) rejected. Wolf said the map still amounted to an unfair partisan gerrymander, a claim backed up by several statistical analyses.","Republicans maintain that the U.S. Constitution only grants the legislature, not the state Supreme Court, the ability to draw a congressional map. But Justice Samuel Alito rejected that argument when he declined an appeal from GOP lawmakers earlier this month. The Supreme Court recognized in 2015 that legislatures did not have the exclusive authority to draw congressional districts.","Legal experts say Alito’s decision sent a strong signal that the Republican claim lacked merit. The plaintiffs in the case also argued that lawmakers could not appeal the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court because the challenge to the congressional map only involved a controversy under the Pennsylvania state constitution, not the federal one.","Drew Crompton, a top aide to Senate President Pro Tempore Joseph Scarnati (R), said he believed federal courts might be willing to take another look after the state Supreme Court proposed its map ― and that it’s “certainly probable” the GOP will take action in federal court when it does.","“No one can read tea leaves of a one-line Alito sentence,” Crompton said Friday. “I think historically the tea leaves you can read by the U.S. Supreme Court is they don’t like to exercise their jurisdiction unless everything else has been tried and answered before you come to the U.S. Supreme Court.”","Once the state Supreme Court proposed its map, Crompton said, the parties would have gone through every step outlined by the court’s order. He also said the GOP legal team is figuring out who it would name as a defendant in a new lawsuit, because it could not sue the state Supreme Court.","After Alito rejected the GOP claims, Richard Hasen, an election law expert and professor at the University of California, Irvine, said there were several legal doctrines that “pretty much preclude a collateral attack in federal court on the state court’s order.” One example is the Rooker-Feldman doctrine, which says the U.S. Supreme Court is the only federal court that can review a state court decision.","Daniel Jacobson, a lawyer at Arnold & Porter who helped represent the plaintiffs in the case, accused Republicans of wasting taxpayer money.","“Speaker [Mike] Turzai and Senator Scarnati seem intent on making more frivolous arguments that the U.S. Supreme Court has already rejected,” he said in a statement. “They are wasting taxpayer money and the resources of the courts, and we will respond appropriately to any such lawsuit.”","While Republicans argue the state Supreme Court is usurping its right to draw a congressional map, Democrats say lawmakers had plenty of time to act and just failed to do so.","The court said in January that a new congressional map would be “available” on Feb. 19 and hired Stanford professor Nathaniel Persily to help it draw new lines. Republicans, Wolf and the plaintiffs in the case have all submitted proposals to the court to consider as it comes up with a new map."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a874a2a2000003900eaf200.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"SPORTS","headline":"Report: College Hoops Corruption Case Poised To Wreak Havoc On Top Programs","authors":"Pete Thamel, Yahoo Sports","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/college-basketball-corruption_us_5a862b94e4b00bc49f426f7e","short_description":"The soundtrack to the three federal basketball corruption cases is essentially a ticking time bomb, which will inevitably explode.","date":"2018-02-16"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"QUEER VOICES","headline":"Lush Puts Trans Rights Movement In The Spotlight With New Campaign","authors":"Curtis M.

The bill never made it out of committee.","Wait … what does this scrub jay have to do with guns?","Actually, nothing ― except that the longtime chief lobbyist for the National Rifle Association in the state hated the bird, and made that distaste clear to everyone in the Tallahassee state Capitol. By 1999, Marion Hammer had already pushed through a string of gun-rights laws and would in the coming years shepherd many more onto the books, including Florida’s notorious “stand your ground” act. The two-and-a-half-ounce bird, the only avian species endemic to peninsular Florida, never stood a chance.","“She was apoplectic about it,” said Charlie Crist, who as a Republican was elected the state’s education commissioner in 2000, would later become a GOP governor, and is now a Democratic congressman from the St. Petersburg area. “I couldn’t understand it.”","In a committee hearing, Hammer ― who earlier in the 1990s served as the national NRA’s president ― praised the mockingbird, which had been the state bird for decades and which she liked personally, while ridiculing the scrub jay.","“They eat the eggs of other birds. That’s robbery and murder,” she testified. Responding to scrub jay supporters’ statements that they were so gentle as to eat out of people’s hands, she said: “Begging for food isn’t sweet. It’s lazy and it’s a welfare mentality.”","Neither Hammer nor NRA national officials responded to HuffPost’s queries on Thursday.","Hammer, of course, is just the group’s liaison to the state legislature. Behind her is the familiar well-oiled machine of gun industry money doling out campaign contributions and ― more important ― a turnout operation that each election brings to the polls legions of voters more interested in firearms than any other issue.","In an entirely Republican-run state like Florida, the NRA has been able to get what it wants by keeping GOP lawmakers scared of challenges in the party primaries. “The real problem here is the Republican incumbent worried about getting primaried,” he said Thursday. “That’s the chokehold.”","He said the NRA’s power, long recognized in Congress, is perhaps even more entrenched in Tallahassee, meaning even the shooting deaths of 17 students and staff in a well-to-do Fort Lauderdale suburb will likely change nothing.","“It is unfortunate,” Crist said. “It breaks your heart.”","Rick Wilson, a longtime GOP consultant in Tallahassee and a gun enthusiast himself, said the state has a long history of protecting firearm ownership, with 1.3 million people currently holding concealed carry permits and more licensed gun dealers per capita than any other state.","“This is a state that made up its mind about guns a long time ago,” he said.","Wilson said the NRA has been effective at mobilizing that sentiment into votes, particularly in the more conservative areas north of Interstate 4, which stretches across Florida from Tampa to Daytona Beach. A Democrat who even mildly supports gun limitations of any type simply has no chance in that part of the state.","“It is the fastest way for Democrats to disqualify themselves, no matter what other attributes they have,” he said.","The practical effect of that in recent decades has been a series of NRA-written bills getting turned into laws by a pliant GOP state legislature.","Just minutes before news broke of the 1999 shootings at Columbine High School in Colorado, newly elected Gov. Jeb Bush handed Hammer the pen he’d just used to sign a bill allowing out-of-state concealed permit holders to carry their guns in Florida, too.","A few years later came a bill to codify the common-law “castle doctrine” ― the idea that those confronted with intruders in their homes could use deadly force rather than retreat. Not much later came the expansion of castle doctrine to “stand your ground” regardless of the location ― which was key in the acquittal of the man who shot and killed Trayvon Martin in 2012.","“If you could walk away safely, you were obliged to, rather than use deadly force. Now, deadly force can become a first resort, not a last resort,” said Dan Gelber, a longtime Democratic state legislator and now the mayor of Miami Beach. “They’ve given this right to drunks, They’ve given this right to terrible shots. They’ve given this right to people with terrible judgement. They’ve given this right, literally, to gang members.”","Gelber said the NRA has continued to stay on offense in Tallahassee, year after year pushing bills not because they are a high priority, but to keep Republican lawmakers in line and gun-rights advocates energized.","One example: the NRA even won a state law eliminating the lists of guns passing through pawnshops that police had been using to investigate crimes. “They made it illegal to keep the list,” he laughed.","Gelber said he was relatively safe in his liberal, heavily Democratic part of the state, but that many other lawmakers felt like they could not oppose the NRA’s demands. “If you speak against them, you are on an enemies list,” he said. “I used to stand up pretty regularly to the NRA. I felt pretty alone.”","Wilson said the NRA could not accomplish anything unless it had a motivated membership willing to reliably get to the polls for a single issue. And, as it stands, gun-rights voters are more energized than gun-control voters, he said.","“Here’s the political calculus: If your passion for your issue is greater than the other guy’s passion for their issue, you win,” Wilson said.","He said that he personally would be willing to have a reasonable debate about access to guns, but that too many Democrats are too ready to lump him in with violent criminals and infringe his firearm-owning rights.","“I’m a hunter. I’m a target shooter. I’m a long-range target shooter. But you know what I’ve never done? Shot anybody,” he said.","Any attempt to pass gun control in Tallahassee would also have to get past Hammer, who is now in her fourth decade expanding gun rights in Florida. Last spring, she even took time to again take on her old nemesis, the scrub jay. Different lawmakers (the original sponsor died in 2003) again tried to make it the state bird.","“The scrub jay is not an impressive looking bird,” she wrote in a Tampa Bay Times op-ed. “And, unlike the mockingbird, the scrub jay can’t even sing.”","The bill did not pass, and the scrub jay is still not the state bird."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a86000821000039006015d9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"BLACK VOICES","headline":"Dwyane Wade Calls Out Laura Ingraham For Telling LeBron To 'Shut Up And Dribble'","authors":"Jenna Amatulli","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dwyane-wade-laura-ingraham-lebron-shut-up-dribble_us_5a86f808e4b05c2bcaca3d67","short_description":"\"The president has given everyone the courage to live their truths,” Wade tweeted.","date":"2018-02-16"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Aaron Paul And Lauren Parsekian Welcome First Child Together","authors":"Carly Ledbetter","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/breaking-dad-aaron-paul-and-wife-lauren-welcome-their-first-child-together_us_5a86fb1ce4b05c2bcaca3f41","short_description":"The two are clearly smitten with their baby girl.","date":"2018-02-16"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"SPORTS","headline":"Sexual Assault Clinics Offered At Winter Olympics For The First Time","authors":"Willa Frej","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sexual-assault-clinics-olympics_us_5a82950fe4b0892a03526a8d","short_description":"They're a safe space for spectators and the workforce to report misconduct and receive counseling.","date":"2018-02-16"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Here's What You Didn't See On 'The Bachelor Winter Games'","authors":"Emma Gray, Claire Fallon, and Nick Offenberg","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-bachelor-winter-games-what-you-didnt-see_us_5a8743cce4b05c2bcacab5e8","short_description":"Contestant Michael Garofola broke down the behind-the-scenes fun that ended up on the cutting room floor.","date":"2018-02-16"},"articleContent":["Watching “The Bachelor Winter Games” requires a real time commitment from even Bachelor Nation’s most ardent members.","Since the show only runs for two weeks ― to coincide with the 2018 Winter Olympics ― viewers are expected to consume three nights of “Bachelor”-related content each week.

We were, at one point, sitting around the island in the kitchen and there was a big talk with everyone, and basically they denoted me to be the speaker on behalf of apologizing for the United States and explaining what was going on. I jokingly tweeted this, but feel like my role there was to improve United States diplomatic relations with our foreign allies.”","2. The “Bachelor” anthem was written by the high-school girl who sang it!","“That was a local high school student who wrote the song herself. They did not give it to her,” said Michael. “Chris Harrison introduced her [at the opening ceremonies] ... I think her mission was to write something funny and cheesy.”","3. Some of the contestants weren’t initially told the competition would include real Olympic sports.","“When I was asked to do this show, I was like, ‘Look, it’s been a while since I’ve gone skiing, it’s been a while since I’ve gone ice skating,’” said Michael. “They said, ‘Oh, Michael G., don’t worry. We don’t wanna get sued by the Olympics! We’re not gonna do real winter sports. We can’t do that. We’re gonna do like, snowball fights and who can build a snowman fastest.’”","Welp.","4. Michael had some potential love interests that never went anywhere, so they got cut.","On Jenny, from Finland: “I was sort of talking to Jenny. Nothing really developed there. She spoke English very well but she was very insecure and self-conscious about her ability to speak English ... She had some difficulty and I think that ultimately for me, if I’m gonna date someone long-distance from Helsinki I need that to be like, ‘Wow, I’ve never found this kind of feeling before.’ Jenny is lovely but I think we were trying and then it just didn’t happen. There was no making out.”","On Lesley, from the USA: ”I love Lesley and Dean together. I love both of them individually as well.

Atoms are incredibly small, but he used a few tricks to make the atom visible to the human eye in a photograph.","The researcher first turned the atom of strontium, the 38th element on the periodic table, into an ion ― an atom with a positive or negative net electric charge. Nadlinger then used currents that four needle-shaped electrodes emitted to isolate and suspend the ion. He illuminated it with a blue-violet colored laser and took the photo through the window of a vacuum chamber, using an exposure time of 30 seconds.","The pale dot that Nadlinger captured is not the true size of the strontium atom, however. The atom is actually re-emitting the light from the lasers to create a glow that is hundreds of times wider than its radius.","“I think people are ... surprised by how big the atom looks here,” Nadlinger told LiveScience. “I hope I’m not undoing 100 years of science education with this photo — atoms actually are unbelievably small!”","The research council received over 100 entries this year for its fifth science photography competition.

They also feature photos of the suspect: an extreme closeup in the Washington Post, and in The New York Times a screenshot from his Instagram account that shows him brandishing a gun.","There’s no question that we humans are deeply curious about those who commit crimes. Our literary tradition, from the myths and tales of the ancient world, to Shakespeare, to Dostoevsky, to the latest police procedural on Netflix, indicates that we have always been fascinated by “the criminal mind,” which is, after all, not so different from our own minds. But, as a former reporter and editor who studies the media and who teaches journalism ethics, I ask the question: Can stoking this fascination cause harm?","Obsession with deviance","Who among us, after all, has not at least fantasized about inflicting bodily harm on an enemy or taking what did not belong to us? At least two considerations constrain us: law and custom. The threat of punishment and the moral injunctions against crimes against persons and property are such compelling reasons to stick to the straight and narrow that we marvel at those who stray.","So the journalistic impulse to learn what we can about a mass murderer by interviewing acquaintances and combing through his social media accounts is understandable. The question that arises with every mass shooting is whether these instant illustrated profiles of the killers do more harm than good.","Might all that attention inspire a similarly deranged person to commit a “copycat” crime? Might the photos in particular, especially the ones that include weaponry, further glamorize the killer as a figure worthy of emulation?","“Attention is attention and this is the ultimate attention-getting,” the principal of a West Paducah, Kentucky, high school told The New York Times after shootings at his school in 1997 and at a school in Springfield, Oregon, six months later. “I mean, getting your picture on the cover of Time and Newsweek. That is going out in a blaze of glory.”","The most compelling anecdotal evidence of a copycat effect may have come from the 26-year-old who killed 10 students at Umpqua Community College in Oregon in 2015.","Incentive to kill?","In a blog post about the television journalist who killed two of his former colleagues in Virginia earlier that year, he wrote, “I have noticed that so many people like him are all alone and unknown, yet when they spill a little blood, the whole world knows who they are. A man who was known by no one, is now known by everyone. His face splashed across every screen, his name across the lips of every person on the planet, all in the course of one day. Seems the more people you kill, the more you’re in the limelight.”","Writing in The Atlantic in 2012, sociologist Zeynep Tufekci argued that the news media ought to tone down coverage of shooting sprees in the same way it modulated its coverage of suicides when it was feared that such deaths had become “contagious” in the 1980s. Among Tufekci’s recommendations: Avoid specifying the killer’s choice of weapons, avoid quoting his writings or utterances, delay releasing the suspect’s name and, to not add to the traumatizing of victims and their loved ones, resist the urge to interview victims and loved ones.","A further argument, in my view, against the snap profile is that it plays into the hands of those who resist any attempts at gun control by focusing on the incident as primarily the expression of a mental health problem rather than a gun availability problem.","Killer profiles","When it comes to mass shootings, defenders of reporting on the suspect’s background note that evidence of a “copycat” effect is scant: Though we seem to lurch from one such tragedy to the next, there are in fact too few of them and the human mind is too unknowable to be able to draw a clear causal connection from news coverage of any one crime to the commission of subsequent crimes.","Indeed, proponents argue that such coverage might actually prevent future carnage. The profile comprises a set of warning signs that we would do well to heed if we are ever confronted with similar hints of a propensity to violence and cruelty.","Tufekci acknowledged the public’s interest in mass shootings and that such incidents are likely to have more than one cause. “But it’s important to recognize,” she wrote, “that sensational news coverage is, increasingly, part of the mix of events that contributes to these rampages.”","As far back as the Columbine shootings in 1999, mental health professionals have been urging journalists to focus less on the perpetrators of shooting rampages and more on the victims. Judging from the coverage of the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, that advice is still going largely unheeded.","Russell Frank is Associate Professor of Communications at Pennsylvania State University.

Claudia Tenney (R-N.Y.) said Wednesday during an interview on upstate New York radio station WUTQ. “He could be the worst guy in the world, but now we’re getting into prosecution, as far as I know. I guess there was an issue about ― maybe the FBI knew about it ― but really, is this what we’re talking about at this point?”","She added: “Once they found out about it, they let the guy go. Why are we still talking about it?”","Porter resigned from the White House on Feb. 7 after both his ex-wives publicly accused him of physical, verbal and emotional abuse. He has denied the allegations.","Porter hasn’t been charged with any criminal offense. That, Tenney said repeatedly, means the accusations most likely are fake.","“There might be an element of truth to [the allegations], but why wasn’t this guy prosecuted before if these things were happening?” she asked.","“Has this guy committed a crime? Has anyone prosecuted him for his alleged abuse against the past wives?”","One of the radio hosts pointed out that because the abuse allegations affected Porter’s ability to get high-level security clearance, he was susceptible to blackmail. Tenney quickly dismissed that issue, saying domestic abuse is not a “crime of character.”","“Blackmail and domestic situations don’t really line up. They’re not crimes of character,” she said. “They’re character, but they’re not dishonesty. To me ... just because somebody has been accused of these things ― and even if they’re true ― that doesn’t necessarily mean he’s going to be dishonest and commit blackmail.”","Tenney blamed Republican Party reluctance to embrace Trump’s presidency as a reason he may have made a rushed decision to employ Porter.","“When you don’t have anyone supporting you that’s part of the structure, you’ve got to find people that aren’t always the best and you find that out later because you literally just need someone to do the job,” Tenney said.","“Obviously the issue of sexual assault or any of those things, anything like that is very serious, but we’re also getting into the minutiae of what’s going on with the White House,” Tenney said.","“There are so many things happening with this White House, people coming and going, and new people.”","Listen to Tenney’s full interview below.","Tenney cited her experience as a divorce lawyer in casting doubt on the accusations by both of Porter’s ex-wives.","“I’ve had divorce cases where terrible abuse is going on and the person doesn’t do anything about it, usually it’s the wife, sometimes it’s the husband,” she said. “But in cases like this, I’ve seen cases where somebody hurts themselves and they go in and blame their ex-husband. Or their ex-husband to be. The person wasn’t even there.”","President Donald Trump and his administration have been criticized for how the White House handled the accusations. Trump and other aides continued to defend Porter, even after he resigned.","Meredith Kelly, communications director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, criticized Tenney’s comments on Friday as “shameful and frankly disgusting.”","“Survivors of domestic abuse have a hard enough time coming forward without Members of Congress casting doubt on their stories,” Kelly said in a press release. “Tenney’s disturbing smear of two women confronting their abuser shows why she needs to be replaced.”","Tenney did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a87115d210000500060173b.jpeg?cache=zZgIWRrzPb&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"QUEER VOICES","headline":"'RuPaul's Drag Race' Season 10 Premiere Date Announced","authors":"James Michael Nichols","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rupauls-drag-race-season-10_us_5a86fd19e4b00bc49f437939","short_description":"Are you ready for two hours of \"Drag Race\" every single week?","date":"2018-02-16"},"articleContent":["It’s hard to believe it, but the 10th season of cult hit reality show “ RuPaul’s Drag Race” is right around the corner.","VH1 announced Friday that we can expect the next season of the massively successful drag institution on Thursday, March 22 ― and each episode will be a whopping 90 minutes long.","Not only that, but VH1 is bringing back “Drag Race” aftershow “Untucked,” which will air immediately following each episode.","That’s two hours of “Drag Race” every single week.","“To celebrate a decade of Drag Race we’ve pulled out all the stops.

Those claims were widely circulated by news outlets on Thursday.","As of Thursday evening, it was seemingly too soon to say what might have motivated Nikolas Cruz, 19, to allegedly shoot at least 17 people to death at his former high school. It was likewise too soon to say whether Cruz held any white supremacist views. So far, though, the evidence linking him to this specific white supremacist group is thin. (We will update this story if that changes.)","Jordan Jereb, an ROF leader, told the Anti-Defamation League on Thursday that Cruz participated in training exercises with the group, but that the group hadn’t ordered Cruz to carry out the school shooting. Multiple media outlets, including HuffPost, picked up the ADL’s report and repeated the claim that Cruz was an ROF member. In several reports, Jereb, an obscure white nationalist figure, was the sole source.","“We are still doing some work, but we have no known ties between the ROF, Jordan Jereb or the Broward shooter,” a Leon County Sheriff’s Office spokesman told the Tallahassee Democrat. The sheriff’s office has arrested Jereb at least four times since January 2014 and has been monitoring ROF’s membership, The Associated Press reported.","By Thursday evening, Jereb appeared to be backing down from his claim.","“There was a misunderstanding because we have MULTIPLE people named Nicholas in ROF,” a user named @JordanJereb posted on Gab, a social media platform popular among fascists and racists. “Are you really going to blame ME for the lying jew media? We know they are liars. Fuck em,” the user wrote. (HuffPost messaged the user, who had posted about ROF months before Wednesday’s shooting, but was not immediately able to confirm his identity.)","HuffPost has not found evidence that Cruz was affiliated with ROF — or that he had even interacted with anyone in the group. Jereb did not respond to repeated requests for proof of Cruz’s involvement with ROF. Cruz’s Facebook and Instagram were taken down after the shooting. On one of his since-deleted Instagram profiles, Cruz’s Twitter avatar wore a “Make America Great Again” hat and he shared pictures of an assortment of guns and knives.","The FBI and the Broward County Sheriff’s Office, which is investigating the shooting, declined to comment.","The existing reporting on the supposed ties between Jereb and Cruz is inconsistent. Jereb told the Miami Herald he has never personally met Cruz. But ABC reported that three former classmates of Cruz identified him as part of the ROF. The former classmates claimed that Cruz was “often seen with Jereb.” Jereb’s last address listed in public records is in Tallahassee, 430 miles from where the shooting took place. ABC didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on how it verified the identities of Cruz’s former classmates.","A spokesman for the ADL, which first reported the supposed tie between the ROF and Cruz, told HuffPost on Thursday that “it is for law enforcement to 100% confirm that he was a part of this group.”","“Given what we found today and the timing of the case, there is no doubt the information raises a red flag and should be investigated further,” the spokesman said.","As reports of Cruz’s supposed link to ROF appeared in the media, members of an “alt-right” white supremacist forum claimed the entire story was an attention-grab by Jereb, or possibly a hoax aimed at tricking media outlets into pushing a false narrative.","Jereb already comes across as a caricature of a Florida white nationalist, and he has been seeking attention for his views for years. “Jereb was a weird character even in the extremist underworld to which he so badly wanted to belong,” the Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors hate groups, wrote in 2014. Most white supremacists avoid the SPLC, but Jereb “wanted desperately to be mentioned in these pages,” the group wrote. “He flooded us with pleas for attention.”","The SPLC has not been able to confirm any ties between Cruz and ROF, Heidi Beirich, the director of the group’s intelligence project, told HuffPost. “It may seem odd that Jereb would bring attention to his group by claiming a connection to Cruz, but Jereb has always been somewhat of a publicity seeker,” Beirich said.","In 2016, Jereb was arrested for allegedly threatening a high-ranking staffer of Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R). The Tallahassee Democrat reported at the time that Jereb was “known to ride a bike through neighborhoods wearing para-military garb. He has filmed numerous run-ins with law enforcement.”","On Thursday afternoon, members of The Right Stuff, a white supremacist forum, claimed that the story of Cruz being tied to ROF was false. “Started out as an inside joke until Jordan Jereb literally told the media that it was true and that he was affiliated with a school shooter,” a TRS user posting under the name “Jordan Fash” wrote.","Fash posted screenshots of an ABC reporter messaging a user named “Ethan” on Instagram asking for information about Cruz. Ethan told the reporter that Cruz was an ROF member. “It was common knowledge he did rallies with ROF, I frequently saw him conversing with Jordan Jereb in person,” the user said.","The ABC reporter declined to comment. ABC didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on how it reported its story.","It didn’t take long for other far-right extremists to latch onto a possible reporting flub as a way to attack the entirety of the mainstream media. Cameron Padgett, the campus fixer for Richard Spencer’s college speaking engagements, tweeted that the media “will do anything to smear white people.”","In his quotes to the media, Jereb elevated anti-feminist and anti-Semitic views, and claimed that Cruz “probably used that training [with ROF] to do what he did.”","There tends to be an information vacuum after a mass shooting, and trolls and propagandists often take advantage of the confusion in order to promote their own interests. After the shooting at a Texas church last year, right-wing conspiracy theorists were quick to claim that their political enemies — everyone from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) to anti-fascist protesters — were somehow connected to the shooter. Trolls will also routinely claim that Sam Hyde, a real-life comedian, is behind a mass shooting before the real shooter has been identified. In the immediate aftermath of a shooting, it’s easy for false information to spread rapidly.","In 1999, Bill White, a former leader of the National Socialist Movement, injected himself into the conversation surrounding the Columbine High School massacre by suggesting that shooters Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold might have visited White’s extremist website before the rampage. White, who identified as an anarchist at the time, managed to garner national attention for his obscure website, which urged kids to build bombs, blow up schools and slaughter football players.","Ashley Feinberg contributed reporting."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a860ef02000003800eaf033.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"COMEDY","headline":"'The Daily Show' Translates Standard GOP Responses To Mass Shootings","authors":"Lee Moran","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-daily-show-gop-mass-shooting-response-translator_us_5a8686fbe4b00bc49f429205","short_description":"Here's what they really mean.","date":"2018-02-16"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"SPORTS","headline":"Olympics Commentator Explains 'They All Look The Same' Remark About Chinese Skiers","authors":"Lee Moran","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jacqui-cooper-chinese-olympics-commentary_us_5a86bc20e4b05c2bcac9b8c6","short_description":"Australian Olympian-turned-analyst Jacqui Cooper insists she was talking about Chinese athletes' similar technical styles.","date":"2018-02-16"},"articleContent":["An Australian TV commentator caused controversy at the Winter Olympics on Thursday with a remark about Chinese athletes all looking “the same.”","Olympian-turned-analyst Jacqui Cooper said this during Channel 7’s coverage of the women’s aerial freestyle ski event in Pyeongchang, South Korea:","“Real nicely done, great control, very Chinese.

Hodges, the landmark civil rights case that guaranteed same-sex couples the right to marry.","“That’s an assault on nature,” he said during a conversation on same-sex marriage and contraception. “And anytime you assault nature, there’s going to be a backlash. That’s what we’re seeing today. … Whenever you go against God’s plan, bad things are going to happen.”","Giampietro, who is currently assistant general counsel of the Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company, also called it “irrefutable” that children are better off being raised by a heterosexual couple. (This is not true. Gay parents may be the best of all.)","In July 2014, Giampietro did another interview with LoCoco on her previous show, “Nazareth Project.” This time, he said same-sex marriage was really about sex and not love.","“This new definition of marriage actually focuses marriage on the sex act,” Giampietro said. “Because if it were simply that we wanted to honor the love of two people, we would allow sons to marry their mothers, brothers to marry their sisters, for example, to get them health care. Isn’t that a beautiful thing? Doesn’t society think that would be a great thing, if a sister could get her brother on health care?”","Giampietro, 52, has said other things that could come back to bite him in his Senate confirmation hearing, which has not been scheduled yet.","He wrote on a blog in March 2014 that “calls for diversity” are “code for relaxed standards.” In 2010, he said he became an advocate for school voucher programs after growing up in Washington, D.C., and seeing that “the children who succeeded in Washington were in private schools, and the children who turned out to be criminals were in public schools.”","Giampietro’s nomination fits into a broader pattern of anti-LGBTQ court picks from Trump. Some of his now-confirmed circuit court judges include John Bush, who compared abortion to slavery and said he strongly disagrees with same-sex marriage, and Leonard Steven Grasz, who proposed amending the Omaha City Charter to let employers discriminate against LGBTQ people.","“One in three of Trump’s judicial nominees have an explicit anti-LGBT record,” said Sharon McGowan, director of strategy at LGBTQ civil rights organization Lambda Legal. “The vitriolic and incendiary anti-LGBT rhetoric from Giampietro captured in this recording, while shocking and disturbing, is unfortunately par for the course with respect to many of the judicial nominees coming out of this White House.”","Lambda Legal is one of several human rights groups calling on Trump to withdraw Giampietro’s nomination in light of his radio interviews. Other groups include the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, the Human Rights Campaign, Alliance for Justice, the National Center for Lesbian Rights, and People For the American Way.","“Even compared to the anti-LGBT record of so many other Trump judicial nominees, Giampietro’s comments are appalling,” said Marge Baker of People For the American Way. “There’s no way that members of the LGBT community could expect fair treatment in a courtroom presided over by this nominee.”","A White House spokesman did not respond to a request for comment about Giampietro."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8611952000002d00eaf03a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Trump Blasts Dems On DACA.

In fact, it is good.","Bennet has had a difficult week. First, one of his hires, Bari Weiss, sparked outrage when she referred to the California-born Olympic skater Mirai Nagasu as an immigrant. This occasioned a heated internal conversation in which staffers vented about the direction of Bennet’s section, as HuffPost reported. This was the same day that Bennet accidentally employed the proud friend of a neo-Nazi for a total of five hours before being forced to let her go.","Now, it seems, Bennet has decided to provide The New York Times staff with a 1,500-word explanation on why these men and women are not actually upset about the opinion section’s attempts at heterodoxy. Instead, they are scared of being challenged. He also makes sure to remind the staff that he is “picking our contributors with care, looking for people who share Times standards for fairness and intellectual honesty and originality.” People such as John Lott, who Bennet published two days ago and who is one of the most widely discredited gun researchers working today.","He closes by, essentially, begging his newsroom colleagues, the people whose jobs it is to hold major institutions accountable and urge transparency, to please keep any criticism (and subsequent leaks) to themselves.","On a related note, if you work at The New York Times and would like to get in touch, you can reach me by email at ashley.feinberg@huffpost.com. Alternatively, my Twitter DMs are open.","You can read Bennet’s memo in full below:","To our colleagues:\n\nThere’s a thought in Adolph Ochs’s original mission statement for The Times that we don’t talk about so much — “without fear or favor” is the go-to, for good reason — but that I particularly love. It’s in his closing line, about the role of Times Opinion; he says we’re supposed to help “assure the free exercise of a sound conscience.” Please bear down on those words and I think you’ll see what I mean. Could there be a more elegant expression of the thought that we’re supposed to protect the freedom of people to think for themselves, and to help them put that freedom to work?\n\nThere’s no reason to hang on to any tradition for its own sake, or to dust off any statement unless it serves our purposes today and helps us look ahead. I think this statement does both, and it helps explain what we’re up to these days here in Opinion.\n\nIt’s a commonplace borne out by social science that Americans are sorting themselves by party or convictions and losing the ability to engage respectfully — even if only to disagree — across those tribal lines. Most people seem to think this is a bad thing, but very few institutions are trying seriously to do anything about it. We are trying. It’s what The Times is supposed to do, and it’s what democracy needs.\n\nSurely one of the most basic principles of The New York Times is that we don’t have all the answers. That’s why Times reporters go out into the world, often taking great risks, to try to figure out the truth. It’s not my place to speak for the newsroom, but from where I sit it seems like the authority of The Times is earned every day through the honesty and determination of that struggle — to understand how people think, and what they’re up to, and how the forces at work in our era are reshaping their lives.\n\nThis principle applies equally to Times opinion journalism. In Opinion, our collective role is not to tell people what to think. It’s not to simply reflect back to them what they already think. It’s to help them — as best we can — to do what they want to do, which is to think for themselves.\n\nIf the newsroom’s fundamental role is to describe the world as it is, ours is to envision how it could be made better. And when it comes to that work, no one — not any of our columnists, who are the best in the business; and not the editorial board, a hive mind of experts; and not any of our outside contributors, who are original thinkers; and also not anyone else on this earth — has all the right answers. We may be right about many of them; we may be partially right about others; and we may be dead wrong on still others. History will have to sort out who had it right in the end. In our time, we owe our readers an honest struggle over the right paths ahead, not a pretense that we’re in possession of God’s own map.\n\nThat means being willing to challenge our own assumptions; it means being open to counter-arguments even as we advance our own convictions; it means listening to voices that we may object to and even sometimes find obnoxious, provided they meet the same tests of intellectual honesty, respect for others and openness. It means taking on the toughest arguments on the other side, not the straw men. It means starting from a presumption of good faith, particularly on the part of our colleagues, including those we disagree with. It means having some humility about the possibility that, in the end, the other side might have a point, or more than one.\n\nIt means having a far richer array of perspectives — richer in terms not only of ideology but of identity and experience — than we have today. Diversity for us is not just a moral necessity but the only road to fulfilling our purpose of enlarging human understanding.\n\nInevitably, it also means sometimes falling short and making mistakes. (Remember: we’re not pretending to be right about everything here in Opinion.) We’re taking some chances, recruiting voices that are new to The Times and publishing pieces that press against our traditional boundaries. Sometimes you — or we — might judge, in retrospect, that we’ve made the wrong choice and put a foot over one line or another. I’m very sorry when that happens. I’d be far sorrier if we never tested the limits.\n\nThis was the mission for Times Opinion that Adolph Ochs laid out in 1896, declaring that he wanted to “invite intelligent discussion from all shades of opinion.” It was the mission The Times rededicated itself to in 1970, when it launched the Op-Ed page to further “our belief that diverse voices in our society must be given the greatest possible opportunity to be heard.” The editors explicitly wanted the Op-Ed voices to disagree with the editorial line of the paper, to keep it honest. A rich and searching and at times challenging breadth of arguments and ideas is also what society needs from us now, however imperfectly we might realize this vision, day to day, as we strive toward it.\n\nDon’t get me wrong: We’re not just letting a thousand flowers bloom. We are picking our contributors with care, looking for people who share Times standards for fairness and intellectual honesty and originality, who believe in empiricism and the essential equality of all human beings. We are, as ever, editing and fact-checking our work. And we’re not indifferent to the question of who’s right and who’s wrong. As debates ripen or the news demands, The Times editorial board is rendering its best judgment on consequential matters, consistent with the progressive values that have shaped its reasoning for many decades.\n\nWhat our readers do with any of our arguments is, of course, up to them. Maybe they’ll change their minds; maybe they’ll sharpen their existing views against a surprising and formidable counterargument. But at a minimum this running, noisy debate will help them understand the clash of ideas that’s shaping the world.\n\nA lot of the work we get to do in Opinion is fun: We get to tackle big ideas, write with verve, experiment with new forms and ways of making arguments. But this is also a real struggle we are engaged in. It’s not easy to believe passionately in certain positions and then work with people who see the world very differently.\n\nThis is one reason, I think, that departments like ours, and even many newsrooms, have always been at risk of becoming homogeneous in various ways over time. It’s particularly hard now, when an echo chamber in social media grabs hold of one piece we publish and treats it as the whole, rather than one of dozens of opinions we publish in running arguments across a week. It’s particularly hard now because, even as we keep getting attacked from the right, left-wing sites are insistently telling the same story — that we’ve added conservative voices in a rightward frogmarch — while ignoring inconvenient realities like the powerful new voices from the left that have also joined our ranks. It’s hard because some of the critics like to resort to labels without actually contending with the arguments our people make. (The good ones contend and sometimes out-argue us. They’ll make us better.)\n\nIt’s hard because this is a work in progress and, as our critics rightly point out, we are still far from realizing our ambitions for a fuller range of voices. We are still far from it.\n\nBut we are making progress, not just in the range of our viewpoints, but in the range of our storytelling, the breadth of our subject matter, and the diversity of our team. I want to emphasize: We have a long way to go. But thanks to the fierce intellects and hard work of your colleagues in Opinion we are moving forward. Far more people than ever are reading all of our work. Great journalists want to be part of this project. Great and brave thinkers and doers and survivors and artists want to make their case in The Times because they know they can have their biggest impact here. They know they can be part of a searching argument about how to make the world a better place. That’s an argument that can never end, and it’s our great privilege, in this angry and vengeful time, to have the chance to help give it new vitality.\n\nI’d like to close with an ask of you: Criticize our work privately to each other as you see fit.

In 2014, he launched a scheme to provide bank accounts to the nearly 40 percent of the population with little or no access to financial services. In November 2016, he withdrew 500 and 1,000 rupee notes ($7.80 and $15.60), the country’s two most common banknotes, from circulation.","The aim was to clamp down on black-market money and get more people into the formal economy, but it had a negative effect on the poor, with micro and small-scale service businesses cutting 35 percent of staff in the first few months, and some families left unable to afford fruit and vegetables.","Cash is on the decline worldwide; non-cash transactions grew 11.2 percent globally in 2015. But for some, the Modi experiment is a sign that cashless societies will hurt the poor, and India is not alone in having poor, unbanked populations. An estimated 7 percent of American households don’t have access to bank accounts, according to the most recent survey from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. And a government study at the end of last year found that the U.S. homeless population had risen for the first time since 2010. Given rising inequality, what happens to those on the margins of the economy when cash is no longer king?","Proponents of a shift away from cash often point to Kenya or Sweden as proof that such a transition can happen without further disadvantaging the poor. In Sweden, which is on track to be the world’s first cashless society, a magazine called Situation Stockholm has equipped its homeless sellers with credit card readers. And M-Pesa, a mobile money service first rolled out in Kenya, has 30 million subscribers and has been credited with raising 2 percent of Kenyan households out of extreme poverty.","But Mehrsa Baradaran, associate dean for strategic initiatives and J. Alton Hosch associate professor of law at the University of Georgia, says that absent these countries’ unique context, these examples would be difficult to follow in the U.S.","“Kenya had one national bank and one mobile company that had a monopoly,” she explains. “Everyone was on the same mobile network so they just rolled out M-Pesa on the mobiles and everyone immediately got on.” The U.S. has a dual banking system (state and federal) and more than 6,500 banks meaning rolling out mobile banking would require a lot more coordination, says Baradaran. “Kenya had a different population ― more poverty and less of a profit model-oriented banking system.”","As for Sweden, Baradaran says, “They just don’t have the level of poverty that we do. ... They have a lot of social services and they’ve transitioned off cash because they have a less-stratified society.”","Economist Kenneth Rogoff, a Harvard professor who formerly served as the chief economist for the International Monetary Fund, argues in his book The Curse of Cash for a gradual elimination of cash to get at the black market and to crack down on tax evasion.","To protect the unbanked, he proposes “making free basic debit card accounts available to everyone, as many countries are now doing,” he told HuffPost. “If India can make free basic accounts available to everyone, surely the U.S. can do the same.”","But Baradaran points out that U.S. banks have historically refused to do this. “In the U.S., banks have a monopoly on payments and transactions,” she says. “If you’re unbanked, you have to operate in cash. All of these fintech providers, like Venmo, PayPal, etc., they all connect to banks too. So, how do we force people into banks? There have been so many efforts in the U.S. over the years to get banks to offer free accounts, but [the banks] refuse because those accounts aren’t profitable for them.”","Grant Kerber, a volunteer with Oakland Omni Commons and Food Not Bombs, says the suggestion to simply bank the unbanked “seems out of touch” with how poor people actually live. “Things like ID cards, driver’s licenses, these are already incredibly difficult for people who are marginalized in society to get access to, so the whole digital payment thing just pushes the goal post even further out.”","Not that there aren’t problems with cash. “It’s actually really expensive to be unbanked,” Baradaran explains. “You’re constantly having to pay out part of your income in fees to turn your cash into other forms of transactional currency ― a prepaid card, for example ― or to turn your cash into checks and back again.”","She does have a potential solution. In her book How the Other Half Banks, Baradaran suggests a postal banking system. “There are already brick and mortar post offices in most neighborhoods, so my idea was that people could bring cash to the post office, they could hold it for them and give them a digital account,” she says.","Such a system would be appealing to the fintech folks, who might pick up hundreds of thousands of new customers by linking to these postal accounts, and shouldn’t bother the banks, which have been avoiding dealing with this segment of the population for years. But Baradaran says she still gets a lot of pushback on it from economists and academics, mostly middle- or upper-class people who see the proposition of having to stand in line at the post office to bank as untenable.","“But that’s because they’re not the ones it’s for,” Baradaran says. “It’s not for people who are already living comfortably with a bank account and direct deposit, who can just bank through the mobile app on their phones. It’s for people who have none of that.”","“Unless you’re poor, it’s hard to understand what it’s like to be poor,” Baradaran says. “And a lot of people don’t realize that if you go into any water office or electric utility office in the country right now, there’s a line of people in there waiting to pay their bill in cash.”","For more content and to be part of the “This New World” community, join our Facebook Group.","HuffPost’s “This New World” series is funded by Partners for a New Economy and the Kendeda Fund.

He doesn’t bother to hide it.","The Wisconsin Republican running to replace House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) once wrote that Jews are destined to “burn in hell.” He has mocked the Holocaust on white power podcasts. In January, Twitter temporarily suspended Nehlen after he posted neo-Nazi propaganda depicting journalists (not all of them Jewish) branded with the Star of David. When Nehlen returned to Twitter a week later, he posted a list of “Jews” (not all of them Jewish) he claims have attacked him. He didn’t last long. Twitter permanently suspended his account this week after Nehlen posted a racist image targeting Meghan Markle, the mixed-race fiancée of British royal Prince Harry.","An open bigot like Nehlen has little chance of winning election ― although the same was once said of Donald Trump ― but holding office might not be the point.","Nehlen’s Gestapo-light behavior has made him a celebrity among “alt-right” white supremacists, the social media-savvy millennial update of yesteryear’s skinhead thugs. Think fascism in polos and preppy haircuts. But it’s still the same hate. Nehlen lets this new generation of extremists dare to dream.","And his behavior has attracted other Jew-haters to his cause. Perhaps the most prominent of them is Nehlen’s campaign spokesman, Josh Smith, a 36-year-old Pennsylvania lawyer with an Anglo-Saxon patronym so banal that it hardly feels real.","A boisterous supporter of Nehlen’s “shall not censor” bill to prevent social media platforms from banning users for hate speech, Smith is even more anti-Semitic online than his boss is. On Gab, a social media platform favored by racists and fascists, Smith opposes women’s suffrage and writes things like “Get fucked, faggot” and “Who on Earth could ever take these filthy kikes seriously??”","He favors social media handles derived from “Ebolamerican,” the name of a parody Twitter account he created during the Ebola virus scare in 2014. When Twitter initially suspended Nehlen in January, it also indefinitely suspended Smith, who had been tweeting white supremacist fare under @ebolasweden and using an avatar of Dan Halen, the scheming cartoon villain from the Adult Swim show “Squidbillies.”","But Twitter suspensions are often little more than public relations bluster, and Smith quickly fired up @EmericaFirst, a dormant account he’d created in March 2010. He went right back to posting messages by white power icons such as Richard Spencer and Mike Peinovich. He promoted neo-Nazi groups like Identity Evropa and tweeted approvingly of white supremacist felon David Duke, whose radio show Nehlen went on recently.","Smith voiced support for a white ethnostate and urged white men to “wake up.” He spoke of “race war” and used Nazi terminology like “lugenpresse,” which means “lying press.” He put up a post denying the Holocaust and tweeted approvingly about expelling Jews from America:","Smith also tweeted about “cultural Marxism” and evil Jews, about Jewish control of the media and Hollywood, about Jewish censorship of right-wing speech and Jewish subversion of America through “deep state” plots. He wrote that “censorship of the goyim” runs through the “blood” of Jews.","He attacked Nehlen’s critics by asking if they were Jewish.","Last week, HuffPost asked him essentially the same question:","Were you raised Jewish?","Smith wrote back to say that he was.","Lawyers, Guns And Money","In January, HuffPost learned that Josh Smith hasn’t always been Josh Smith. He grew up Jewish in Pittsburgh as Daniel Joshua Nusbaum, the son of Maury and Barbara Nusbaum. His maternal grandmother, Sylvia Feldman, was buried last month in Pittsburgh’s Cneseth Israel Cemetery. None of Smith’s relatives contacted by HuffPost responded to requests for comment.","Smith’s father, who is also a lawyer, was the only one in the household who had any interest in Judaism. “My father insisted that I have a bar mitzvah, after which I was allowed to decide my level of future involvement with the religion,” Smith told HuffPost. “I chose ‘no involvement whatsoever,’ and never looked back. Judaism just wasn’t for me.”","But does Smith still consider himself Jewish?","“In the racial sense, yes, because one obviously cannot change one’s DNA. (Although I’ve not had my DNA tested, I’m certain that it would be some percentage Ashkenazi Jewish.) In the religious sense, no,” he said.","Smith said Nehlen and many others in the alt-right already know about his heritage. “I can’t say that they were thrilled about it, but trust is earned, not given, and they have come to realize that their trust in me is well-placed,” he said.","And his commitment to the cause appears sincere. “I refuse to stand idly by and allow Whites to be dispossessed of their homelands, and I will sacrifice my own self-interests to ensure that Whites may secure their existence and a future for their beautiful children,” he told HuffPost in an email, using a variation of the “14 words,” a white supremacist slogan.\n","In his youth, Nusbaum ― as Smith was known then ― was something of an academic prodigy, graduating summa cum laude from the University of Pittsburgh at the age of 18. But he only scored in the 75th percentile on the LSAT and matriculated to the University of Pittsburgh School of Law, where he studied for two years before transferring to Cornell Law School. He was an editor at the Cornell Law Review and contributed one article as Daniel J. Nusbaum. He graduated in 2003 and also interned that year at the American Enterprise Institute.","After law school, Nusbaum worked for about a year in New York as a litigation associate at Sullivan & Cromwell, a prestigious white-shoe law firm that used to employ Peter Thiel. Nusbaum left the firm at the end of 2004, telling HuffPost that he found the work “miserable.” Nusbaum’s bankruptcy records list an approximately $11,000 credit card debt and the law firm as a co-debtor. Sullivan & Cromwell did not respond to multiple requests for comment.","Nusbaum moved back to Pittsburgh, where he would soon earn some notoriety. He claims on his résumé to have started work in November 2004 as the manager of legal affairs for a local information technology business. But he told HuffPost that he didn’t move back to Pittsburgh until January 2005 and didn’t start working for the IT business until several years later. By June 2005, he was employed as a waiter in the Monterey Bay Fish Grotto, a fancy seafood restaurant with panoramic views of the Pittsburgh skyline. He earned $2,500 a month.","In court documents, Nusbaum admitted to suffering at the time from “debilitating psychological disorders” such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and major depressive disorder. His doctor prescribed him Adderall to treat his symptoms, but higher and higher doses of the stimulant failed to have an effect. The doctor switched him to Desoxyn, which is lab-pure methamphetamine — literally meth. The drug is highly addictive and can cause psychosis and delirium. It can also suppress appetite, and Nusbaum, who stands only 5 foot, 6 inches and at the time weighed as little as 120 pounds, said his doctor had ordered him to eat at every opportunity.","“I have been directed to consume food whenever possible,” Nusbaum later told a court.","The Monterey Bay Fish Grotto tried to accommodate Nusbaum’s impairments with a special policy that allowed him to “scarf down” food he brought during eight-minute breaks — two per shift — throughout which he stood in a corner of the kitchen, eating while the restaurant staff watched him. But these sessions did not sate him. He was taking meth twice a day and wanted to snack on some of the restaurant’s food for free. Diners lodged a formal complaint about his jittery behavior. Nusbaum continued to flounder and filed for bankruptcy, having amassed over $130,000 in debt from unpaid college loans and years of bills he’d ignored. In January 2007, the fish restaurant canned him.","A few months later, Nusbaum sued the restaurant in federal court, claiming that the business had violated the Americans with Disabilities Act by failing to address his eating requirements. He represented himself and filed angsty motions that described the “megalomanic [sic] nature” of his boss. He skipped his own deposition.","The case dragged on, and Nusbaum moved into the home of a boyfriend he’d met online. The man owned a local business and shared an interest in bondage and sadomasochism. “I was the submissive one,” Nusbaum later told another court in a different proceeding. Living rent-free in his lover’s house, Nusbaum focused on lashing a settlement out of the restaurant.","Over the course of the next year, however, Nusbaum’s romantic relationship deteriorated, and he began to harass and threaten his boyfriend, who on one occasion had to barricade himself inside his room, according to court records. Nusbaum raged explosively. His boyfriend took to sleeping in his office at work, afraid that Nusbaum would attack him at home. When the man broke off the relationship in November 2008, Nusbaum refused to move out. That month, he also legally changed his name to Joshua Smith.","“At the time, I was not speaking with my family, and I decided that I did not wish to carry on the family name,” said Smith, as this piece will now refer to him.","In March 2009, Smith applied for a gun permit under his new name and omitted a key detail: As a 16-year-old, his parents had him involuntarily committed for two days to a psychiatric facility. Smith told HuffPost that the involuntary commitment happened after he discovered a family secret that prompted a dispute.","“I was released after two days. This was not a mental health issue ― my family was just highly dysfunctional back then. My parents have admitted it was a terrible mistake, and have repeatedly apologized to me for it. I have, of course, forgiven them.”","Back then, he was Daniel Nusbaum. But under Pennsylvania law, he still couldn’t own a gun as Josh Smith, and his attempt in 2009 to obtain one frightened people. His ex-boyfriend sought a six-month restraining order, which Smith protested in court. A judge looked at Smith’s “sufficiently disturbing” behavior and granted the order. Smith had a meltdown in the courtroom.","Smith unsuccessfully appealed the ruling, playing victim and later demanding $250,000 in damages in a separate proceeding that was dismissed. In one motion, he used racial slurs to liken a judge’s treatment of him to actual racism. “[T]his would be no different than if a court had a party before it who was of a certain racial class (say, for instance, black),” Smith wrote, “and the court stated, ‘well, all n****rs say that,’ or ‘all n****rs say the same thing in the end.’”","It’s worth noting here that the alt-right doesn’t know what to make of gay people. Some white nationalists like Richard Spencer don’t seem to care much about sexual orientation. Others such as Matt Heimbach believe white nationalism is only for straight, white people and consider everything else “perversion” and “degeneracy.” Andrew Anglin talks about executing homosexuals by throwing them off rooftops. But desperate movements can’t be choosy, and Smith’s sexuality, like his heritage, hasn’t disqualified him from membership.","When HuffPost asked Smith about his sexual orientation, he refused to discuss it. “It is now clear to me that such behavior (homosexuality, transgenderism, all of it), as well as the culture that surrounds it, is fundamentally degenerate and destructive to the very foundations of civilization, and thus can never be promoted in any healthy society,” Smith emailed.","A few years ago, however, he sounded a different note on an online radio show while defending an Indiana law that allowed Christian business owners to turn away LGBTQ customers. “OK, so I’m gay – openly gay, proud of it, it’s great,” Smith told the host.","One of the few subjects on which prominent white nationalist figures have near-unanimous agreement, however, is Jews. Heimbach sums it up: “Jews have zero place in our movement.” They see Jews not simply as a religious group, but as a distinct racial subgroup that is genetically predisposed to subverting white countries. So what might inspire a gay Jew to join forces with far-right extremists? Could it really be, as Smith contends, about free speech as imagined by a movement whose members routinely threaten journalists with death and make no secret of their desire to silence political opponents?","Far-right extremists champion free speech as a way to advance an ideology with an end goal of extinguishing voices:","The Jewish Anti-Semite","The phenomenon of the anti-Semitic Jew has a long history. As far back as the 13th century, Nicholas Donin, a Jewish convert to Christianity in France, played a key role in putting the Talmud on trial in the “Disputation of Paris” in 1240, resulting in a decree to burn copies of the religious manuscript. Pablo Christiani, another Jew who converted to Christianity in the Middle Ages, continued Donin’s efforts and persuaded Louis IX of France to give him permission to enforce an edict that required Jews to wear badges.","Why would Jews side with their persecutors? Even the question can raise stereotypical assumptions about Jewish people, who for centuries have been demonized as making self-interested “tribal” decisions determined by their ancestry.","“A person’s heritage is just one small component of what motivates them,” says Aryeh Tuchman, the associate director of the Center on Extremism at the Anti-Defamation League. “What do Jews stand for? Jews have a huge variety of opinions about every single issue. They can have radically different opinions.” And some of them, Tuchman notes, can just be “crazy racists.”","Consider Bobby Fischer, the world champion chess player who was raised Jewish but by the time he was a young man in the 1960s had turned into an ardent Holocaust denier and fan of Adolf Hitler. Medical professionals now believe Fischer suffered from an undiagnosed mental disorder. That, of course, hasn’t stopped the alt-right from celebrating the chessmaster as a “based Jew,” a term used to celebrate Jews who embrace the white supremacist movement.","Another “based Jew” was Dan Burros, a hardened Ku Klux Klan leader and member of George Lincoln Rockwell’s American Nazi Party. Burros was such a devout anti-Semite that in 1965, after The New York Times exposed his Jewish ancestry, he shouted, “Long live the white race! I have nothing to live for!” and shot himself dead with a .32-caliber revolver.","In the 1980s and 1990s, David Cole became an infamous Holocaust denier, according to Tuchman. Though Cole rejects the term “denier,” preferring to be called a “revisionist,” leading Holocaust denial experts such as Deborah Lipstadt, a professor of Jewish history at Emory University, maintain the distinction is effectively meaningless and often used by anti-Semites to soft-peddle their bigotry.","Cole appeared on a range of talk shows to play Nazi heel. Eventually, he changed identities to become David Stein and reinvent himself as a popular Republican gadfly and pundit in Los Angeles. But Cole/Stein never gave up his anti-Semitic conspiracy theories. “I haven’t changed my views,” he told The Guardian in 2013.","Today, Cole writes a regular column for Taki’s Magazine, a far-right publication where Richard Spencer once worked as an editor and that has published several notable white nationalists. In an October 2017 column entitled “How Many Jews Can Be Gassed on the Head of a Pin?”, Cole tried to cast doubt on the widely accepted number of Jews murdered by the Nazi regime. Instead of 6 million, Cole “put the total at somewhere between 3 and 3.5 million.”","“Some aspect of denying the Holocaust really spoke to him,” says Tuchman. “It’s very hard to understand.”","Equally hard to understand is that Nehlen may have more than one anti-Semitic Jew working for him. A Florida man named Matt Fischer who claims to be Jewish tweets as @MattsOurSemite and acts as the Republican candidate’s “Semitic Liaison,” a trollish title that fits the alt-right’s strategy of using humor to deflect criticism. “The truth is many Jews harbor serious pathological self-hating tendencies,” Fischer has tweeted in the past, by way, perhaps, of explaining his own bigotry.","The derogatory term “self-hating Jew” is often used by Zionist Jews to criticize Jews with anti-Zionist views. But Fischer twists the term even further, in particular because the alt-right holds up Israel as a model for the white ethnostate it seeks. (If Jews can have their own homeland, the crooked logic goes, whites should get one too.)","Compare Fischer’s self-hating comment to the eulogy George Lincoln Rockwell gave for his friend Burros: “[The Jews] are a unique people with a distinct mass affliction of mental disorders ... symptoms of paranoia, delusions of grandeur, and delusions of persecution. Dan Burros was the product of this unfortunate Jewish psychosis. It cost him his life.”","Two years later, Rockwell would be murdered by one of his followers, a violent gentile with a history of mental illness.","Psychosis doesn’t discriminate.","And Rockwell’s eulogy wasn’t describing a problem unique to any ethnic group. He was talking about the type of fearful, broken mind that is drawn to fascism. Half a century later, his words could easily apply to the alt-right, the political movement of last resort for today’s racist kooks and conspiracists. Regardless of background, all these people manage to find their way to the butt end of the same mental cul-de-sac.","Josh Smith did too.","A Troll Is Born","In early 2010, Smith had a stroke of good fortune when the fish business bailed him out. He hadn’t worked in almost two years, and the Monterey Bay case had become his lifeline. After years of squabbling, the restaurant finally paid him $35,000 to go away. But Smith failed to declare $30,000 of the settlement as income and ran afoul of the IRS, according to records from United States Tax Court.","“It seems as if he is traveling under a black cloud, some of which he causes,” his mother wrote of her son in an email that is part of another case file.","Smith had by then set up his own one-man private legal practice. His firm’s motto: “Live Invincibly.” He posted Craigslist ads: $99 to handle traffic citation hearings; $300 for DUI cases. He offered to barter his legal acumen for “services” and “property.”","As an advocate for others, he hoped to replicate his fish restaurant success and tried to wring money out of a wireless infrastructure company with a discrimination suit. But he failed to appear at a key conference, according to a motion filed by the defendant, and the case was dismissed. Smith next went after a local race track and casino for “employment discrimination.” He threw temper tantrums in legalese and was admonished for dilatory, unprofessional behavior and “bad faith conduct.” He tried to buy time by telling the court that he had “severely injured his right wrist” and couldn’t write or type. When a judge ordered him to appear with his client to explain himself, he didn’t show. Instead, his client turned up with a different lawyer. The judge terminated Smith as the attorney on the case, which was soon dismissed.","One night in June 2012, according to court records, Smith materialized elsewhere ― outside his ex-boyfriend’s house. It was the third time since the restraining order that he’d crept up on the man. The ex-boyfriend called the police, who arrived a few minutes later and ordered Smith to leave.","Smith texted his ex later that night. “It has taken me a few months just to ring your doorbell let alone tell you how much I miss you and think about you,” he wrote. “I haven’t even had sex in three years because I don’t want to with anyone else but you. … I just want you to know how incredibly special you still are to me but it seems you are determined to never let me tell you that. You have no idea how much that breaks my heart, dude.”","A judge signed off on a second restraining order, this one for three years, and threatened Smith with jail time. Smith rushed out of the courtroom as the judge issued a warning about the traits shared by people whom restraining orders fail to deter from violence: obsessive jealousy, fixed ideations, previous legal problems. “Mr. Smith has all of those markers,” the judge said, advising the victim to be careful in public places.","The courts were never going to offer Smith, who remains a licensed attorney in Pennsylvania, a suitable outlet for his brand of wild-eyed disputation. He required a more lawless forum. Like many other angry, unstable young men, he found it on social media.","His career as a far-right troll began in 2014, when a manufactured panic about Ebola gripped the national conversation for months. Americans visiting and working in West Africa had been infected with the virus. One of them subsequently transmitted it to two nurses in a Dallas hospital. Conservative isolationists such as Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Bill O’Reilly whipped Ebola concern into a conspiratorial, racialized hysteria to call for West African travel bans and attack the Barack Obama administration. Donald Trump tweeted about how “the plague will start and spread inside our ‘borders.’”","Smith saw opportunity in “Fearbola,” and his pathologies played well on Twitter. He set up a parody account called “Ebolamerican,” from which he tweeted as a “patriotic, irreverent virus” that had come to America eager to “live the dream.” He’d stumbled on a new calling as a far-right Twitter noodge.","Smith made the Ebolamerican meme his online brand so people could easily recognize him. Soon he was bantering with other far-right extremists such as Mike Cernovich and Gavin McInnes. He’d found his new family. He’d found purpose.","By 2016, Smith had achieved enough celebrity in America’s online racist and fascist community that he appeared in a Breitbart story written by alt-right apologist Allum Bokhari, who criticized Twitter for repeatedly suspending Smith for reasons that Bokhari chalked up to the attorney just being a “conservative.” This straw man is routinely used by far-right propagandists who masquerade as “free speech absolutists” ― the same kind that celebrate Peter Thiel’s destruction of Gawker ― to pressure social media companies not to take racist, hateful content or political disinformation offline.","In 2016, Smith also did some work for Chuck Johnson, a Holocaust-denying far-right troll and fake news merchant who used to write for Breitbart and has connections to the Trump administration as well as Thiel, Julian Assange and neo-Nazis such as Andrew Auernheimer, the webmaster for The Daily Stormer. Smith refused to tell HuffPost what he’d worked on with Johnson. “As a matter of professional ethics, I am not at liberty to answer that question,” he emailed.","But chat transcripts show that Smith helped Johnson, who received a permanent ban from Twitter for soliciting violence against a Black Lives Matter activist, with a crowdfunding project called WeSearchr that Johnson launched in 2016. WeSearchr allows a user to create a “bounty” to finance a project. And Smith had an idea for a bounty. On YouTube, he’d been defending Brock Turner, the Stanford swimmer convicted of felony sexual assault after he was caught trying to rape an unconscious woman behind a dumpster. Smith wanted to start a bounty to out Turner’s anonymous victim.","“[A]nonymity for accusers ― for any crime ― is terrible public policy,” he explained to HuffPost, pointing to a harsh public statement the victim read at Turner’s sentencing. “[I]t is fundamentally unfair to the public and the defendant to allow this anonymity to be utilized as both a sword and a shield.”","Most members of the alt-right, of course, hide behind fake names so they can harass, slander and threaten without consequence. Anonymity is the group’s most powerful weapon. And Smith’s understanding of both the law and the group’s social media clout, made him a good person to work for Paul Nehlen. Smith told HuffPost that he reached out to the Republican candidate in November 2017 to pitch him what is now known as Nehlen’s “shall not censor” legislative proposal, which would federally regulate social media companies from banning, suspending or otherwise restricting the accounts of users who spew hate speech and propaganda. In other words, themselves.","“It was a brainchild of mine,” Smith said. “I’d spent over two years thinking about the issue, what could be done about it, and what solutions would be viable. Paul recognized the importance of the issue, and decided he wanted to make it a centerpiece of his campaign. As it turns out, we also have a shared vision for putting America First, so it was not long before he asked me to be the spokesman for the campaign.”","In December, however, Nehlen lost the support of a different, more powerful ally in political strategist Steve Bannon, who was backing the Wisconsin Republican as part of his populist insurgency against the GOP establishment. Bannon cut ties with Nehlen after news broke that the candidate had appeared on white power podcasts. But Nehlen’s white nationalism was never a secret. In 2016, Richard Spencer described Nehlen to me as “kind of an alt-right candidate” and, by way of example, pointed to a question the candidate had asked about why Muslims are even in the United States. According to Smith, Bannon was “intimately aware of Paul’s politics” before he backed him.","It was, rather, Nehlen who hadn’t been aware of Bannon’s politics, Smith said. By this, Smith meant Bannon’s “philosemitism” and “Breitbart’s heavily Jewish leadership.” He interpreted Bannon’s decision to reject Nehlen as nothing more than a public relations move “designed, coordinated, and executed by the Jewish media.”","And so Smith arrived, whelped fully into his role as an extremist, the gay homophobe, the Jewish anti-Semite, a tangle of psychodynamic contradictions, a welter of hate. An alt-righter.","That he wants to enshrine into law his ability to be the worst possible version of himself online might be the only thing about his journey that comes as no surprise.","On Valentine’s Day, Smith tweeted his support for ethnic cleansing. “I’m not that concerned if some violence happens,” he wrote.","This story has been updated to include additional information about Cole’s writing and public comments.","Oliver Mushtare contributed reporting."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a84b8a62000003800eaee8b.png?cache=e1cyt7wHTN&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"WOMEN","headline":"The 20 Funniest Tweets From Women This Week","authors":"Hollis Miller","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-20-funniest-tweets-from-women-this-week_us_5a86e285e4b004fc319141d3","short_description":"The Olympics, \"Friends,\" and the \"50 Shades\" trilogy provided some great inspiration.","date":"2018-02-16"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Trump’s Historic Medicaid Shift Goes Beyond Work Requirements","authors":"Stateline, Editorial Partner","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trumps-historic-medicaid-shift-goes-beyond-work-requirements_us_5a86fcace4b08896770933fd","short_description":"The new requirements likely will cause many Medicaid beneficiaries to be removed from the rolls.","date":"2018-02-16"},"articleContent":["By Michael Ollove","Requiring able-bodied adults to work for their Medicaid is just part of the Trump administration’s drive to remake the decades-old health insurance program for the poor.","The administration signaled late last year that it welcomes state-based ideas to retool Medicaid and “help individuals live up to their highest potential.” At least 10 states have requested waivers that would allow them to impose work requirements and other obligations.","For example: They would require more recipients to contribute small monthly premiums. They would insist on monthly paperwork. They would impose lifetime limits on coverage. And they would kick recipients off Medicaid for a period of time — 30 days, or perhaps six months — for failing to follow the rules.","All the states requesting Medicaid work requirements are led by Republican governors who tout the “it’s a trampoline, not a hammock” approach to the social services safety net.","In the past few weeks, the Trump administration has granted approval to Kentucky and Indiana to begin imposing new requirements for Medicaid recipients that are likely to push some people off the rolls. Arizona, Arkansas, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Utah and Wisconsin — all led by Republican governors — also have requested federal permission to adopt new requirements. Medicaid is a joint federal-state program, so states need federal approval to make substantial changes.","In Kentucky alone close to 97,000 people will lose Medicaid benefits over the next five years as a result of new changes, one study estimated. In Mississippi, Medicaid enrollment would shrink by 58,995 — 9 percent — in the first year alone, according to the state’s application to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.","The Southern Poverty Law Center, the National Health Law Program and the Kentucky Equal Justice Center have sued to block implementation of the Medicaid changes in Kentucky. The three civil rights organizations are arguing that the Trump administration has overridden the federal Medicaid law, which only Congress can do, “overturning a half century of administrative practice, and threatening irreparable harm to the health and welfare of the poorest and most vulnerable in our country.”","More Uninsured?","Indiana and Kentucky, as well as Arizona, Arkansas and New Hampshire, all expanded Medicaid eligibility to more low-income adults under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. As a result, all of those states boosted the percentage of their residents with some form of health insurance. (Maine voters last year also approved the expansion, though the state hasn’t implemented it yet.)","But the imposition of new requirements would reverse some of those gains. It also entails a sharp break from the Obama administration’s explicit position that all changes to state Medicaid policies had to “increase and strengthen overall coverage of low-income individuals in the state.”","The Trump administration has removed that language as a criterion for approving changes to state Medicaid policies. Instead, the administration announced a different objective for Medicaid.","“We have a higher purpose than just handing out Medicaid cards,” Seema Verma, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said in a speech to state Medicaid directors in November. “The Medicaid program is a promise to help individuals live up to their highest potential, leading healthier, more fulfilling, and more independent lives.”","Verma’s speech was a prelude to CMS issuing new guidance in November indicating its openness to state proposals to add work requirements to their Medicaid programs, proposals the Obama administration routinely rejected. Out went increasing access to health care to the poor; in came language about employment leading to better health for enrollees by helping them to “rise out of poverty and attain independence.”","Instead of increasing access to Medicaid, the Trump administration said the changes it is pursuing will modify the behavior of beneficiaries to “promote upward mobility, greater independence and improved quality of life.”","It’s very much in keeping with longtime Republican orthodoxy that safety net programs should be only temporary ports for the poor. The long-term goal should be self-sufficiency. “Medicaid is a tragic example of the soft bigotry of low expectations consistently espoused by the prior administration,” Verma said.","Many Republican governors have embraced the shift.","“I firmly believe that every human being aspires to earn her own success. For those whose family situation and health allow it, there is nothing quite as beneficial as the sense of accomplishment that comes from work,” Utah Gov. Gary Herbert said in an email to Stateline. “Medicaid meets the needs of many populations, but that part of Medicaid that is intended to help catch those who have fallen on hard times should do all that it can to assist their efforts to return to gainful employment.”","But the new philosophy has alarmed many who advocate for health care access for the poor. Instead of helping people obtain work, they say the Trump approach will simply deprive people of health care.","“It’s such a wrongheaded punitive policy that won’t achieve the end goal of putting people to work,” said Dee Mahan, director of Medicaid Initiatives at Families USA, a nonprofit that advocates for health care for all. “It’s breathtaking.”","‘Lockouts’ and Lifetime Limits","Since 2008, the federal government has given some states, including Indiana, permission to require some Medicaid beneficiaries to pay premiums for their coverage. Thanks to its recent waiver, Kentucky now has the authority to “lock out” beneficiaries for six months unless the person pays past-due premiums and also completes a financial or health literacy course. Maine, New Mexico and Wisconsin are seeking the same authority. (The Obama administration had already given Indiana permission to use lockouts as a concession for the state to expand Medicaid in 2015.)","In approving lockouts in Indiana, CMS said that requiring beneficiaries to meet program requirements would “strengthen beneficiary engagement in their personal health care plan” and provide incentives for people to become responsible decision-makers.","But at least one study found that imposing premiums in Medicaid leads to fewer people being covered. In Indiana, more than 46,000 otherwise eligible residents were not enrolled in Medicaid between February 2015 and December 2016 because they didn’t make their first payments on time. About 14,000 lost benefits for not making subsequent payments on time. And nearly 10,000 in that group were locked out of benefits for six months.","The half-dozen states that charge premiums now generally apply them only to Medicaid beneficiaries at higher income levels. But some states, such as Wisconsin and Maine, want to charge premiums to more beneficiaries. Wisconsin seeks to begin charging premiums of $8 a month to households whose income falls below the federal poverty line. For a family of four, that would mean a household income of no more than $25,100 a year.","CMS also gave Kentucky and Indiana the authority to lock out those who fail to renew their Medicaid eligibility on time.","Arizona, Kansas, Utah and Wisconsin also want to impose a lifetime limit on coverage. Wisconsin, for example, proposes a lifetime limit of 48 months. Kansas is shooting for 36 months. Arizona and Utah are hoping for five years, although in Arizona’s case, time that an enrollee worked wouldn’t count against the limit. Once time is up, recipients couldn’t receive Medicaid for the rest of their lives.","Federal officials also granted Kentucky’s request to end the practice of retroactive eligibility, under which people who are eligible for Medicaid but not enrolled are signed up retroactively when they show up for medical services. Maine is seeking permission to end retroactive eligibility as well.","Critics say the Trump administration’s philosophy demonstrates either ignorance about or indifference to the hardships and chaos confronting many who live in poverty. Many work multiple jobs, do contract work or are otherwise in situations where hours and fluctuations in income are hard to predict or to document. They may live in situations in which mail delivery is unreliable. They may not have access to computers.","“Many poor people face challenges that will make it very difficult to meet these requirements,” said Joan Alker, executive director of Georgetown University’s Center for Children and Families. “There is low literacy and issues of homelessness, mental illness and addiction. They lack transportation and affordable child care. People will lose coverage because of this, including people who have jobs.”","Stateline home page","Sign up for exclusive state policy reporting and research"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a86fd392100003100601703.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"EPA Says Scott Pruitt Flies First Class Because Angry People Yell At Him Too Much","authors":"Nick Visser","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/scott-pruitt-epa-first-class_us_5a864be5e4b004fc319090ae","short_description":"A member of the public once told the administrator he was \"f**king up the environment.\"","date":"2018-02-16"},"articleContent":["Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt frequently flies in first and business class because he’s regularly confronted by angry members of the public during his travels, according to a report in Politico on Thursday.","The EPA’s Office of Criminal Enforcement told Politico that Pruitt was “approached at the airport numerous times, to the point of profanities being yelled at him,” which spurred the expensive bookings.","“The team leader felt that he was being placed in a situation where he was unsafe on the flight,” Henry Barnet, the office’s director, told Politico. In one instance, someone approached Pruitt and yelled, “You’re fucking up the environment,” Barnet said.","Pruitt has come under fire this week after The Washington Post reported that the administrator was regularly booked in premium cabins, often costing thousands of dollars more than equivalent seats in coach. The report, citing EPA receipts obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request, noted several flights cost more than $90,000 in total during a few weeks last June.","Federal regulations mandate government employees travel in the “least expensive class of travel” for their needs, but individuals are allowed to book premium seats if there are security concerns.","The EPA briefly said this week Pruitt had a “blanket wavier” to travel first class but later rolled back its statement when Politico noted that the regulations state that such travel must be approved on a “trip-by-trip basis.” A spokesman later clarified to the news site that Pruitt’s office submitted a waiver seeking an exemption before each trip, citing security concerns.","Until Thursday’s report, it was unclear what those concerns were, although Pruitt defended the bookings in an interview with the New Hampshire Union Leader, blaming what he called a “very toxic environment politically.”","“We’ve reached the point where there’s not much civility in the marketplace and it’s created, you know, it’s created some issues and the (security) detail, the level of protection is determined by the level of threat,” he told the Union Leader on Tuesday.","Pruitt’s tenure at the EPA over the past year has been controversial among environmentalists. The agency has quickly worked to roll back many regulations meant to combat climate change. The agency has also moved to unravel the Clean Water Act and the Clean Power Plan, and Pruitt was one of the driving forces behind President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw the U.S. from the landmark Paris climate deal.","He receives many more threats than his predecessors, E&E News reported in January, and is the first EPA administrator to have a full-time security detail.","The agency also refuses to release many details about Pruitt’s schedule in advance, citing similar security concerns."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8654ba1e0000dc007abd8b.jpeg?cache=ymDnbt27AA&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"QUEER VOICES","headline":"‘RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars 3’ Episode 4 Recap: Who Won Snatch Game?","authors":"INTO, Editorial Partner","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rupauls-drag-race-all-stars-3-episode-4-recap-who_us_5a870eb4e4b088d92ef35adf","short_description":"I am honestly blown back by how poorly Trixie is faring this season.","date":"2018-02-16"},"articleContent":["by Kevin O’Keeffe","Every year, we let ourselves get excited for Snatch Game on “RuPaul’s Drag Race.” And every year, we are reminded that Snatch Game is not actually that good.","Oh, sure, there are plenty of highlights. We remember Sharon Needles’ brilliant Michelle Visage, gasping about working Susanne Bartsch’s party and Buffalo nickels. We remember Jinkx Monsoon’s iconic Little Edie, so detailed in every gesture and vocal affectation. We even remember the misfires, like Tyra Sanchez’s Beyoncé, who was, to paraphrase Pandora Boxx, not very Beyoncé at all.","But we forget that, most of the time, the Snatch Game impersonations are just OK — kind of a muddle of bad punchlines and half-baked conceits. This particular Snatch Game ranges from the solid to the confused to the disastrous. The result is the first (hopefully only) disappointing episode of “All Stars” season three, one that doesn’t showcase this crop of queens at their best.","BenDeLaCreme and Shangela emerge on top this week, and it’s not even close. In fact, RuPaul doesn’t bother declaring a third member of the top. She just gives the two queens the win and sends them to the back of the stage. I can’t remember such a definitive win in Snatch Game herstory; even Alaska and Roxxxy Andrews gave Jinkx some competition in season five.","BenDeLaCreme delivers the second winning male impersonation on Snatch Game, going full “Hollywood Squares” to play Paul Lynde. It’s a perfect Snatch Game character, akin to Alaska’s winning Mae West from All Stars season two: lots of quips, big vocal effect, and aimed right at Ru’s old-days-loving heart. Ben also dominates the game, sneaking in jokes after others’ answers and building a banter with Ru. It’s an impressive performance.","Like with the last two weeks, Ben is playing someone other than “BenDeLaCreme,” which helps me connect with her more. During season six, she couldn’t get beyond her drag character, but she’s the real deal this cycle. She has prepared for this competition to an absurd extent — there has literally been no challenge too great for her so far. It feels like something has to happen to make her winning the season feel less like an inevitability. But maybe she’s just going full Bianca Del Rio, sweeping everything in an unstoppable march to the finale.","Ben takes the cleanest path to the win this week, but Shangela takes a riskier one. She disposes of her first character, Miss Cleo, when RuPaul says her accent sounds more Irish than Jamaican. She goes with a backup, her friend and actress Jenifer Lewis. Picking your friends can backfire: Remember Detox’s Kesha? But Shangela nails it by getting so into character she physically embodies Jenifer. By just leaning back in her chair, she morphs into her subject and brings the attitude to match. It’s not a legendary Snatch Game performance, but it’s a good one.","Aja mostly impresses as Crystal LaBeija, her original character choice for the season nine Snatch Game, and once again turns it out on the Flower Power runway (in a look guest judge Kristin Chenoweth calls “Edie Sedgwick comes to life”). Bebe does the latter as well, but her Grace Jones is just OK. Like in The Bitchelor, her concept is stronger than the execution, because she can’t improv that well.","They both escape the bottom three, which is instead filled by repeat visitors Chi Chi DeVayne and Kennedy Davenport, as well as, in a shock, Trixie Mattel. All three performances are bad, but the first two have a different problem than Trixie does. Chi Chi as Maya Angelou and Kennedy as “The Real Housewives of Atlanta”’s Phaedra Parks can’t come up with good material on the spot, and their looks both in Snatch Game and on the runway aren’t strong enough to save them. Trixie, meanwhile, wildly overthinks her RuPaul impression, delivering a barrage of unfunny punchlines throughout the challenge. It’s disheartening to watch, particularly because you can see Trixie herself realizing she’s bombing as she performs.","I am honestly blown back by how poorly Trixie is faring this season. Going into this, I thought she’d pull an Alaska; instead, she’s barely managing better than a Roxxxy. Actually, that’s unfair to Roxxxy — she at least managed to win a challenge in “All Stars” season two! So what’s going wrong? Trixie still has her charisma, after all, and God knows her typical look embodies her uniqueness (as seen on the runway this week, as a sort of Princess Peach gone flowery). And anyone who’s watched her off the show has seen her talent.","What’s failing Trixie is her Nerve. She’s melting under the “All Stars” lights, losing all of the tenacity she’s gained since season seven. Snatch Game is supposed to be her challenge. She knows it’s her challenge. She even promises she’s going to win at the top of the episode. But then, a fight with Shangela over a note Thorgy Thor left for Trixie rattles her, and she never recovers. Trixie even cries on the runway, just episodes after mocking Milk for crying about the results. She correctly analyzes that she’s “not the Trixie that [her] fans look for” in All Stars. What’s most crushing is that you can hear how disappointed she is in herself.","The lip sync this week is to Katy Perry’s “I Kissed a Girl,” the kind of song you’d have expected “Drag Race” to do forever ago. Shangela and Ben bring just different enough styles that their dynamics work together well. Shangela’s lip syncs this season seem to be more prop-based, while Ben is playing into the camp at every chance she gets. So this week, we get Shangela throwing mints at Ben, who reacts with gusto, and Ben falling onto Shangela after she death-drops at the end of the song. It’s a cooperative lip sync that recalls Tatianna and Alyssa Edwards’ “Shut Up and Drive” and Jujubee and Raven’s “Dancing on My Own” from previous “All Stars” seasons, if not quite at the qualitative level of those all-time-great showdowns.","Like those lip syncs, this one ends in a tie, with Ru giving each queen $5,000 and the power to eliminate one of the bottom three. However, since they both pick Chi Chi to go home, it’s just a single elimination. As a big Chi Chi fan, her performance this season has been a tremendous bummer to watch. She clearly wasn’t ready for “All Stars,” and she knew it. I hate that her “Drag Race” legacy will be stained by this performance. At her best, there’s no better entertainer, and I highly recommend seeing her when she’s next in your city.","Some trivia-heavy thoughts:","After three extra-long episodes, we get a quick installment this week, and the show suffers for it. Snatch Game is not tight enough (heh) to fit into 40 minutes plus commercials. We race through the runway in less than a minute, with nary a judge comment about Shangela or Ben’s looks. “Drag Race” has become too sprawling to condense into an episode this short, and you can feel the editing strain.\nSince the judges don’t, let’s talk about the winners’ Flower Power runway looks: Shangela’s Beyoncé-inspired look is divine. Ben’s is a bit too expected and recalls her bejeweled eleganza look from two episodes ago. But who the hell am I to judge her? She’s won every damn challenge of the season! She knows what she’s doing.\nBenDeLaCreme is now the only queen in “Drag Race” her story to win two Snatch Games. Kennedy missed her chance to complete the same trick. The only other queens who failed to win their second Snatch were Ginger Minj and Tatianna. The former was merely safe in “All Stars” season two’s Snatch Game, while the latter was actually eliminated.\nAdding to Ben’s pile of records: She is now the first queen to win four challenges in a row. She beats her own record of three in a row, which she set just last week.\nListen, I don’t want to pile on Trixie, but the makeup look she did for RuPaul was a mess, too. Whenever Trixie has to paint something other than her usual face, it seems like she gets uncomfortable. (Her Dolly Parton look was also not her strongest.) Her Ru dress, on the other hand, was perfect.\nShangela breaking the fourth wall to shame us for Trixie’s performance had me giggling. “Y’all told her on the internet it was funny! I blame y’all!” I promise it’s usually much better, Shangela!\nFun fact: If you compare their placements in Snatch Game, Jessica Wild officially delivered a better RuPaul impression than Trixie Mattel. Icon.\nShe was a good sport, but Kristin Chenoweth being on the Snatch Game panel did nothing for me but waste time. I wish she and fellow guest judge Nicole Byer had been the contestants, instead of Michelle Visage and Carson Kressley, so we got to spend more time with them both. The guests were very much victims of the shortened episode.\nSpeaking of: Why did Marc Jacobs walk through the workroom with Ru, then never appear again, with no explanation? We’ll probably never know!\nStill pretty sure Bebe is the mole.","The next episode of “RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars” will air Thursday, Feb. 22, at 8 p.m. Eastern on VH1."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a870ef31e000019007abec6.jpg?ops=crop_0_74_1080_555%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Trump Signs Larry Nassar-Inspired Sexual Assault Bill Behind Closed Doors","authors":"Alanna Vagianos","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-signs-larry-nassar-inspired-sexual-assault-bill-behind-closed-doors_us_5a858e2ce4b0ab6daf467b9c","short_description":"The president quietly signed the bill the week after two White House staffers resigned amid allegations of domestic violence.","date":"2018-02-15"},"articleContent":["President Donald Trump signed a bill into law on Wednesday afternoon that aims to protect amateur athletes from sexual assault in the wake of the Larry Nassar sex abuse scandal.","Nassar, the former team doctor for USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University, has been given two concurrent sentences of 40 to 175 years and 40 to 125 years in prison for sexually abusing hundreds of young athletes.","Several of Nassar’s victims helped create the Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse and Safe Sport Authorization Act, which was sponsored by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.). The measure received a big push after 265 women delivered victim impact statement during Nassar’s sentence hearings in January.","The bill has a three-pronged approach to protecting athletes and regulating governing bodies of amateur athletics.","First, it requires coaches, trainers and others to report any sexual abuse allegation to the police within a 24-hour period.

Ted Poe (R-Texas) said during a House debate of the bill in January.","Trump signed the bill behind closed doors in the Oval Office as his administration deals with its own abuse scandal.

He explained that he was Sikh and that he serves both the U.S. and his home country of India, since his parents still live there.","“The attacker’s behavior escalated more and more as Mr. Singh tried to inform him about his religion, about the tenets of Sikhism, why he wore a turban,” Kaur told HuffPost. “As that went on, the attacker became more and more incensed, to the point where he pulled out a gun.”","The woman in the car then “forcibly removed” the male passenger from the vehicle, the coalition said. She then apologized for the male passenger’s behavior and told Mr. Singh to drop her at home and to avoid taking the same route back to eliminate another encounter with the man.","Kaur said that Singh is traumatized, especially since the religious leader feels he was attacked because of his Sikh identity.","“To be attacked for something you love and respect about yourself ... that is really being attacked at the core,” Kaur said.","“He was really fearful and even now he feels insecure about whether this man will come back and attack him again, whether other people will feel emboldened by this as well.”","Singh allegedly notified the police about the incident the next day, Jan. 29. The Sikh Coalition is dismayed that, more than two weeks later, the passenger still has not been arrested or charged.","The Rock Island County sheriff and the state’s attorney’s office did not respond to HuffPost’s requests for comment.","Sheriff Gerry Bustos told The Washington Post that he expects charges will be filed by the end of this week, after Uber responds to a warrant for more information about the attack.","An Uber spokesperson told HuffPost that the company is gathering the information requested. It has removed the rider’s access to Uber and is “fully cooperating with law enforcement on their investigation.”","“Uber does not tolerate any form of discrimination on the app, and we have reached out to the [driver] to offer our support,” the spokesperson said.","Kaur believes that the incident should be prosecuted as a hate crime, with or without the additional evidence from Uber.","“I understand the need for a thorough investigation ... but I think when you have a man who has been identified, and a man who makes threats specifically against somebody’s race, religion, ancestry and national origins, and you don’t arrest that person, that sends a clear message,” Kaur told HuffPost. “And to not prosecute this as a hate crime would be to send another clear message. What you’re really doing is telling a community that you don’t care about them.”","Although Sikhs have been part of America’s religious landscape for over 100 years, many Americans are unfamiliar with the religion or confuse Sikhs with Muslims. In the years since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Sikh Americans have repeatedly been targets of hate crimes, in part because the turbans and beards Sikh men wear as part of their faith make them stand out as visible minorities.","Kaur, who met with local Sikh leaders on Wednesday, said that some Sikhs in the community have been feeling insecure and scared after hearing about what happened to Singh.","“There is a man with a gun who has already threatened a member of the community because of his brown skin, turban and beard, and many other community members here fit that description,” she said. “They’re thinking, ‘Does he look at all brown people the same way? If he comes back to attack Gurjeet, is he going to mistake me for him?’”","“In the post-9/11 era, with all the hate violence and backlash the Sikh community has to deal with, that’s a very real thought,” Kaur said.","In a statement, Singh urged authorities to arrest and charge the passenger.","“This never should have happened, and I want my community and family to feel safe,” he said."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8604f71e00002c007abd5e.jpeg?cache=GzFYh2wmtL&ops=crop_0_423_1500_1406%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"MEDIA","headline":"Ex-GOP Lawmaker: It’s Time To Vote Republicans Out So We Can Get Gun Control","authors":"Ed Mazza","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/david-jolly-flip-the-house_us_5a85274ae4b0774f31d1f615","short_description":"\"Republicans are not going to do a single thing after this shooting we saw today.\"","date":"2018-02-15"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Kelly Ripa Says 'Thoughts And Prayers Are Not Enough Anymore' After Deadly Mass Shooting","authors":"Carly Ledbetter","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kelly-ripa-says-thoughts-and-prayers-not-enough-anymore-florida-school-shooting_us_5a85c1d5e4b0774f31d331e7","short_description":"At least 17 people were killed and 15 others injured on Wednesday.","date":"2018-02-15"},"articleContent":["Talk show host Kelly Ripa declared that “thoughts and prayers are not enough anymore” the morning after a gunman killed 17 people and injured at least 15 others at a South Florida high school on Wednesday.","″[I] don’t know how how many times this is going to happen,” Ripa said on “Live With Kelly and Ryan” on Thursday. “I don’t know how many times it has to happen for a school shooting, a mass shooting of this caliber, before somebody does something, before people really get into it.”","Ripa also got out in front of people who would criticize her, as a celebrity or a talk show host, for talking about an issue like gun violence.","“In this moment, I am a mom of three kids that go to school and I had to talk my kids off a ledge this morning because they were afraid to go to school,” she said, adding that her kids have grown up practicing active shooter drills.","“The fact that our country has such unparalleled mass shooter violence is staggering to me,” Ripa said.","“Somebody needs to have a conversation that is larger than in this moment, and, again, I just say it as a concerned citizen and parent and human being that something needs to change.

When South Africa’s National Assembly convenes Thursday, it is expected to elect Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, a Nelson Mandela protégé, as head of state.","Zuma, disgraced, will depart the presidency nine years after he was elected. He now faces prosecution and is likely to be ostracized by a party that once reportedly aided and abetted his pillaging of the state but which will now do its best to distance itself from its former leader.","While Zuma assumed the presidency under a cloud of corruption and amid deep doubts about his integrity, he once had the support of a large part of the electorate who was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. Many believed that once he was elevated to the position once occupied by a figure as beloved as Mandela, he would rise to the occasion and become more effective than his predecessor, Thabo Mbeki, in advancing the national project of building a new society.","For a while, at least, he was a colossus upon South Africa’s political and national terrain, dominating his party and directing the affairs of state. But his repurposing of the nation to serve his personal interests undermined and wounded institutions, violated the constitution and reduced the ANC, which once fought to defeat white minority rule, to a patronage network.","Zuma saw the state as his personal protection racket, a network he could use to dispense patronage and wealth. But he also appeared determined to use his office to manipulate key institutions to ensure that he stay out of jail. He quickly took control of key institutions, including the police and intelligence and judicial systems, installing a succession of subservient political figures to protect him and his network.","Once he had neutered systems of accountability, he turned his attention to the economic sphere. He cleaned out the South African Revenue Service, installing as its commissioner a minion who engineered the wholesale gutting of one of the jewels in the civil service system.","Next up was National Treasury. His good friends and family benefactors, the Gupta brothers, needed access to state coffers, and when ministers of finance seemed to get in the way on two occasions, in December 2015 and again in March 2017, Zuma removed the ministers without consultation.","As a result of this so-called state capture, trust in government ― and in the ANC ― suffered greatly, and that eventually led to Zuma’s downfall.","Zuma took the reins of a governing party with an electoral majority of close to 70 percent. He went on to mold the ANC in his image: He became the ANC, and the ANC became him.","Today, the party is much diminished, its electoral future an uncertainty. The party, which has lost control of major cities, including Johannesburg and Pretoria, could dip below 50 percent in next year’s election and is now deeply divided. Its national conference in December led to a fragile and uncertain détente between battling factions ― one attempting to reform the party and the other seemingly still determined to use it as vehicle for maximum rent extraction from the nation.","But if there is a silver lining in the events of the last few months ― which included reporting by an independent press and the display of courage by public servants who called out or investigated corruption ― it is that it reminded South Africans of the lofty ideals that they built their democratic state on in 1994.","While South Africa may have lost its innocence, Zuma did not break the country."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a84fad31e000046057abbf1.jpeg?ops=crop_23_291_2754_1691%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"WORLD NEWS","headline":"Cyril Ramaphosa, South Africa's Great Negotiator, Elected President","authors":"Alexander Winning, Reuters","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/south-africa-cyril-ramaphosa-elected-president_us_5a8589cde4b0058d55668035","short_description":"Ramaphosa has fulfilled his long-held ambition to lead the country.","date":"2018-02-15"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Democrats Seek $1 Billion To Boost Cybersecurity For U.S. Elections","authors":"By Dustin Volz, Reuters","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cybersecurity-us-elections_us_5a854d64e4b0774f31d21ada","short_description":"The measure followed warnings from U.S. intelligence officials that midterm races in November are likely to see renewed meddling from Russia and possibly other foreign adversaries.","date":"2018-02-15"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"SPORTS","headline":"Mikaela Shiffrin Wins Gold In Women's Giant Slalom","authors":"","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mikaela-shiffrin-gold-giant-slalom_us_5a8523a4e4b0ab6daf45c6ec","short_description":"It was her second gold medal ever after her 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics win.","date":"2018-02-15"},"articleContent":["PYEONGCHANG (Reuters) - American Mikaela Shiffrin put on a show of grace, power and consistency to win her first gold medal of the Pyeongchang Olympics in the women’s giant slalom on Thursday.","With all the top 30 having completed their second runs and a huge margin separating them from the rest of the field, the 22-year-old was assured of victory, with Norway’s Ragnhild Mowinckel taking silver and Italy’s Federica Brignone bronze.","After days of frustrating weather delays, it was the perfect start for Shiffrin, who won the slalom in Sochi four years ago and could compete in four or five more events here.","In a contest of sharply fluctuating fortunes between the morning and afternoon runs, her placings of second and fourth-fastest gave her a combined time of two minutes, 20.02 seconds, and a comfortable margin of 0.39 seconds over Mowinckel.","Italy’s Manuela Moelgg was the last of the top 30 to race, having beaten Shiffrin by 0.2 seconds in the morning, but she fumbled her chance of winning an Olympic gold at the age of 34 and finished the competition in eighth place.","Sweden’s Estelle Alphand posted the fastest afternoon time but was only 26th in the morning, leaving her 16th overall.","With many competitors struggling to avoid mistakes and several wiping out altogether on the steep 1,250 meters-long slope, with a vertical drop of 400 meters, Shiffrin was conspicuous by her smooth, attacking style and easy rhythm.","The giant slalom was the first women’s Alpine skiing race to take place at the Pyeongchang Games, after high winds forced it to be rescheduled from Monday and also caused Wednesday’s slalom to be postponed.","(Additional reporting by Rory Carroll;

Today, immigrant communities have higher rates of unintended pregnancy and cervical cancer, and some have higher rates of HIV. Almost half of non-citizen women of reproductive age with low incomes lack health insurance.”","“At Planned Parenthood, we understand that reproductive justice and immigrant justice are part of the same fight,” she added. “Because when women can share their medical histories openly and access reproductive health care without fear, they are better able to build healthy families, participate in the workforce and control their destinies.”","In September 2017, President Donald Trump announced he would rescind the Obama-era program Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) that protects undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children.

Quezada said the long wait time was more than an inconvenience.","Latino voters don’t trust the system, Quezada said. “If they don’t have a good experience on Election Day when they are casting their ballot, their likelihood of participating in a system they don’t trust again in the future becomes that much harder.”","Across the country, elections officials are marshaling data on registered voters, historic turnout, parking spaces and other information to reduce wait times at polling places. Also helping to decrease wait times is voting by mail, which is available in 22 states, and early voting, which is now offered in 37 states — though a couple of states have rolled back their early voting.","But white voters are benefiting far more from such innovations than Hispanic or black voters are. As the nation gears up for what is shaping up to be a high-energy midterm election this November, the disparity is likely to loom large.","In the 2016 presidential election, black voters, on average, waited 16 minutes to vote, while Latino voters waited 13 minutes, according to a Massachusetts Institute of Technology survey of voters. In the same election, white voters waited 10 minutes. In 2012, black and Latino voters stood in line for more than 20 minutes to cast their ballot, nearly twice as long as white voters.","Stephen Pettigrew, a political scientist at the University of Pennsylvania, has found if there are two neighborhoods in the same city, and one is majority-white and the other has more blacks and Hispanics, voters in the white neighborhood have a shorter wait.","Voting rights advocates call the disparity a “time tax.” They argue that it violates the fundamental right to vote — and that it is often intentional.","“We are in a state of threat to voting rights,” said Denise Lieberman, co-director of the Power and Democracy program at the Washington, D.C.-based Advancement Project, a civil rights organization. “Some actions, like changing polling places, may seem benign on its face, but they are creating havoc.”","Fewer Resources","In poorer counties and cities, long lines may stem from a lack of resources. But even in wealthier counties, minority communities tend to get fewer polling places, voting machines and poll workers than white neighborhoods in the same county, according to a 2014 study from the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University’s School of Law. “Minority precincts have tended to get the short end of the resource allocation stick,” the study concluded.","Lieberman argues that in many counties, election officials are less inclined to provide minority communities with the resources that can shorten lines.","It’s one of many policies that are “creating a climate of discrimination,” Lieberman said, in the same vein as restrictive voter ID laws, the slashing of early voting in states like Florida and North Carolina, and the consolidation of polling places, all of which adversely affect communities of color. Local officials and state lawmakers are trying to suppress the minority vote, Lieberman said.","“None of this is a coincidence,” Lieberman said. “The folks who pass these laws know their impact. … Communities of color bear the brunt of a lack of legal protection.”","In North Carolina, a federal court agreed in 2016, saying many of the state’s restrictive voting laws, including strict voter ID requirements and a rollback of early voting, “target African-Americans with almost surgical precision.” North Carolina lawmakers said the laws were passed to protect state elections against fraud and to save counties money.","Cutting Voting Lines","Local election officials know how to keep voting lines short, which makes this time gap so frustrating for voting scholars such as Charles Stewart III, the director of MIT’s Voting Technology Project.","U.S. voters’ wait time shrank to 11 minutes in the 2016 presidential election, down from 14 minutes in 2012, according to MIT’s quadrennial survey. Further, the survey found, fewer voters waited more than an hour to cast their ballot than in the previous election. County officials should be using best-practice tools to decrease wait times in all precincts regardless of their racial makeup, Stewart said.","Many of those tools were implemented after the 2012 presidential election, where hellish voting lines in states such as Florida made national news. (On average, according to MIT’s survey, it took Florida voters 46 minutes to cast their ballots that year.) President Barack Obama took notice, and in 2013 he appointed a bipartisan commission, led by the chief lawyers from his campaign and Republican nominee Mitt Romney’s campaign, to solve the issues that plagued the country’s electoral system.","One of the commission’s primary recommendations was to use data, such as voter registration numbers and parking availability near polling places, to better manage polling places, which would in turn decrease the size of lines. The commission’s goal was to make sure no American ever waits more than a half-hour to vote.","Tammy Patrick, a senior adviser at the nonprofit Democracy Fund and a member of the commission, said that because election officials are following its recommendations, “the preponderance of lines is going down.”","Stewart, for his part, launched an online “toolkit,” which he said is now used by a quarter of the country’s local election officials to help them deploy enough poll booths, poll workers and ballot scanners to handle Election Day voting.","“If you’re not gathering that data,” Stewart said, “you’re running blind.”","Michael Scarpello, the registrar of voters in San Bernardino County, California, has embraced that lesson.","To serve the largest geographic county in the contiguous 48 states, Scarpello and his analytics department take a large swath of data — registered voters, historic turnout, parking spaces, voter behavior, capacity of polling places — to assign poll workers, distribute supplies­­ and assign voters to specific polling locations, freeing up busy locations and utilizing underused places. Using this data, Scarpello is able to update polling place capacity by the hour in a county of nearly 900,000 registered voters.","“If there are lines, they are short,” Scarpello said. At most, voters wait five minutes.","The county’s immediate response to Election Day voter behavior lowers the length of lines, the cost of elections, and the time it takes to count ballots. Between 2008 and 2016, the county cut its ballot-counting time nearly in half, from 16 hours to nine, Scarpello said.","“Our job is to make voting as convenient as possible for voters,” Scarpello said. “If voters are motivated, we don’t want to put any barriers in their way.”","Closing the Gap","Voting lines in Orange County, California, never surpass nine minutes, said Neal Kelley, the county’s registrar of voters. That’s significant because the county is the fifth-largest voting jurisdiction in the country and because a third of the electorate is Latino.","There is no difference in wait times between Orange County’s majority-white Newport Beach and majority-Latino Santa Ana, Kelley said. Countywide, the average wait time for voters dropped drastically in recent years after Kelley began using sophisticated data techniques to change how they allocate the county’s 11,000 voting booths and 9,000 poll workers among 1,300 polling places.","As the county prepares for a potentially competitive congressional election for 15-term Republican U.S. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher’s seat this November, Kelley said he’s relying on data from 2010, the last hotly contested midterm election, to estimate turnout for this one.","Kelley said he will monitor precincts closely on Election Day. “One booth could make all the difference in the world.”","In Maricopa County, where Quezada and his neighbors waited so long to vote in 2016, the official in charge of that election has paid a price.","Helen Purcell, then Maricopa County’s recorder since 1989, had reduced the numberof polling places for the 2016 primary, recommending 60 polling places in the fourth-largest county in the United States, down from 200 in 2012.","In the aftermath of the election, The Arizona Republic found that low-income, Latino neighborhoods bore the brunt of the decrease.

Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) lashed out at his former colleague Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Thursday, saying the nation’s top law enforcement official had stepped out of his lane by weighing in on a drug sentencing reform bill that had bipartisan support.","Grassley, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, supports the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act, which passed the committee 16-5 on Thursday but faces a tough road ahead. Sessions’ letter on the bill, which would reduce mandatory minimum sentences for certain nonviolent drug crimes, warned it would benefit “a highly dangerous cohort of criminals.” While there’s been growing support for criminal justice reform among Republicans in recent years, Sessions has generally opposed such measures.","Grassley said during a markup hearing that while he considered Sessions a friend, he was “really irritated that he would send that letter.” He noted his support for Sessions through the confirmation process as well as when the attorney general has been targeted by President Donald Trump.","“The president was going to fire him last spring and I went to his defense,” Grassley said. (Though it has been widely acknowledged that Sessions wrote a resignation letter, the Justice Department has taken the position that admitting that Sessions authored a resignation letter would violate his personal privacy.)","“It was almost as if it was Senator Sessions being back on this committee, and not [Attorney] General Sessions. That’s a problem. He is now the attorney general and is charged with executing the laws that Congress passes, not interfering with the legislative process,” Grassley said.","If Sessions wanted to be involved in marking up legislation, Grassley said, “maybe he should have quit his job and run for the Republican Senate seat in Alabama.” That was a reference to the fact that the Republican nominee ― who was accused of sexual misconduct ― lost to a Democrat.","A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment on Grassley’s remarks.","Ryan Reilly is HuffPost’s senior justice reporter, covering federal law enforcement, criminal justice and legal affairs.

I","date":"2018-02-15"},"articleContent":["On Halloween , many people love to dress up as their favorite characters, but for others, playing the part of someone they admire is actually a lifestyle. Insert: the cosplay community — a group of creatives who are passionate about costume play. While it’s not traditionally known as a hobby in which people of color partake, there is one young black woman who is making a name for herself in cosplay.","Kiera Please is a cosplayer who has gained a massive following. She’s transformed into everyone from Canary of the Japanese manga series “Hunter x Hunter” to Winifred Sanderson from the Disney horror fantasy film Hocus Pocus. And every time she tries out a new character, her spot-on execution illustrates her incomparable talent.","Besides just playing characters she adores, the 23-year-old has made it known time and time again that she absolutely loves and understands the importance of playing characters of color. “Women of color can be seen in different realms, and I want to make sure people can take that in and realize that,” she tells Yahoo Lifestyle. “If you see no one that looks like you that can be kind of frustrating.”","We caught up with the Georgia-based cosplayer to find out more about her amazing journey and how she’s changing the face of cosplay.","Yahoo Lifestyle: How did you begin doing cosplay? Did you have any formal training?","Kiera: It’s kind of a funny story. I always used to get compared to this character named Garnet from the animated series “Stephen Universe.” One day I was just like, “Hey, I’m going to dress up as Garnet” because everybody would constantly tell me how I remind them of that character. I decided to just piece it all together and was like, “Hey, guys, look who I am,” as a surprise and everyone received it pretty well.","Initially, I didn’t even connect that it was cosplay and was just really enjoying it, and I thought to myself, I want to do another character. That’s when I did my second character, Princess Kida, and from there I started realizing there was a whole community of people who do this. It didn’t even come across my mind at first.","Why is it important for you to cosplay women of color?","There was a time when I sat down just thinking of characters of color within cartoons, and I had a hard time. I struggled to name six! While there are more than six out there, it was kind of strange to me that it took a while for me to come up with that list. I believe it’s important to identify with characters in shows that you watch. It’s good to just highlight those characters so people know there are characters out there like that. They are important, and I feel like there should be more. Women of color can be seen in different realms and I want to make sure people can take that in and realize that. You want to empower people, and you want to be empowered by the things you watch. If you see no one who looks like you, that can be kind of frustrating.","Have you experienced any unique challenges or backlash from the cosplay industry?","Yes, definitely. A lot of it has been from people who aren’t necessarily familiar with that realm. A lot of the backlash mainly comes when I cosplay someone who isn’t black. People will say, “You don’t look like her,” “You’re a little too curvy to be that person,” or “This looks nothing like it — you failed.” It’s just heartbreaking because it’s not necessarily about looking exactly like the character; it’s about having a love for that character, their personality, maybe even identifying with them heavily, and putting your love into that character. That’s why you create the outfits, and that’s why you decide to dress up within them because something about that character touched you.","I try to just ignore the backlash and keep going so people can see it doesn’t bother me, and I’m still going to do it.","Does it ever bother you when someone who’s not of color plays a character that is? Why or why not?","It depends on how the person executes it. As long as there’s no yellowface or blackface or manipulating to look black, then I’m OK with it. Princess Kida is seen as a woman of color, and you can wear a white wig without adding brown to your skin. It also depends on if the character is wearing any garments that have any cultural significance. Personally, I don’t want to touch a character if in real life their garments actually do mean something. I’d rather just stay away from that character.","It’s important to be sensitive about how you clothe your character and recognizing those differences to make sure you’re aware and that you’re not offending anyone.","Have you you ever gone out in cosplay on a regular day?","Oh my God, I have! It’s so funny. Sometimes it looks like people are thinking, Is that what she’s really wearing? Then there are some people that come up to me like, “Um, I don’t want to bother you, but are you blah blah blah from this show?” I never say anything when I do it to anybody. I just go out and see what happens. It’s cool to see people’s reactions.","Cosplay costs can add up with all the supplies needed. How did you get around that? Any tips?","Yeah, sometimes I do get sponsorships from companies that have cosplay items. I actually usually like to change my hair, so there are times when I’ll coordinate it with the characters I may want to play and get wigs to try from different companies.","As far as cutting costs, it’s usually just going through and manipulating clothes at a thrift store or your closet. I definitely suggest going to a thrift store and looking for fabric there on 25 cent or $1 days. Joann Fabric and Craft Stores is a good place to try. They always have text coupons with items up to 50 percent off.","Many characters wear outfits you would wear in everyday life, but their outfit just may be very iconic to their personality. I’ve had some people come up to me saying, “Yeah, I didn’t realize I could do it that way too.” It’s very touching to hear, “I don’t have a lot of money to spend all the time on this, so it’s good to know that there’s other characters that don’t have extravagant outfits that I can cosplay.” This allows you to save up to build for an extravagant costume you’ve been wanting to get.","What advice would you give to children of color or anyone younger who is inspired by you and wants to get into cosplay?","I would probably tell them to just go out and try it. Whether it comes out great or it comes out OK or you don’t like it, the first thing to do is just start. As cliché as that sounds, it’s true. I would also say try to find a friend to do it with you. It makes the process easier and more fun when you can go to the thrift store and have a buddy.","Another piece of advice would be to not care about what people have to say. If you’re embarrassed or scared to go into it, at the end of the day, they’re not in control of your life. To let someone control your life who has no impact on your future is just not worth it. You don’t ever want to live your life thinking, I wish I would have tried that. You’d rather live it saying, “I tried that, it didn’t work. OK, I’m going to move on” or “I tried that and found out I loved it.”","Also, don’t be afraid to start small. I can remember a lot of times in the past not starting a project because I felt like I needed so many things, but at the end of the day, you have to just start with something that’s doable. Don’t discount starting small, even if you can’t start where you want to be. It’s OK to start somewhere else. Let go of your ego of how it’s supposed to go, and just go into it any way that you’re able to.","What do your family and friends think about your love of cosplay?","They didn’t really know I was into it. To be honest, I feel like they found out through the internet. I didn’t explicitly say, “Hey, Mom, I’m doing this.” It’s kind of like they randomly saw it on the internet and then no one said anything. That’s the funny part. They’re just like, “All right, if that’s what she want to do.” Now it’s more of an open conversation where they’ll give suggestions. They were never unsupportive of it. They just saw and were like, “OK, well we love you. Do what you want.” Now it’s more so like, “Oh, you should do this character or can I do it with you?” It’s funny.","Why do you enjoy cosplay and continue to do it?","When I started doing it, I would consider each character just a little project I was working on. It would help me get through hard times. If I was struggling with something, it was kind of like my therapy. It wasn’t just about making these characters, but it was about doing something that I enjoyed that would help me get through situations, calm my mind, calm my thoughts, and just lower my blood pressure, in general. I really enjoy the process of it.","I also love when people come up to me in real life because of cosplay. They let me know things like, “I was scared to try it out or I never thought I could. I didn’t really know about it, and then I saw you do it and thought it was kind of cool, I want to try it too.” It feels good to know people are delving into realms they’re unfamiliar with and feeling completely confident about it. It’s not always easy to dive into something like that, so it’s nice to give that push to someone who may have needed it.","In the end, I just like seeing the end result of the characters. I like going to the conventions and seeing other characters or other people do it. It’s just nice to see people put in all that work and then see the finished product. You’re like, wow, they really created something that didn’t exist before and now here it is. They look wonderful.","This interview has been edited and condensed.","Read more from Yahoo Lifestyle:","How this curvy blogger hopes to change the fashion industry’s diversity problem\nYouTuber’s ‘Pennywise’ makeup tutorial defended by cosplay influencer\nPeople can’t believe how much this cosplayer looks like Wonder Woman","This post was originally published on Yahoo Lifestyle."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a85c6e32100003800601599.jpeg?cache=31MRop2ayN&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"SPORTS","headline":"Snow Volleyball In The Olympics?

The music’s bumping a bass beat thick enough to rearrange internal organs, and the crowd throws up hands every time the DJ calls out MONSTER BLOCK or SUPER SLAM.","Oh, and it’s a balmy 35 degrees out. Perfect volleyball weather, right?","Beach volleyball has become one of the marquee events of the Summer Games, and now comes its snowy cousin with an eye on carving out a little slice of the wintertime sports pie. Snow volleyball isn’t anywhere near getting onto an Olympic slate, not even close, but at a demonstration event held on Valentine’s Day at the Austria House, within sight of the Olympic Sliding Centre, the energy was as high as almost any event this week.","The International Volleyball Federation (FIVB) and the European Volleyball Confederation (CEV) rounded up a handful of notable beach volleyballers: gold medalists Emanuel of Brazil, Vladimir Grbic of Serbia and Giba of Brazil, as well as bronze medalist Chen Xue of China and Olympians Stefanie Schwaiger of Austria, Kim Yeon-koung of South Korea, and Nikolas Berger of Austria. The Olympians threw on some thermals, gloves, and soccer cleats, and took a turn in the snow as perhaps a hundred fans around them cheered and danced.","“We like to play in the mountains, in the beach, outside, inside, with children, with men and women,” CEV president Aleksandr Boricic said after the demonstration. “With snow volleyball, we can cover volleyball every day of the year.”","The purpose of this little exhibition was to show snow volleyball’s viability as a sport, and on that score, it succeeded just fine. But as an Olympic entry? That’s where it gets a little trickier.","Snow volleyball demands a different set of skills than the beach version, starting with the fact that, well, you’re on snow. Attendants with rakes chopped the snow into a fine powder, but by the end of the match, the stomping players, and dropping temperatures, had pounded the snow into slick near-concrete.","The altitude is a factor, as is the cold. Players in most snow volleyball events — though not this particular one — close off with a celebratory dip in a hot tub, but before then, the lower oxygen can tire even the best players.","It’s because of these inescapable factors — plus unpredictable ones, like the high winds savaging the Olympic Village at the same time the volleyball beats were dropping — that organizers from the FIVB and the CEV were preaching baby steps rather than big-picture dreams, “innovation” and “possibility” rather than expectation.","“What we do believe is that snow volleyball is great, it’s about engagement,” Azevedo said. “We want people to be playing volleyball. The future, who knows?”","The earliest snow volleyball could realistically make the Olympic slate would be 2026, following a stint as a demonstration sport in the 2022 Games in Beijing. But even that is no sure thing; the IOC historically has sought to keep sports confined to one season. (An attempt to bring cross-country running to the Winter Games in 2008, for instance, went nowhere.) Snow volleyball does have both a strong organizing federation and a ready availability of Olympic-level players, but even those might not be enough to get snow volleyball onto the Olympic slate.","In the short term, snow volleyball’s backers are focusing on smaller steps: a European Tour kicked off in 2015, and European championships will take place later this year. FIVB hopes to start a world tour in 2019, to be followed by world championships in 2020. Beyond that, well … we’ll see.","Read more from Yahoo Sports:","American speedskaters still seeking 1st Olympic medal\n\nWhile you were sleeping: USA won the halfpipe (again), Netherlands won speed skating gold (again)\n\nAmerican skier suffers the most heartbreaking injury of the Olympics","This story was originally published on Yahoo Sports."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a850d841e00002c007abbf4.jpeg?cache=HKKpMBwe6J&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Steve Bannon Met With Robert Mueller's Team For Two Days This Week","authors":"Patricia Zengerle and Karen Freifeld, Reuters","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/steve-bannon-mueller_us_5a85fc38e4b00bc49f424023","short_description":"He also refused to answer many questions during a meeting with the House Intelligence Committee.","date":"2018-02-15"},"articleContent":["WASHINGTON, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Former White House adviser Steve Bannon met with Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigators for two days this week, even as he frustrated lawmakers by refusing to answer many questions posed by the U.S. House Intelligence Committee on Thursday.","Republican Representative Mike Conaway and Democratic Representative Adam Schiff said Bannon, President Donald Trump’s former strategist and a key player in Trump’s 2016 election campaign, would answer only 25 questions approved by the White House.","Schiff called for the initiation of contempt of Congress proceedings against Bannon.

Hair should be of ample length, none of that short “butch” stuff. Carry yourself like a lady whenever and wherever possible.","Oh, and be straight.","The men have their own instructions. Build ample musculature. Keep your hair clean-cut, but nothing too fancy. Men aren’t fancy. Speak with a deep voice, talk about family a lot, and pick a couple masculine interests — may we suggest beer and your love of sports — as go-to talking points.","Oh, and be straight.","So when an athlete like Adam Rippon comes along, breaking every single rule dictating how American athletes become American heroes, a caution flag gets waved. The TV networks pull back. Corporations shy away. Children must be protected, the very image of what it is to be a man in America suddenly at risk.","Except... not this time.","This time, NBC is talking about how Rippon “slays.”","This time, Sesame Street celebrated his accomplishments with an Elmo dance.","This time, marketing departments in corporate America are scrambling to figure out how to connect themselves to the gay kid.","This time, straight guys are talking about how they love Adam Rippon.","This time... is different.","This all quite nearly happened once before. In 2010, Johnny Weir was a Rippon-style quote machine... or should I say he was just typical Johnny Weir. Everything American audiences are seeing now in his figure skating commentary and his outlandish outfits for NBC... he was in 2010.","He even gave a performance in the individual free skate that, we wrote at the time, “brought the crowd to its feet.”","Just as many felt about Rippon’s performance in the team event Sunday night, Weir was equally “robbed” of better numbers by a scoring system that mandates bigger jumps, less fancy. A scoring system that mandates its figure skaters be masculine not feminine, athletes not artists... straight not gay.","Despite the list of similarities, Rippon has hit a nerve with American audiences in a way Weir never did, in large part because those American audiences have, forever, changed.","From the perspective of 2010, it’s hard to recognize American culture as it relates to the LGBT community today. Just eight years ago opposing same-sex marriage was standard operating procedure for your run-of-the-mill Democrat; Now it’s bigotry. Wrapping a TV show around a big, black drag queen was ghettoized to “gay TV”; Now it’s ratings gold.","The most glittery, gay athlete at the Winter Olympics is, after just a few days, our national hero.","To be sure, we are all still Americans in one respect: We want a winner. Rippon could be as outlandish, as over-the-top, as witty as his mind could spin. But if he didn’t perform athletically, if he didn’t bring home a medal, he’d be long forgotten already a few days after his debut Olympic.","Instead, on day three of the figure skating competition, this slim young man in the most sequined outfit any one costume designer could muster, he gave an emotional performance that was felt from Pittsburgh to Pyeongchang. Hours later there he was, snapping pics with a medal around his neck, Olympic-hero status firmly secured.","It’s so important for gay youth to see someone like Rippon being his authentic gay self. We’ve seen a bit of it before, from the likes of the aforementioned Weir and Ru.","Yet no one has put it all together into quite the perfect package as has Rippon.","The kicker is all of this is the importance to that gay youth of seeing the reaction to him. Entertainers, athletes and politicians have lauded him. Their friends and family are celebrating him. Dads are talking glowingly about that Olympic hero in that shiny outfit. The reaction — to Rippon’s emotional performance and his big personality — gives that young kid permission to let his big personality out too.","The next couple of nights will be telling. Rippon isn’t favored to win a medal, largely because of the current (I’d say flawed) scoring system.","Yet no one can ever take away the medal he’s already won. He will forever be an American Olympic medalist. His legacy, and America’s love affair with Adam Rippon, isn’t going anywhere.","If he is able to win an individual medal this week, the Internet, and our perception of the great American hero, will break forever.","For more from OutSports, check out these stories:","Elmo dancing with Adam Rippon is not a small thing","Gay Olympian says she was threatened by Russians after World Cup boycott","Meet gay Olympic figure skater Jorik Hendrickx"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a85de1d1e000037007abd44.jpeg?cache=tsMT0iWzeN&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Senate Votes Down Multiple Bills To Help Dreamers After Veto Threat On Bipartisan Proposal","authors":"Elise Foley","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/senate-dreamers-trump_us_5a85f40de4b004fc31903ed3","short_description":"President Donald Trump's administration rejected multiple bipartisan proposals.","date":"2018-02-15"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"LATINO VOICES","headline":"Rapper French Montana Launches Campaign To Help Dreamers Go To College","authors":"Carolina Moreno","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/french-montana-launches-campaign-to-help-dreamers-go-to-college_us_5a85ce3ce4b004fc31901109","short_description":"\"I am one of tens of thousands of first and second generation immigrants that are having a significant positive impact on the United States.\"","date":"2018-02-15"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"MEDIA","headline":"Shepard Smith Gives Fox News Viewers A Reality Check After Florida School Shooting","authors":"Ed Mazza","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/shep-smith-florida-shooting_us_5a850aa1e4b0058d5565d76d","short_description":"Some things haven't changed much since Columbine.","date":"2018-02-15"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"BLACK VOICES","headline":"Lena Waithe's Comedy, Centered On A Queer Black Woman, Is Coming To TBS","authors":"Rebecca Shapiro","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lena-waithe-comedy-tbs_us_5a84e7fbe4b0774f31d1e170","short_description":"\"Queer black characters have been the sidekick for long enough, it’s time for us to finally take the lead,” she writes.","date":"2018-02-15"},"articleContent":["TBS announced on Wednesday that the network has ordered a pilot from “ Master of None” star and writer Lena Waithe.","The series, titled “Twenties,” stars a queer black girl named Hattie and her two best friends, who are straight, according to TVLine.

He said he remains “optimistic that any company that claims to value diversity, as Hyatt does, will not ultimately embrace such naked bigotry.”","Act for America was founded by Brigitte Gabriel, a Christian immigrant from Lebanon who has said that “every practicing Muslim is a radical Muslim,” that Muslims are a “natural threat to civilized people of the world, particularly Western society,” and that a “practicing Muslim, who believes in the teachings of the Quran, cannot be a loyal citizen to the United States of America.”","In 2007, Gabriel stood behind a Marriott-branded podium during a Christians United For Israel conference at one of the chain’s hotels in Washington and said that Arabs “have no soul.”","“The difference, my friends, between Israel and the Arab world is the difference between civilization and barbarism,” she said. “It’s the difference between goodness and evil.

Gabriel has also pushed the paranoid conspiracy theory that radicalized Muslims have infiltrated every level of government, including the CIA, FBI, Pentagon and Department of State.","“Escalating anti-Muslim hate crimes in recent years are undoubtedly related to the fears and suspicion raised by these and other conspiracy theories,” said Tamara Sonn, associate director of the Bridge Initiative at Georgetown University, a multi-year research project into Islamophobia.","“Hosting an organization that engages in such activities does not reflect well on the values of Hyatt Hotels Corporation,” she said.","In June 2017, during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, Act for America coordinated “March Against Sharia” protests across the country, events that attracted neo-Nazis, white supremacists and armed anti-government militia members.","Act for America did not respond to a request for comment.","CORRECTION: A previous version of this story described American Renaissance magazine as anti-Semitic.

It was the second federal appeals court to find that Trump’s third travel ban was likely unconstitutional, but both rulings have been put on hold until the U.S. Supreme Court hears oral arguments in the matter this spring.","The 4th Circuit’s majority opinion, written by Chief Judge Roger Gregory, represents yet another instance in which the president’s own words ― and tweets ― have hurt his arguments in court. This has happened to Trump again and again and again.","The 4th Circuit found that Trump had expressed “what any reasonable observer could view as general anti-Muslim bias.” In addition to statements from the campaign trail, the opinion cited Trump’s retweets of anti-Muslim videos posted by a far-right British political party in November as well as this tweet from August:","“The President’s own words ― publicly stating a constitutionally impermissible reason for the Proclamation ― distinguish this case,” the majority found.","While Trump could have “removed the taint of his prior troubling statements,” he hasn’t, the court said. “In fact, instead of taking any actions to cure the ‘taint’ that we found infected [the second executive order laying out a travel ban], President Trump continued to disparage Muslims and the Islamic faith,” it said.","From the opinion:","Plaintiffs here do not just plausibly allege with particularity that the Proclamation’s purpose is driven by anti-Muslim bias, they offer undisputed evidence of such bias: the words of the President. This evidence includes President Trump’s disparaging comments and tweets regarding Muslims; his repeated proposals to ban Muslims from entering the United States; his subsequent explanation that he would effectuate this “Muslim” ban by targeting “territories” instead of Muslims directly; the issuance of [executive order 1] and [executive order 2], addressed only to majority-Muslim nations; and finally the issuance of the Proclamation, which not only closely tracks [executive order 1] and [executive order 2], but which President Trump and his advisors described as having the same goal as [executive order 1] and [executive order 2].","The Trump administration had urged the court to disregard the president’s pre-election statements, perhaps the court said in “implicit recognition of the rawness of the religious animus” in those statements. But the government’s argument that what he said before he was elected wasn’t relevant didn’t hold up, the 4th Circuit said.","“This is a difficult argument to make given that the President and his advisors have repeatedly relied on these pre-election statements to explain the President’s post-election actions related to the travel ban,” the court wrote.","From the opinion:","The Government does not ― and, indeed, cannot ― dispute that the President made these statements. Instead, it argues that the “statements that occurred after the issuance of [executive order 2] do not reflect any religious animus” but reflect “the compelling secular goal of protecting national security from an amply-documented present threat.” We cannot agree.\n\nRather, an objective observer could conclude that the President’s repeated statements convey the primary purpose of the Proclamation — to exclude Muslims from the United States. In fact, it is hard to imagine how an objective observer could come to any other conclusion when the President’s own deputy press secretary made this connection express: he explained that President Trump tweets extremist anti-Muslim videos as part of his broader concerns about “security,” which he has “addressed ... with ... the proclamation.”","“In sum, the face of the Proclamation, read in the context of President Trump’s official statements, fails to demonstrate a primarily secular purpose. To the objective observer, the Proclamation continues to exhibit a primarily religious anti-Muslim objective,” the court wrote.","Read the entire opinion below:","Ryan Reilly is HuffPost’s senior justice reporter, covering the Justice Department, federal law enforcement, criminal justice and legal affairs.

Cory Booker.","date":"2018-02-15"},"articleContent":["WASHINGTON ― The Senate voted Thursday to advance one of President Donald Trump’s judicial nominees, Michael Brennan, who spent his confirmation hearing dodging questions about whether racial bias exists in the criminal justice system.","Every Republican on the Judiciary Committee voted for Brennan, a white Wisconsin lawyer who is Trump’s choice for a lifetime seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit. GOPers on the committee are Sens. Chuck Grassley (Iowa), Orrin Hatch (Utah), Lindsey Graham (S.C.), John Cornyn (Texas), Mike Lee (Utah), Ted Cruz (Texas), Ben Sasse (Neb.), Jeff Flake (Ariz.), Mike Crapo (Idaho), Thom Tillis (N.C.) and John Kennedy (La.).","Every Democrat voted against Brennan.","When Brennan appeared before the committee last month, he bizarrely avoided questions by Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) about whether there is racial bias in the U.S. justice system. His responses ranged from saying he would “do my very best” not to be biased, to talking about his volunteer work, to saying he might give an opinion if he could have a look at the data that Booker was drawing from to say there is racial bias.","Booker was dumbfounded ― particularly because Brennan, who was a state trial court judge in Wisconsin for nine years, should know there are lots of data.","“You’re a judge in the United States of America and you have not looked at issues of race in sentencing and the criminal justice system?” Booker asked. “I find this astonishing.”","Federally collected data is clear on the racial divide in the justice system. Black drivers, for example, are more likely to be pulled over than white drivers. White drivers involved in traffic stops are searched at lower rates than black drivers. Black people spend more time behind bars than white people for the same crimes, and black people are three times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than white people ― even though the two groups use cannabis at roughly the same rates.","During Thursday’s vote, Booker said one of the main reasons he opposed advancing Brennan was because of the judge’s “insulting” and “dangerous” responses to his previous question.","“To be nominating a federal judge who does not even acknowledge the persistent impact of race within our justice system and doesn’t even have a plan or thoughts on it, to me, is stunning and absolutely unacceptable, if not offensive,” Booker said.","Brennan’s nomination now heads to the full Senate for a final vote.","Democrats were also upset that Grassley, the committee chairman, gave Brennan a hearing at all, given that he bent the rules to do it. Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) never turned in her so-called “blue slip” to signal her support for a hearing on Brennan, who is from her home state. It’s longstanding tradition that the chairman won’t give a nominee a hearing unless blue slips are turned in. Grassley ignored that tradition and held a hearing anyway.","“I think we just took a very perilous step that not only eliminates the blue slip with respect to circuit judges, but also disables the very often bipartisan committee selection process with respect to circuit judges,” said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.).","Sasse accused Democrats of setting the precedent for blowing up Senate rules in 2013, when then-Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) lowered the threshold from 60 to 51 votes to advance most nominees on the Senate floor in response to the GOP’s ongoing obstruction of President Barack Obama’s nominees.","“I think the things you’re lamenting are sad,” Sasse told Whitehouse. “You’re pretending it started today. It’s B.S.”","But Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), who formerly chaired the committee, chided Grassley for his unprecedented decision in 2016 not to give a hearing to Obama’s Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland.

In fiscal year 2018, the fund received $53 million in appropriations.","It’s no secret that the administration is more sympathetic to business interests than endangered species. And like most environmental protections, it seems to view the Endangered Species Act ― ESA ― as little more than a regulatory burden to economic growth.","But the administration has also stressed that forming strong partnerships with states and other parties is key to preventing species from going extinct.","“The resources brought to the table by these partners is fundamental for achieving the conservation objectives of the ESA,” Greg Sheehan, principal deputy director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, said at a congressional hearing in July. “It’s time that we recognize those efforts and rebuild the collaborative spirit of conservation that has restored most all fish and wildlife species in America in the last 120 years.”","Dan Ashe, a former director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, said the proposal to end funding for the state conservation fund is baffling, given the Trump administration’s talk about more cooperation.","The ESA grants “are the principal source of support for states’ work on endangered species and for partnership between the Fish and Wildlife Service and states,” Ashe told HuffPost.","To get funding, a state or territory must put up at least 25 percent of a project’s cost and enter into an agreement with the federal government. The grant monies go toward habitat restoration, land acquisition, conservation planning, research and education.","In its justification for the budget change, FWS writes simply that it “is not requesting funding for these activities in order to support higher priorities.”","Among the many creatures that the proposal could negatively impact is a species of imperiled Hawaiian seabird, the Newell’s shearwater. In 2010, the birds’ attraction to artificial lights brought an unpopular end to Friday night football on the Hawaiian island of Kauai. It was that year that the Department of Justice prosecuted the County of Kauai and the island’s electrical utility for violating the Endangered Species Act and Migratory Bird Treaty Act in connection with incidental bird deaths. Both ultimately pleaded guilty and agreed to implement mitigation measures.","During their maiden flight from mountainside burrows, Newell’s shearwaters can confuse street and stadium lights with the moon and become disoriented. After repeatedly circling the light source, the birds often fall to the ground — a phenomenon appropriately called “fallout” — where they become easy targets for cats, mongoose and other predators. The birds have also been killed striking power lines and utility poles on their way out to sea.","Once in abundance on all the Hawaiian islands, Newell’s shearwaters are now found almost exclusively on Kauai. The population has declined by an estimated 75 percent over the last two decades.","Hawaii’s state government has been working with FWS for years to reduce the number of accidental seabird deaths on Kauai, in part thanks to the more than $2 million it has received from the conservation fund since 2011. The money has been used to develop and implement an island-wide habitat conservation plan to better protect Newell’s shearwaters and other at-risk species, including the endangered Hawaiian petrel. The effort has included working with county government, the island’s electrical cooperative and the state Department of Transportation to shield and dim lights and bury power lines.","Officials with the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources did not respond to a request for comment. But Beth Tokioka, a spokeswoman for the Kauai Island Utility Cooperative, said the Kauai Seabird Habitat Conservation Program has been an important partner in the electrical provider’s ongoing efforts.","“We are making great strides toward a long-term plan that will help improve the survival rate of these birds,” Tokioka wrote in an email. “Continued partnerships with KSHCP and others will be critical to the success of that effort.”","Other recent beneficiaries of the federal grant money are the California gnatcatcher, Delhi Sands flower-loving fly, Perdido Key beach mouse and Salt Creek tiger beetle ― all on the federal endangered species list.","The White House and the Interior Department did not respond to HuffPost’s inquiries about the recommendation to eliminate the grant funding for states.","In its previous budget proposal, the Trump administration requested $19.3 million for the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund, which would have been a decrease of $34.1 million below the 2017 funding level. Instead, Congress allocated the $53 million.","It’s unclear what changed for the administration between this year and last. And if last year was any indication, it is highly unlikely that Congress will sign off on the latest request.","Doing so, Ashe said, would be “a huge step backward,” as those monies are critical both to recovering already threatened species and keeping others off the endangered list.","During President Barack Obama’s time in office, “we were very proud of the record we set, that we had recovered and delisted more species than all previous administrations combined,” he said. “And that didn’t happen by accident. It happened because we applied the resources to get species over that last mile.”","In July, Republicans on the House Committee on Natural Resources took up a package of five bills targeting portions of the 1973 conservation law, which they maintain is broken and in need of an overhaul. At the hearing, Sheehan voiced support for the proposals and said his goal was for the agency “to be a better neighbor and partner to the public and states.”","Eliminating funding for state ESA grants runs counter to that priority.","Trump and Zinke also have pegged themselves as the allies states have long waited for. During his confirmation hearing in January 2017, Zinke said his first priority as head of Interior would be to “restore trust … working with rather than against local communities and states.”","“Being a listener and a listening advocate rather than a deaf adversary is a good start,” he said.","That advocacy has focused almost exclusively on boosting mining and fossil fuel production, as Zinke has prioritized energy development over conservation.","Tierra Curry, a senior scientist with the Center for Biological Diversity, said gutting the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund would only push endangered species toward extinction.","“This is especially damaging because [the] funding is often the backbone of state non-game programs and helps animals across the country, from bats and butterflies to salmon and grizzlies,” she said in an email.","Mary Beth Beetham, director of legislative affairs at the nonprofit Defenders of Wildlife, said the proposal highlights the administration’s disregard for the natural world and is yet another reason why the budget should be dead on arrival in Congress.","“In our mind, this is basically a disaster for wildlife,” Beetham said."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a85a2421e000037007abcd8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Trump's Budget Cuts Millions Of Dollars From Gun Background Check System","authors":"Jennifer Bendery","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-nra-gun-safety-background-checks_us_5a84abdee4b0774f31d1b770","short_description":"This would \"significantly undermine\" efforts to keep firearms out of dangerous hands, gun control advocates say.","date":"2018-02-15"},"articleContent":["WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump’s newly unveiled budget would cut millions of dollars from the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which gun dealers use to verify if someone is banned from buying a gun before selling it to them.","Buried on Page 719 of his fiscal year 2019 budget, released Monday, the president calls for cuts to the National Criminal Records History Improvement Program and the NICS Act Record Improvement Program. Both provide federal grants to states to help them improve their reporting of criminal records and protection orders to the national database for background checks, including domestic violence records.","The two programs are currently budgeted at $73 million. Trump’s budget proposal for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 would slash their funding to $61 million, which amounts to a 16 percent cut.","(Why do the numbers in the infographic jump around so much from 2017 to 2019? A House Appropriations Committee staffer said it’s unclear, but notes the 2017 figure reflects what the Justice Department actually spent while the 2018 and 2019 figures reflect what Trump requested.)","Gun control advocates say these federal grants have been “critical funding sources” for states trying to routinely submit comprehensive records to the national background check database.","“President Trump claims that he wants to build ‘a safe, strong, and proud America’ but his actions do not live up to his words,” said Robin Lloyd of Giffords, the gun safety group founded by former Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.), who survived a gunshot to the head in 2011.","“Instead of strengthening the nation’s background check system to make sure it effectively keeps guns out of dangerous hands, he slashed funding to this critically important system, which will significantly undermine its effectiveness,” Lloyd said.","There are about 30 million reasons why Trump would want to weaken gun safety measures. That’s roughly how many dollars the National Rifle Association spent helping to elect him president. His proposed cuts are also wildly out of step with polls showing near-universal support for strengthening background checks to apply to all gun sales, not just those done by licensed firearms dealers.","The president’s budget, however, is more an overview of White House priorities than it is a document that translates into law. Republicans in Congress will use Trump’s proposal as a baseline but come up with their own government spending levels when they put forward annual appropriation bills.","Trump’s call for cutting funds for gun background checks comes just three months after a mass shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas, involving a gunman who was prohibited from buying or owning firearms because of a domestic violence conviction but who had a gun nonetheless because the Air Force failed to enter his conviction into the national criminal background check database. The error has prompted the Air Force to begin a review.","Mass shootings are now a regular occurrence in the country ― and so is Congress’ inaction on it. There have already been 30 mass shootings and 18 school shootings in 2018. Republican leaders in Congress routinely offer “thoughts and prayers” in response to each shooting but don’t follow up with any policy changes aimed at stemming gun violence.","Another mass shooting took place as this article was being written Wednesday.

As of 2015, 95 percent of them were white, 83 percent were men, and just 1 percent were women of color.","King likened the complexion and maleness of the group to the population at “any golf course in America.”","“I’m not saying white is evil and black is righteous,” said King, acknowledging there are examples of draconian black prosecutors and compassionate white prosecutors. “But it’s troubling when a system that primarily targets people of color has almost exclusively white men, and conservative white men at that, at the helm.”","The addition of King marks something of a reboot for the PAC, which existed in a more modest form in 2017. Becky Bond, who masterminded the Sanders campaign’s digital organizing operation, conceived of the group as a way to apply the “big organizing” technique she honed in 2016 to prosecutorial elections that ordinarily receive little national attention.","Last year, Bond’s group helped elect Larry Krasner as district attorney of Philadelphia, and re-elect Stephanie Morales as the commonwealth’s attorney for Portsmouth, Virginia.","In its reconstituted form, the PAC has already endorsed its first two candidates, both of whom are challenging incumbent district attorneys in Texas’ March 6 Democratic primary. Elizabeth Frizell, a state district judge, is running to unseat Faith Johnson in Dallas County. Joe Gonzales, a defense attorney, is hoping to replace Nico Lahood in Bexar County, which includes San Antonio.","District attorney races remain an untapped opportunity for progressive activists to leverage relatively modest resources for major policy wins, according to King.","That’s because the lack of awareness of the office’s power, even in some of the most progressive parts of the country, had allowed deeply conservative or otherwise problematic DAs to serve for decades. For example, in Manhattan, Cyrus Vance Jr. ran uncontested for a third term as DA in the Democratic primary in September. When it later emerged that Vance had declined to pursue possible criminal cases against film mogul Harvey Weinstein and Ivanka and Donald Trump Jr., it was too late for another candidate to appear on the ballot for the general election.","Even a minor uptick in turnout for DA races could produce significant results, King maintained.","“If we can activate exciting new candidates who stand for reform, we can make changes from coast to coast,” he said.","The launch of the PAC occurs at a unique moment in the evolution of both the contemporary black civil rights movement and the national discussion about criminal justice reform.","The new black rights movement grew organically in recent years in response to controversial police killings of black men and women, the vast majority of whom were unarmed.","The July 2014 death of Eric Garner on Staten Island after police put a chokehold on him was King’s wake-up call. The killing, which resulted in no indictments despite video footage of the cops ignoring Garner’s pleas for his life, ultimately inspired King to leave his job at an environmental organization in Los Angeles and devote himself full time to combating police brutality and racial bias in the criminal justice system.","The movement for black lives has suffered a number of other frustrating setbacks, including the acquittal of, or failure to prosecute, police officers involved in the killings of black men in Ferguson, Missouri; Baltimore; and Minneapolis.","Meanwhile, the election of Trump and his appointment of Jeff Sessions as attorney general have dashed hopes for bipartisan federal legislation to liberalize sentencing and decriminalize drug use. Sessions’ Department of Justice has also signaled that it will be providing less oversight of local policing practices.","For King, that makes it the perfect moment for activists who engaged in street protests and acts of civil disobedience to put at least a portion of their energy into the so-called inside game of helping elect progressive politicians.","“If we are perpetually on the outside, our message might be right, but it won’t have the effectiveness that it deserves,” he said. “We can mobilize in some really amazing ways locally and just get these races in the front of the mind for people so that they understand it’s everything.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a85b7412000002d00eaefab.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"22 Sick'ningly Brilliant Gifts For 'RuPaul's Drag Race' Fans","authors":"Brittany Nims","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gifts-for-rupauls-drag-race-fans_us_5a85bd01e4b0058d55671954","short_description":"\"All tea, no shade.\"","date":"2018-02-15"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Here’s What You Need To Know About The Weapons Of War Used In Mass Shootings","authors":"Nick Wing and Mollie Reilly","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ar-15-style-weapons_us_5a84cf09e4b0ab6daf45ab2d","short_description":"Mass shooters are well aware that assault-style rifles are easy to obtain and capable of causing enormous casualties.","date":"2018-02-15"},"articleContent":["As officials continue to investigate 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz, who is accused of opening fire on his former high school Wednesday afternoon, killing at least 17 people and injuring more than a dozen others, familiar details are already emerging about the weapon police believe was used in the massacre.","Police suspect Cruz was armed with at least one AR-15-style rifle and “countless magazines” in the deadly shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.","This adds to a disturbing trend. In many of the most deadly mass shootings in the last several years, including the Las Vegas massacre on Oct. 1 and the shooting at a Texas church on Nov. 5, the lone gunmen were armed with assault-style rifles like the one reportedly used at the Florida school.","There’s plenty of debate over what constitutes a mass shooting — as well as what drives those who commit them. But it’s increasingly clear that individuals who want to inflict mass casualties are taking advantage of the widespread availability of weapons of war.","These weapons are meant for use on the battlefield.","Renowned firearms engineer Eugene Stoner developed the first AR-15, or ArmaLite Rifle (hence the “AR”), in the late 1950s, using advances in technology and materials to revolutionize battlefield weaponry. Stoner’s rifle was marketed to national militaries interested in a lightweight firearm with precision accuracy and high lethality at long range. Colt Manufacturing Co. eventually purchased ArmaLite and convinced the U.S. military to replace the M-14 with its M-16, which employed many of the advances in the AR-15.","Many modern AR-style rifles are modeled off of these rifles and their successors, which have been the standard issue for the U.S. military since the Vietnam War. But there is one key difference: Battle-ready assault rifles have a selector switch that allows automatic fire (a continuous spray of bullets with a single pull of the trigger), or semi-automatic (one shot with each trigger pull). Civilian versions are semi-automatic only.","The AR-15′s influence is apparent on the .223 SIG Sauer MCX rifle reportedly used in the 2016 Pulse nighclub massacre in Orlando, according to Mother Jones.","Here’s how one reviewer described the SIG Sauer MCX:","SIG SAUER developed the MCX rifle for America’s special forces. Their goal: a firearm that’s as quiet as an MP5, as deadly as an AK-47, and more modular than anything ever designed.","The manufacturer touts the same qualities, saying the rifle is designed to be “silenced, light and short.”","These rifles are designed to kill as efficiently as possible.","These weapons are designed to fire off bullets very, very quickly. Some manufacturers boast that an experienced shooter could fire as many as 45 rounds in one minute. Magazines containing fresh ammunition can be swapped out in a matter of seconds.","The specifications of assault-style rifles vary depending on ammunition, but many tests put the muzzle velocity of a standard round from an AR-15 at 3,200 feet per second, making it accurate up to 500 yards ― more than a quarter-mile.","This makes rounds from an AR-15 or other assault-style weapons far more devastating than those fired from small-caliber handguns.","Here’s a video of a 5.56mm caliber round ― the kind used in many assault-style rifles ― being fired into ballistic gel meant to mimic human flesh. You can see how a single shot inflicts massive trauma, regardless of where it hits the target.","And that’s just one round. A standard AR-15 magazine holds 30 rounds. But in most states, the rifles can be legally outfitted with high-capacity magazines that can hold 60 or even 100 rounds. A gunman in Texas recently managed to fire off 212 rounds from an AR-15 during a standoff with police, though it’s unclear if he used high-capacity magazines. Six people were shot during this exchange, none fatally. If the shooter had chosen a more densely populated target, the outcome could have been much different.","AR-15 and similar weapons also are highly customizable, allowing for the addition of aftermarket sights, grips, suppressors and other accessories that make them more effective and easier to wield in combat situations.","Assault-style rifles are relatively cheap and easy to buy.","The average price of an assault-style rifle fluctuates somewhat with supply and demand. Online distributors currently offer versions for under $200, though the average price appears to be around $1,000. A SIG Sauer MCX like that used by the Orlando gunman retails for about $1,700.","In most states, anyone legally allowed to possess a handgun can also purchase an AR-15 or other assault-style rifle, with no further requirements. In Florida, for example, there is no waiting period for would-be buyers of rifles or other long guns.","Not even people on the terrorist watch list are barred from purchasing assault-style rifles. An attempt to close that loophole was voted down by Senate Republicans in 2015, and was blocked again shortly after the Orlando shooting the folllowing year.","These guns are already everywhere.","There are estimated to be millions of assault-style rifles already in civilian hands, according to recent manufacturer reports, with dozens of companies offering versions. Most of these weapons will never be used in crimes. But the threat is nonetheless present.","A suspect arrested in 2016 in Los Angeles had three of AR-15 rifles in his car, along with bags of ammo and explosive materials. He reportedly told police he was on his way to the city’s gay pride parade.","And it’s not just a matter of AR-15s and their higher-tech variants. Hundreds of thousands of new assault-style rifles flood the market each year. This includes high-powered weaponry like the AK-style rifles used in 2015 by the Planned Parenthood shooter in Colorado Springs, or the gunman who attacked a military recruitment center in Chattanooga, Tennessee.","Some states ban assault weapons, but manufacturers have found ways around the restrictions.","A number of states, including California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey and New York, have laws limiting or banning the sale of assault weapons. California, for example, has banned AR-15s and other rifles with detachable magazines, which allow shooters to quickly reload. However a recent feature called a “bullet button” allows magazines to be quickly replaced, while still technically remaining fixed, rendering this law largely ineffective. State lawmakers attempted to close this loophole by introducing legislation prohibiting future sales of rifles with bullet buttons, but gun owners have found ways around the ban.","Gun manufacturers have also managed to easily circumvent other state laws by making small modifications to the weapons, such as replacing the grip or other components.","Federal attempts at banning assault weapons have been largely unsuccessful.","In 1994, then-President Bill Clinton signed a federal ban on the manufacture, sale and possession of assault weapons and large-capacity magazines. The law specifically banned certain semi-automatic weapons, including the AR-15, as well as rifles that could accept detachable magazines. That ban lapsed in 2004, when Congress did not reauthorize it.","There’s been debate about how well the ban actually worked. It didn’t apply to guns manufactured prior to 1994. According to NBC News, more than 1 million assault-style rifles and 25 million guns with high-capacity magazines were grandfathered in. A 2004 study by the University of Pennsylvania found that while the ban did result in a measurable reduction in crimes involving assault weapons, crimes involving non-banned guns remained steady or increased.","“We cannot clearly credit the ban with any of the nation’s recent drop in gun violence,” concluded the study. “There has been no discernible reduction in the lethality and injuriousness of gun violence, based on indicators like the percentage of gun crimes resulting in death or the share of gunfire incidents resulting in injury.”","Pro-gun activists say this shows a new assault weapons ban wouldn’t affect gun violence. But if the ban hadn’t expired, it’s difficult to imagine these guns proliferating to the point of becoming the weapon of choice of mass shooters.","After the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in Connecticut, some members of Congress sought to renew the assault weapon ban. It passed the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2013, but was excluded from a vote by the full Senate due to Republican opposition. An attempt to re-attach the measure by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), one of the ban’s most ardent supporters, was voted down 40 to 60.","House Democrats again pushed for renewal in late 2015, following the mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, and Feinstein reintroduced it in 2017 following the Las Vegas and Texas shootings. There’s been no action on it since.","An attempt to ban bump stocks, a device used by the Las Vegas shooter that effectively turns semi-automatic rifles into automatic ones, also failed to gain traction in Congress. (Massachusetts, however, became the first state to ban the add-on stocks earlier this month.)","Every time a gunman carries out a massacre with an assault-style rifle, sales go up.","Gun sales, particularly those of assault weapons, tend to spike after each mass shooting, fueled in part by fears that lawmakers will crack down. Already immensely popular, AR-15s and similar rifles flew off the shelves after Sandy Hook. Gun shop owners saw a similar spike after San Bernardino.","This trend is so pronounced that gun industry executives have admitted mass shootings are good for business.","Families of gun violence victims are fighting back against this profit windfall. The parents of nine Sandy Hook victims and one person who survived the massacre are suing Remington, the manufacturer of the rifle used in that shooting. The suit accuses Remington of negligence in selling a military-grade weapon for civilian use, arguing that the guns were purposefully marketed to young men as personal weapons of war.","“Remington took a weapon that was made to the specs of the U.S. military for the purpose of killing enemy soldiers in combat ― and that weapon in the military is cared for with tremendous amount of diligence, in terms of training, storage, who gets the weapon, and who can use it,” the families’ attorney, Joshua Koskoff, told CNN in February of 2016. “They took that same weapon and started peddling it to the civilian market for the purposes of making a lot of money.”","Handguns are common in single-victim gun violence, but military-style rifles are becoming the weapon of choice for mass shooters.","Tens of thousands of people die in gun violence every year, and the overwhelming majority involve handguns, not assault-style rifles or other long guns. At least 64 percent of the gun-related homicides in 2016 were committed with pistols, according to FBI data.","When shooters do turn to heavy weaponry, however, the results can be catastrophic.","Weapons of war have been used in some of the deadliest shootings over the last several years. In addition to Las Vegas, AR-15 style rifles were used during mass shootings in California, Connecticut, Florida, Oregon, Texas and Colorado.","The gun industry is trying to convince you these weapons are just for fun.","Gun advocates insist assault-style rifles are ideal for hunting and target shooting. A fact sheet published by the National Shooting Sports Foundation in 2013 condemned the “assault weapon” label, claiming the term was “conjured up by anti-gun legislators to scare voters into thinking these firearms are something out of a horror movie.” The group has repeatedly argued that the guns are useful for marksmanship competitions and hunting large game. The NRA champions the AR-15 as ”America’s rifle.”","The industry has coined the term ”modern sporting rifles″ to describe assault weapons, and the term is used by major gun retailers like Cabela’s, and manufacturers such as Smith & Wesson and Remington.","That message may resonate with gun enthusiasts. The weapons are versatile and efficient, and if you like the idea of shooting things for sport, the appeal is obvious. Assault-style weapons look cool. Shooting one might even make you feel like a badass.","But the very same traits that have made them the preferred weapon for military personnel and sport shooters are what make them a natural choice for those who want to inflict senseless violence with maximum casualties.","It now seems the toll of mass killers is limited only by their choice of weapon, their training and their target. The political response to that terrifying reality has been to hope that people will choose not to kill. That plan clearly isn’t working.","A version of this article initially ran in 2016."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/575f25322200002d00f80b77.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Here Are The Autopsies For The Victims Of The Las Vegas Mass Shooting","authors":"Nick Wing and Matt Ferner","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/las-vegas-autopsy-documents_us_5a8234efe4b01467fcf08b97","short_description":"The details are disturbing.

Looking through that window is admittedly uncomfortable, but doing so gives us a rare opportunity to honestly confront the graphic reality of a mass shooting. Shying away from that truth has only helped perpetuate a status quo in which many people have decided there’s nothing we can do to limit either the scope or the frequency of these tragedies. If that’s the path we continue to take, we should at least be willing to face up to the raw brutality of the incidents that we have accepted as an unavoidable feature of American life.","A number of the reports were difficult to evaluate due to inconsistencies in measurement, terminology and methodology, issues likely complicated by the sheer number of cases and the many different medical examiners who conducted the examinations.","HuffPost consulted with Arthur Alphin, a ballistics expert who specializes in the forensics of gunshot wounds and who has testified in a number of multiple shooting cases, to get his thoughts on a few of the cases. His comments are included in a number of the summaries below.","Case #1","Female","Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the head.","The bullet enters the right side of the victim’s head, creating multiple skull fractures and injuring multiple features of her brain, before reversing trajectory and exiting further down on the right side of her head.","Case #2","Male","Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the chest.","The bullet enters the right side of the victim’s upper chest, coursing through his chest cavity and abdomen, before exiting on the lower left side of his back.","Case #3","Male","Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the back.","The bullet enters the left side of the victim’s back, coursing through his chest cavity before taking a slightly upward trajectory and exiting through his left chest.","Case #4","Female","Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the back.","The bullet enters the victim’s left upper back, coursing through her chest cavity and causing injuries to the heart and lungs before coming to rest in the tissue of her right breast.","Case #5","Female","Cause of death: Gunshot wounds to the chest and forearm.","A bullet enters the victim’s upper right chest, striking a rib, perforating her right lung, diaphragm and liver, before coming to rest in the soft tissue of her lower right chest. Another bullet enters through the victim’s back right forearm, passing cleanly through and exiting the front of her arm.","Alphin believes both sets of injuries were caused by a single bullet that struck the victim on an unstable trajectory, likely because the overheated barrel of the gunman’s rifle had expanded from shooting so rapidly, sending rounds flying out more unpredictably.","“Dollars to doughnuts, this is the same bullet that does all of this,” said Alphin. “The round was probably unstable, meaning it was wobbling slightly in free flight. That’s why you’ve got that slightly oblong entry wound, that indicates a bullet that was wobbling from that overheated barrel. It enters the forearm, then it goes through and has an irregular exit wound to the anterior right forearm. ... Now the bullet is beginning to tumble [as it enters her chest].”","Alphin added, “I would think she was standing, she realized there were bullets coming, she put her arm up and a bullet struck her.”","Case #6","Female","Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the chest.","The bullet enters the victim’s lower right arm and passes cleanly through it into her chest, where it injures her right lung and ultimately strikes her vertebral column, shattering the bullet.","Case #7","Female","Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the right chest.","The bullet enters the victim’s right upper chest, perforating multiple features of her right lung, before coming to rest in the soft tissue of her central back.","Case #8","Female","Cause of death: Gunshot wounds to the head.","One bullet enters the victim’s left eye, injuring her eye and fracturing her skull, before coming to rest in the muscles on the side of her head. Another bullet enters the right side of the victim’s head, causing additional skull fractures and injuring multiple features of her brain, before coming to rest in the back of her head. The victim also suffered a gunshot wound to the hand and a graze wound to the shoulder.","Alphin explained how two separate bullets could have struck the victim in the head.","“Both of those head wounds would be instantly fatal, which means the person would drop to the ground like a sack of rocks. There’s no way, even if the guy had kept the rifle stable and these are bullets that sequentially exited the muzzle, you’re still talking a couple tenths of a second between impacts and the body would have started to drop. I’m thinking one of these hit the victim standing and one of them hit her laying on the ground. Remember, all the shooter is doing is spraying bullets.”","Case #9","Male","Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the chest.","The bullet enters the victim’s right chest between the ribs, perforating his liver, stomach and diaphragm, before entering his left chest. The jacket of the bullet is recovered in the victim’s left lung, while the bullet itself is found in the space between two ribs.","Case #10","Female","Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the head.","The bullet enters through the right side of victim’s head, fracturing the skull, fragmenting the bullet and causing massive injuries to the brain.","Case #11","Female","Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the back.","The bullet enters the victim’s right back and passes through her shoulder blade and into her chest cavity, perforating her right lung, heart and left lung, before exiting from her left chest. Clusters of cuts and bruises suggest the victim was either dragged or trampled after collapsing.","Alphin believes the bullet was wobbling when it struck the victim but says it’s hard to tell from the listed measurements.","“Once the bullet travels down through the lungs, that’s a fatal wound,” he said. “Trauma and internal bleeding.”","Case #12","Male","Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the chest.","The bullet enters the victim’s left chest between his ribs, fracturing one of the bones and likely fragmenting the round, leading to perforations of his left lung, spleen, aorta, liver and right lung.","Case #13","Female","Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the back.","The bullet enters the victim’s left back around her sixth rib, likely fracturing a bone before passing through her left lung and piercing the major arteries of the heart.","Case #14","Female","Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the head.","The bullet enters near the top of the victim’s head, fracturing her skull and causing massive hemorrhaging of her brain. Contusions on the victim’s face were likely the result of her falling forward after being fatally struck.","Case #15","Female","Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the chest.","The bullet enters the victim’s right chest between her ribs, taking an upward trajectory through her right lung, aorta and across her midline, where it perforates her left lung and comes to rest in the tissue of her left shoulder.","Alphin believes the bullet was stable in flight when it struck the victim but became unstable upon entry.","“It basically hit perpendicular to the surface of the skin,” he said. “The bullet, as it’s precessing, probably clipped one of the ribs, and that’s why it’s unstable within the body and broke apart. That’s why there are fragments recovered.”","Case #16","Male","Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the head.","The bullet enters near the top of the victim’s head, coursing through his brain and into his neck before coming to rest in the tissue of his right shoulder.

At least this poor woman, it was instant.”","Case #33","Male","Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the chest.","The bullet enters the victim’s right upper chest near the collarbone, coursing along the bone and through the body before coming to rest in the tissue of his upper arm.","“If a bullet enters or comes close to the long axis of a bone, the path of least resistance for the bullet is to skim along the bone, and so it actually follows the bone a little bit,” said Alphin. “As it’s dragging the side of the bullet alongside the bone that helps keep the bullet stable and nose on, and it’s easier to separate the flesh then, because it’s just being knocked away from the bone.”","Case #34","Female","Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the chest.","Bullet enters the victim’s left chest, striking and fracturing a rib, perforating features of the heart and right lung before coming to rest in the tissue of the right chest.

Abrasions on the victim’s forehead and extremities were likely suffered when she collapsed in the moments after she was shot.","Alphin explained why victims who have been shot in the head with military-style rifles, which typically shoot bullets around three times as fast as a handgun, will often have bruising around the eyes.","“It’s very, very common that the eyelids will be bruised, because the eyeball was trying to be forced out of the head,” he said, adding that it’s even possible for these wounds to lead to the eyeball being ejected from the socket.","Case #38","Male","Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the chest.","The bullet enters the victim’s right chest, coursing through tissue, striking the right collarbone and perforating his right lung.

It probably hurt like hell. She may not have even known she was bleeding to death. Not uncommon. She feels down there, there’s a wound, there’s a little blood coming out. She says she’s hit. Ninety seconds later, she’s dead.”","Alphin added that the tourniquet may have been a sign that a veteran of either the Iraq or Afghanistan war attempted to stem the bleeding following a treatment protocol that has come back into favor in the U.S. military.","Case #55","Female","Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the back.","The bullet enters the victim’s left upper back, perforating her lung and heart, where it comes to rest.","Case #56","Male","Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the head.","The bullet enters the top left of the victim’s head, fracturing his skull and injuring multiple features of the brain, where it comes to rest.","Case #57","Female","Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the back.","The bullet enters the victim’s central upper back, coursing through her spine and chest cavity, before coming to rest in the tissue of her chest.

The attack is the 17th school shooting in 2018 alone.","The suspect, 19-year-old former student Nikolas Cruz, is now in custody.

No commensurate movement for men who are still generally locked into the same rigid, outdated model of masculinity and it’s killing us.” he said.\n\nHe added that men need to be given the same space that women have to explore their identities and express their emotions.","“If you want to hurt a man, the first thing you do is attack his masculinity.

International guidebooks, the most prestigious travel newsletters, chefs and designers have set their sights on this great city. Residents of Mexico City, also known as Chilangos, who simultaneously love and hate it, know very well why they stay and why they always recommend it to travelers from all over the world.","The Mexican capital has evolved without losing sight of its history, but the best thing it’s done is to simply be itself. The local cuisine is delicious, and the nightlife includes both interesting dives and luxury bars. Socially responsible fashion is booming, too, and there are more contemporary art offerings now than ever before.","The HuffPost Mexico staff chose locations and experiences —new and/or reinvented — that help keep Mexico City among the most attractive cities in the world.","1. Eat Like a Local","The country’s culinary riches are in the markets, homes and streets. Eat Like a Local, a project by Rocío Vázquez Landeta, seeks to take travelers on a journey to discover Mexico City through its food, its traditions and its people.","Tourists can choose from several options that run from the most exclusive restaurants to tours through the markets, where they try typical Chilango munchies and taste delicious tacos, pulque, beer and mezcal in stunning locations, all while meeting new people.","“Eat Like a Local is not a tourism company, but a platform through which you discover the best and most original aspects from different areas of the capital, in the company of a good friend,” Rocío says. “My intention is to show travelers the day-to-day Mexico through the folklore of its markets and its people’s traditions. I don’t take them to the typical recommendations you find in travel guides; I design ‘culinary expeditions’ tailored to their tastes and interests.”","Since a big part of the tours involves public transportation and walking (because that’s how you really get to know a city, after all), the groups are generally small, 10 people max.","2. La Guerrerense","La Guerrerense’s obligatory stand in Ensenada just opened a location in the Mexican capital.","This shellfish bar was established in 1960 by Alberto Oviedo and his wife, Celia Carranza. Now, pay attention: Their son was Eduardo Oviedo, who married Sabina Bandera. She is better known as La Güerita or La Guerrerense. Sabina says that she didn’t know how to work with seafood because, in her native state of Guerrero, she worked in agriculture and with dairy products. It was in Ensenada where her in-laws taught her about seafood. Step by step, Sabina innovated the business, creating more than 13 sauces, all organic and preservative-free. She grows some of the chiles they use at their stand.","Don’t miss the pismo clam tostada, and certainly don’t miss the sea urchin tostada, a delicacy.","3. La Casa Rivas Mercado","In the heart of the Guerrero district sits one of the prettiest buildings in Mexico City. Built during the 19th century by porfirista architect Antonio Rivas Mercado, it just reopened to the public after nine years of reconstruction. “Restoring the 6,350 square feet meant fighting the sinking and structural decay, while also being respectful of its eclectic style, with seven variations of cantera stones and its 50,000 types of encaustic mosaics, tiles and English floors,” notes the federal Department of Culture.","4. Petit comité accommodation","In one of the most central and cosmopolitan neighborhoods, La Condesa, there’s a spot that takes travelers on an experience of luxury and comfort: Casa Decu.","Casa Decu is a 27-room boutique hotel that, immersed in the Mexican Art Deco scene, “has been conceived both to enjoy the area’s amenities as well as the facilities themselves and, of course, satisfy any traveler’s needs, like internet, continental breakfast and a laundry room.”","This gem, which stands out among the city’s hotel offerings, has rooms equipped with full kitchens, a 24/7 gym and a sensational rooftop that serves as a breakfast area in the morning and a relaxation spot with a panoramic view of the city during the afternoon and evening.","5. Take a ride through the chinampas","Going for a ride in a trajinera (a flat-bottomed boat) has been a popular and traditional activity for ages, but one way to improve the experience is to go through the chinampas, which are centers where they harvest vegetables that —depending on the time of the year and yield— are sold to renowned Mexico City restaurants, such as Pujol and Sud 777.","The chinampa is an artificial harvesting system built in areas in which water is the main natural resource; the aquifer is called “humedal” (wetland). They’re built for harvesting plants and vegetables.","This harvesting system is placed in the shallow areas of lakes and doesn’t require artificial irrigation or rain water, since its location means water is always readily available.","6. Salón Los Ángeles","Go back in time, and don’t worry about bringing a dancing partner, because you’re sure to find one here. “This emblematic place, a flagship of urban life, opened its doors in 1937 and to this day, it hasn’t closed for any reasons,” reads the famous dance hall’s website, and now it would seem that new trends have breathed new life into it. In this venue for danzón, chachachá, swing and mambo, what stands out today is its authenticity.","7. Ruta de la Amistad","This year marks the 50th anniversary of the Ruta de la Amistad (Friendship Road), a set of 22 large sculptures created by world-famous artists for the 1968 Mexico Olympics. The project was the brainchild of Mathias Goeritz, a German-born Mexican painter, sculptor and artist.","Wandering the 10.5-mile-long sculpture corridor means touring the southern area of the Mexican capital, an area that has had constant transformations, the most important possibly being the construction of the second floor of the Periférico, a beltway that borders Mexico City (but which also put some of the sculptures at risk).","For over 25 years, the sculptures in the Ruta de la Amistad have fallen victim to abandonment, but different conservation groups have helped repair them. Now, the Patronato de la Ruta de la Amistad (Friendship Road Board) aims to have this group of sculptures declared a historical monument to ensure its protection.","7. All the amazing restaurants","Caldos Ánimo is the creation of chef Antonio de Livier. Birriamen, the perfect combination of birria and ramen, is a hit among the locals of the Nápoles district at his restaurant Ánimo.","WanWan Sakaba is a small restaurant in which you’ll feel as if you were in a traditional Japanese tavern (izakaya) while having luscious noodles with beer and sake. There are no tables, just a bar.","Sud 777 offers contemporary cuisine with Mexican-grown ingredients. Chef Édgar Núñez designs the menu seasonally.","You can’t miss the food at Pujol, which has earned the fourth spot on the list of the 50 best restaurants in Latin America. It’s run by chef Enrique Olvera, who has two restaurants in New York City.","Quintonil offers a menu that strongly showcases the flavors and techniques of chef Jorge Vallejo’s contemporary Mexican cuisine.","8. Monumento a la Revolución","History, modernity and unforgettable sunsets: This is what you’ll get during your view from Monumento a la Revolución.","From the Monumento a la Revolución, you’ll be able to take in one of the best views of the city. You’ll also learn about the historical building whose construction stopped in 1912 due to a diversion of funds, which were owed to the revolutionary movement that was taking place. In addition, you’ll be able to have a coffee while enjoying this vista brimming with history.","10. Luis Barragán House","Built in 1948, the house and study that belonged to Luis Barragán, one of the most famous Mexican architects in the world, has been named a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.","The reason: “It’s the only individual property in Latin America that has earned such honor because it’s a masterpiece within the Modern Movement of architecture, creating a new blend of traditional and vernacular elements and different philosophical and artistic movements from all ages.”","With the eye-catching colors of its interior but restrained façade, Luis Barragán’s house was built on a small street in the old Tacubaya neighborhood and is surrounded by traditional houses, workshops and small stores.","The house, which you can visit by appointment, has also hosted exhibits by other artists. Last year this architectonic gem was the setting for the Mármol Rosa (Pink Marble) exhibit by Cypriot artist Christodoulos Panayiotou. His concept was to recontextualize and redefine personal household elements that evoke Luis Barragán’s spirituality, sensibility and sources of inspiration.","11. Lorena Saravia Boutique","This local brand is affordable luxury that wants to “be Mexico’s most important all-purpose fashion brand and secure the country’s untapped niche that falls somewhere between fast fashion and high fashion,” according to its creator, Lorena Saravia.","The Mexican designer works with traditional silk producers in Oaxaca. She recently released a collection made from this silk and ran a charity sale to help victims from September’s earthquake.","This article was first published by HuffPost Mexico."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a7cb11d2000003800eae4b7.jpeg?cache=5eO8aLvWI1&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"BLACK VOICES","headline":"Here Are The Black People Behind The Scenes Who Made 'Black Panther' A Reality","authors":"Taryn Finley","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/here-are-the-black-people-behind-the-scenes-who-made-black-panther-a-reality_us_5a80de55e4b08dfc9305611c","short_description":"Representation behind the camera matters, too.","date":"2018-02-15"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"WOMEN","headline":"Arizona Department Of Corrections Changes Menstrual Pad Policy Following Backlash","authors":"Antonia Blumberg","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/arizona-menstrual-products-female-inmates_us_5a8375cae4b0adbaf3d8857f","short_description":"But activists say it's not enough.","date":"2018-02-14"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Stormy Daniels Says Trump Lawyer Breached Agreement, So She's Free To Talk","authors":"Antonia Blumberg","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/stormy-daniels-michael-cohen-agreement-breach_us_5a848bd0e4b0058d556570df","short_description":"“Everything is off now, and Stormy is going to tell her story,” the former porn actress' manager said.","date":"2018-02-14"},"articleContent":["Former adult film actress Stephanie Clifford says she is ready to tell her story after the president’s lawyer reportedly breached a nondisclosure agreement preventing her from speaking publicly about her alleged affair with President Donald Trump.","The actress, who goes by the stage name Stormy Daniels, said through her manager on Wednesday that attorney Michael Cohen invalidated their agreement when he acknowledged on Tuesday that he’d paid her $130,000 in a “private transaction” just before the 2016 presidential election.","“Everything is off now, and Stormy is going to tell her story,” manager Gina Rodriguez told The Associated Press.","The alleged affair between Clifford and Trump made headlines in January when In Touch Weekly revealed excerpts of a previously unpublished 2011 interview with the actress.","The interview appeared to validate a Wall Street Journal report that Trump’s lawyer arranged a $130,000 payment to Clifford in October 2016 to buy her silence about the relationship. Trump’s legal team and Clifford initially denied both the affair and the payment.\n\nBut on Tuesday, Cohen acknowledged to The New York Times that he’d paid Clifford $130,000 out of his own pocket ― although he would not address why he made the payment or whether Trump was aware at the time.\n\n“Neither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign was a party to the transaction with Ms. Clifford, and neither reimbursed me for the payment, either directly or indirectly,” Cohen told the Times. “The payment to Ms. Clifford was lawful, and was not a campaign contribution or a campaign expenditure by anyone.”\n\nAnother article published Tuesday at The Daily Beast reported that Cohen is shopping a book proposal about Trump that would discuss Clifford’s story.\n\nIn the wake of these reports, Rodriguez said her client is now free to speak publicly about her alleged relationship with Trump and will soon announce how and when she will do so.\n\nRodriguez, Clifford and the White House press office did not respond to requests for comment.","In 2011, In Touch said, Clifford told the tabloid she’d had sex with Trump in his Lake Tahoe hotel suite in the summer of 2006, the year after Trump had married his third wife, Melania Knauss, and just months after she gave birth to their son, Barron.\n\nClifford described the sex as “textbook generic,” according to the magazine, and added, “I actually don’t even know why I did it, but I do remember while we were having sex, I was like, ‘Please, don’t try to pay me.’”\n\nAn attorney for Clifford released a statement on her behalf in January denying that the affair happened. But the actress has evaded direct, public questions about whether she had a sexual relationship with Trump."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a848c2821000039006013eb.jpeg?cache=8JhB9LqeeO&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"VA Secretary's European Trip Was An Ethics Mess Funded By Taxpayers","authors":"Lydia O'Connor","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/va-secretary-europe-travel-investigation_us_5a8465fbe4b0ab6daf45298b","short_description":"David J.

Shulkin and his chief of staff committed ethics violations that saddled taxpayers for extravagances on a trip to Europe last summer, according to an inspector general’s findings released Wednesday.","Shulkin’s 10-day trip to London and Copenhagen was planned under the guise of business travel, but involved only 3-1/2 working days, according to the report. He effectively used a VA subordinate as “a personal travel concierge” to plan leisure activities, and improperly accepted free tickets to the Wimbledon tennis match, the report said.","Shulkin’s chief of staff, Vivieca Wright Simpson, doctored language in an email from another VA official to falsely convince government ethics officials that Shulkin was receiving an award from the Danish government, according to the inspector general. She used that lie as justification for Shulkin’s wife, Merle Bari, to be included in the trip, said the report, which noted investigators found no evidence that Shulkin knew about the falsehood.","Shulkin is among five current or former Cabinet members under President Donald Trump who have come under investigation by their agencies’ inspectors general over taxpayer-funded travel. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price resigned last year after billing taxpayers more than $1 million for military and private flights, and Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt this week claimed security concerns force him to stick taxpayers for his first-class travel.","Questions about Shulkin’s Europe trip were first raised in September by The Washington Post.","The VA probe recommends that Shulkin reimburse the government for more than $4,000 spent on his wife’s airfare.","VA press secretary Curt Cashour said Shulkin’s office is still reviewing the report.","“Accountability and transparency are important values at VA under President Trump, and we look forward to reviewing the report and its recommendations in more detail before determining an appropriate response,” he said in a statement to HuffPost.","Investigators also found that Shulkin misused VA resources by instructing a VA program specialist to work with his wife planning several days of leisure activities, including tours of palaces, an impromptu dinner in Sweden, a river cruise and several other high-priced excursions.","“Personal conveniences” added more than $15,000 to the cost of the trip, including last-minute flight changes to avoid longer layovers and a flight change so that Shulkin and his wife could attend Wimbledon with expensive tickets gifted to them by Victoria Gosling, a U.K. woman involved in several sports governing bodies, the inspector general found.","Shulkin claimed Gosling is his wife’s friend, which would allow for a “personal friendship” exception to the rules against accepting such gifts. But investigators found Gosling said she didn’t even know the name of Shulkin’s wife. The report recommends that Shulkin reimburse Gosling for the tickets.","The trip in total cost the VA at least $122,334, the report found. Because Shulkin’s team failed to properly document expenses, the investigators couldn’t fully assess how much of the spending was misused. The investigators concluded that the VA should audit all of the trip’s expenses.","UPDATE: Feb. 16 ― Shulkin said on Thursday that he would reimburse the government for his wife’s travel costs and make a contribution to the treasury matching the cost of the Wimbledon tickets, The Wall Street Journal reported.

His administration has asked the Supreme Court to take the unusual step of overturning the first injunction, issued by U.S. District Judge William Alsup, now instead of letting it go through the normal appeals process.","The Supreme Court could decide as soon as Friday whether it will hear the administration’s request ― unless the new injunction delays that process. As of Tuesday, the justices were only scheduled to consider a request to overturn the injunction in the consolidated case out of California, according to Karen Tumlin, legal director for the National Immigration Law Center, one of the groups suing the administration over DACA.","Trump declared he would rescind DACA in September, claiming it was unconstitutional.

The plan was that Dreamers whose permits were set to expire after March 5 would be unable to apply for renewal, creating that deadline for Congress to act before an estimated 1,000 people per day began losing protections.","Under the injunctions, however, those who have been approved for DACA are eligible to keep renewing it until the courts decide otherwise.","Because President Barack Obama created the program by executive action, Trump has the authority to scrap it. But the consolidated New York lawsuit ― which combines a case originally filed on behalf of DACA recipient Martín Jonathan Batalla Vidal with a suit filed by attorneys general from 15 Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia ― argues that the administration violated DACA recipients’ due process rights and the terms of the Administrative Procedure Act when changing the policy. The APA requires federal officials to offer a reasonable justification before changing a major policy.","The Trump administration’s claim that the program is unconstitutional isn’t likely to stand up in court, according to Garaufis’ order. Trump’s decision to end DACA appears instead to be “arbitrary and capricious” and “an abuse of discretion,” the judge wrote.","“The question before the court is thus not whether Defendants could end the DACA program, but whether they offered legally adequate reasons for doing so,” the order says. “Based on its review of the record before it, the court concludes that Defendants have not done so.”","In a statement, Justice Department spokesman Devin O’Malley responded, “Today’s order doesn’t change the Department of Justice’s position on the facts: DACA was implemented unilaterally after Congress declined to extend these benefits to this same group of illegal aliens.”","The judge did not weigh in on the plaintiffs’ argument that Trump violated the Constitution by discriminating against DACA recipients based on animus toward Latinos. Nearly 80 percent of DACA recipients are originally from Mexico, a country the president has accused of sending rapists and other criminals into the U.S.","These injunctions are just a stop-gap solution for DACA recipients. Although they can still apply for renewal, it can take months for permits to be reviewed and approved, and many people’s protections are likely to lapse in the meantime. And, of course, the Trump administration is fighting to overturn the rulings and go back to rejecting applicants.","The president has said he wants to help young undocumented immigrants ― and maybe even grant them a pathway to citizenship ― but only if Democrats agree to fund his southern border wall, detain and deport more children and others at the border, and restrict legal immigration. His framework for a deal is considered dead on arrival in Congress because of heavy opposition from Democrats and some Republicans to slashing legal immigration, but the president hasn’t budged."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a836c2f2000002d00eaec7d.jpeg?cache=6KaWAqXQHN&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"COMEDY","headline":"You Won't Believe North Korean Cheerleaders' New Obsession On 'Jimmy Kimmel'","authors":"Ron Dicker","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/north-korean-cheerleaders-jimmy-kimmel_us_5a8413ade4b0adbaf3d91e8e","short_description":"A certain someone has global appeal in comedy bit.","date":"2018-02-14"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Investigators Probing FBI's Treatment Of Clinton Say Trump Budget Would 'Inhibit' Work","authors":"Ryan J.

Former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has blamed Comey’s actions on her electoral college loss, while Trump has convinced many of his supporters that the FBI was actually biased against him.","Horowitz said that under the Trump budget, he’d be forced to reduce his office’s staffing levels by 4 percent. The Trump administration asked for a $95.886 million budget for the Office of the Inspector General for fiscal year 2019. Horowitz wrote that his office needs a $100.106 million budget for that year, noting that there’s a request pending before Congress for $97.380 million for the 2018 fiscal year.","“Funding at $100.106 million represents a modest increase from our FY 2018 budget request of $97.380 million, and will allow the OIG to maintain its current services into FY 2019, have budget parity with other DOJ law enforcement components, hire five additional lawyers and one non-lawyer to handle the substantial increase in FBI and other whistleblower retaliation matters that we are investigating, and permit us to sustain our efforts to curb waste, fraud, and abuse in DOJ programs,” Horowitz wrote.","Horowitz’s office conducts audits and investigations for the Justice Department, which has more than 100,000 employees. Horowitz said that his office recovered nearly $28 million in the 2017 fiscal year and identified another $27 million in potential cost savings.","“We appreciate the support we have received both from the Department’s leadership and Congress for this important oversight work. However, in order for the OIG to continue to promote more efficient and effective DOJ programs, and to continue to conduct effective oversight of the Department’s largest components, the OIG must be adequately funded,” Horowitz wrote. “The OIG cannot effectively oversee the Department’s largest components if their budgets and staff grow disproportionately to ours.”","Horowitz’s office recently met with lawmakers, discussing his ongoing probe of the DOJ’s handling of the Clinton email investigation ahead of the 2016 election. The inspector general’s investigation turned up text messages exchanged by two FBI employees that were subsequently turned over to Congress and have provided fodder for President Trump and Republicans on Capitol Hill who have used anti-Trump texts to portray the FBI as a law enforcement agency that attempted to stop Trump’s election.","Back in November 2017, Horowitz told Congress that he hoped they would release the Clinton email report in March or April 2018.","A spokeswoman for the Justice Department declined to respond for comment. The Office of the Inspector General declined to comment beyond its report to Congress."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8486e31e000037007abb72.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"We Asked Republicans Why They Think Trump’s Lawyer Gave A Porn Star $130,000","authors":"Igor Bobic","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/porn-trump-stormy-daniels_us_5a84a371e4b0058d55659824","short_description":"They insisted they're preoccupied with more weighty matters.","date":"2018-02-14"},"articleContent":["WASHINGTON ― The personal attorney of the president of the United States acknowledged this week that he paid an adult film star $130,000 just before the 2016 presidential election. The bombshell admission would have almost certainly rocked any previous administration, raising a whole host of questions, like, “Did this in any way violate campaign finance law?” and, “Dear God, why would the president’s lawyer ever pay a porn star?”","Republican lawmakers, however, said on Wednesday they had no interest whatsoever in the matter. They ducked and dodged questions about the payment, explaining they were not closely following a story about a president and a porn star. Some begged off inquiries by saying they were wholly engrossed by this week’s ongoing debate over immigration in the Senate.","“That’s the least thing on my mind right now,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told HuffPost.","Graham, who was one of the House prosecutors in the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton, added he was “not remotely curious” about why the lawyer paid a porn star $130,000 shortly before Donald Trump won the White House race.","Trump’s long-time lawyer, Michael Cohen, told The New York Times on Tuesday that he paid Stephanie Clifford, the adult film entertainer known as Stormy Daniels, out of his own pocket and that “neither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign was a party to the transaction.”","“The payment to Ms. Clifford was lawful, and was not a campaign contribution or a campaign expenditure by anyone,” Cohen said in a statement to the Times.","The statement did not address whether Trump himself had anything to do with the matter. Nor did he answer questions about whether Trump had been aware of the payment, why it was made or whether Cohen had made similar payments to other people in the past, according to the Times.","Last month, The Wall Street Journal reported the payment was made to Clifford to keep her quiet about an alleged affair with Trump in 2006, the year after he married his third wife, Melania, and a few months after the birth of their son, Barron. Daniels was reportedly paid to sign a non-disclosure agreement and keep silent about the affair.","Cohen and White House officials have previously denied the affair occurred. In his Tuesday statement about the payment, Cohen said, “Just because something isn’t true doesn’t mean that it can’t cause you harm or damage. I will always protect Mr. Trump.”","Clifford supposedly revealed the affair in previously unpublished 2011 interview with In Touch Weekly that the outlet wrote about after the Wall Street Journal story.","After initially denying the affair and the payment, Clifford over the past month has been silent or given coy answers about her relationship with Trump.","But on Wednesday Clifford’s manager, Gina Rodriguez, said that she believes the porn actress is now free to discuss her alleged sexual encounter with Trump because Cohen had invalidated the non-disclosure agreement by publicly discussing the payment.","“Everything is off now, and Stormy is going to tell her story,” Rodriguez told The Associated Press.","If Clifford does end up revealing more information about her alleged relationship with the president ― including why she received the $130,000 ― GOP lawmakers can expect additional questions about whether it had been made properly during the campaign. Common Cause, the government watchdog group, has argued the payment was an in-kind contribution to Trump’s campaign.","For now, however, most Republican senators seemed more comfortable simply punting on thorny questions about the subject.","“I would think that that’d be something — instead of you asking me — I would expect if it’s a campaign issue, that the Federal Election Commission would be looking into it,” Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) told HuffPost.","Other GOP senators similarly said it was someone else’s job to investigate the matter.","“I’m going to leave those inquiries to others,” Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said. He added that he was chiefly focused on “substance and policy” on issues like health care and immigration.","Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) said it was simply “not a high priority at this time,” while Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) said he wasn’t sure “whether there’s congressional interest” in opening an investigation.","Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), on the other hand, conjectured that the “press will do more than investigate it.” Asked if he was personally curious why a lawyer for a president would ever pay such a large sum to a porn star ― or anyone, for that matter ― Shelby demurred.","“I don’t know why a lot of things happen around here,” he said.","Several Democratic senators, meanwhile, suggested that it wasn’t too hard to figure out why an attorney for a former reality television star who once proudly graced the cover of Playboy magazine would pay a porn star just before the election.","“I think it’s pretty obvious why he did it,” Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-V.t.) said before walking into an elevator.","Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) said Republicans would be more interested in investigating the story if a lawyer for a Democratic president had made a similar admission.","“Congress would do nothing other than that for a year,” he said."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a84a4bc2000003900eaee65.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"SPORTS","headline":"Shaun White Makes History With Gold Medal Win In Halfpipe","authors":"Josh Butler","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/shaun-white-pyeongchang-snowboarding-medal_us_5a836ef8e4b02b66c5130966","short_description":"He became the first person to win three gold medals in Olympic snowboarding competitions.","date":"2018-02-14"},"articleContent":["American snowboarder Shaun White has won Winter Olympics gold for a historic third time in the snowboarding halfpipe, besting the field in Pyeongchang with a phenomenal 97.75 score in his final run and becoming the first person to win a trio of gold medals in the sport.","White led the field after the first round, as judges gave his initial effort a 94.25 score, but Japanese snowboarder Ayumu Hirano edged to the front with a 95.25 in the second round.","In the last round, with the last run of the final, White managed to pull out a near-perfect run to steal gold.","Hirano scored the silver medal, while Australian snowboarder Scotty James won bronze.","The 31-year-old White is now on top of the all-time Olympic gold medal tally for snowboarding, which was introduced to the Winter Games in 1998, with wins at the 2006 Turin Games and the 2010 Vancouver Games in addition to his gold in Pyeongchang.","NBC has been celebrating White and his quest to make history with a third gold medal win, though the network was called out this week for failing to acknowledge that the athlete settled a sexual harassment suit in 2017.","Asked about the harassment allegations on Wednesday, White told reporters that, “I’m here to talk about the Olympics, not gossip and stuff.”","White joins fellow American Kelly Clark (who won a gold and two bronzes) on top of the overall medal tally for the sport.

What started as a Facebook comment from one fan named Chris White has blown up into a conspiracy that has fans going full Carrie Mathison with their proverbial cork boards to prove it right.","As first laid out by White, the theory hinges on RuPaul’s use of The Handmaid’s Tale as a recurring motif this season. Chad Michaels and Alaska, the first two “All Stars” winners, keep appearing at the end of the episodes in full Handmaid garb, and Ru’s messages to the eliminated queens include a lot of jargon from the Margaret Atwood novel and Hulu series adaptation. White thinks that’s no coincidence, and like in the fictional Republic of Gilead, Bebe is acting as a mole for the higher powers — in this case, the judges. Considering she won the first season, she’s the perfect pick for this:, loyal to Ru, but not very well-known to the audience.","“Bebe is going to coast by never landing in the bottom two or winning a challenge; she will always be safe,” White explained. “When the finale comes, Bebe will be announced as the mole and helps Ru decide which queen will become the winner. By doing this, it allows Bebe to showcase her talent to new fans every episode without her winning a single thing from lip syncs to the grand prize since she already won. This also allows Mama Ru to do an “All Stars” season of just winners only in the future.”","I was personally lukewarm on this theory — until the most recent episode of “All Stars,” which featured Bebe being called safe despite a pretty terrible challenge performance in “The Bitchelor.” Honestly, I can’t explain her being safe and Aja being in the bottom three without relying on the mole theory. And so I find myself believing White more and more, though I’d make some adjustments to his thinking (namely, I think the twist will be revealed during this season’s “Revenge of the Queens” equivalent episode, not the finale).","Details aside, the bigger question is: What if this theory is correct? What if Bebe is the mole? Here are my four big takeaways:","It would speak tremendously to Bebe’s acting skills. That’s no small thing: Bebe’s season didn’t have any acting challenges. This is a case for her to flex a muscle that all other Drag Race queens get to, and do it in an all-new way.","It would make the all-winners season seem like a near-inevitability.","When RuPaul first floated the idea of a winners season on her podcast with Michelle Visage, “What’s the Tee?”, I brushed it off as a flight of fancy. Bebe’s announcement for this cast made it only seem less likely. But if I’m a former winner, and I see how Bebe’s star is rising thanks to the exposure on “All Stars” Season 3, and I have the chance to get in on that myself? I’m way more likely to do it now than I was before. If Ru really wants to do it, this is the best way to make it happen.","It would make a potential Trixie Mattel win even more special.","Trixie has talked previously about how she went to see Bebe her first time in drag at 21. A single comment — “Stick with drag, it’ll take you anywhere” — inspired her to keep going. Now imagine Bebe gets to help choose Trixie as the winner of “All Stars” Season 3. That’d be pretty damn heartwarming.","It would be, to quote Bebe herself, the gag of the season.","RuPaul’s Drag Race is a show that does best when it’s shocking the audience. Look at Season 9: What was perceived as a fairly weak season was saved by a mask, a rebellion, and a format change. This season, for all its delights, has been pretty much a replication of “All Stars” Season 2 so far. It’s going to need a major shock to rise to the heights of the most iconic seasons. Bebe being the mole would do that. Executed well, it could honestly elevate the show to challenge Season 5 and “All Stars” Season Two as the best of the series.","So there are plenty of good results to be derived from a Bebe mole reveal. And indeed, the stars do seem to be aligning, even as Michelle Visage denies it. But the mere fact that we seem to have figured it out makes me think we may be in for a different twist altogether. RuPaul is crafty: Just when we think we know her next move, she pulls something new out of her hat. I think we’re far from finished with the gags of “All Stars” Season 3 just yet."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8332352000003600eaec19.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"SPORTS","headline":"Olympic Skier Gus Kenworthy Has A ‘Game Of Thrones’ Doppelgänger","authors":"Lee Moran","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gus-kenworthy-games-of-thrones-lookalike_us_5a84077ce4b0cf067520061d","short_description":"\"I'm just saying we've never seen you at the same place at the same time.\"","date":"2018-02-14"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Chadwick Boseman Reacts To Viral Video Of Kids Learning They'll See 'Black Panther'","authors":"Jeremy Belanger, Yahoo Entertainment","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chadwick-boseman-reacts-to-viral-video-of-kids-learning-theyll-see-black-panther_us_5a846fbce4b0058d55654639","short_description":"The star of “Black Panther,” Chadwick Boseman, visited The View and reacted to the joyous viral video of a middle school","date":"2018-02-14"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"SPORTS","headline":"Olympians Shut Down Local Fox Anchor Who Said Figure Skating Is 'Not A Sport'","authors":"Lee Moran","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/figure-skating-not-a-sport-local-anchor_us_5a83e965e4b0adbaf3d8cd01","short_description":"Gracie Gold, Vincent Zhou, Chris Knierim and Jeffrey Buttle all waded in.","date":"2018-02-14"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"SPORTS","headline":"Shaun White Dismisses Sexual Harassment Allegations As 'Gossip'","authors":"Ron Dicker","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/shaun-white-sexual-harassment-allegations-gossip_us_5a84020ce4b0adbaf3d8f2ed","short_description":"He later admitted that \"it was a poor choice of words.\"","date":"2018-02-14"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Amy Poehler And 'Parks And Recreation' Cast Reunite For Galentine's Day","authors":"Cole Delbyck","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/amy-poehler-parks-and-recreation-cast-reunite-galentines-day_us_5a843db0e4b0adbaf3d96344","short_description":"Ladies celebrating ladies.","date":"2018-02-14"},"articleContent":["What’s Galentine’s Day?

Braden is a former Major League Baseball pitcher who has worked for ESPN.

From collecting cash-stuffed red envelopes from relatives ― a Chinese tradition symbolizing good luck ― to chowing down on a feast of good food, the actors say the occasion serves as an opportunity to celebrate their Asian heritage.","“It’s something important to us because it’s a holiday that is all about family and thinking about the future. American New Year is mostly about making promises to yourself, like resolutions, but Lunar New Year is about connections with other people,” Yang, 14, explained to HuffPost. “So everything we do is about other people, not us. Except for the red envelopes!”","Like many people celebrating the Year of the Dog, the trio enjoys some classic dishes traditionally served at a Chinese family’s New Year’s table, including fish, rice cakes, and dumplings.","As Wheeler, 13, noted to HuffPost, the rice cakes, called “nian gao” in Chinese, represent the phrase “nian nian gao sheng,” meaning increasing prosperity year after year. Dumplings, shaped like old gold ingots, are thought to bring fortune and prosperity to families. And fish, called “yu,” symbolize the saying “nian nian you yu,” meaning “may the year bring prosperity.”","But food isn’t the only thing the three are amped up for. The actors say they love being around family and playing games with relatives.","Sometimes, they reflect on their immigrant roots and the struggles that family members before them have gone through.","“Without all the sacrifices my family made, I probably wouldn’t be here in America, I wouldn’t be on a TV show, and wouldn’t be talking to you,” Chen, who’s 11, told HuffPost.","Yang mentioned that his grandparents worked hard to ensure his family could get a taste of the American dream.","“My grandparents on my mom’s side passed away a while ago, but they owned a restaurant and worked really hard to make it over here. My mom worked at their place all throughout her childhood, and then she had to put herself through school,” he said. “But my grandparents on my dad’s side worked really hard too — also they helped their brothers and sisters come over to the U.S. My grandpa had 11 brothers and my mom had 10, and one by one, most of them came over too.”","For Wheeler, he enjoys learning from his grandparents and taking in the lessons he’s taught from older generations.","“My grandpa will sometimes talk about the things his family taught him to do to celebrate Lunar New Year, like the preparations and superstitious rituals that are or are not allowed,” he said. “He also talks about what his family did when he was a child and the things his parents did for him to move him ahead in life. I like listening to his stories and hope I can share with my kids what I learned from my grandpa.”","Ultimately, introspection remains at the core of the Lunar New Year spirit. And the trio will be doing just that.","“It’s a time for reflection, for thanking those who came before or who may have helped us get to where we are today,” Wheeler told HuffPost. “And it’s also a time to celebrate the traditions and family that make us who we are.”","“Fresh Off the Boat” airs Tuesdays at 8:30 p.m. on ABC."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a848e221e000037007abb86.jpeg?cache=zWhiaicat4&ops=crop_141_6_2823_1900%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Why You Shouldn't Freak Out Even If The Stock Market Does","authors":"Zach Carter","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/stock-market-dont-freak-out_us_5a846bc5e4b0774f31d15aaf","short_description":"Everything is fine ... except your paycheck.","date":"2018-02-14"},"articleContent":["Stocks plummeted in pre-market trading on Wednesday as a herd of speculators briefly lost their wits over … not much, really.","The proximate cause of the stock plunge was almost universally identified as a monthly consumer price report from the Department of Labor. This is confusing for sane people, because the results of the report were quite good. Consumer prices rose by a half of 1 percent in January, on an annual path of 2.1 percent ― almost exactly the rate top officials at the Federal Reserve believe is healthiest for the overall economy. Great job, prices!","So why did futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average drop 500 points in an instant? There is a widespread view among the investment community that the stock market is overvalued. Whether there is such a thing as a correctly valued stock market is a genuine financial dilemma, but what mattered on Wednesday morning was that most traders believe that stock prices are too high. The market has been more or less steadily rising since February 2009, with the Dow, NASDAQ, S&P 500 and Russell 2000 indices all more than tripling. President Donald Trump’s election ushered in a wave of euphoria among traders expecting deregulation and big corporate tax cuts, and while we’ve seen exactly that, people got a little carried away. The Fed, moreover, had been keeping interest rates close to zero since the 2008 financial crisis to support a flailing economy. With job numbers looking better, the central bank has been steadily raising rates, which typically depresses stock values.","As a result, the people who guess where the market is going for a living are looking to sell stocks quickly before they drop, and any smidge of disappointment in an economic report can serve as a trigger. The consensus among market experts was that January’s prices would rise by 0.3 percent. The difference of 0.2 percentage points was enough to roil stocks for a couple of hours. (Technically the Fed targets a slightly different measure of inflation than the report issued Wednesday, but the two metrics generally track each other closely.)","To be clear ― the inflation report should not have been a big deal. It indicated almost ideal price levels for the U.S. economy. But traders are worried that much higher levels of inflation will eventually become a problem, and used a tiny uptick in prices to a healthy level as grounds for a freakout because they feel, generally, that the stock market is currently too high.","Conservative economists have been warning about imminent, violent inflation for almost a decade now. It hasn’t materialized, and we have instead consistently undershot the Fed’s target inflation rate of 2 percent. But the idea that some inflation could be coming down the pike at some point isn’t totally crazy.","When the economy is humming and workers have money in their pockets, they can afford to buy more stuff. That encourages companies to make more stuff, and to hire more people to make it. This in turn gives workers more money to spend on stuff. That’s great.","But when people have more money to spend, they can also afford to pay higher prices for the stuff they buy. And so a byproduct of job creation can be price inflation, as better-off workers bid up prices. That hasn’t happened during this recovery. Inflation has been essentially nonexistent as the unemployment rate has slowly declined. Wages for workers have been consistently flat, leading plenty of economists to believe there is still a lot of room for production to expand before we really have to worry about prices going up. Obvious infrastructure problems ― like trains that crash all the time for no reason ― add to the impression that the economy needs to see more investment, not less.","The tax cuts signed into law late last year gave people some reason to pause, though. Taxes, contrary to popular belief, do not fund government operations. The federal government controls its own currency and can print however much it wants to. If it wants to build a bridge, it can just print money and pay it to someone who can build it. This, in reality, is how we “finance” public projects.","What taxes do, instead, is make sure prices don’t get out of control. If there is too much money sloshing around the economy and pushing prices up, the government can take it out of circulation by taxing it.","This strategy is perfectly consistent with an ambitious government spending program. If we have roads and bridges that need to be repaired and trains that need to be upgraded to make transportation and business more efficient, the government can spend freely to make sure these very real needs are met. And because this kind of spending increases overall productivity and brings down costs, it probably doesn’t drive up prices all that much, even if it puts more money in workers’ pockets.","But if it does, there’s an easy solution: just raise taxes.","The trouble of course is that the Republican Party’s raison d’etre is essentially cutting taxes for the rich. The tax legislation the GOP passed late last year costs about $1 trillion over the course of a decade, meaning, essentially, that there will be $1 trillion more dollars in the economy, the vast majority of them in the hands of the very rich. Persistent budget deficits can’t bankrupt the government, since the government can’t run out of money. But they can eventually spur inflation.","We are still not experiencing anything resembling harmful levels of inflation ― but the tax cut is the sort of thing that gets us closer without offering very much in return. CEOs have openly acknowledged that they won’t invest the money they’ll save on their tax bill in new plants or equipment, and there is no reason to believe boosting corporate profits by lowering the corporate tax rate will make firms any more efficient.","Because low taxes are a matter of quasi-religious faith among the GOP, there is good reason to believe Republicans in Congress will resist calls to raise taxes if inflation ever does really get serious.","But even in this scenario, all is not lost. The Fed has plenty of tools available to fight inflation. If it raises interest rates, banks tend to lend out less money (or lend it out at higher rates), which either forces some companies out of business or raises their costs, leading to unemployment and downward pressure on worker wages, which in turn keeps prices in check. It’s not an ideal solution, but it does work.","But all of these problems are pretty far away, if indeed they ever actually materialize. Right now, the stock market is looking for an excuse to go wild. When bad news can’t be found, good news will suffice."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a846f0e1e00002c007abb47.jpeg?cache=J4mDGDoqo1&ops=crop_0_280_3000_1549%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"The Immigration Debate In The Senate Is Stalling Before It Ever Really Started","authors":"Elise Foley and Matt Fuller","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/immigration-debate-senate-stalling_us_5a8367c3e4b0cf06751f8172","short_description":"Are Republicans just running out the clock, or is there really no compromise for Dreamers?","date":"2018-02-14"},"articleContent":["WASHINGTON ― Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) promised senators a freewheeling debate on immigration. Thus far, however, there’s been no real floor action at all ― and with Republican leaders saying the Senate will move on from immigration after this week, there’s a risk they’ll come up empty-handed.","Senators are struggling to find an immigration proposal that could get the support of 60 Democrats and Republicans. With two self-imposed deadlines approaching, any delay could further threaten protections for Dreamers, undocumented young people who came to the U.S. as children. And without a bill, lawmakers don’t have a way to proceed.","Instead of holding votes on Tuesday, senators spent the day blaming each other for inaction.","“We’re going to find out real soon whether Democrats are serious, whether or not they want a solution or whether they just want a campaign issue,” Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) said at a press conference where Republican leaders criticized Democrats for blocking a vote on a Republican amendment on Tuesday.","Soon after, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) accused McConnell of violating his own promises on the immigration debate.","“Yesterday, the majority leader said that the purpose of this week is not to make a point, but to make law,” Schumer said Tuesday. “We couldn’t agree more. That’s why I was disappointed that the majority leader attempted to start voting today with an amendment that does absolutely nothing to address DACA, does absolutely nothing to address border security.”","McConnell led off the immigration debate with a proposal on “sanctuary cities” ― jurisdictions that don’t fully cooperate with deportation efforts. That amendment would have little to do with undocumented young people who are at risk of losing protections, nor would it address the border. It’s not even on President Donald Trump’s list of demands for an immigration package. But McConnell said that Democrats could offer an amendment of their own as well.","Schumer immediately rejected the idea, instead proposing to hold two other votes: one on a bill based on Trump’s framework ― which Republicans had not yet introduced ― and another on a bipartisan bill to help Dreamers and ramp up border security. He said that even if neither bill received 60 votes, it could allow them to better assess what proposals could pass. But that didn’t happen.","On Tuesday evening, McConnell attempted to schedule a vote again, but was again blocked by Democrats. The Senate will pick the matter up again on Wednesday.","McConnell has indicated he wants to finish the immigration debate this week, and he’s shown little willingness to give senators more time. That’s led Republicans who favor stricter immigration laws to believe they can run out the clock on the immigration debate if no proposal finds 60 votes ― meaning conservatives have little incentive to compromise and every incentive to hijack the debate with divisive issues like “sanctuary cities.”","Democrats don’t want to give in on their immigration principles just to find a solution by swallowing Trump’s proposal, which would grant legal status to some Dreamers while slashing legal immigration pathways, increasing border security measures, and eliminating protections for children and asylum-seekers. Democrats realize that McConnell is trying to put them in the bind of either abandoning some principles or being left with nothing.","Thus far, Democrats have chosen the latter.","Trump gave a “deadline” of March 5 for Congress to act to protect young people who benefit from the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program. Each of those DACA recipients has a deadline of their own for when they will lose protections from deportation and permission to work in the U.S. But if senators can’t find a bill this week, the debate could easily get lost in the Senate calendar.","McConnell says lawmakers have had plenty of time to get something ready, even though some pieces of proposed legislation from his own party had not yet been introduced. Since Trump and some Republicans are asking for large-scale changes, any legislation is likely to be long and complicated.","“There’s no reason in the world why, if there is a core 60 votes to support something, we can’t achieve it in the next few days,” McConnell told reporters.","The Senate did successfully open debate on immigration Monday night, but weeks of bipartisan negotiations haven’t yielded a compromise proposal. Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said Monday that he didn’t see a scenario where any of the current proposals could pass with 60 votes.","The 49 Democrats in the Senate are hoping to find 11 Republicans willing to join them on a DACA proposal, but even offering significant amounts of money for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border hasn’t moved enough Republicans.","Democrats clearly have some support from Republicans for extending DACA protections and adding more money for border security. Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) has been clear he wants to preserve DACA, and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) has been a key GOP negotiator in the bipartisan talks. But Democrats need more than just a few Republicans to pass a proposal that win over their side.","Even if Democrats were able to muscle through a proposal in the Senate, the House could present its own challenges. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has said he’ll only put a bill on the floor that Trump would sign. Democrats have hoped that, if the Senate could pass a bill with 60 votes, Trump might signal some openness to the proposal and Ryan would feel the pressure to at least give the bill a vote.","The idea that a bill could pass with 49 Democrats and 11 Republicans and become law doesn’t fit reality, according to Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas), who said that passing a bill through the Senate with mostly Democrats would be a “futile gesture.”","If senators can’t even get the debate off the ground, however, there’s little reason to believe a famously obstinate institution like Congress will solve a famously difficult issue like immigration before March 5. That means Dreamers will begin to lose their protections in larger numbers, even if they are awaiting DACA renewal because of court rulings that temporarily reopened the program.","Schumer said Democrats won’t give up if they don’t reach a solution by the end of the week.","“We’re going to keep fighting in every way we can,” Schumer said."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a83682b210000c300601218.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Chrissy Teigen And John Legend's Lovey Duet Wins Valentine's Day","authors":"Cole Delbyck","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chrissy-teigen-and-john-legends-lovey-duet-wins-valentines-day_us_5a84846ce4b0ab6daf454f05","short_description":"Yes, she SINGS.","date":"2018-02-14"},"articleContent":["Whether you’re into Valentine’s Day or would rather be buried under a pile of candy hearts than to actually celebrate, we’d wager this lovey duet between Chrissy Teigen and John Legend will melt even the coldest hearts.","The internet’s clapback queen sent her husband some love on Wednesday by throwing it back to an outtake from a Valentine’s Day-themed video Love magazine shot last year.","In the clip, Legend and Teigen duet Nat King Cole’s jazz standard “L.O.V.E.” The “All Of Me” crooner kicks things off, but the supermodel readily jumps in ― and shows off some vocal chops of her own.","In the video released last year, a lingerie-clad Teigen soulfully lip-synced to perhaps her husband’s most famous ballad, ”Ordinary People,” while Legend sweetly watched.","The couple, already parents to daughter Luna, announced they were expecting a baby boy following a stunning appearance at the Grammy Awards in January.","Legend has yet to respond to Teigen’s post in kind, but he did share a photo of the two looking oh-so-dapper before Ellen DeGeneres’ star-studded 60th birthday bash.","He topped the post off with a heart emoji in the caption."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a848f67210000c3006013ef.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Freedom Caucus Chairman Warns Paul Ryan To Tread Lightly On Immigration","authors":"Matt Fuller","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mark-meadows-paul-ryan-immigration_us_5a84b76ae4b0774f31d1c39c","short_description":"Mark Meadows helped push John Boehner out. Is he planning something against Ryan?","date":"2018-02-14"},"articleContent":["WASHINGTON ― As senators get closer to producing a bipartisan immigration bill, House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) is warning Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) to think twice about putting whatever comes out of that chamber on the House floor.","Meadows seemed to put the speaker on notice Wednesday morning during the monthly Conversations with Conservatives event, telling reporters that while he doesn’t “really” think there are any conversations happening about a new speaker, “there are certainly new conversations that would involve new leadership.”","In an interview in his office Wednesday afternoon, Meadows said he wasn’t threatening Ryan, but intimated that there very well could be repercussions for the speaker if he moves forward with an immigration bill conservatives don’t like.","“Immigration is a defining moment for many of our members,” Meadows said. “To not recognize that, and think you’re gonna be able to make excuses on why a bad bill gets sent to the president, is not going to be accepted by the people we represent, and certainly not going to be accepted by a number of members.”","When HuffPost asked Meadows if that meant he would put forward a motion to remove Ryan ― something Meadows did in 2015 with then-House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) ― if Ryan put up an immigration bill largely relying on Democrats, Meadows said he had not “entertained putting in a motion to vacate in well over two and a half years.”","Did he know of any other members who have entertained that idea?","“I have certainly not encouraged other members who have mentioned that,” Meadows said. “How’s that?”","Ryan’s office declined to comment for this story.","Meadows seems to want to avoid a direct threat to Ryan, preferring to speak of general repercussions in November if Ryan passes a bill addressing the Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals immigration program that some Republicans deem insufficiently conservative. When asked whether there would be immediate repercussions, Meadows was silent for a moment before saying, “November.”","But it’s difficult to hear Meadows’s cryptic warnings and not think Ryan may have more trouble with the Freedom Caucus and other conservatives than he previously anticipated.","The North Carolina Republican spoke at length Wednesday about general frustrations with Ryan regarding the latest budget deal and the speaker’s less than stellar record of an open process.","“Leadership continues to have one agenda that gets communicated to a certain group of people, and another agenda that gets communicated to a different group of people,” Meadows said. “And ultimately, we would all be better served if we were just open and transparent about the negotiations that are going on.”","Meadows claimed he had heard the budget deal numbers for roughly two months ― indeed, speaking to HuffPost in late December, Meadows correctly predicted exactly what the numbers would be ― and said leadership wouldn’t confirm the spending increases until the very last minute.","Meadows said leadership has used an “open process when it’s convenient, and a closed process when it’s not.”","But that approach itself is similar to what Meadows and other conservatives would take. Meadows wants to make sure Republicans can get votes on amendments when it’s advantageous to them, but they want to prevent votes on amendments and bills when it’s not in their favor ― like with an immigration proposal that could pass the House with all Democrats and the support of a small number of Republicans.","Meadows acknowledged what he and other conservatives want isn’t a true “open process.” But he argued that Republicans should abide by the informal convention of only giving votes to legislation that has the support of a majority of the majority ― the so-called Hastert Rule ― a promise Ryan made to the Freedom Caucus for any immigration bill when he became speaker in 2015.","“There is not a bill that would garner the majority of the majority other than Goodlatte,” Meadows said, referring to the hard-line immigration measure proposed by Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.).","Conservatives feel GOP leaders have made less than a full effort to secure support for that legislation, despite promises during one of the continuing resolution fights that leadership would whip the bill and put it up for a vote.","Leadership is currently whipping that Goodlatte bill, but it faces an uncertain fate in the House, as almost every Democrat is certain to vote against it, along with a number of Republicans.","Meadows argued that if leadership’s job depended on getting 218 votes to pass the Goodlatte bill, they would indeed get to 218. “But their job does not depend on that, and so whipping that bill has been less than a priority for our leadership team,” he said.","Leadership has certainly been slow to whip the bill ― something they told the Freedom Caucus they would do the week after conservatives voted for a bill to keep the government open in January ― but Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) has made an effort in recent days to at least seem like he’s pushing for passage of the Goodlatte proposal. Scalise aides note they’ve been holding member briefings, and have been getting member feedback for weeks.","Ryan has also been careful to not anger conservatives worried about immigration. He’s avoided promising Democrats that he’ll put up a bill just because it passes the Senate or could pass the House. Ryan’s standard, stated over and over again, is whether President Donald Trump will sign it.","On that front, conservatives seem to worry Trump could be talked into supporting a bill that has limited GOP support ― out of a desire to secure funding to build a border wall and to provide a legislative fix for DACA. They also worry that Ryan will use Trump’s support to put up a bill that has less than the support of a majority of the majority.","Thus far, though, there’s been little movement on any sort of immigration bill like that. The Senate can’t find 60 votes for the sort of proposal that all Democrats would support, and without Senate action, there’s little threat of the House moving forward. Ryan’s job may be safe by virtue of inaction.","But if the Senate could get its act together, and if Trump decided to support a bill coming out of the Senate and Ryan put it on the floor, there very well could be repercussions for the speaker before November.","Asked if he anticipated someone else putting forward a motion to vacate, Meadows replied: “I’m only one member.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a84b8ff210000c30060142a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"LATINO VOICES","headline":"Michelle Rodriguez Will Star In Virtual Reality Series ‘The Limit'","authors":"Carolina Moreno","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/michelle-rodriguez-robert-rodriguez-the-limit_us_5a84b285e4b0ab6daf45930c","short_description":"\"Sin City\" director Robert Rodriguez is behind this \"first-of-its-kind series.\"","date":"2018-02-14"},"articleContent":["“Sin City” director Robert Rodriguez and actress Michelle Rodriguez joined forces once more for a new virtual reality series.","The “Fast and Furious” actress is set to star in the filmmaker’s upcoming VR project “The Limit,” which will premiere on STX’s pay-per-experience channel “Surreal” this summer, according to Variety.

They’re calling it bike equity.","date":"2018-02-14"},"articleContent":["By Teresa Wiltz","Bike sharing may be the ultimate symbol of gentrification, the province of avocado-toast loving, espresso-swilling — and mostly white — millennials.","But some cities are taking measures to combat that, by making it easier for low-income riders and those without a credit card or smartphone to take a two-wheeler for a spin.","They’re calling it bike equity, and to achieve it, cities are trying a number of things: steeply discounted memberships for food stamp recipients; bike-riding classes; pay stations that accept cash; and recruiting riders from underserved neighborhoods.","Bike equity sounds like a buzzword, but research shows it has its advantages: Bike sharing can bring disadvantaged communities a reliable — and healthy — alternative to mass transit, according to a June report by Portland State University in Oregon.","The interest is there, too: Most low-income people of color said they would like to bike share, the report found, but the high cost of membership, as well as worries about traffic safety, stopped them.","Ten years ago, Washington, D.C., was the first U.S. city to roll out a bike-share program. The idea was to provide tourists and locals with a fun way to get around while reducing congestion and improving air quality. Other cities, including Boston, Denver and New York, soon followed.","But only years later did most cities start trying to woo diverse riders. Boston started its bike-share program in 2011, but just last month began offering steep discounts to food stamp recipients.","Pushback","But the bikes haven’t been universally welcomed, and in some places it took a while for organizers to set up programs for low-income users, inflaming tensions over an amenity that many say smacks of gentrification. In San Francisco, for example, bike sharing has met with fierce opposition.","The city’s bike-share program, which includes San Jose and the East Bay area, started in 2014 but didn’t offer discounted rates for low-income riders until early 2017.","Last summer, community activists successfully blocked bike-share stations in the city’s Mission District, a historic, predominantly Latino neighborhood, because, they said, the program didn’t do much for their community, fueled gentrification, and didn’t include them in the plans.","Locals can save money by buying a bike for $65, said Erick Arguello, president of Calle 24 Latino Cultural District. “These are amenities that are benefiting people who are gentrifying the neighborhood.”","Michael Tanner, a senior fellow with the libertarian Cato Institute, called discounted bike-share programs a waste of money and “yuppie do-gooderism.” Far better, he said, would be to help lower-income people get what they really need: affordable housing in rapidly gentrifying neighborhoods.","Bike Equity","Philadelphia was the first U.S. city to incorporate bike equity into its planning from the start, said Steve Taylor, spokesman for the League of American Bicyclists, a biking advocacy group based in Washington, D.C.","Waffiyyah Murray, program manager of Philadelphia’s Better Bike Share Partnership, said city officials took note of how other places had been slow to include underserved communities. “Equity has to be the focal point,” she said.","In 2015, the city rolled out its Indego bike-share, installing 20 stations in underserved communities and offering a cash payment option, and then in 2016 adding a discounted pass for people who receive public assistance. The city even offered a digital literacy and safe bike riding course: Digital Skills and Bicycle Thrills.","It can be difficult to measure the costs of the programs, however. There’s very little data, said Nathan McNeil, the urban studies researcher at Portland State University who authored the June report.","Indego relies on a combination of grants and corporate sponsorship plus membership fees, but Murray was unable to say what it costs each year for Philadelphia to provide its Access Pass to low-income users because, she said, discounted members are part of the overall operations budget. And though the city received a grant from the Better Bike Share Partnership to run its discounted pass program, Murray said the grant funders wouldn’t allow the city to disclose the amount.","(Philadelphia Deputy Managing Director Mike Carroll last year announced a $2.5 million grant from the JPB Foundation to the partnership to promote bike-share equity, following a $5.8 million grant to the city in 2014.)","Since its launch, Indego users have logged nearly 2 million rides. Ten percent of the rides were by the more than a thousand low-income riders who receive public assistance and have signed up for the Access Pass. Indego sold 975 of the access passes in 2017 alone, surpassing their expected goals by 30 percent, Murray said.","“We’re definitely proud of that,” Murray said. “And the number is growing.”","The Better Bike Share Partnership, the coalition that launched Indego, has given grants ranging from $10,000 to $75,000 to other cities, including Atlanta, Los Angeles and Milwaukee, to set up similar programs or to reach low-income communities.","Barriers to Riding","It’s taken a while to get to this point. The first bike-shares were set up in more affluent, predominantly white neighborhoods, such as the Wall Street area in lower Manhattan, said Nathan McNeil, the urban studies researcher at Portland State University who authored the June report.","To some degree, he said, this made sense. Cities investing in bike-share programs wanted to demonstrate that they could be successful. Starting with high-traffic areas that attract tourists is a way to ensure that more people ride.","But that approach contributed to the perception that bike sharing wasn’t for everyone, McNeil said.","Last year, McNeil and a team of researchers surveyed residents living near bike-share stations in traditionally low-income communities in Brooklyn, Chicago and Philadelphia. About a quarter of people surveyed said they worry that bike sharing spells greater gentrification — and getting priced out of the neighborhood, he said.","Cost was a factor too, the report found, but discounts provided a big incentive for joining. Once people did join, they bike share just as often as higher-income riders.","The survey found that the biggest barrier to bicycling in general, regardless of race or income, was concern about traffic safety. To remedy this, cities have to create bike lanes so that riders feel safe, McNeil said, and need to educate potential riders about riding through urban streets.","Expanding Access","This year in Boston and neighboring Brookline, Cambridge and Somerville a program started offering discounts to food stamp recipients. The Snap to Ride program offers beneficiaries of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, a $5 a month membership and a $50 a year membership. (The normal annual rate is $99.)","The metro area’s bike-share, called Boston Hubway, previously offered discounts to people in public housing. With that program, about 800 out of 15,000 annual riders received financial assistance. With the new Snap to Ride program, it’s expected that 10 to 15 percent of the riders will be low-income, said Benjy Kantor, senior marketing manager with Motivate, a national bike-share operator which manages the Boston Hubway.","The Bay Area in California has a similar program for food-stamp eligible riders, as do Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., and Montgomery County, Maryland.","Meanwhile, Chicago and Portland offer discounted monthly memberships for low-income riders.","Those who run the programs said it’s hard to estimate how much it takes to provide low-income access, but among the costs are marketing expenses. In Portland, for example, the Better Bike Share Partnership in 2016 gave the city a $75,000 grant to reach low-income communities and provide discounted memberships in the program’s first year.","Typically, bike-shares run as a nonprofit-public hybrid, funded by a combination of federal and philanthropic grants and corporate sponsorship. When offering discounted bike-share memberships, cities typically don’t incur up-front costs, Kantor said. Cities may end up paying in other ways, such as repairing wear and tear on bikes, he said.","But even with discounted rates, not everyone is taking advantage of them. For example, D.C.’s Capital Bikeshare provides discounted memberships to community organizations in the region. But several of the community partners told Stateline that most of their clients don’t take advantage of the program.","Gearin’ Up Bicycles, a D.C. nonprofit that works with underprivileged youth, pays for the bike-share memberships so that participants can bike share for free, according to executive director Sterling Stone.","“But they’re not jumping on it,” Stone said. He expected at least 15 people would sign up, but only six are enrolled, he said.","New Life, New Ride","Bike sharing has helped Maria Teresa Llanos and her husband settle into their new life in the United States after immigrating from Venezuela.","Llanos and her husband were relieved to hear that the school where they’re learning English, Carlos Rosario International Public Charter School, provides students with a discounted bike-share pass, $5 for a year.","The only problem: The last time she was on a bike, she was 12.","“I needed to start again,” Llanos said, “learn to ride a bike, learn a new career, learn a new language.”","Today, she says, she and her husband bike share to class. They even use it for their new photography business. She figures she saves at least $40 a week on transportation.","In May, Detroit rolled out its MoGo bike-share program, modeled closely after Indego. In the years leading up to its launch, the city worked closely with Philadelphia officials, said Lisa Nuszkowski, founder and executive director of MoGo Detroit Bike Share. Detroit offers $5 annual memberships to anyone receiving state benefits, and riders can attend free how-to classes.","Bike sharing “isn’t going to be the panacea for everything,” Nuszkowski said. “But it can be one component of a transportation ecosystem.”","The city has logged 113,000 rides to date, exceeding its initial ridership goal, Nuszkowski said, and 18 percent of its monthly and yearly members are low-income riders. Today, she said, the program has bike-share users from every ZIP code in the city, a sign that the outreach is working.","“We wanted to make sure we weren’t dropping a shiny new toy on the city and saying, ‘you’re welcome, everyone,’ ” Nuszkowski said. “To be successful, it really has to be reflective of the city we serve.”","Stateline home page","Sign up for exclusive state policy reporting and research"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8475f321000034006013c0.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"COMEDY","headline":"Jimmy Kimmel 'Reveals' The Trump White House's Valentine's Day Cards","authors":"Lee Moran","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jimmy-kimmel-trump-white-house-valentines-day-cards_us_5a83e568e4b0cf06751fcf4f","short_description":"\"I love you like daddy loves Jared.\"","date":"2018-02-14"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"QUEER VOICES","headline":"Queer Students Celebrate Valentine's Day By Sharing First Kiss Stories","authors":"Curtis M.

Despite repeated calls from lawmakers and top scientists to nominate a science adviser and director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, Trump has yet to appoint one.","This is longest that the science office ― which is currently operating with a “skeleton staff” ― has gone without a director since at least 1976, when Congress codified the role. A former presidential science adviser called the lag “mind-boggling.”","A Feb. 6 Science magazine article reported the White House interviewed candidates last year. It wasn’t clear why no one was hired.","Trump has demonstrated a disdain for science that some say may be complicating his search. In a scorching New York Times op-ed published in January, physicists Neal Lane, a science adviser to President Bill Clinton, and Michael Riordan said “it will be difficult at this point, if not impossible, to find an accomplished, reputable scientist who would agree to work” with Trump.","Citing the president’s many “assaults on health and environmental policy,” including his decision to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement and his appointment of Scott Pruitt as head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Lane and Riordan said the president hasn’t just displayed a contempt for science, but “for evidence in general.”","“No president in recent history has needed a capable science adviser more while apparently wanting one less,” the scientists wrote. They noted that a capable adviser could have helped prevent, or at least blunt, some of Trump’s worst science-related policy decisions.","Since 1976, the White House science adviser has played an important role in providing independent and expert advice to sitting presidents on a wide range of critical issues, including disaster management (Barack Obama, for instance, relied on his science adviser, the physicist and former Harvard professor John Holdren, to help navigate the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill and the 2011 Fukushima nuclear meltdown) and disease (Holdren later assisted Obama in tackling the outbreaks of Ebola and Zika).","Most modern presidents have apparently recognized the importance of the position, which requires Senate approval. According to The Washington Post, Obama and Clinton, as well as John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon, all named a science adviser before taking office. George W. Bush ― who, until Trump, had been the modern president who’d dawdled the longest to choose a science adviser ― named physicist John Marburger within five months of taking office.","Democratic lawmakers have repeatedly expressed alarm at Trump’s failure to choose a science adviser, and at reports that the Office of Science and Technology Policy remains significantly understaffed. The Boston Globe reported this week that the office now has just 50 people, considerably fewer than during Obama’s tenure, and less than half are scientists.","Democrats on the House Science Committee urged Trump in a letter last month to immediately hire “qualified scientific advisers.”","“Sound scientific and technology advice is indispensable to US national security and economic growth, and to forming federal policies that help drive the kind of research and technological advances that made this country great,” the lawmakers wrote.","Obama adviser Holdren told the Globe this week that it was “mind-boggling” that Trump was making decisions without a science adviser ― one who could help deal with crises like North Korea’s nuclear program, climate change and the opioid epidemic.","“It’s vital for the president to get the best science advice, and right now, he isn’t getting that. His decisions are being made without the benefit of science,” Holdren said."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8401fb2000003800eaed3b.jpeg?cache=Aa62A4rkPg&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"What Makes Olympic Bobsledder Aja Evans Feel Like She ‘Can Take On The World’","authors":"Dana Oliver, Yahoo Lifestyle","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-makes-olympic-bobsledder-aja-evans-feel-like-she-can-take-on-the-world_us_5a8472d2e4b0058d55654bd3","short_description":"Maintaining soft, supple, luminous hair and skin during the winter isn’t quite as simple as just slathering on conditioners","date":"2018-02-14"},"articleContent":["Maintaining soft, supple, luminous hair and skin during the winter isn’t quite as simple as just slathering on conditioners and moisturizers.

A string of trips last June cost taxpayers more than $90,000 in total, according to agency receipts the Environmental Integrity Project obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests.","Pruitt said Tuesday that his protective detail and his chief of staff made the bookings based on security assessments, and said there was a string of incidents last year that spurred his frequent use of first-class seats. It was not immediately clear what these incidents involved, and the EPA did not reply to HuffPost’s request to clarify what they were.","“We live in a very toxic environment politically, particularly around issues of the environment,” Pruitt told the Union Leader. “We’ve reached the point where there’s not much civility in the marketplace and it’s created, you know, it’s created some issues and the (security) detail, the level of protection is determined by the level of threat.”","“I’m not involved in any of those decisions,” he continued. The Union Leader noted that Pruitt traveled to New Hampshire via a first-class flight from the Washington, D.C., area to Boston.","The EPA defended Pruitt’s travel in an interview with The Washington Post on Sunday, saying ethics officials had approved the expenses. Federal regulations state that government employees must “consider the least expensive class of travel” for their needs, but security concerns do allow for more expensive bookings.","CNN reported in October that Pruitt gets at least “four to five times the number of threats” as his predecessor. He’s also the first person in the role to have a full-time security detail at a cost of about $2 million a year.","Pruitt’s tenure at the EPA has been controversial as he’s quickly moved to dismantle many Obama-era environmental regulations, including the Clean Power Plan. Researchers have accused Pruitt’s EPA of disenfranchising scientists on the agency’s advisory boards, and senior officials have been leaving in droves, either through buyouts or voluntary departures.","On Monday, former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger (R) called on Pruitt to be fired, calling him “the wrong person at that place,” echoing the calls of many environmental groups.","But Pruitt told the Union Leader his detractors “just don’t know me.”","One thing is clear: Pruitt’s use of first-class seats isn’t helping the environment. A 2013 World Bank report found that travel in business-class seats accounted for around three times the carbon emissions of equivalent seats in coach, because the seats take up far more space. First-class spots are even larger and can account for up to nine times the emissions."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a83702d2000002d00eaec86.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Taylor Swift Shakes Off Copyright Lawsuit Over Hit Song","authors":"By Alex Dobuzinskis, Reuters","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/taylor-swift-copyright-lawsuit-tossed_us_5a83e57be4b0cf06751fcf74","short_description":"The judge ruled the phrases in question were not sufficiently original to merit copyright protection.","date":"2018-02-14"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"COMEDY","headline":"#IfMomWroteCandyHearts Is The Sweet And Sassy Valentine's Day Hashtag We Needed","authors":"Jenna Amatulli","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ifmomwrotecandyhearts-valentines-day-twitter-hashtag_us_5a844132e4b0adbaf3d96903","short_description":"\"Don't eat this candy heart.

The practice, the lawsuit argues, is in violation of the Federal Equal Pay Act and similar state acts in New York and California ― the two states where Rose lived while working for Vice from 2014 to 2016.","According to the filing, Rose obtained an internal memo in 2015 showing her the salaries of about 35 other employees. She allegedly discovered that overall, the men were being paid significantly higher salaries than their female counterparts for essentially the same work.","Rose says she discovered a particularly egregious pay discrepancy between herself and a male employee she’d hired. Per the lawsuit:","Plaintiff hired her male subordinate, but she learned that this male employee earned approximately $25,000 per year more than her. This male employee quickly rose through the ranks and was later promoted to a position as Plaintiff’s supervisor by the male executive overseeing the Live Nation joint venture, who told Plaintiff that the male employee was a “good personality fit” for male clients at Live Nation.","The lawsuit alleges that hundreds of women employed at Vice Media were affected by the equal pay violation. Rose’s lawyers are seeking class-action certification.","In a statement to HuffPost, Vice said it’s still reviewing Rose’s complaint, and noted that it’s studying workplace equality concerns.","“We have just been made aware of the complaint and are reviewing it,” the statement read. “As a company, we have made a significant commitment to a respectful, inclusive and equal workplace. That commitment includes a pay parity audit started last year, a goal of 50/50 female/male representation at every level by 2020, and the formation of a Diversity & Inclusion Advisory Board.”","Former Vice News writer Alice Speri tweeted in support of Rose’s claims on Tuesday:","In December, a bombshell New York Times report explored the toxic workplace culture for women at Vice Media. Two men alleged in the report to have engaged in sexual misconduct at work, company President Andrew Creighton and Chief Digital Officer Mike Germano, were subsequently placed on leave the following month. After the launch of an internal investigation, Germano was permanently dismissed. The company is still investigating claims against Creighton.","Ahead of the Times piece late last year, The Daily Beast and BuzzFeed News also published investigations into toxic behavior by male employees at Vice Media."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a836c5d2000003800eaec7e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"MEDIA","headline":"NY Times Abruptly Fires Its New Nazi-Befriending Editorial Board Hire","authors":"Andy Campbell and Christopher Mathias","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ny-times-quinn-norton-neonazis_us_5a837db8e4b0cf06751f8fbe","short_description":"Quinn Norton has tweeted that she's friends with neo-Nazis, and has used slurs on a regular basis.","date":"2018-02-14"},"articleContent":["The New York Times has fired journalist Quinn Norton, its brand new editorial board hire, HuffPost has learned.","At around 3 p.m. on Tuesday, the paper’s communications department tweeted that it had hired Norton as its “lead opinion writer on the power, culture and consequences of technology.”","Twitter users immediately began pointing to her past tweets, in which she’s admitted she’s “friends with various neo-Nazis” ― though she says she has “never agreed with them.” In other tweets, she’s called users “fag” and used racial slurs.","By 10 p.m., Quinn had been released from the company.

After the titular warrior T’Challa has been crowned ruler of the African nation Wakanda, his late father appears to him against the violet twilight, just as Mufassa materialized in young Simba’s hour of need. “I am not ready to be without you,” the mourning T’Challa tells his papa, who gently promises that T’Challa has spent his life training for this precious juncture. He’s gonna be a mighty king, so enemies beware.","A mighty king indeed, one whose story vastly outshines the 22 movies and 10 television series logged since the so-called Marvel Cinematic Universe began in 2008 and the DC Extended Universe launched in 2011.","Like many a franchise, “Black Panther” steeps itself in well-trod mythology ― Arthurian folklore, James Bondian valor, and, yes, a fitting dose of “The Lion King,” which itself borrows from “Hamlet.” In most instances, particularly when it comes to the mind-numbingly homogenous superhero craze, listing the tropes we’ve seen a dozen times over is a dispiriting exercise. Not here.","Thanks to the careful work of director Ryan Coogler, who co-wrote the “Black Panther” script with “American Crime Story” scribe Joe Robert Cole, the movie’s familiar elements are comforting instead of tiresome. That’s because what bookends them is fresh and more invigorating than anything this genre has produced in the 21st century.","Of course, a lot of that is owed to the fact that no superhero flick has ever looked like this. None has had an almost exclusively black cast, and most are likelier to take place in the far reaches of outer space or some version of New York City than they are a fictional utopia in Africa.","And even the brightest spots in the Marvel and DC catalogs don’t feature characters as nuanced and interesting as the ones seen in T’Challa’s homeland, where muscular women are heroes, warring with other nations is not the answer, armored rhinos act as guards and everyone’s attire glitters so spectacularly it might as well have catwalked straight off a Wakanda Fashion Week runway.","As the poised but restrained T’Challa, Chadwick Boseman, our de facto biopic master thanks to his roles as Jackie Robinson (“42”), James Brown (“Get On Up”) and Thurgood Marshall (“Marshall”), once again proves himself a sturdy leading man. He’s aided by a choice ensemble that includes Lupita Nyong’o as a charitable operative and well-rounded love interest, Danai Gurira as the captain of a female squadron, “Get Out” breakout Daniel Kaluuya as T’Challa’s right-hand confidant, MVP Letitia Wright as his quippy tech-whiz sister Shuri, Angela Bassett as his royally robed mother, Forest Whitaker as an Obi-Wan-esque archbishop who oversees the crowning of Wakanda’s monarch, and Martin Freeman as an American CIA envoy who joins T’Challa in protecting his paradise.","In an inspired casting choice, it’s Michael B. Jordan, a stud among heroic studs after “Fantastic Four” and his previous Coogler collaborations (“Creed” and the fantastic 2013 indie “Fruitvale Station”), who becomes T’Challa’s foil. Sporting a mean mug and a gritty dreadlocked updo, Jordan plays Erik Killmonger, a fallen angel who returns to the birthplace that exiled him with one mission in mind: overthrowing T’Challa and bandaging the emotional scars hardening his superpower-hunting soul. Killmonger seeks vengeance that would demolish Wakanda’s isolated, technologically rich culture ― the very culture that has avoided colonialism and relieved its inhabitants of the systematic racism blanketing the globe. Jordan brings a grizzled vigor to the screen without losing what makes good villains so potent: a tangible sense of the injustices life has brought upon them.","T’Challa and Killmonger’s conflict yields a smattering of battles, as is routine for any comic-book spectacle’s third act. And the action itself is far from perfect. Like too many films of this ilk, it’s smothered in gaudy computer-generated renderings and edited for maximum velocity, detracting from the intimate character beats Coogler has laid out. However judicious it is overall, “Black Panther” further proves these movies would be better with less capital. Even our craftiest filmmakers can’t resist hitting that extra VFX keystroke when allotted, in this case, a reported $200 million budget. Jumping from the lush flora and fauna of Wakanda ― that resourceful land where sunrises and sunsets punctuate unfathomable sci-fi beauty ― to the overcooked culminating fight sequences is like a rude jolt in an otherwise smooth roller coaster. (Credit for the aforementioned beauty goes to director of photography Rachel Morrison, whose work on “Mudbound” just made her the first woman nominated for the cinematography Oscar.)","To its benefit, “Black Panther” isn’t overflowing with these gangbuster action scenes. In fact, a couple of its most thrilling moments are ritualistic hand-to-hand skirmishes set atop a multihued mountain where onlookers’ uniforms form a rainbow of colors.","Even down to those onlookers, this is far more character-driven than anything Marvel has done, and I don’t mean “character-driven” in the vein of, say, “Thor: Ragnarok,” a romp that tried oh-so-hard to reinvent the wheel via canned, quirky humor. Here, everyone is steeped in the mythos of their ancestry but committed to a more diplomatic future. Their wisecracks are grounded in the politics of Wakanda and its relationship to other regions, as when Shuri says of Freeman’s agent, “Great, another broken white boy for us to fix.”","To wit, “Black Panther” thawed my superhero-agnostic heart, which, with all due respect to the objectively well-made “Dark Knight” and the first “Spider-Man” go-round, hasn’t truly adored one of these movies since Tim Burton was making Batman.

He finally wants to iron some things out.","date":"2018-02-14"},"articleContent":["In a galaxy far, far away, an ominous-looking spaceship prepares for landing. Clouds of smoke pour from exhaust ports as the craft slowly descends, its foreboding features coming into focus. But something’s not quite right. Is that a handle on its hull? Is that even smoke? What kind of alien contraption is this?","Apparently, it’s the clothes-ironing kind.","In a scene transition from the latest “Star Wars” movie “The Last Jedi,” what initially appears to be a spaceship ready for touchdown is soon revealed to be something far less imposing ― an iron ready for household duty. We were watching the First Order press its laundry the whole time.","To most fans, the scene is just an innocuous sight gag. Laundry is hilarious, amirite? But to devotees of a cult 1970s parody called “Hardware Wars,” the iron cameo has a lot more steam.","Director Rian Johnson confirmed last year that the iron scene in “The Last Jedi” is an homage to “Hardware Wars,” the first-ever “Star Wars” parody.","San Francisco-based filmmaker Ernie Fosselius created the trailer-style spoof back in 1978, lampooning the big-budget spectacle of what later became known as “A New Hope” with a 13-minute, intentionally hokey short film. Whereas “Star Wars” features special effects-driven spaceships, droids and stormtroopers, “Hardware Wars” features mundane household appliances like irons, vacuums and steamers buzzing around space.","“May the Farce be with you,” the obscure film beckoned about a decade before “Spaceballs” hit theaters.","But what was initially a small parody project has since grown into an unprecedented tour de Force. Thanks perhaps to its endearing cheesiness, and the persistent popularity of “Star Wars,” “Hardware Wars” became one of the most successful short films of all time, reportedly grossing around $500,000 in the first year of its release. It’s still revered by supporters today.","And that’s why so many fans loved the “Hardware Wars” reference built into “Last Jedi.” It’s just that ... the film’s creator didn’t.","It’s true that reactions to “Last Jedi” have been mixed overall. Some audience members loved Johnson’s update of the franchise, some hated it, and some are just professed members of the “alt-right.” As for Fosselius, he’s decidedly not a fan, and he’s been carrying around his arguably legitimate reason for decades.","A NEW GRUDGE","Over the course of an hourlong interview last month and a few subsequent email exchanges with HuffPost, we attempted to unpack Fosselius’ feelings about Johnson’s “Hardware Wars” reference ― and Fosselius’ broader, “Star Wars”-related grievances.","His story began with a few phone calls.","Following the release of “The Last Jedi,” Fosselius said he was “flooded with calls” congratulating him on the “Hardware Wars” allusion. Many of these admirers even supposedly told him they had no intention of seeing “Last Jedi” until they heard there was a “Hardware Wars” reference in it.","Sounds pretty good, no? Uh, no.","“This is the phrase that got me: ‘Aren’t you happy that you finally got into a “Star Wars” film?’” Fosselius said of the various well wishes he received.","“No, I’m not,” he explained. “I did the parody. Why would I want to get into an actual ‘Star Wars’ film?”","Let’s clear some things up: Fosselius didn’t just get into a “Star Wars” movie. He’s already been in a number of them. According to the filmmaker, “Star Wars” sound designers Ben Burtt and Gary Rydstrom were early fans of his work and they brought him into their studio to do character voices, sound effects and miscellaneous vocal grunts for “Empire Strikes Back,” “Return of the Jedi” and even Lucasfilm’s “Indiana Jones” movies. Fosselius said he wound up rearranging a John Williams piece in “Return of the Jedi,” too. (Burtt and Rydstrom did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.)","Still, Fosselius harbors an even bigger issue. Fans misconstrued his parody as a tribute to George Lucas’ movie, he says, rather than a full-fledged spoof. And as a result, he believes he’s been miscast as “the number-one fan of ‘Star Wars.’”","“That’s how things work,” Fosselius said. “You get absorbed into the thing you’re spoofing because it’s revised. Your intentions are revised.”","So when people told Fosselius they’d spent money on “Last Jedi” tickets just to see the “Hardware” reference, he was annoyed.","“I thought, oh, great. I’m doing business for [‘Last Jedi’]. I’m bringing in customers for their movie,” Fosselius said. “Look, you got to understand. ‘Hardware Wars’ was a parody. It wasn’t a fan film. Oh, god. I’m never going to live it down. It was turned into a fan film.”","“It really sort of pissed me off,” he added, “because I spend my entire life trying to make a name for myself in a very obscure profession, because it’s what came naturally to me, and I consider [my parodies] art. I thought everyone was going to have fun with it.”","THE FARCE AWAKENS","Back in San Francisco in the late 1970s, Fosselius and his team certainly had fun putting together “Hardware Wars.”","Their parody style was simple: create “a really crappy version of something that was huge.” With “Star Wars” being “big budget,” “big box office” and “technically so advanced that you can’t even imagine how they did it,” it was the perfect target.","“I was surrounded by a lot of people who were Trekkies, and [‘Star Wars’ mania] was the next huge leap over ‘Star Trek’ worship, you know?” said Fosselius. “And there were already rumors out about how amazing [‘A New Hope’] was and people had that glazed look in their eyes saying this is the best thing that has ever happened in movies. That’s a call to me. Yeah, let’s put things into perspective.”","The parody’s creator described the project that followed as “a spontaneous group effort.” He delivered the initial pitch to producer Michael Wiese in a Chinese restaurant in 1977.","“For props, he used what was available,” Wiese told HuffPost. “A soy sauce bottle was a spaceship. He just had me on the floor. Of course, the people in the restaurant were like, there’s a crazy person in the booth.”","But the antics worked; Wiese was onboard.","From there, Fosselius recruited an eclectic group of friends and a number of co-workers from the animation company Imagination, Inc., where he worked on “Sesame Street” cartoons.","Their budget was nearly nonexistent, reportedly only $8,000. But that worked for the purposes of mocking a big budget blockbuster with an intentionally chintzy production.","“Everyone said, ’I got the camera’ or ‘Let’s do this and borrow that’ and ‘I work at a place so let’s get in there at night and shoot in there,’” he said. “It was probably the last thing that I know of where that was possible.”","Pretty soon, steam irons and toasters were soaring through space on obviously visible fishing line, while droids 4-Q-2 and Artie Deco traversed desolate landscapes complete with suspiciously earthling-like sunbathers in the background. Heroes like Fluke Starbucker (Scott Mathews), a Luke Skywalker knockoff with a lopsided wig; Princess Anne-Droid (Cinthia Freeling), a Leia wannabe with stale bread buns for hair; and Ham Salad (Bob Knickerbocker), a Han Solo-esque “ace mercenary pilot and intergalactic wise-guy” were teaming up to save the galaxy from evil ne’er-do-wells like Darph Nader.","It was tacky. It was corny. “It was magic,” Fosselius said.","According to the filmmaker, even the short movie’s casting sort of worked itself out. For example, Imagination, Inc. animator Jeff Hale seamlessly slipped into the Obi-Wan-Kenobi-type role of Augie ‘Ben’ Doggie because he had the voice for it.","“I said, ‘You have a British accent. You gotta play him,’” Fosselius said. “He had a beard, so it was perfect.”","And legendary voice actor Paul Frees ― a friend of Imagination Inc. co-founder Walt Kramer ― somehow consented to provide narration for “Hardware Wars.” At the time, he was the go-to guy for everything from voice-overs in movie trailers to playing the voice of God in different projects. (He reportedly narrated the original “Star Wars” teaser.)","“This guy makes more money than anybody ever made in the voice-over business. He’s the main guy. So for the balls to go over there and say, ‘Oh, we need a couple of voices,’” said Fosselius, recalling how Kramer convinced Frees to do the lines in exchange for some maintenance work on his recording equipment.","Fosselius said Frees called him one day after “Hardware Wars” was released.","“I answer the phone and [Frees] says, ‘Are you Ernie?’ And I go, ‘Oh no, he found out something. The unmistakable voice of God!’ And I was like, ‘Yeees, sir,’” Fosselius recalled. ”[He goes], ‘How did you get my voice?’ I said, ‘Well, remember Walt Kramer fixed your machines and you agreed to read a couple of lines?’ ‘Oh right. Never mind.’ Click.”","“He’d forgotten about it,” Fosselius said. “But it scared the crap out of me. I thought I was gonna get sued.”","The film was said to be initially available on 16 mm through Pyramid, a nontheatrical distributor known for educational films. Students watched “Hardware Wars” in classrooms and it gained a grassroots following from there.","Pyramid sent the film out to festivals where it won various awards, including the Most Popular Short Film of the Year at the 1978 Chicago Film Festival. Eventually it was enlarged to 35 mm and played in theaters across the country.","“For years, it ran with ‘Rocky Horror’ every Saturday night at the UC Theater in Berkeley [California] among other ‘cult film’ venues in other cities,” Fosselius said.","THE LUCAS EMPIRE STRIKES BACK","Though Fosselius’ film was a financial success, the “Hardware Wars” creator said he didn’t see a lot of profits from the movie. Still, he mostly laments the fact that his original goal ― to create a belittling spoof ― has been lost.","Today, “Hardware Wars” is one of the most revered “fan films” ever, and Fosselius thinks George Lucas might be partly to blame for it.","Over the years, Lucas has apparently spoken openly about “Hardware Wars,” listing it as one of his most-loved parodies in a 1999 interview on “The Big Breakfast.” He’s also reportedly referred to it as a “cute little film” and his favorite tribute to “Star Wars.” In 2003, Lucasfilm gave “Hardware Wars” a Pioneer Award at the Official Star Wars Fan Film Awards.","The award, in Fosselius’ mind, passed down a misleading verdict: If anyone thought “Hardware Wars” was making fun of “Star Wars,” they were wrong. It was a fan film. It won a Pioneer award, after all!","“It was upsetting,” said Fosselius, “because it wasn’t like Lucas was saying, ‘Oh, that was fun and everybody likes it, and no harm done. That was a parody. It was a spoof. It was fun. It was satire,’ No, he has to make it that I did it because I love the film so much I had to imitate it. That’s how I took it. And if George says that, then that’s the law, and everyone is now thinking that’s what happened.”","Further dismissing any notion that he envisioned “Hardware Wars” as a “Star Wars” tribute or fan film, Fosselius added, “I’ll say one thing. I’ve been in a room with George Lucas about five or six times ― I mean, over 40 years ― and he never talked to me. He never said how he felt about [‘Hardware Wars’].” Representatives for Lucas did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.","A few years after “Hardware Wars,” Fosselius parodied Francis Ford Coppola’s “Apocalypse Now” with a short 1980 film called “Porklips Now.” Whereas Lucas had virtually ignored the parody artist, “Porklips Now” allegedly earned Fosselius a 3 a.m. call from Coppola himself.","“[Coppola] said, ‘Ernie, I’m gonna be doing some work with Jerry Brown. Come over to my house tomorrow at 10 o’clock,’” Fosselius said of the phone call. “I go, ‘Oh shit. Wait a minute.’ That’s the first thing he said. He didn’t say anything about [‘Porklips Now’]. And it’s Coppola, so I’m thinking ‘Godfather,’ you know? Like, ‘Oh shit.’”","The filmmaker took some precautions. He called a friend to tell him he’d be going to Coppola’s house the next day. He gave the address to the friend and said, “If you don’t hear from me, something bad happened.”","Once there, the director quickly got to the point.","According to Fosselius, Coppola said, “You know, I didn’t like that you made fun of me and the film. It sort of pissed me off. But you got a right to do a parody, so be it. Whatever. Now I’m asking you to help me work on this campaign.” That campaign was Jerry Brown’s 1980 presidential run.","“I love this guy for this, and I respect him,” Fosselius said of Coppola. “He told me and he was honest about it. So that I thought was much better than never talking to me and figuring out some way to discredit me.”","Coppola told HuffPost he couldn’t remember whether or not he asked Fosselius to work on a project for Brown, but he said, “I like and admire Ernie Fosselius and so it could be possible.”","Ultimately, Fosselius said that the “Hardware Wars” reference hidden inside “The Last Jedi” isn’t the end of the world for him, but “people are making money on this,” he reiterated.","“You can call it a tribute, but a real tribute would pay my rent for a month, or buy me some art supplies,” Fosselius said, “or say something nice about me in the press.”","The “Hardware Wars” creator said he’s still trying to figure out why Johnson wanted to add the tribute at all.","“That’s all I wanted to find out,” he said. “Are you a fan? Why’d you put that in there? Because it might have just been to gather in all the ‘Hardware Wars’ fans that might not have gone and to convert them to being ‘Star Wars’ fans because, ‘Look! We’re cool. We put this obscure reference in here, and everybody showed up.’” Like Burtt, Rydstrom and Lucas, Johnson did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.","Next time, he’d appreciate a heads-up.","“If you call it a tribute, wouldn’t you want to find out if the person wanted a tribute like that or what that would actually mean?” he said. “It does cement in the idea that I’m a fan, that I’m the number-one fan because I got the number-one award, and all that stuff, which is completely bogus.”","Fosselius still hasn’t seen “The Last Jedi,” and he probably never will. He doesn’t like the digital films and special effects of today ― it “physically bothers” him. He’s nostalgic for classic parodies, too.","“Satire’s probably dead by now,” he said. “It’s pretty dangerous. It’s not something people do.”","With that spirit in mind, Fosselius is able to look back on his film fondly, regardless of those who misread it.","“It was that magic that happened when you throw something out there, invite people to come in [and] bring in whatever they got, and hope you get some sort of really exceptional things happening,” he concluded. “It was a very magical kind of a mix.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a6a60981d000027006acd84.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"People Are Feeling Lots Of Things About Timothée Chalamet On The Cover Of GQ","authors":"Jenna Amatulli","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/timothee-chalamet-gq-cover-twitter_us_5a8458cfe4b0ab6daf45165b","short_description":"\"He's out here blessing my lovely ass on valentine's day,\" said one Twitter user.","date":"2018-02-14"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"LATINO VOICES","headline":"Oscar Isaac Explains Viral Photo Of Him Eating Cheetos With Chopsticks","authors":"Carolina Moreno","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/oscar-isaac-cheetos-chopsticks-viral-photo-explanation_us_5a8465e9e4b0058d55653c33","short_description":"We finally know the truth, and it's real classy.","date":"2018-02-14"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Netflix Actually Made The Dating App From Black Mirror's 'Hang The DJ' Episode","authors":"Jenna Amatulli","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/netflix-black-mirror-dating-app-hang-the-dj_us_5a847f02e4b0774f31d176f8","short_description":"And, yes, it will tell you how long your relationship will last.","date":"2018-02-14"},"articleContent":["Valentine’s Day may already feel like an episode of “Black Mirror” for some people.

In Genesis, Abram’s name was changed to Abraham to reflect his new identity as the father of the Jewish people. And in the Christian gospels, Jesus changed his follower Simon’s name to Peter to symbolize that the apostle would be the “rock” upon which the church was built.","Echoing that tradition, a Lutheran congregation in New Jersey recently marked a milestone in the life of its pastor with a renaming ceremony. On Sunday, parishioners watched their transgender pastor take on his new chosen name ― Peter.","It was a sacred way for Hoboken’s St. Matthew Trinity Lutheran Church to acknowledge and bless the Rev. Peter R. Beeson’s gender transition.","Beeson told HuffPost that it was also important for the congregation to demonstrate the “expansiveness of God’s compassion.”","“The renaming ceremony provided an opportunity ... for us to show the broader world that there are faithful Christians who support LGBTQ+ people and offer a counter message to the one of fear and hate so prevalent today,” Beeson told HuffPost. “Particularly for people who may be pondering their gender identity or sexual orientation ― particularly young people ― this provided us an opportunity to say that God loves you, and that all people are created in the image of God.”","St. Matthew Trinity Lutheran Church is part of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), a mainline Protestant denomination. The New Jersey Synod of the ELCA has a history of affirming and welcoming LGBTQ clergy members and lay leaders.","Halfway through the traditional Sunday service, Beeson and the New Jersey Synod’s bishop, Tracie Bartholomew, walked over to the church’s baptismal font. Bartholomew spoke about the ways that God changed people’s names in the Bible. A church leader then asked the congregation a series of questions about supporting Beeson in his transition and being a welcoming Christian community.","Bartholomew blessed Beeson with water from the font and welcomed him by his new name.","“It was powerful to hear the congregation re-commit to their long history of inclusion and promise to be a safe and welcoming congregation for all people who are seeking a Christian community,” Beeson said about the ceremony.","Daniel Stoll, a church council member, told HuffPost that the ceremony was “beautiful.” The church was packed with three times more visitors than is typical for a Sunday service, he said.","However, Stoll said the congregation has also received “a lot of negativity” online and through office calls from those who “think they can judge for God.”","“[Gay and trans individuals] have every right to be their authentic selves as anyone. God didn’t make a mistake,” Stoll told HuffPost. “Jesus teaches us to love every individual. The hate has to stop.”","Beeson told HuffPost that he has long felt a calling to be a minister. Growing up, his fundamentalist, evangelical Christian parents often had missionaries stay over at the family home in Arizona. In the tradition he belonged to, women were only permitted to be missionaries or Sunday school teachers. As a child, Beeson thought he would one day become a missionary as well.","Coming out as queer in his late teens forced Beeson to wrestle with his Christian faith and eventually leave his parents’ religious tradition. Years later, he said he was drawn by the Holy Spirit to return to the church. He joined an inclusive ELCA congregation in Phoenix.","“With time, I fell in love with the Lutheran emphasis on grace and divine action ― that means God finds us, rather than the fundamentalist interpretation that we have to find or earn God’s forgiveness by being holy,” Beeson said.","As he became more involved in the life of that congregation, the ministerial calling from childhood resurfaced. Beeson’s mentors also encouraged him to go to seminary and become a pastor.","Beeson has served as pastor of St. Matthew Trinity since October 2014.","He said one of his favorite passages in the Bible is the story of how Jesus broke the social norms of his time to speak with a Samaritan woman at a well.

After all, the billionaire is notorious for her desire to expand private school choice programs (which include many religious private schools that teach Christian fundamentalist doctrine).","One year into her tenure, educators have turned this opposition into action.","As in so many industries and among Democrats at large, there has been a wave of activism in response to President Donald Trump in the past year. In education, this activism has manifested as a renewed rallying around traditional public schools.","The Network for Public Education, an advocacy group, has seen membership shoot up to 330,000 members, compared to 22,000 members before DeVos was nominated. The previous year, membership had increased by only a fraction of that amount.","And in states like Kentucky, more teachers than ever are running for office.","Polls have shown a decline in support for some of DeVos’ favorite types of schools. One poll from August showed that public enthusiasm for charter schools ― a type of public school that is privately operated and often has support from both parties ― is dropping. Another poll, from American Federation for Children, the education reform group DeVos used to head, found that overall support for the concept of “school choice” has been dropping too, although it remains high. (The AFC poll defines school choice as giving “parents the right to use the tax dollars designated for their child’s education to send their child to the public or private school which best serves their needs.”)","DeVos “was a wake-up call to everyone who was concerned about the future of public education,” Diane Ravitch, a former U.S. assistant secretary of education and founder of the Network for Public Education, said over breakfast in a Brooklyn neighborhood in January. “I’m actually glad [Trump] chose her.”","Ravitch, who is writing a book about resistance to school privatization efforts, calls DeVos a “blessing in disguise.” For the first time in a decade, Ravitch said, she feels public schools are “gaining ground on the school privatization movement... and I don’t think it’s going to survive the scrutiny.”","Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, the nation’s second largest teachers union, says she has also seen increased engagement among her members in the age of Trump and DeVos ― especially as an upcoming Supreme Court case threatens to deal a major blow to union finances. She told HuffPost she has recently observed a string of local races where pro-public education advocates have prevailed. More members are showing up at town halls and regional meetings.","“You see a tremendous appetite to fight,” Weingarten said.","But she’s not cheery about the reasons for this increased engagement.","“What you also see, on the other side, is a brazen, non-hidden quest to just kill us, and to kill every bit of every tool that enables broad-based voice and opportunity,” she said.","Indeed, Carol Burris, executive director of the Network for Public Education, says she is far more more worried than she is optimistic about DeVos’ impact.","“The truth of the matter is, even though there is a heightened awareness and pushback, there is so much money on the other side that it is overwhelming,” said Burris, a former public school principal.","Despite widespread dislike for DeVos and some of her policies, these issues are still moving forward in many places. A majority of consequential education policy decisions are made at the state and local levels, especially as DeVos’ plans for more federal school choice have mostly stalled. Burris notes that groups like hers have seen an increase in monetary donations ― but “because there are so many Republican majorities in statehouses, they are seizing the day,” she said. “They are sponsoring legislation at a breakneck speed.”","Advocates for charter schools say they have seen some declining support from liberals, but support among centrists and conservatives has remained steady.","Peri Lynn Turnbull handles external relations and strategy at the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools. She says that while charter schools have become a harder sell in left-leaning, anti-Trump states, she’s glad that overall it has become a more relevant issue. It has become challenging, though, to combat what she calls increased misinformation about what charter schools are and what they do.","“It’s elevated the conversation, for one. There’s no doubt about it,” said Turnbull, whose organization has also been critical of many of Trump and DeVos’ signature priorities.","On the other hand, Lennie Jarratt of the Heartland Institute, a conservative and libertarian think tank, said there’s been an increase in private school choice legislation at the state level that “hadn’t happened like that in prior years.” Private school choice takes various forms ― whether through tax credits, vouchers, or education savings accounts ― but it generally helps parents subsidize a child’s enrollment in a private school. Opponents of private school choice say it drains public school systems of resources.","“Teachers unions pushed back harder probably than any other year against school choice,” Jarratt said. “The proponents of school choice [have] been just as vocal, and more vocal too.”","Jeanne Allen, head of the pro-charter and pro-voucher group Center for Education Reform, says that not having to advocate as much to get a voice with federal leaders has freed up her group to focus more on other issues.","She doesn’t believe that opposition to DeVos has had any lasting impact on the education field.","“She’s not everyone’s cup of tea, but when I talk to people from all walks of life, I get very little, I hear very little criticism,” Allen said. “I think the political fallout over her confirmation was a very, very small vocal minority of people who have any kind of lasting concerns.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a821d0e210000c300601013.jpeg?cache=PsdsIc57eB&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Pennsylvania Governor Rejects GOP Proposal For New Congressional Map","authors":"Sam Levine","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tom-wolf-gerrymandering_us_5a8316f7e4b0892a0353c30e","short_description":"Gov.

I cannot release any information about this.”","To be clear, there is no “advantage” issue here. Junior was assigned male at birth but identifies as trans gender fluid. Junior wants to play on the boys teams.","Earlier this fall Junior came out to his parents as a gay boy. That’s how he identified at the time. His parents, Matt and Vanessa White, were concerned with how it would be received by the local community, so they asked Junior to hide his truth.","“That was a huge mistake,” Matt told Outsports. “I take responsibility for that.”","Even as he was destroying other teams on the football field, Junior attempted to harm himself as he didn’t know how else to express his need to share his true self.","That was a wake-up call for Matt and Vanessa. They spoke to the football coach about Junior being gay. That coach then spoke to the team captains. Together they handled it perfectly, rallying support for Junior across the team. By the end of the football season Junior felt at home.","“All of them were accepting,” Junior told Outsports.","Former NFL player Ryan O’Callaghan, who lives in nearby Redding, had even visited Junior and his parents last autumn to provide some insight and inspiration to the family.","“He seems like a good kid,” O’Callaghan told Outsports of Junior, “the best player on his youth football team.”","The trouble for Junior started when he made another announcement: He was questioning his gender identity and identifying more and more as a girl.","Junior hadn’t been using any restroom facilities in school for a while because she didn’t feel comfortable walking into the boys bathroom anymore. One day at school it became impossible to avoid. So she walked into a girls bathroom. That’s when all hell broke loose.","She was reported to the principal and called out of class. She was told that she was not allowed to use any restrooms — boys or girls — in the school other than the one in the school’s main office.","That outraged Junior’s parents, who fought back. That’s when they were informed that Junior could use the girls facilities but she would no longer be allowed to play on any boys basketball teams.","Junior said his teammates want him back on the team, but the principal and superintendent simply won’t let him play.","“They’re mad at the superintendent,” Junior said of his teammates. Junior is also a competitive gymnast.","Junior has already had to watch from the sidelines as his team has continued its season. He and his friends have held signs at the games demanding that “#34” be allowed to play.","The basketball games have not been easy on Junior. At one game, Junior was harassed by a parent in the girls room, and then accosted by another woman when she walked out of the restroom, being told she is never to use a girls room again.","“Just look what they’re doing to my kid,” Matt said, simultaneously saddened and enraged.","Now Junior is simply wanting to play on the team where he feels the most comfortable — with the boys and his friends. Matt said Junior is exceptionally talented athletically and that it makes absolutely no sense to force him to compete against girls. It’s a similar issue Texas wrestler Mack Beggs faced, forced to compete against girls while identifying as a boy.","“It doesn’t matter who’s there, he stands out,” Matt said of his child who plays both sides of the football. “He’s one of the best players on offense and defense. In football he’s the fullback, and he intimidates the defense.”","In basketball, Matt added, “he jumps the highest” on the team.","Junior’s dream is to play football for Stanford University.","Junior’s plight has given rise to #ISTANDWITH34 on Twitter, which reflects Junior’s number on the boys basketball team and on the football team.","Now all Junior wants to do is play with those teams again and use the restroom where he feels most comfortable. All that’s standing in the way is a school district insistent that he now compete against girls.","For more from OutSports, check out these stories:","Figure skater Scott Dyer wants to help others by coming out publicly","The transformation of Adam Rippon","2018 Olympics will have a record 13 out LGBTQ athletes"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a83495421000038006011ef.png?cache=CkLNaAGUgZ&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"BLACK VOICES","headline":"Kenan And Kel Reunite With 'All That' Castmates For Wild Photo Op","authors":"Carolina Moreno","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kenan-and-kel-reunite-photo-op_us_5a834c7be4b0cf06751f61ba","short_description":"Awwwww, here it goes!","date":"2018-02-13"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"FBI Chief, Asked About Trump Tweets, Said He Tells Bureau To Ignore 'The Noise'","authors":"Ryan J.

Earlier this month, the bureau publicly stated that a Republican-authored memo that Trump and his supporters were using to undermine special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election had “material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo’s accuracy.”","Republican confidence in the FBI has dropped significantly as Trump has been able to convince many of his supporters that the bureau is biased against him, despite the fact that the bureau’s public handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation ahead of the 2016 election actually boosted Trump’s candidacy.","Ryan Reilly is HuffPost’s senior justice reporter, covering federal law enforcement, criminal justice and legal affairs.

Now is the time to continue pushing to ensure ... that the regulated do not become the regulators,” said Virginia Del. Sam Rasoul (D), a leading monopoly critic in the House.","For Dominion, which, as the larger of the two utilities and top campaign donor, is sometimes considered the most powerful force in Virginia politics, the defeat was especially humbling.","“I’ve never seen Dominion lobbyists look so sad,” said a senior Democratic aide in the legislature who requested anonymity to speak freely.","If Dominion had had its way, the House would have followed the state Senate’s lead. On Friday, the state’s upper chamber handily passed a bill that would, among other things, permit Dominion and Appalachian to reinvest their over-earnings into renewable energy and grid modernization projects in lieu of providing refunds to their ratepayers.","The vast majority of outside experts, including the office of Virginia’s attorney general and the State Corporation Commission, which oversees the monopolies, maintained that the scheme would enable “double dipping,” or charging ratepayers twice for the same infrastructure investments. Dominion and Appalachian would be allowed to take from the refunds owed to ratepayers ― that’s one dip ― and then still charge them higher rates to finance the same projects ― that’s the second dip.","A bipartisan group of state senators got together to propose an amendment that would have specifically barred the companies from charging ratepayers a second time, but it got shot down by a wide margin. Senate Democratic Leader Dick Saslaw had insisted that Dominion’s assurances were more than enough to go on, so why muck up the bill with a useless clause?","On Monday night, however, Saslaw’s counterpart in the House, Democratic Leader David Toscano, a delegate from Charlottesville, introduced a nearly identical bill barring double-charging.","More important, in his speech Toscano appeared to call the bluff of Dominion’s backers. He challenged opponents of the amendment to explain why, if Dominion claims there would be no double dipping, it would be so bad to pass a provision explicitly ensuring just that?","“If there isn’t a double dip in the bill, passing the amendment will clarify that fact. If there is a double dip in this bill, passing the amendment will fix the problem,” he declared.","Del. Terry Kilgore (R), a recipient of nearly $174,000 in donations from Dominion who introduced the House bill, did his best to shoot down the talking point with a folksy metaphor.","It is not clear exactly what Kilgore meant, but he compared the bill to a car dealer offering a customer a new car for the price of an old one that the customer had returned to the dealership.","“Who’s not going to jump onto that? And that’s basically what we’re doing here,” Kilgore said.","When it came time to vote, Kilgore’s metaphor apparently wasn’t enough. The Republican leaders who control the agenda in the chamber were visibly shocked as the amendment passed, 55 to 41.","That put the majority Republicans in a politically vulnerable spot, since the vote had placed them on the record against a consumer protection amendment.","In an apparent attempt at damage control, Del. Greg Habeeb, a Republican from southwest Virginia, claimed that the Republican lawmakers were merely concerned that the amendment amounted to legislating “on the fly.”","Republican leadership then moved to reconsider the amendment, and all the Republicans voted to pass it in a voice vote.","Whether or not Republicans succeed in averting political blowback for the vote, the legislature’s antimonopoly firebrands landed a blow against Dominion that no legislative dealmaking can undo.","“This is the first time I’ve seen Dominion lose on the floor. This is a game-changer,” the Democratic aide said.","The House was going to pass the utility rate bill well before Monday night’s amendment. It’s still expected to pass the legislation when it comes up for a final vote on Tuesday ― perhaps by an even wider margin than it would have otherwise.","And the amended legislation still has its critics, many of whom are unhappy with provisions of the bill that limit the factors the SCC can consider when evaluating the utility companies’ infrastructure projects.","However, as it stands, the amended bill protects ratepayers from the risk of price gouging that consumer advocates considered especially egregious.","Dominion still has plenty of legislative maneuvers it can use to strip the amendment from the bill before it gets to the governor’s desk. The House and Senate bills will likely need to be reconciled in conference committee, another opportunity for backroom pressure.","But in a state swimming in Dominion’s generous campaign contributions, every little setback counts.","What’s more, the state’s House Democrats, 16 of them freshmen, have shown their willingness to publicly break with Virginia’s moderate Democratic governor, Ralph Northam. Northam gave the bill its blessing without the amendment, and a spokesman from his office told The Washington Post that the “double dipping” issue had already been resolved.","Democratic House Leader Toscano voted to advance the original legislation out of the Labor and Commerce Committee without the amendment.","But in the past two weeks, he and other lawmakers received an outpouring of feedback from individual constituents and grassroots groups who were infuriated by the double dipping.","Many of the same local progressive groups that materialized spontaneously in the wake of Donald Trump’s election — and helped flip 15 Virginia House seats in November — took the lead in pressuring lawmakers to oppose any bill that allowed the utilities to double-charge.","One such group, Network NOVA, demanded that lawmakers “#KillTheBill” in online appeals for activists to contact their lawmaker.","A widely circulated meme the group shared focused on “double dipping.”","“When Dominion writes the law: we pay twice, they get richer,” the meme said.","Toscano conducted a SurveyMonkey poll of members of his constituent email list and found widespread opposition to the double-dipping provision, even as a majority still favored the bill as a whole.","The freshman Democrats also played a key role in stoking skepticism about the utility monopolies within the caucus. Virtually all of the new House Democrats campaigned against Dominion’s influence. Thirteen House Democrats even signed a pledge promising to refuse donations from Dominion or Appalachian.","The freshman Democrats “were asking very detailed questions about the technical elements of this bill,” Toscano said.","“It’s one thing to campaign and take positions, it’s another thing to try to govern,” he continued. “And when you have to figure out how to govern, you’ve got to look at the nuances of this bill. And that’s what these freshmen were doing.”","During the day on Monday, Toscano whipped the members of his caucus to vote in unison for the amendment to prevent the double dipping.","“This is a new dynamic right now,” the Democratic leader concluded. “It’s a function of some of these new people and in general some of the populism of the time.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a82676f2100003900601045.jpeg?cache=zMq3pZ4bq2&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Despite Trump's Defense Of Aide, Most Americans Say Domestic Violence Allegations Should Be Disqualifying","authors":"Ariel Edwards-Levy","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/despite-trumps-defense-of-aide-most-americans-say-domestic-violence-allegations-should-be-disqualifying_us_5a8227e7e4b01467fcf0856f","short_description":"Concerns about domestic violence are divided across political and gender lines.","date":"2018-02-13"},"articleContent":["Most Americans believe that domestic abusers shouldn’t be allowed to work in politics, a new HuffPost/YouGov poll finds, and those who’ve followed stories about former Trump aide Rob Porter largely say that he wasn’t suited to work in the White House.","Americans of all political stripes have little sympathy for Porter, or for others alleged to have committed domestic violence. But there’s a significant intensity gap between the outrage shown by Hillary Clinton’s voters and that demonstrated by the rest of the country — one that often outpaces the gap along gender lines.","A 64 percent majority of the public says that someone credibly accused of domestic abuse should be disqualified from serving in politics, with just 11 percent saying they should not be. Eighty-four percent of Clinton voters say that facing such allegations should be disqualifying, as do 56 percent of Trump voters, and 58 percent of everyone else polled, including non-voters and those who chose a third-party candidate in 2016.","Two-thirds of Americans say they’ve heard at least a little, and 25 percent say they’ve heard a lot in the news about Porter, who resigned as White House staff secretary after his two ex-wives came forward to say he had physically and verbally abused them. One of the women provided photographs of her injuries. Both said they’d reported their allegations to the FBI during a background check on Porter, who didn’t hold a security clearance.","Of Americans who followed the story at all, 51 percent say the allegations against Porter are credible, and just 5 percent that they’re not; the rest are unsure or say they haven’t heard enough to weigh in. A majority, 63 percent, say the allegations against Porter are disqualifying, with just 14 percent saying they aren’t. And a 43 percent plurality say that President Trump and other White House staffers didn’t react strongly enough to the accusations, with 24 percent saying the reaction was about right, and just 8 percent that the administration reacted too strongly. (Clinton voters were the most likely to say they were following the story, which perhaps helps to explain some of the results.)","The White House, which has struggled to offer a clear timeline of when senior staff found out about the allegations, initially defended Porter after the abuse allegations broke. White House Chief of Staff John Kelly described him in a statement as “a man of true integrity and honor,” before releasing a second statement in which he said he was “shocked” by the allegations and that there “is no place for domestic violence in our society.”","In his first comments on Porter’s resignation, President Trump said “it was very sad” to hear the news about Porter, but that “he says he’s innocent, and I think you have to remember that.”","Among those who’ve followed the story, Clinton voters take the strongest line against Porter and the administration: 82 percent say the accusations against the former staffer are credible, 89 percent that they’re disqualifying, and three-quarters that the White House did not respond strongly enough.","Trump voters, are more tepid in their condemnation, but they aren’t exactly rallying around Porter either. Just 29 percent say the allegations against Porter are credible, but only 5 percent say they are not credible, with the rest declining to offer an opinion. And by a two-to-one margin, 44 percent to 22 percent, they say that Porter shouldn’t be able to hold a job in the Trump administration. Most, however, say they’re comfortable with the way the White House handled the story.","Just over half of all Americans, 51 percent, currently say that President Trump does not respect women, while just 30 percent say that he does. Eighty percent of Trump voters, but just 2 percent of Clinton voters, believe Trump respects women.","There are significant divides over the seriousness of domestic abuse as a national issue. The vast majority of the public, regardless of the gender or whom they voted for, say that it’s at least a somewhat serious problem. But women are 19 points likelier than men to say domestic abuse is a very serious issue, and Democrats are 18 points likelier than Republicans. The gap between Clinton and Trump voters is 36 points, making Clinton voters about twice as likely as Trump voters to say domestic abuse poses a very serious problem.","There are some differences by gender inside each voting bloc, as well. Female Clinton voters are 12 points likelier than male Clinton voters to say domestic abuse is a very serious problem, and female Trump voters are 24 points likelier to say so than are their male counterparts.","Use the widget below to further explore the results of the HuffPost/YouGov survey, using the menu at the top to select survey questions and the buttons at the bottom to filter the data by subgroups:","The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Feb. 9-11 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.","HuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

She didn’t seem like a frontrunner going into the final few episodes, and was probably headed for a rocky breakup, but she got to have it on her own terms ― and leave on her own schedule.","On HuffPost’s “Here to Make Friends,” we discussed all this and more with “Bachelor” and “Bachelor in Paradise” alum Caila Quinn:","Claire Fallon: [Jacqueline] tells him she’s had these moments of doubt and it makes her feel like she’s not the right person to take to hometowns. She’s not confident enough. And he’s sort of trying to persuade her to stay, which surprised me, because I didn’t see her being one of his top ladies.","Emma Gray: No. I think at the end of the day, they both realized from the last date, Arie definitely realized that their lives are incompatible. But what I took from this is that Arie has not been broken up with very much in his life.","Claire: It’s funny because every relationship we know about, really in detail, he has been broken up with ― like the woman who left him, and Emily.","Emma: That’s true. It just still read to me as though this was a foreign feeling to him or that he, like all of us, he likes to have control, and so the minute someone starts to pull away, you’re like “Wait, wait, wait, no.”","Claire: And that’s the thing, with Bekah M. he had the similar realization that it wasn’t going to work out, and then he gave himself some runway to deescalate his feelings for her without saying goodbye at a moment when he would be acutely upset by it. Then by the time he let her go, he was like, “I’ve thought about it, and I’ve distanced myself from you emotionally because it’s not going to work out.” With Jacqueline, she jumped the gun and―","Emma: She didn’t give him the space to make that decision.","Claire: Which, good for her.","Emma: Good for her! I love when women self-eliminate on this show. It’s extremely satisfying.","Caila Quinn: It’s also extremely hard. You think you’re not in control, but you really are, and it’s kind of representative of all women just not knowing that you can be in control of the situation too.","Claire: You can just remove yourself.","Emma: Especially when I assume you have producers in your ear being like, “Why don’t you give this another chance? Maybe this could work out. Maybe this is your person.” That takes a lot of internal strength to just say, “No, I’m going to go home.”","Claire: And you see why producers would do that, because as soon as she leaves, everyone else is like, “Well maybe I have doubts! Maybe I should leave.” It’s kind of infectious; it’s like how everyone gets divorced in a friend group at the same time. It’s not infectious, but also psychologically it really is.","Emma: Also the whole thing just reminded me of Sharleen. Very much. Where it was like, intellectually, she knew that this was never going to work, but she’s like, “I’m still really attracted to you and I want to make out with you.” And that’s real.","Caila: It was well thought-out. I think it was my favorite moment of the episode. And we just haven’t seen a real conversation of someone thinking through their emotions in the same depth. So, kudos to Jacqueline.","Claire: Yeah, it’s not common that someone has the wherewithal to really be like, “I don’t know what my feelings are. I don’t know if they’re related to the process or if they’re related to this guy.” She really thought it all through.","And Arie’s like, “I really like you, I don’t want this to be over. If you have any doubts, come back to me.” Which, like, we’re going into hometowns! What is he going to do if she comes back and is like, “Fantasy suites, I’m back!”","Emma: Then he’ll get to dump her, Claire, and that’ll be more satisfying for him.","Claire: Exactly. That’s really true.","I just feel like Jacqueline can do so much better.","Emma: Yeah. I also think she’s probably physically and mentally exhausted at this point.","Caila: Yeah, she’ll meet some great guy who will put her first. It’ll be fine.","Emma: And she won’t be tempted to move to Scottsdale and give up her schooling!","Claire: This is just always the weirdest part for me, when someone gets eliminated or leaves themselves, with really good reason, and they’re clearly incompatible, and just to see how much they still pedestal that person. She still thinks he’s so perfect and lovable. And I’m like, you’re going to take a month away from this, and you’re going to look back and be like ... him? But you know, the feelings are real in the moment.","Emma: Did you feel that way, Caila? Looking back?","Caila: I was just really sad, but then when you watch it back, you’re like, “Oh my goodness, his connection is so much stronger with other people ― why didn’t I see this in the first place?” And so I think she’ll look back and be really proud of herself.","For the full discussion on Episode 7, check out the full episode:","Subscribe to “Here To Make Friends”: Apple Podcasts / Acast / RadioPublic / Google Play / Stitcher / RSS","Do people love “The Bachelor,” “The Bachelorette” and “Bachelor in Paradise,” or do they love to hate these shows?

It’s about more than just being Olympians. It’s about more than their first Olympic medals, won this past weekend in the team event in PyeongChang. It’s deeper than that. And the emblems of it are matching tattoos.","In fact, it, and the tattoos, stem from missing out on the Olympics. Four years ago, both Rippon and Nagasu were left off the U.S. figure skating team for the 2014 Sochi Games. Nagasu was overlooked despite a third-place finish at the U.S. Championships.","Rippon remembers watching the Sochi Opening Ceremony a month later at Nagasu’s house, and commiserating over In-N-Out burgers. He told Yahoo Sports that story, as well as the one behind the tattoos, on Tuesday ahead of his individual event later this week.","“We sat on the roof,” he recalls. “And we were just kind of talking, we weren’t even watching the Olympics. We were just kind of crying a little bit, and eating [In-N-Out] double-doubles and animal-style fries.","“We were sitting up there, and we were laying back, we looked up at the sky and the stars, and we had a long talk. I remember telling her, ‘I’m so grateful you’re my friend.’”","Rippon says the moment is “still so poignant in my mind.” He says he told Nagasu, “We’ll be able to get through this.”","At some point, Rippon also proposed the idea of the tattoos.","“After everything that we went through four years ago, I said, ‘I want to have a matching tattoo with you,’” he recalls. “You pick what it is, and I’ll get whatever you want.”","Rippon says they joked about getting the Abercrombie moose. But eventually, Nagasu found a glyph – a circle with lines through it – that means “power.”","Rippon got his on his left thigh, just above his kneecap. Nagasu has hers near her wrist. Both are in white ink, as are the rest of Rippon’s tattoos – he says he has “seven or nine.”","“You can hide them pretty well,” Rippon says. “Not everybody can see them.”","But the two Olympic figure skaters, who are rooming together in PyeongChang, know they’re there, and that’s what matters. “It’s something really personal between me and her,” Rippon says. The tattoos strengthen the bond that was built throughout years of skating – and on Nagasu’s roof.","“There’s been a lot of ups and downs since then,” Rippon says. “To be here now, especially with her of all people, is crazy.","“So if you’re ever depressed,” Rippon concludes with a smile, “go to In-N-Out, and four years later, you can be at the Olympics.”","This story was originally published on Yahoo News.","More from Yahoo Sports:\n• Wetzel: Rippon, Zhou are emblematic of melting pot U.S. figure skating team\n• Olympic champion takes out media members during crash\n• Wetzel: Married figure skaters bring Valentine’s Day to the Olympics"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a82e3f62100005000601107.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Congressional Candidate Recounts Childhood Abuse In Powerful Campaign Ad","authors":"Amanda Terkel","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sol-flores-ad_us_5a830347e4b00ecc923eac16","short_description":"\"I didn't tell anyone that a man living with us would come into my bedroom when I was asleep and lift my nightgown.\"","date":"2018-02-13"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"COMEDY","headline":"Jimmy Kimmel's Winter Olympics Look Nothing Like NBC's","authors":"Ron Dicker","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jimmy-kimmel-winter-olympics_us_5a82f037e4b0892a03533a00","short_description":"At least she stuck the landing.","date":"2018-02-13"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Omarosa Dishes On Mike Pence: 'He Thinks Jesus Tells Him To Say Things'","authors":"Lee Moran","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/omarosa-big-brother-mike-pence-donald-trump_us_5a829f71e4b01467fcf0ebd0","short_description":"\"We would be begging for the days of Trump back if Pence became president.\"","date":"2018-02-13"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"SPORTS","headline":"U.S. Luger Emily Sweeney Wipes Out In Dramatic Olympics Crash","authors":"Nina Golgowski","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/luge-emily-sweeney-crash_us_5a82df99e4b01467fcf17f22","short_description":"The athlete was reportedly taken to a hospital for evaluation.","date":"2018-02-13"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Porter’s First Wife Dismisses Belief That Only Weak Women Are In Abusive Relationships","authors":"Alanna Vagianos","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/porters-first-wife-dismisses-belief-that-only-weak-women-are-in-abusive-relationships_us_5a82ebe9e4b0892a035333b3","short_description":"Kellyanne Conway said she's not worried about Porter's current girlfriend, White House communications director Hope Hicks, because she's \"so strong.\"","date":"2018-02-13"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Chrissy Teigen Politely Explains Why Tweet About Mirai Nagasu Was Insensitive","authors":"Kimberly Yam","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chrissy-teigen-bari-weiss-mirai-nagasu_us_5a830bbbe4b00ecc923ed36d","short_description":"New York Times writer Bari Weiss had tweeted a video of the Olympian accompanied by the caption: \"Immigrants: They Get The Job Done.\"","date":"2018-02-13"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"WORLD NEWS","headline":"Australia Marks 10 Years Since Apology To Indigenous Peoples","authors":"Eoin Blackwell","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/australia-marks-10-years-since-apology-to-indigenous-peoples_us_5a822574e4b00ecc923d4af2","short_description":"But has much changed?","date":"2018-02-13"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"SPORTS","headline":"Tongan Flag-Bearer Is Worried Sick At Winter Olympics","authors":"Ron Dicker","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/shirtless-tongan-flag-bearer-is-worried-sick-at-winter-olympics_us_5a8308bbe4b01467fcf20918","short_description":"Pita Taufatofua hasn't heard from his family after a tropical cyclone smashed his homeland.","date":"2018-02-13"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"All 50 State AGs Demand An End To 'Culture Of Silence' Surrounding Sexual Harassment","authors":"Emily Peck","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/attorneys-general-forced-arbitration_us_5a83484fe4b0cf06751f5abe","short_description":"It’s the first time in a decade state attorneys general have taken action together on an issue. Much of the credit goes to the Me Too movement.","date":"2018-02-13"},"articleContent":["During a time of rabid partisanship, somehow the Me Too movement has managed to bring together Democrats and Republicans (at least the ones outside the White House).","On Monday, every single state attorney general ― a majority of whom are Republican ― signed a letter to congressional leaders demanding that sexual harassment victims get their day in court.","The attorneys general want Congress to end the practice of forcing sexual harassment cases into mandatory arbitration, secret private courtrooms outside the public justice system. Companies favor arbitration because it’s cheaper ― victims typically don’t get much money ― and even more appealing, arbitration allows corporations to keep embarrassing cases secret.","“Ending mandatory arbitration of sexual harassment claims would help to put a stop to the culture of silence that protects perpetrators at the cost of their victims,” the letter says.","The veil of secrecy that often surrounds harassment claims keeps victims isolated ― unaware that someone else has already gone through a similar experience and unable to fight together, the letter notes. It serves the public interest to bring these claims out into the open.","The letter marks the first time in a decade that all state attorneys general have taken an action like this, according to a press release from Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, a Republican who until now was best-known for a controversy over a political donation from President Donald Trump and was last on the national stage at the Republican National Convention. She is leading this effort with North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein, a Democrat.","Stein told HuffPost that the growth of the Me Too movement has caused Republicans and Democrats to take a fresh look at the issue.","“There’s been a much greater understanding about how deep-seated and widespread sex harassment is,” he told HuffPost Tuesday. “The Me Too movement and all the attendant media coverage has really underscored just how grave this situation is in America’s workplaces.”","The idea to write to Congress, which is presently considering bipartisan legislation on the issue, came from one of his staffers, Stein said. Most state attorneys general signed on to the idea pretty quickly. He and Bondi worked together to wrangle the few who didn’t immediately respond.","The letter managed to shock advocates who have been fighting against forced arbitration.","“This represents an important turning point,” said Cliff Palefsky, an employment and civil rights lawyer in California who has been a leading advocate against the practice of forced arbitration since the late 1980s. The fact that Republicans have signed on to this letter is momentous, he said, as historically they’ve supported arbitration and blocked legislation on the issue.","“I hope the leaders of Congress recognize that there’s a wave coming and they should step up and do the right thing,” he said.","The bipartisan push is a direct outgrowth of the Me Too movement, a seemingly unending wave of credible sexual misconduct allegations against some of the most powerful political and business leaders in the country. Arbitration agreements and confidentiality clauses helped protect many of these men, perhaps most notably Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, who has been accused by dozens of women for behavior dating back decades.","Former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson succeeded in getting around the arbitration clause in her employment contract with Fox News when she took the extraordinary step of suing the company’s former chairman, Roger Ailes, directly in court.","Getting her case out into the light in 2016 was crucial in exposing Ailes, and ultimately resulted in his ouster from the company he co-founded. The reverberations around Carlson’s move also led to the ouster of Fox superstar Bill O’Reilly.","The suit turned Carlson into one of the leading proponents to end forced arbitration. In December, she helped senators from both parties introduce legislation in Congress that would end the practice in sexual harassment cases.","“Ending arbitration in these cases is the first step to give women and men the voice they deserve,” Carlson told HuffPost on Tuesday. “Harassment and retaliation at work is an apolitical issue — an issue that affects us all — an issue we should all care about — for our mothers, sisters, aunts, grandmothers and most of all our children. The myths and secrecy surrounding this serious issue must stop.”","It’s notable that the letter ― and legislation ― only addresses forced arbitration in sexual harassment cases. Cases involving racial discrimination, wage disputes and other employment issues would still wind up litigated in private. Even consumers are subject to mandatory arbitration if they have a dispute with a company after buying a product or using a service.","About 55 percent of private sector employees are subject to mandatory arbitration, according to a study released last year by the progressive Economic Policy Institute. That translates to 60.1 million workers, according to the data. Companies also use arbitration clauses to prevent employees from joining together in class action suits. That means if a group of female employees were all harassed by the same man, they would each have to sue the company individually. That’s a huge disadvantage to such women, already far less empowered than the company they’re fighting.","That’s what happened to four women suing the beverage company Monster Energy over harassment and other claims. All are fighting their cases separately in arbitration ― even though two of the cases involve misconduct by the same man.","“It’s unfair,” said Mary Frances “Fran” Pulizzi, who sued Monster for discrimination last year. The 43-year-old, who worked in business development for the company, said it’s been difficult to find a lawyer. Many have told her they can’t afford to take on arbitration cases, where plaintiffs typically don’t win large payouts. She’s also anxious about the limited amount of time she’ll have to present her case. In a public court she’d be able to submit more evidence.","“I have stacks of emails and documents that show patterns that prove what I’m saying happened, really happened,” she said. “I have to comb through and find the best pieces, I guess. I hope that it’s enough.”","Pulizzi remembers being presented with the arbitration agreement before she was hired by the company. At the time, she didn’t imagine she’d ever sue her employer.","“I wish I’d never signed it,” she said."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a83489c2000003900eaec4d.jpeg?cache=u96xBtfQm6&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"John Oliver Is Surprised Dustin Hoffman Didn't Expect Harassment Questions","authors":"Bill Bradley","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-oliver-dustin-hoffman-sexual-harassment-questions_us_5a827a7de4b00ecc923d869f","short_description":"The \"Last Week Tonight\" host talks about his heated exchange with Hoffman over sexual harassment allegations.","date":"2018-02-13"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Legendary Crooner Vic Damone Dead At 89","authors":"","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/vic-damon-dead-legendary-crooner_us_5a829371e4b01467fcf0d914","short_description":"He was once described by Frank Sinatra as having \"the best pipes in the business.\"","date":"2018-02-13"},"articleContent":["LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - U.S. singer Vic Damone, a crooner who found fame in the 1940s and 1950s, has died at the age of 89, his family said on Monday.","Damone, known for hits like “I Have But One Heart” and “You Do,” died in Miami Beach, Florida on Sunday surrounded by relatives, his family said in a statement.","Damone appeared in television shows and movies in the 1960s and also had hits with “An Affair to Remember” and “On the Street Where You Live.”","New York-born Damone was the son of an Italian-American electrician and was inspired to launch a singing career by Frank Sinatra, with whom he later became friends.","Damone was also a personal friend of U.S. President Donald Trump, the family said.","In 1962, he hosted his own television variety show “The Vic Damone Show” on NBC, after appearing in movie musicals “Hit the Deck” and “Kismet” in the 1950s.","In 1971, Damone began performing in Las Vegas casinos, and in 1972 he was offered the role of singer Johnny Fontane in “The Godfather” movie but turned it down.

His desire was so strong that in 2016, as the Times put it, Rippon was “subsisting mostly on a daily diet of three slices of whole grain bread topped with miserly pats of the spread I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter.” Those “meals” would be supplemented with three cups of coffee, each sweetened with six packs of Splenda.","Rippon, who landed two triple axels in his routine on Monday and earned a bronze medal in the figure skating team competition, said those sort of eating habits are likely what led to his breaking his left foot while hopping to warm up his legs last year.

Yet according to the National Eating Disorders Association, 10 million American men will at some point struggle with a clinically significant eating disorder.","As the Times notes, even though eating disorders “are not discriminatory,” the silence among men is rooted in the cultural aspect of what it means to admit you have a problematic relationship with your body and food,","“Males are supposed to be stronger and not need psychological assistance,” Ron A.

Bush and Bill Clinton, where he built a reputation as the skillful operator the White House needs to execute on its deregulatory agenda.","But during his time as a counsel to the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, he was accused of abusing his power to target his opponents, which raises concerns for some about how he’d run an increasingly political agency. The same committee voted along party lines last week to advance his nomination to the full Senate for confirmation as the next-in-line to lead the EPA.","In January 2005, the Senate panel convened a hearing to discuss the Clear Skies Act, a bill Wheeler’s former boss Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.) sponsored in 2003. The legislation rewrote federal air pollution rules under the Clean Air Act to reduce power plant emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and mercury, while allowing planet-warming pollution like carbon dioxide to continue unabated.","At the hearing, John Paul, a regional air pollution officer from Dayton, Ohio, who spoke as a representative of the Association of Local Air Pollution Control Officials and its sister group, State and Territorial Air Pollution Program Administrators, testified that the bill was “simply not protective enough” and was “far too lenient” on polluters.","In response, Inhofe took the unusual step of asking the groups to turn over six years of IRS filings and all records of grants they received from the EPA. Wheeler took ownership of the demands in a March 1, 2005 interview with E&E News. But he denied that the requests were politically motivated.","“STAPPA receives apparently ... most if not all of their funding from the U.S. taxpayers,” Wheeler said. “That is part of our legitimate oversight activities on grant oversight. It has nothing at all to do with Clear Skies.”","But Bill Becker, who served as STAPPA’s executive director for 37 years before retiring in June, said the tax probe broke with ordinary protocol for requesting filings and “was meant for no other purpose than to intimidate and retaliate for positions ... against their bill.”","“It was merely a fact-finding witch hunt against our association, with the hope that they could find something and use that against us to temper what we said,” Becker told HuffPost by phone Monday. “They treated us at the time in a mean-spirited, political way for merely questioning a policy.”","The groups complied with the request, and Becker said nothing more came of it. But the existence of the Senate probe marked the associations in Washington, leaving some wondering whether the groups had done anything suspicious to warrant the investigation, Becker said.","“He got nothing, but he left the impression that somehow our association was being accused of doing something that we didn’t do, and others saw that,” he said. “So we went through a period where it was uncomfortable.”","Environmentalists and Democrats opposed the Orwellian-named “Clear Skies” bill, but the nonpartisan associations’ criticism carried particular weight because state regulators were the ones tasked with actually implementing the legislation.","“We could home in on the details and quickly discover if something would really weaken the Clean Air Act, so that testimony was really important,” said Becker. “Sen. Inhofe and his staff, including Andy [Wheeler], knew this and I think wanted to intimidate us or undermine what we were saying.”","The EPA declined HuffPost’s request to interview Wheeler, but defended his qualifications in an emailed statement.","“Andrew Wheeler has spent his entire career working to improve environmental outcomes, including many years on Capitol Hill and at EPA’s Office of Pollution and Prevention and Toxics during the George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton administrations,” Liz Bowman, EPA spokeswoman, wrote in the email. “We look forward to having him back at EPA.”","Faegre Baker Daniels, the law firm where Wheeler currently works, did not respond to an interview request.","Chris Miller, a former Democratic aide who worked on the Senate committee at the same time as Wheeler, said Inhofe frequently made decisions or requests that seemed like political plays, but the STAPPA probe stood out.","“Nothing rose to the level of what the STAPPA extra scrutiny was,” Miller, who now works at the lobbying firm AJW, told HuffPost. “The states were more allied with the public health side than the industry side, and Sen. Inhofe didn’t like that.”","Becker said STAPPA tried to avoid a partisan fight over the tax probe, noting that its president was a Republican who had twice voted for then-President George W. Bush.","“It wasn’t as if we were an association that leaned Democrat,” he said. “We were far right of the [Natural Resources Defense Council] and [Environmental Defense Fund] and environmental groups, but we were left of a conservative EPA and some of the elected officials.”","Still, Becker at the time told a reporter friend about the incident when he called looking for news tips, and in mid-February of 2005, Cox News Service published a wire story. Days later, The New York Times picked up the story. In March, the Baltimore Sun published an editorial lambasting Inhofe for “auditing the messenger” in what “looked for all the world like bullying.”","Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a government accountability and transparency watchdog, said the 13-year-old tax probe “raises serious concerns as to Wheeler’s judgement.”","“An investigation into policy opponents, if in an attempt to intimidate them, raises questions of abuse of power and government resources,” Jordan Libowitz, the group’s communications director, told HuffPost by email.","Yet the incident didn’t come up during Wheeler’s initial confirmation hearing in November. Instead, Republicans recalled chummy anecdotes of his time working for Inhofe and at the EPA. (Republicans steamrolled calls from the Sierra Club last week to postpone the confirmation vote after The Intercept published a report detailing fundraisers Wheeler held for Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) and Inhofe in May.)","Democrats hammered Wheeler for lobbying ties he had to coal magnate Bob Murray until late last year. The bombastic chief of Murray Energy has wielded unprecedented influence over the Trump administration, providing the White House with an “action plan” that called for a federal bailout of coal-fired plants, repeal of the Clean Power Plan and a challenge to the 2009 EPA “endangerment finding” that determined carbon dioxide pollution poses a risk to public health.","Despite mincing words over whether he believes humans are causing climate change, Wheeler escaped the intense scrutiny put on Kathleen Hartnett-White, the Council on Environmental Quality nominee whose failure to answer basic science questions captured Democrats’ attention. While Hartnett-White stammered and struggled to defend her record of taking extreme stances against environmental regulation, Wheeler remained calm, spoke in polished legalese and projected a familiar Beltway aesthetic.","That seemed to put Democrats at ease. The party raised ire over Hartnett-White ― who credited coal with abolishing slavery and said carbon dioxide emissions were good for the planet ― and Michael Dourson, the EPA’s chemical safety division nominee whose research firm was described in 2014 by InsideClimate News as the “one-stop science shop” for chemical and tobacco industries seeking friendly conclusions. Both withdrew their nominations as support waned.","But no Democrats raised concerns over Wheeler when EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt testified last month before the Senate for the first time since taking office. Still, no Democrats voted to advance Wheeler’s nomination last week, though Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) ― who tend to vote with Republicans on fossil fuel issues ― could guarantee an already-likely confirmation in the full Senate. Jonathan Kott, a spokesman for Manchin, said the senator hadn’t decided on whether to vote for Wheeler yet. A spokeswoman for Heitkamp did not respond to a request for comment.","In a statement, a spokeswoman for Inhofe denied that the probe was politically motivated or connected to the Clear Skies bill.","“Sen. Inhofe’s investigation into STAPPA was a part of a broad investigation into EPA’s grant management process,” Leacy Burke, the spokeswoman, wrote in an email to HuffPost.","Mike Danylak, a spokesman for the Republican majority on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, declined to comment on the STAPPA probe.","A Senate vote on Wheeler’s confirmation is not yet scheduled. But if, and more likely when, he is confirmed, he could be mere months or years away from becoming the nation’s top environmental regulator. EPA administrators under Republican presidents have tended to leave office early over the past three decades. When Inhofe, 83, retires, Pruitt is said to be considering a bid for his seat, or a run for governor of Oklahoma. He is also eyeing the job of attorney general if Jeff Sessions steps down, according to Politico. In that case, Wheeler would become the EPA’s acting administrator.","“I am astonished there hasn’t been louder objection to his nomination from more progressive voices on Capitol Hill,” Frank O’Donnell, president of the environmental group Clean Air Watch, told HuffPost.","“Wheeler acted like a real bully in his dealings with the state and local agencies,” he added. “To me, that was an abuse of power, and it makes me concerned about what he might do with even more power at the EPA. If you cross him, would he take retribution?”","This story was updated to include a statement from Inhofe spokeswoman Leacy Burke."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8334e42000003900eaec23.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"SPORTS","headline":"Olympic Snowboarder Protests Meek Mill's Imprisonment In Unusual Way","authors":"Ron Dicker","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/olympic-snowboarder-meek-mill_us_5a82dcdee4b00ecc923e3d73","short_description":"Tit Stante got the message out during the men's halfpipe.","date":"2018-02-13"},"articleContent":["A Slovenian snowboarder has imprisoned musician Meek Mill’s back.","With TV cameras trained on Tit Stante during halfpipe qualifying at the Winter Olympics on Tuesday, the athlete showed off his board with the words ”#FreeMeekMill” on it.","Rap artist Mill has received support from celebrities calling for a pardon after he was sentenced in November to two to four years in Pennsylvania state prison for probation violations.

Nothing came out. She sighed. It wasn’t anything new — this happens every year around this time.","“Every winter, the water goes off,” she said. “For days. Then you have to boil it for days.”","Brashear’s water was out for eight days, which she said pales in comparison to her neighbors up the mountain who had none for nearly a month. The county government handed out bottled water, which she saved — her family doesn’t drink the tap water anyway because of its sulfur-like taste — and she hiked up a coal bank nearby to carry five-gallon buckets of clean creek water to fill the toilet and brush her teeth.","“People were calling the county every day,” she said. “When I called, I asked them how long it would be. They’d say, ‘No ma’am, no idea, might be tomorrow.’”","Viper is an unincorporated community — an area without its own municipal government — a few miles up the road from Hazard in Perry County, an Appalachian coal mining community with a 30 percent poverty rate. The water is sourced from the nearby Kentucky River and controlled by Hazard Utilities, though many people still use well water because they say the utility’s water is unreliable. When freezing temperatures slammed the Southeast earlier this winter, the utility reported that major waterline breaks and a water shortage from some of its 9,000 customers letting their faucets run (done to prevent pipes from freezing) caused the shutoffs.","The crumbling infrastructure here is just a snapshot of the larger water crisis in the U.S. In 2017, the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) gave the U.S. a “D” in drinking water infrastructure. According to ASCE, the U.S. loses about 6 billion gallons of treated water everyday, making it a $1 trillion problem to fix.","“It’s in pretty tough shape,” said Greg DiLoreto, a retired water utility executive and chair of ASCE’s infrastructure committee. “It has a huge effect on our economy, and puts a big burden on small and rural communities.”","In Appalachia, as the coal industry has waned, the money that local governments receive from coal severance tax funds (a fee on the amount of coal extracted) — which helped pay for utility and other infrastructure upgrades — has drastically decreased. And as the water shuts off or runs out more frequently, with little communication to customers, it has huge ripple effects on communities: businesses have to shut down, workers get sent home and lose wages, and schools close. American families lose $3,400 a year because of poor infrastructure, DiLoreto said, thanks to lost wages or expenses like buying bottled water or fixing their cars because of potholes.","“Mostly, I think folks don’t really know what to do,” said Ivy Brashear, Pam’s daughter and the Appalachian Transition Coordinator at Mountain Association for Community Economic Development. “Inevitably [the county] will be able to put small patches on what the problem was, but obviously that’s literally just putting a Band-Aid on a broken system.”","There are large-scale solutions to address these types of basic infrastructure problems. In January, a Kentucky lawmaker introduced a bill to combine some eastern Kentucky counties so they can better pool resources. Perry County recently hired a full-time grant writer to find more funding for economic development initiatives, especially those that use abandoned mine land or Appalachian Regional Commission funds.","Some utilities in cities like Milwaukee and Washington, D.C., are selling biosolids from wastewater treatment to fund water infrastructure improvements; in other places, private water companies are buying out smaller, struggling public water companies.","Instead of waiting for these expensive, long-term changes, however, residents in Appalachia and elsewhere are taking matters into their own hands. In Martin County, Kentucky, which has its own failing water district that shut off water to residents this year, residents have started a Facebook group called Martin County Water Warriors to draw attention to the issue and share resources. In Marion, North Carolina, activists have hosted community forums that bring together city government officials, local residents, organizations and other stakeholders to strategize how to build better infrastructure. In Jackson, Mississippi, and Knoxville, Tennessee, residents are organizing to get community leaders to run for city council or public service commissions.","The key to finding solutions is to look at infrastructure and development more holistically, said DiLoreto. “It’s all connected,” he said. “Wastewater treatment is typically the largest user of electricity in a community, so if the electric grid goes down, the wastewater treatment doesn’t work. It goes into the stream, polluting [drinking] water sources.”","Smarter electric grids and more widespread broadband networks can help solve these types of problems, said Christopher Mitchell, director of the Community Broadband Networks initiative at the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, which works with electric cooperatives to expand internet access and introduce programs that make it easier for outages to be monitored and repaired, or introduce energy efficiency programs.","That could make a huge difference in places like Perry County, which has seen the state utility, Kentucky Power, try to raise rates by 9 percent. The state’s public service commission is working to decrease the rate by 4 percent; some customers say they are paying anywhere from $600 to $1,000 per month for electricity. “Now that we have the water back, I’m working with a group on electricity,” Pam Brashear said.","Expanded internet access could also create more opportunities for work in rural areas. Jackson County, Kentucky, for instance, has a fiber-optic network that has “enabled job creation because people can work from home,” he said.","Getting these types of projects started is often the biggest challenge, but it’s what will lead to economic transitions in rural communities, said Elizabeth Wright, education coordinator for the Highlander Center in Tennessee. She works on the Appalachian Transition Fellowship, which partners community leaders with host communities so they can create solutions from the ground up. Past programs have focused on renewable energy development, abandoned mine land development, environmental testing or community education, while others are interested in infrastructure.","“Appalachia has historically been a region that people have come in and extracted from natural resources, and from experiences and culture here, so there’s a history of exploitation and forcing dependence on people with one major industry,” Wright said. “There’s a monopoly on people’s ability to take care of themselves and take care of their families.”","But that’s changing, she said. “People who live here know better, and I think they’re getting creative and are excited about this opportunity that now exists. There are hardships along with that, but these conversations are really happening.”","For more content and to be part of the ‘This New World’ community, join our Facebook Group.\n\nHuffPost’s ‘This New World’ series is funded by Partners for a New Economy and the Kendeda Fund.

Rebuilding Iraq after three years of war with Islamic State will cost $88.2 billion, with housing a particularly urgent priority, Iraqi officials told an international conference on Monday.","Donors and investors have gathered in Kuwait this week to discuss efforts to rebuild Iraq’s economy and infrastructure as it emerges from a devastating conflict with the hardline militants who seized almost a third of the country.","Iraq declared victory over Islamic State in December, having taken back all the territory captured by the militants in 2014 and 2015.","About $22 billion will be required in the short term and another $66 billion in the medium term, the director-general of the country’s planning ministry, Qusay Adulfattah, told the conference, without indicating any timeframe.","“Rebuilding Iraq is restoring hope to Iraq, and restoring the stability of Iraq is stabilizing the states of the region and the world,” said Planning Minister Salman al-Jumaili, adding that the reconstruction was therefore also the responsibility of the international community.","The United States, which leads an international coalition that provided Iraq with key air support in the fight against Islamic State, does not plan to pledge any money at the Kuwait conference, U.S. officials said.","Nations could help by acting as guarantors with lenders, allowing Iraq to take out soft loans to fund infrastructure projects, Mahdi al-Alaq, the Secretary-General of Iraq’s Council of Ministers, told the conference, adding that there were preliminary indications that some states would do so.","The housing sector has the most urgent need for funds, said Raja Rehan Arshad, the lead disaster risk management specialist for the World Bank.","Around 138,000 housing units had been damaged and half of them were completely destroyed, said Mustafa al-Hiti, who runs Iraq’s Reconstruction Fund for Areas Affected by Terroristic Operations.","About 2.5 million Iraqis remain displaced by the fighting, he added.","Iraq has been plagued by violence over the past 15 years.","A U.S.-led invasion toppled Saddam Hussein and was followed by years of insurgency, sectarian bloodletting between Sunnis and Shi’ites, as well as ethnic tensions between the Arabs and Kurds, all before Islamic State emerged in 2014."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a816e0f2100003900600edb.jpeg?cache=PGdyqkBMf6&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"WORLD NEWS","headline":"London Airport Shuts Down After World War Two Bomb Found In Thames River","authors":"","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/london-airport-world-war-two-bomb_us_5a8178b5e4b0c6726e152eae","short_description":"It weighs more than 1,000 lbs.","date":"2018-02-12"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"SPORTS","headline":"Figure Skater Mirai Nagasu Becomes First U.S. Woman To Land Triple Axel At Olympics","authors":"Dominique Mosbergen","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mirai-nagasu-triple-axel-olympics_us_5a8102d8e4b0c6726e14b9e4","short_description":"Nailed it!","date":"2018-02-12"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Here's Why Parents Are Boycotting The New 'Peter Rabbit' Movie","authors":"Cole Delbyck","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/parents-boycotting-peter-rabbit-movie_us_5a81ef3fe4b0d4a3d10c1dcc","short_description":"Moviegoers have slammed the film for mocking the seriousness of food allergies.","date":"2018-02-12"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"QUEER VOICES","headline":"‘RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars 3’ Episode 3 Recap: Who Won The Bitchelor's Heart?","authors":"INTO, Editorial Partner","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rupauls-drag-race-all-stars-3-episode-3-recap-who_us_5a7de88be4b0a0f48092eb68","short_description":"Good riddance to bad attitude.","date":"2018-02-12"},"articleContent":["by Kevin O’Keeffe","Good riddance to bad attitude.","I don’t want to spend much time in this recap talking about Milk, mostly because I said a lot of what I feel about her in last week’s RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars season three recap. And in fact, the other queens sum it up well this week: She’s talented, but incredibly deluded when it comes to her All Stars performance.","However, Milk is a disaster in the improv comedy challenge this week — a parody of “The Bachelor” called, appropriately, “The Bitchelor” — ignoring the challenge’s directions to not talk over her partner, thus doing Trixie Mattel a disservice by hogging all their time together. She probably costs Trixie the win this week, a fact Trixie and the other queens know well. And instead of owning her mistakes, she whines that she’s better than the other bottom three queens.","It’s a big miss for Big and Milky, as the whole season has been.","Drag Race is not the right place for Milk’s skills. I’m excited to see what she does next, particularly since she’s been taking a more activist role in her social media presence as of late. But whether it was the editing, her own ego, or a mix of the two, Milk did not come off well this season. It’s a mixed blessing to go home, but a blessing most surely.","So let’s instead talk about the other seven queens, and considering we haven’t done it yet this season, let’s do it as a power ranking. (Since she’s been eliminated, we won’t include Milk; for the record, she’d have been last.) On a scored average of runway — category is: wig reveals! — and challenge performance, here’s where the remaining seven All Stars stand this week.","7. Bebe Zahara Benet","Runway: 6 Challenge: 3 Overall: 4.5","Well, this isn’t going to make the “Bebe is a mole” conspiracy theorists any less suspicious. Bebe is way out of her depth this week. She plays her assigned role for “The Bitchelor” — a virgin — with an interesting twist. She’s an African princess, and her virginity is sacred, only to be given to her eventual husband. Unfortunately, that pretty good premise doesn’t go much of anywhere, and she doesn’t have many real jokes. Additionally, her Asian-inspired runway look is just solid in a sea of spectacle. She easily deserved bottom three this week.","6. Chi Chi DeVayne","Runway: 8Challenge: 3Overall: 5.5","Chi Chi is pretty defeated this week after the judges knock her for what she’s well aware is a bad challenge performance. She didn’t get much of a prompt for her character beyond “is into the Bitchelor” — which, yes, all the contestants are — and “is polyamorous.” Unfortunately, Shangela gets all the good beats of their duo (admittedly not many good beats), and an ambitious, sensual runway look isn’t enough to keep her out of the bottom. I hope her spirits pick up soon; she was my favorite pre-season, and I hate to see her spirit broken.","5. Shangela","Runway: 7 Challenge: 5 Overall: 6","This is about as safe as safe performances get. Her corn runway, complete with popcorn wig reveal, is fun, and her jokes as an uptight, bisexual dom in “The Bitchelor” mostly land. But coming off her Mariah Carey, it’s something of a letdown. My instinct is Shangela wanted to keep a relatively low profile this week, but we’ll see.","4. Aja","Runway: 10Challenge: 4Overall: 7","It is such a bummer that Aja’s Needy Girl misses the mark for the judges. Quite frankly, I’m with her — I thought her definition of needy was totally fine. But her performance of even that definition was somewhat lacking. On the other hand, her runway was astonishing, the perfect execution of her new, “kawaii” (as she calls it) aesthetic. Not only did she have a wig underneath a wig headpiece, she had another wig on underneath! There were a couple of triple wig reveals on the runway, but none as strong as this.","I also have to give Aja props for basically acting like there was no way she was going home during deliberations. Because really, there wasn’t. She knew she was fine. And good for her! No need to break a sweat over nothing.","3. Trixie Mattel","Runway: 8Challenge: 7Overall: 7.5","What’s going on here? Yeah, Trixie kinda got fucked up by Milk this week, and still managed a solid third-place spot (both on the show and in our ranking) by playing the Fake Bitch with aplomb. (I wish her voice was a little separate from her typical Trixie voice, but her gags with her cell phone are still good.) Her runway is a psychedelic dream, and easily the best thing she’s worn on Drag Race.","And yet so far, what seemed during pre-season to be a Trixie coronation season is proving to be anything but. She’s the queen of safe, and this week, she can’t even win an improv comedy challenge — her specialty! Trixie has until Snatch Game to get it together because if she can’t win that one, she’s got no hope at the crown.","2. BenDeLaCreme","Runway: 7 Challenge: 9 Overall: 8","Increasingly, I wish RuPaul would’ve held off and given Ben’s win from the first week to Shangela or Kennedy instead. That variety show win was somewhat dubious; her dynamo Julie Andrews last week and incredible cougar character this week (who enters “The Bitchelor” crotch-first) are clear home runs. But it’s tempting to get frustrated with Ben’s win in this challenge because it feels like she can do no wrong in Ru’s eyes.","Frankly, though, Ben’s not really doing anything wrong. She’s operating on a completely different level than she was in season six of the flagship show. Her fidelity to her character this week is unreal — she actually chews a banana, spits it out, then eats it again. And then makes a joke about it that lands perfectly!","Whereas her competitors are thinking about the game as it happens, Ben is thinking three or four steps ahead. That makes her better at the challenges than it does the runway (where she’s still doing OK, if not being outshone), but luckily for her, All Stars is much more about the performance challenges than it is the runways.","Does it matter that she lost the lip sync this week? Not really. She’s won every challenge of the season. She’s set for as long as she can keep this up.","1. Kennedy Davenport","Runway: 8 Challenge: 10 Overall: 9","Flawless victory. This was incredible work from Kennedy, both on the runway — which, I agree with Michelle Visage, was pure Davenport in all its pageant glory — and in the main challenge. Kennedy is one of a handful of pageant queens to really show their comedy chops on “Drag Race,” alongside girls like Alyssa Edwards and Trinity Taylor. Her character, a hard-living party girl with bad teeth and a big ass, is a gonzo characterization like Alyssa is able to create, but pairs that with sharp timing like Trinity’s. She commits to every stunt and fall completely.","Ross Mathews questions why he doesn’t think of Kennedy as a comedy queen, considering she won Snatch Game in her season (with a top-10 all-time performance as Little Richard). I admit, I forget how funny she is too. Part of the issue is that Kennedy takes drag very seriously; her negative reaction to both Thorgy Thor’s crude mirror message to Shangela and Milk’s defense of said message is an extension of that seriousness. Drag is not just a hobby or an artistic interest for her. Drag is Kennedy’s life and work. But that severity of purpose, in a weird way, makes her a great comedy queen. She conceptualizes a character, delivers it full-force, and shocks the hell out of everyone. Hers is a deserved win and makes this episode a great showcase for one of Drag Race’s most underrated queens.","A few short thoughts, plus a longer coda:","The lip sync this week is to “Green Light” by Lorde, a song I’ve hoped this show would do since it came out. Oddly enough, Ben and Kennedy both opt for a slower burn treatment, Ben saying she can’t camp it up a third week in a row. While I admire her instincts, I think she needed to go bigger here; she looks a little awkward, neither fierce nor controlled. Kennedy, meanwhile, earns major points for subverting the expectation that she’d flip all over the place, instead, drawing a ton of attention to her lips and eyes. It’s not quite Latrice Royale’s “Natural Woman,” but it’s commanding.\nHighly annoyed that the judging suddenly shifted back to having a bottom three this week. Stay consistent, Mama Ru. (Did love, however, that when Bebe called it the gag of the season, and Aja said that it happened last season, Bebe responded with, “Well, to me, this is a gag.”)\nDespite All Stars season three not being the Trixie steamroll I thought it’d be, I did fully cackle at her descriptions of her shorter second wig as “Tatianna Same Parts,” “Dennis the Menace,” and “Naomi Smalls.”\n“Have you ever taken out a catheter?” Ben had me howling in the challenge. I’m rapidly warming up to her, though I think her playing characters other than the “BenDeLaCreme” character for the last two weeks has helped.\nGood for Bebe, mixing it up with the other girls during deliberations! Her blunt honesty about Milk’s performance, paired with her general distaste for the “sugar coat, cool cool cool, woo woo woo woo woo” atmosphere among the girls, is a new look for her. She even gets shady in her confessional about Milk’s delusion: “That performance? I mean, how can you not tell?” Keep them in line, mother.\nConstance Zimmer and Jeffrey Bowyer-Chapman were terrific guest judges, as game to have fun as they were constructive in their critiques. I cheered when Constance helped coach Chi Chi through her runway breakdown. Special plaudits to Jeffrey for playing the part of the Bitchelor so gamely.\nI feel bad about how hard I laughed at Shangela’s “Somebody put something in her cocktail — Cosby?” joke.","Finally, a note on the last episode: There’s been discussion online (and even obliquely during this week’s opening) about whether “Drag Race” favored certain contestants in the VH1 “Divas Live” challenge. My answer to that: Of course it did. You could take one look at the parts divided up (as Thorgy did) and notice how tilted the challenge was. Shangela got a comedy routine as Mariah Carey (which she executed perfectly), while Thorgy got a tricky character and not many jokes as Stevie Nicks. The same thing happened with Alyssa Edwards’ Annie Oakley and Katya’s Princess Diana, respectively, in “All Stars” season two’s Herstory of the World Challenge.","I’m less interested in calling out obvious manipulations and more interested in how contestants fight back against these limitations. Reality competitions are never a 100 percent even playing field; the best contestants know how to play against disadvantages to create their own success. Violet Chachki saw a villain edit coming in season seven, and challenges that favored her rival, Ginger Minj. But she figured out a way to beat both the edit and Ginger, and she won the crown.","So I empathize with Thorgy, who knew the bus was coming her way, but she got too far in her own head to beat the odds. “Drag Race” isn’t just a reality show; it’s a mind game that consistently rewards the cleverest queens who aren’t just great at drag, but understand the inner machinations of the show itself.","For that reason, even though Ben is the strongest competitor so far, I’m still betting on Shangela or Trixie to take the crown home this time. In both their performances and their commentary, they demonstrate that they truly get Drag Race. That’s more important than all the challenge wins in the world.","The next episode of RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars will air Thursday, Feb. 15, at 8 p.m. Eastern on VH1."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a7de8c12100003400600cc5.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"SPORTS","headline":"Russian Rival Offered To Lend Luge To Struggling U.S. Silver Medalist","authors":"Ron Dicker","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/russian-rival-offered-to-lend-luge-to-struggling-us-silver-medalist_us_5a8198ade4b0c6726e155eeb","short_description":"\"I guess this goes against every U.S.-Russian stereotype ever,\" Chris Mazdzer said.","date":"2018-02-12"},"articleContent":["An athlete from doping-tainted Russia is behind one of the more heartwarming sportsmanship stories to emerge at the Winter Olympics.","Chris Mazdzer, who won the first singles luge medal in U.S. men’s history by taking silver over the weekend, said a Russian luger offered to lend him his sled in January when Mazdzer was mired in a slump.","“I guess this goes against every U.S.-Russian stereotype ever,” Mazdzer said, according to Reuters.","Mazdzer noted that the luge was state-of-the-art.

Pruitt regularly travels with a large contingent of aides, but they’re usually booked in coach. It’s unclear if members of his security detail fly in first class with him.","HuffPost reached out to the agency for comment, but EPA spokeswoman Liz Bowman told the Post Pruitt’s trips amounted to an effort “to further positive environmental outcomes and achieve tangible environmental results.”","“He’s communicating the message about his agenda and the president’s agenda,” she said.","The Hill notes that federal regulations mandate government employees “consider the least expensive class of travel” for their needs, but there are provisions for “exceptional security circumstances” that allow for premium bookings. The EPA pays for Pruitt to have an extensive, 24/7 security detail at a cost of nearly $2 million a year, excluding costs like travel.","Such protection is relatively unusual for an EPA administrator, and CNN reported last October that no previous head of the agency had ever had a full-time detail. But the agency’s inspector general, Patrick Sullivan, said Pruitt gets “at least four times ― four to five times the number of threats” than his predecessor, Gina McCarthy got while she held the position.","Pruitt has drawn the ire of many environmental groups and activists since he took over the agency. During his first year, he helped spearhead efforts to roll back the Clean Water Act and the Clean Power Plan, urged President Donald Trump to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate accord and moved to eviscerate the agency’s science advisory panels.","The Post notes that Pruitt often cites security reasons for his upgraded tickets, even for short, domestic flights. In July, he was booked on two round-trip tickets to Alabama and Georgia that totaled more than $4,600.","Pruitt’s use of military and private flights are currently under investigation by the EPA’s inspector general after the Post reported last September that the administrator took four such flights costing taxpayers more than $58,000.

We’re both from California. So I really looked up to her,” Nagasu told NBC News. “As role models, I think Kristi [Yamaguchi] and Michelle are setting the bar really high.”","For both Nagasu and Kwan, their Asian immigrant backgrounds come with stories of sacrifice.","Nagasu’s parents, Kiyoto and Ikuko, came to the U.S. from Japan about three decades ago to open their own sushi restaurant, according to the Los Angeles Times.

I made it to the national championships in used skates that were custom-made for another girl.”","Her parents still found the time to dish out important advice, like urging their talented daughter to appreciate her accomplishments along the way.","“You keep working to get better, but if you learn to be satisfied, it puts you at ease and you avoid the highs and lows,” Kwan’s father told The New York Times back in 1998."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a81eb161e00002c007ab761.jpeg?cache=oknQIZ0YkB&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Mike Pence Says U.S. Would Be Open To Possible Talks With North Korea: Report","authors":"Matt Spetalnick, Reuters","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mike-pence-us-would-be-open-to-possible-talks-with-north-kore_us_5a811254e4b044b3821ebe73","short_description":"\"The maximum pressure campaign is going to continue and intensify.\"","date":"2018-02-12"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"States Set Aside Millions Of Dollars For Crime Victims.

The application","date":"2018-02-12"},"articleContent":["by Elizabeth Van Brocklin","Hours after a gunman killed 58 people and injured hundreds more in Las Vegas last October, donations for victims and their families began pouring in. A GoFundMe campaign launched by local leaders would raise $11 million in three weeks. Uber gave free rides to blood-donation sites and hotels offered complimentary rooms for relatives. One group of hospitals treated 71 victims, then promised to waive all of their medical bills.","The influx of relief for mass shooting victims is not unique to Las Vegas: at least $28 million was donated after the massacre in Newtown, Connecticut; $2.4 million after San Bernardino; $31 million after Orlando.","Yet mass shootings, despite the attention they receive, are not the norm. Each year, tens of thousands of people are wounded in incidents of gun violence that have become almost routine. The injured are disproportionately young black men, who have few services specifically geared to support them in the jarring wake of violence. Some victims require extensive therapy to relearn how to write, speak, or walk. There may be follow-up surgeries to remove bullet fragments, treatment for pain and infections, and counseling for stress, anxiety, and depression. Some miss work because of their injuries, or can’t work at all. Roughly one third of hospitalized gunshot patients are uninsured.","A resource does exist to help vulnerable crime victims, including gunshot survivors, though many never tap into it. Victim compensation programs in every state reimburse victims and their families for expenses like medical bills, mental health counseling, lost wages, and funeral costs. Revenue for the state-run programs comes from offender fees and fines, along with federal grants under the Victims of Crime Act, or VOCA. In 2016, compensation programs paid more than 250,000 claims totaling more than $348 million, according to federal data.","Victim advocates, anti-violence activists, and social workers interviewed by The Trace said that victims of violent crime face numerous hurdles in applying for the funds. They say that for traumatized victims, the eligibility criteria can be daunting, the applications toilsome, and processing times long. Even the most basic requirements to receive compensation, like reporting the crime to law enforcement, can deter victims, especially those from neighborhoods where distrust of the criminal justice system runs high.","Most vexing, advocates say, is that state laws that govern compensation programs can ultimately exclude people at the highest risk of being shot. While black men disproportionately experience violence, they are also more likely than whites to have been convicted of a felony, which in some states can disqualify people from receiving funds.","Victim compensation “is set up to really help victims, and yet it’s ironic, because it often really adds to the pain that they are going through,” said Alicia Boccellari, a clinical psychologist and founder of the University of California-San Francisco’s Trauma Recovery Center, which provides mental health services and case management for violent crime survivors. “It puts a lot of expectations on them, when they really have so few inner resources to deal with all this. Sometimes the victim ends up feeling further victimized.”","As part of my ongoing reporting on gun violence, I interviewed more than two dozen gunshot survivors and loved ones of homicide victims to better understand how the compensation system fit into their experiences. About half had not applied for compensation in the first place. Several had misconceptions about the existence of compensation and how to access it. Some felt that pursuing compensation would be a waste of time — one likened victim compensation to “an urban legend.” Others said they were denied because they did not meet their state’s eligibility criteria.","Kellie Cors-Atherly’s 13-year-old son Todd was killed in Pleasantville, New Jersey, in 2012. She didn’t know about compensation until it was too late to apply, and says she dipped into her savings in order to move to a safer neighborhood. “If I would have known there was relocation money, if I would have known there was counseling money, yes, I would have applied for it,” she said.","Cors-Atherly now runs a local nonprofit to support survivors of violent crime, work that includes spreading the word about compensation. “A lot of the families I’ve come across, they don’t even recollect having someone from victim compensation reach out to them,” she said.","Navigating the compensation process from a wheelchair","On the morning of December 13, 2015, Ernest Edmonds, Jr., was leaving a club in Newark when, he says, a man asked him for a cigarette. According to Edmonds, the man tried to rob him, and as he fought back he heard a loud crack. Looking down, he saw red blooming through the stripes of his Houston Astros baseball jersey. He then blacked out. Hours later, police found Edmonds on the ground with a cut lip and a gunshot wound to the back. Halfway down the block, an officer discovered his hat, lighter, and watch in a pool of blood.","Edmonds, 35, awoke from a coma several weeks later to find he was paralyzed from the waist down. The bullet had pierced his back, only to be stopped by his spine.","“Figure you got 32, 33 years of walking, and then you’re just not walking anymore,” he said “It’s completely different.” Before the shooting, he’d lived in his cousin’s peach-colored house in East Orange, New Jersey. Thirteen steps led to the front porch. Then two more flights to reach his bedroom. Now reliant on a wheelchair, Edmonds wondered, How am I going to do this?","At the physical rehabilitation center, Edmonds heard there was financial assistance for crime victims like him. He searched online and found a phone number for New Jersey’s Victims of Crime Compensation Office. In his state, eligible victims may receive up to $2,500 in relocation expenses, and up to 104 weeks of lost earnings, among other benefits.","Edmonds says he would use the money to pay for his own place and make up for lost income. “I need it so much,” he said. “It could help me getting into a wheelchair-accessible apartment. It could help with a lot of backed-up bills. I can’t do for my kids like I used to.” Since he was a teenager, Edmonds worked for a family-operated construction business, where he said he made around $650 per week. He now has to make a$766.25 disability check last the whole month.","After talking to New Jersey’s compensation office, Edmonds received a blank application and started to fill it out. The application asks crime victims to include supporting documentation, including copies of itemized receipts, bills, insurance information, and work pay stubs. “It’s like a list of 15 things that they’re asking for, and I was only able to obtain, like, six of them,” Edmonds recalled. Stuck, he set the form aside.","One morning last November, Edmonds shifted on a special mattress prescribed to help prevent bedsores. His makeshift bedroom had taken over the dining room of his cousin’s house, where swathes of fabric covered the windows. He used a claw-grabber to lift a bottle of Sprite from a nearby table. Cloying incense mixed with smoke from Edmonds’ cigarettes, which he chain-smoked; talking about what had changed since the shooting made him feel stressed.","“It's like a prison in here. He can't get out, he can't move around,” said Nicole, Edmonds’ younger sister. “He might as well board up the windows and soak away.”","The shooting transformed Edmonds’ life. He lost the ability to bathe or dress on his own. While living in his cousin’s house, he rarely left except for doctor’s appointments, and then he needed two or three people to bump him in his wheelchair down the front steps. To get something from his old room, his cousin would have to FaceTime him from the third floor. “Being dependent on so many people, I think that’s the hardest thing,” he said. “Without my family, my sister, seeing my children, I really might have given up.”","Last spring, a former roommate saw Edmonds struggling and encouraged him to restart the victim compensation process. They filled out the application together and enlisted the help of a local lawyer. Still, there were roadblocks — Edmonds could not easily go down to the police department to get the incident report, so he had to wait months for the detective to bring it to him. At one point someone stole his phone and he lost all his contacts, including the number for the lawyer.","December marked the two-year anniversary of his shooting. That month he moved to his mother’s apartment, where there are no steps to get in the front door. He can move around more easily there, but it’s still hard to take a shower on his own; the counters and cabinets are not built for someone in a wheelchair. On Christmas Day, he stayed home and watched basketball while his family celebrated at his grandmother’s house. Afterward, his sister brought him a plate of food.","As of this article’s publication, his application had not yet been submitted.","Victims question eligibility criteria","States began establishing victim compensation programs in the 1960s, to extend a financial lifeline to victims and incentivize them to report crimes. In 1984, Congress enacted the Victims of Crime Act, which created a federal fund to supplement state compensation efforts and also support agencies and organizations that work on behalf of crime victims. At the beginning of 2018, the fund’s estimated balance was $11.8 billion. Just a portion of that will ultimately go directly to victims.","Compensation funds are designed for the most vulnerable, those who’ve exhausted all other options for covering their expenses. It is a “payer of last resort,” meaning it only fills gaps other financial resources don’t cover. “If a person has any type of insurance, even if it’s Medicaid, we can’t do a whole lot for them,” said James McCurtis, manager of the Division of Victim Services in Michigan. “We’re limited by statute in terms of what we can do.”","Those limits can end up excluding people who say they desperately need help.","Rita Jolly of Southfield, Michigan, says her state’s compensation program failed her. In 2013, her son Terry was murdered on the playground of his old elementary school in Detroit. In her grief, Jolly had to take a personal leave from work, without pay. She eventually received money for the burial through her son’s life insurance policy, but it did not cover the extra expenses: the flowers, funeral programs, and clothes Terry would be buried in — gold and blue hoodie, pants, and socks, representing his love of the University of Michigan’s basketball team. “I couldn’t dare put him in a suit, because he didn’t wear a suit,” Jolly said. “He was a 16-year-old kid!”","To cover those costs, she turned to victim compensation. But the insurance policy made her ineligible, and her claim was denied. “Even though a person has an insurance policy, it’s other expenses that come along with death that the crime victim compensation could have helped with,” she said.","Compensation applications may be denied or closed for a number of reasons, the most common being “incomplete information,” followed by “ineligible application” and “ineligible crime,” as defined by the Office for Victims of Crime, which administers federal VOCA grants to states. Every state has its own appeals process, but there are no current national figures on how many denied applicants pursue it.","Three years later, Jolly confronted the unthinkable: Her daughter Shalita was found in the street in the city of Pontiac with a gunshot wound to the head. This time Jolly did not bother applying for compensation. “I kept all my receipts and everything, but I never followed up,” she said. “Why waste my time when they denied me for the first one?” To pay for her daughter’s funeral, she says her family depended on contributions from friends, coworkers, and a GoFundMe account. Even then, it still wasn’t enough to buy a headstone.","Few state programs track victims of gun violence.","Jolly belongs to a group of mothers of homicide victims who’ve spoken out about their state’s eligibility criteria, which they say is too strict and capriciously applied. Others around the country have voiced similar complaints. An investigation published last year by the Dayton Daily News revealed that among the thousands of victims in Ohio denied compensation annually, some were rejected because of criminal or drug histories, even if neither played a role in the crime that left them needing assistance. (Ohio is one of several states that restricts people with felonies from getting compensation payouts.) In Pennsylvania, victim advocates claim that black families are being denied because of illegal activity on their murdered children’s records.","In 2016, an estimated 1.4 million people ages 12 or older experienced at least one serious violent crime, defined as sexual assault, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault, according to the Department of Justice. It is impossible to know how many of those victims could benefit from compensation. The same year, a total of about 204,000 individuals identifying as direct survivors of violent crime applied for compensation.","Three years ago, the Office for Victims of Crime began requiring states to report more detailed demographic information. The data the office has collected reveals some patterns: Applicants tend to be female, white, and between the ages of 25 and 59. However, the office’s reports do not provide the same details about compensation recipients, meaning it isn’t possible to identify trends in approvals or denials among certain groups. Most victim compensation programs — like many American cities — do not distinguish gunshot victims from other kinds of assault victims.","Exceptions include the Ohio Victims of Crime Compensation Program, which breaks out gun homicide as a specific category, and the Louisiana Crime Victims Reparations Program, which marks cases that involved firearms. Statistics obtained by The Trace reveal that compensation goes to a small portion of the overall number of shooting victims in Louisiana. In 2016, the compensation board made rulings on 161 firearm-related cases from from all over the state, of which 149 were approved. That year, more than 580 people were shot in New Orleans alone.","Misconceptions about the funds","Roughly half of the gun violence survivors I spoke with hit barriers before even starting an application. Some described victim compensation as a mythical benefit they’d heard about but had seldom seen work in real life. Loved ones of homicide victims described being too grief-stricken to follow through with the process, or reluctant to appear as though they were begging for a handout. A couple of gunshot survivors said they were interested, but had no idea how to start the process.","Isiah Johnson was shot in Milwaukee twice within one year. He did not apply for compensation. “Both times nobody contacted me,” he said. “Nobody ever said where or how to do it.” Nicole Byrd of Absecon, New Jersey, needed help with funeral expenses after her son was murdered in 2010, but said a conversation at the prosecutor’s office left her thinking her state’s compensation program doesn’t help families of gunshot victims. (It does.) Roy Brumfield, shot eight times in New Orleans on two separate occasions, didn’t believe victim compensation was available in his city. “They don’t do that in New Orleans,” he said. (Louisiana’s program serves residents statewide.)","Perhaps the most fundamental flaw of compensation programs is how few crime survivors know that they exist. “Because victim compensation is not as well-known as other forms of compensation (i.e., workers compensation), lack of awareness is often the primary obstacle that victims and survivors must overcome,” wrote Douglas Evans, a researcher at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in a 2014 report. A survey of California crime survivors conducted a year earlier showed that one in three was unaware of victim compensation.","Victim compensation programs have long been tied to the criminal justice system. In order to qualify for compensation, victims must report the crime; they also often need to obtain a police report to include with their application. But only 60 percent of firearm violence is ever reported, and shooting victims fearing retaliation may be reluctant to interact with police. “When the only portal into compensation is law enforcement, and you have violence in communities where there’s already a perception of mistreatment by police, that leaves a lot of victims without a way to get help,” said Stacey Wiggall, a clinical social worker and technical assistance administrator at the Trauma Recovery Center in San Francisco.","From the policing side, law enforcement officials are required to notify victims about compensation in at least two-thirds of states, but there’s evidence that this doesn’t happen consistently. Alabama’s compensation program, for instance, reported that “many police jurisdictions are still reticent to inform victims of their constitutional rights to receive information on crime victims compensation.”","Even when the information is given, it can be lost to the moment. “Sometimes in the swirl of the incident, our advocates are giving a lot of information and I can imagine that some families or individuals are just not digesting that information,” said Katherine Carter, a spokeswoman for the Essex County Prosecutor’s Office in Newark, New Jersey.","Compensation administrators acknowledge that there is a gap between the total number of victims and those who apply. “We run a program that people generally aren’t aware exists until they need to know it exists,” said Robert Hamill, administrator of Iowa’s Crime Victim Compensation Program. He said the responsibility to notify victims falls to advocacy organizations, law enforcement, and prosecutors — with the largest share falling to his own staff. “We have an obligation to make sure that people know that we’re out here to help them,” he said.","Wading through red tape with a broken jaw","Accessing compensation requires an applicant to be enterprising and organized at a time when it may be hard just to get out of bed. Claudiare Motley of Charlotte, North Carolina, was shot during an attempted carjacking while visiting Milwaukee for his high school reunion in June 2014. The bullet blew a hole through his jaw. He learned about compensation from a liaison in the hospital and sent off his application about a month later. After his third surgery, his insurance carrier dropped him, leaving him truly desperate for financial aid. Wisconsin’s compensation program told Motley he was eligible, but advised that he would have to wait to receive all his medical bills before they could determine a payout.","“The bureaucracy is so thick and there are so many financial and emotional stressors during that time that take your attention away,” said Motley, 46. “Sometimes they don’t get back to you right away. Sometimes they’re very short with you. It can become very frustrating.”","Despite the frustrations, Motley was fortunate to have resources to help him persist. Six months after he was shot, he graduated from law school. He read the victim compensation statute and learned about victims rights in Wisconsin. Between infections and surgeries to rebuild his jaw, he juggled phone calls with the hospital, the compensation office, the insurance company, and creditors.","As he waited to hear about his claim, his case was passed from one person to another to another. Motley kept at it, at one point driving to the compensation office in Madison so he could check on his application in person.","“I definitely feel that I had a distinct advantage,” Motley said, referring to his tenacity with the process. “I could have easily fallen through the cracks.”","About two and a half years after he applied for compensation, Wisconsin’s program paid his dentist, doctor’s office, and hospital a total of $40,000 — the state’s maximum award. Motley says the money was both a “godsend” and a “drop in the bucket.”","As of early February, Motley had undergone 10 surgeries and procedures. He estimates he still owes $130,000 in medical bills.","Making compensation available to more victims","In 2015, the International Association of Chiefs of Police launched a national project to train law enforcement on how to improve victims’ access to compensation. At the state level, Nevada passed a bill to allow undocumented immigrants to receive compensation. In Massachusetts, a proposed measure would ease the rules about whether funds can go to a victim or to family members if the victim contributed to his or her own injuries.","Gaps remain when it comes to addressing the specific needs of gun violence victims. Among 11 compensation offices The Trace reached out to, only Iowa’s program responded saying it targets outreach toward those victims. California’s program, which administers the oldest and largest fund in the country, has pledged to improve access for underserved victims, including “communities affected by gang violence.” The program also administers grants to support trauma recovery centers, which provide victims with mental health treatment and practical assistance, including help applying for compensation. Ohio recently followed California’s lead, and has seven trauma recovery centers currently in development.","“There is this money that’s just sitting there and underutilized because people don’t know about it or are unable to access it,” said Jennifer Alvidrez, a program official at the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities, who evaluated California’s victim compensation program in the past. “It’s kind of a no-brainer to make that money more accessible to the people that it’s really there for.”","Are you a survivor of gun violence with a story to share about victim compensation?

But what about wasteful spending?","date":"2018-02-12"},"articleContent":["By Elaine S. Povich","When Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown and California legislative leaders needed a handful of votes last year to push a gasoline tax hike over the finish line, they turned to a well-tested, yet widely disparaged, tool: “earmarks” for wavering lawmakers’ pet projects.","They agreed to fund nearly $1 billion worth of special items, from $100 million for a University of California-Merced parkway project (to corral Democratic Assemblyman Adam Gray), to a $400 million extension of the Altamont Corridor Express commuter rail line (to win the support of Republican state Sen. Anthony Cannella).","Brown defended what he called the “arrangements” as a way to push through a much-needed increase in the gas tax, which is expected to raise $5.2 billion annually over 10 years for roads, bridges and other infrastructure.","“I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything as big as this particular transportation bill,” Brown told reporters after the late-night vote. “So I would say some of the arrangements that were entailed in this process, they may look large, but relative to $52 billion, it’s all pretty modest.”","The U.S. Congress placed a moratorium on the use of federal earmarks in 2011, hoping to curb wasteful spending. But in California and some other states, they never went away. Many state leaders argue that inserting money for local projects into broader bills isn’t wasteful — it’s an indispensable tool for winning votes. They say earmarks promote bipartisanship and break gridlock.","Now President Donald Trump and some lawmakers from both parties are calling for a revival of federal earmarks as a way to address the dysfunction in Washington. As Congress weighs the issue — it held hearings last month — the experience of states is instructive.","The California lawmakers who got money for projects in their districts defended the deals as beneficial to their constituents.","“This effort will certainly benefit the entire state by improving our dilapidated roadways, but my focus has always been ensuring my district is a participant in California’s growth,” Cannella said in a statement.","But critics, mostly opposed to raising the gas tax altogether, called the giveaways unseemly. A group of Republicans is currently mounting a petition drive to put a measure to scrap the gas tax hike on the November ballot.","A Big Mistake?","Congress stopped using earmarks following the disclosure of some especially egregious abuses. At the behest of Alaska lawmakers, for example, Congress in 2005 earmarked $223 million to link Ketchikan to the island of Gravina, home of only 50 souls, and already served by a ferry. Outrage over money spent on a Bridge to Nowhere ensued.","That was followed by the conviction of former U.S. Rep. Randy “Duke” Cunningham, a California Republican, who in 2006 was sent to prison for seven years for taking at least $2.4 million in bribes from defense contractors as payback for steering earmarks to their companies.","But in recent weeks Trump has repeatedly evoked a time when, thanks in part to earmarks, Congress had an easier time getting things done. “Our system lends itself to not getting things done, and I hear so much about earmarks — the old earmark system — how there was a great friendliness when you had earmarks,” he said in January.","“In the old days of earmarks … they went out to dinner at night and they all got along, and they passed bills,” Trump said. “A lot of the pros are saying that, if you want to get along and if you want to get this country really rolling again, you have to look at [earmarks].”","Some longtime Washington watchers agree.","“The whole focus on bashing earmarks has been a big mistake,” said Jonathan Rauch, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. “Politics is about making deals, and making deals is difficult and complicated. Votes sometimes put [members] in trouble in their home districts. It’s very helpful to offer them some protection in the form of an earmark.”","Many lawmakers also miss the days of earmarks — but not all of them, including the Speaker of the House.","“Taxpayers were rightfully angered to learn of their hard-earned tax dollars squandered on the infamous Bridge to Nowhere in Alaska and the Rain Forest Museum in Iowa,” Republican Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin says in a statement posted on his website. “More troubling than these egregious examples of waste is the corruptibility of the process.”","“Earmarks aren’t inherently problematic, but when former members of Congress are in jail for selling earmarks, there’s something seriously wrong with the process,” he wrote.","And shortly after Trump made his remarks, U.S. Sens. Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican, and Claire McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat, introduced the “Earmark Elimination Act,” to further underscore their opposition and put the current, self-imposed ban by the House and Senate into law.","Good and Bad Earmarks","By definition, earmarks skirt the normal process through which legislatures pay for projects, said Gian-Claudia Sciara, an assistant professor at the University of Texas-Austin who has studied them. Sciara cites transportation projects as an example. In a perfect world, state or regional transportation authorities would perform a cost-benefit analysis on every proposed project and lawmakers would decide which ones to pay for. Such a system ensures that taxpayer dollars aren’t being wasted.","But circumventing the process doesn’t always produce bad results, Sciara said. “Some people would say the great thing about earmarks is that sometimes the projects we want aren’t in those state and regional plans.”","In some states — New York, New Mexico, North Carolina and Pennsylvania among them — capital spending bills routinely include the priorities of individual lawmakers, whether they have been requested by state agencies or not. Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York came into office railing against the state’s “member item” system, which allowed projects to get funded without scrutiny. So in 2012, the State and Municipal Facilities Program was created, which was supposed to provide more oversight. Lawmakers still are allowed to sponsor projects, but state agencies must review them before any money is spent.","In North Carolina, the state’s $23 billion 2017 budget included $70 million in special earmarks, according to an analysis by The News & Observer. The earmarks include $830,000 for a new sewage system at an upscale golf community called River Landing owned by a hog-farming magnate who also made large political donations to legislators. All of the parties say the contributions had nothing to do with the funds and that the project was a worthy one.","Earmarks also persist in New Mexico.","Paul Gessing, president of the Rio Grande Foundation, an Albuquerque think tank espousing limited government, noted this year’s capital projects bill in New Mexico contains lots of bond issues and outlays for projects such as $14,100 for improvements to the Los Volcanes senior center in Albuquerque and $2 million for infrastructure improvements at Santa Fe community college. He has no quarrel with any of the projects individually, but with the process itself and what he says is a lack of oversight and vetting.","“These dollars are jealously guarded, especially in rural areas. For a lot of these legislators there’s not a heck of a lot going on in their districts,” Gessing said. “But obviously, more often than not, it tends to work for the benefit of narrow special interests and hurts John Q. Public.”","The same is true in Pennsylvania, according to Nate Benefield, vice president and chief operating officer of the Commonwealth Foundation, another free-market think tank. His group spotted $65 million in earmarks last year in the state’s “fiscal code” bill, which is part of the budget process. Pennsylvania went nearly a year without a budget, and funding in the fiscal code bill “helped solidify” some of the votes in the budget that eventually passed, he said.","“It’s hard to pinpoint exactly because sometimes the way they are written is so obscure,” he said. “But over the years a lot of these earmarks have been used to get members on board, as part of the budget process.”","For example, his group found that an earmark for $5 million for “a hospital in a city of the third class in a home rule county that was formerly a county of the second class A” was likely meant for Crozer-Keystone Health System in Chester City. And an earmark for $850,000 for “a special rehabilitation facility in Peer Group Number 13 in a city of the third class with a population between 115,000 and 120,000 based upon 2010 census data” was probably going to a facility in Allentown.","“That’s a bad way of appropriating funds,” Benefield said. “We only really have a chance to analyze what’s in these bills long after they pass.”","Stateline home page","Sign up for exclusive state policy reporting and research"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a81af922100003600600f3e.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Civil Rights Lawsuit Derails Deal To Sell Off Weinstein Co.: Reports","authors":"Nina Golgowski","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/weinstein-co-sale-stalled_us_5a819545e4b044b3821f5a0d","short_description":"A $500 million sale of the movie company was reportedly pulled on Sunday.","date":"2018-02-12"},"articleContent":["Plans to sell Harvey Weinstein’s movie company reportedly crumbled on Sunday after New York’s attorney general filed a lawsuit against the studio and its co-founders, accusing them of committing civil and human rights violations.","A group headed by former Small Business Administration chief Maria Contreras-Sweet was expected to finalize a roughly $500 million deal ― which included the assumption of debt ― to purchase Weinstein Co., The Wall Street Journal reported.","Just before the deal was signed, Attorney General Eric T.

The unit had a budget of about $15 million in recent years.","Jobs will be cut as the office is eliminated. The administration believes it can support the office’s functions with fewer people and less of a regional presence around the country.","Loftus said the DOJ would try to “look out for our people” and look for various options for Community Relations Service employees.","“We’re going to look and make every effort to make sure that we can take care of our folks. ... We have time to prepare, and with support from the Hill we can look at ways to help the current staff,” Loftus said.","Responding to a question from HuffPost about the idea of folding a non-investigative office into the Civil Rights Division, Loftus said the administration took that into account.","“We are very aware that there are some potential issues if you combine them, because there needs to be some segregation between CRS and its responsibilities under the Civil Rights Act and the functions that [the Civil Rights Division] may have in its regular investigative and prosecution responsibilities,” Loftus said.","“So when CRS moves in, there’s going to have to be some type of segregation, so that we don’t cross those lines,” Loftus said. “We’re very mindful of that, and to the extent that we need different authorizing language in our legislation, that will be part of the FY 2019 budget process that we work out with the Hill.”","Becky Monroe, the acting head of the Community Relations Service during the Obama administration, criticized the decision in a post for the Lawyers Committee on Civil Rights Under Law.","“One of the reasons CRS is effective is because it is not an investigative nor prosecutorial component of the DOJ. Instead, it works through regional offices [to] deliver services tailored to a community’s needs. For mayors, chiefs, sheriffs, and community leaders alike, the fact that CRS is not involved in prosecutions or investigations makes it possible for leaders to ask for the assistance without fear of facing a lawsuit,” Monroe wrote. “The historic and important contributions made by CRS are not just a line item to be tossed aside, as Trump’s budget suggests. The civil and human rights of all individuals are too priceless for that.”","DOJ’s Community Relations Service has long faced fire from some on the right. A few years ago, the unit was unfairly accused of providing “support” for anti-George Zimmerman rallies.","Todd A. Cox, policy director of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, said that ending the Community Relations Service “by callously draining it of its resources is yet another move by this Administration to circumvent their legal obligations and strip minority communities of federal protections.”","“We need the Justice Department’s ‘peacemakers’ now more than ever, and cutting off funding for the CRS ― like so much of Trump’s proposed budget ― is irresponsible and shameful,” Cox said.","This post has been updated with reactions from Becky Monroe and Todd A.

It’s why we fell in love with people like Naomi Campbell, Cindy Crawford, Christy Turlington — muses who were as close as family and thick as thieves, and brought Girl Power to the runway. We admired them for their honesty, their aggressive personalities, their ability to fuse fantasy with reality, and their respect for the craft.","But the industry has changed. These days, having a famous last name has superseded having a skill, and the ones who get the most work are more likely to have already been on a reality show. What they stand for? Sometimes, just a paycheck. But there’s another community of rising models like none before them: They’re brave, they’re diverse, and they know how to sell clothes. That they’re transgender is not the point — but it definitely matters.","Teddy Quinlivan, Leyna Bloom, Casil McArthur, Gia Garison and Geena Rocero are fashion’s present and future. Beyond being featured in some of the world’s most prestigious magazines and runways, they’re changing how the industry views women, and what a model should be. The fact that they’re advocates, not just spokespeople — each in different ways — makes them more than worthy of the ‘supermodel’ title. Because, the very nature of modeling means that their bodies are valuable, desirable, and beautiful, which is a fight, a statement, and a protest in and of itself.","When we think of what makes a model a ‘super,’ it’s not only the ability to win fans, but also to turn the runway into a global stage on which they represent the best of what’s to come. Whereas getting on the catwalk was once the entire point, now, it marks the beginning of something more. We’re in the middle of some revolutionary shifts in our culture, and models have been vocal about keeping the industry honest and pushing it forward. From calling out racial inequality and sexual harassment, to confronting body shamers, and turning their platforms into political stages, they’re not afraid to fight for justice — and to not take no for an answer.","After several seasons that saw an increasing number of transgender models on the catwalk — from 12 to 45, during spring 2018 — transgender visibility is increasing, though it’s all but clear. Teddy, Leyna, Casil, Gia and Geena are some of the biggest names in the community, and it’s time the world knows them by their first names, too. Though their stories are different, they all possess an honest investment in where fashion is going, and how their presence in the industry contributes to the cultural zeitgeist at large.","Last season Teddy Quinlivan revealed her gender identity via CNN Style. By doing so, she acknowledged from that moment on the fashion industry would refer to her as a 'transgender model' — instead of 'a model,' as they had for years.","\"I think the fact that I’m transgender isn't what makes me successful, but it is what makes me special and unique,\" she says. \"Is it the most important thing about me? No. But is it a part of me? Yes. I didn’t want anyone to be able to say, 'Oh, well you just got that show because you're trans.' I wanted to make sure that nobody could say that about me or use that against me because your genitals do not play a factor in how successful you can be as a model.\"","Quinlivan entered the industry without disclosing her gender and reached global success, which makes her story both frustrating and revealing. It means that she's considered to be the first transgender model to walk the runways of dozens of major fashion houses, like Versace and Prada, not to mention her endless editorial work. Her passing privilege has won her a career many models, transgender or otherwise, will never achieve in a lifetime — and she openly admits it.","\"I honestly wish I had some drama to tell you about being a transgender model, but it's really no different for me. However that doesn't mean that every chance you get in the industry, people aren't constantly trying to push you down,\" she quips. As a result, Quinlivan developed her own insecurities. But after scoring her first major exclusive, with Louis Vuitton no less, she began to see herself for what she is: someone who was born for this. \"'Are my cheekbones high enough? My jawline narrow enough?' I thought, Well, if my face is good enough for Dior, Louis Vuitton, and Gucci, then it must be okay.'\"","Quinlivan's experience in the industry is unique, and the factors that play into her success aren't exactly secondary to the obvious. But she's even more read on what it's like for people who don't look like her; that with the odds of becoming a model being slim, the odds for a trans model are even slimmer. \"We're a very, very tiny minority, so I think it's important to understand that while there are a lot of transgender women in the world, there are not a lot of transgender models,\" she says. She recounts a story from a season past, where she was set to walk for a luxury fashion brand. Upon asking the casting team if she was the only transgender model to walk the show, she was told there was supposed to be one more — but they couldn't fit the shoes.","It's these types of provisions that ratify the idea that designers design with one type of model in mind, leaving hopefuls with only one option: imagining what the industry would look like if they didn't. When faced with the question of whether or not she'd suggest more transgender hopefuls try their hand at modeling to make up for the imbalance, her answer can be summed up in one word: \"reconsider.\" And she means it: \"Don't do it. The world needs serious help right now. Forget about having your picture in a magazine to validate your attractiveness. Because regardless of your gender, you can spend ten years waiting around for Steven Meisel to call — it probably will never happen.\" Because even if that phone does ring, she knows her fortune won't last forever.","\"I'm one of the only success stories I've ever heard. And that's all you hear about: success stories or the model who became successful and then had a drug overdose and lost it all. Why put yourself through all of this bullshit for a photo in a magazine? I ask myself that question on a daily basis.\"","From the suburbs of Chicago, to sleeping on trains in New York City, to appearing in the pages of Vogue India (the first transgender model to do so), Leyna Bloom is the embodiment of a success story — nay, the American dream. An Afro-Filipina whose voice is tender yet tough, Bloom has all of the qualities of what it takes to be taken seriously as a model, and she’s got the proverbial scars to prove it.","When she broke into the industry just a few years ago, Bloom knew exactly who she wanted to be. After all, her time spent serving face on the floors of vacant Harlem theaters and dance halls in the ballroom scene prepared her for it. Eyes wide, she goes down the list: “I had a beautiful group of girls I was inspired by: Tanay Pendavis, Onjenae’ Milan, Tracey ‘Africa’ Norman, Octavia Saint Laurent, Carmen Xtravaganza... thinking about them gives me chills.”","Though Bloom was inspired by the many greats before her, she's an example that very few women of color who are also transgender manage to go all the way. \"Before I knew anything about being trans, I was a human knowing my soul comes from Africa, from true queens and kings. That gives me the ideology to know where I come from and where I'm going. But I've had more issues with racism than transphobia. Due to the fact I am cis-passing, people on the day-to-day just see a brown skin girl. The 'wow' factor is always me being trans.\"","But when it comes to identifying with her own gender identity and race, and in what order, Bloom has it mapped out to a T. \"I'm a person of color, first, a woman, second, the third, filled with possibilities, and lastly, I'm trans — each of them giving me strength,\" she declares. And though each characteristic is a vital component of her character, she acknowledges that non-cis identifying models need to fight harder for their place in the industry. That when it comes to equal hiring and treatment, the fashion industry goes from being one of the only safe spaces for transgender women and models alike, to yet another workplace that requires transgender people to work harder than others.","\"The biggest setback I've been directly affected by is the lack of money being spent on myself and other trans models of color. They're making so much money and press off of us, but they're not paying us and that really fucks with me. Our clients need to pay us,\" Bloom holds. \"The majority of trans people of color, especially trans women, have the worst living situations. We are homeless, we are starving, we need medical aid. Society has rejected us in public spaces to live normal lives, ignoring how badly we want to.\"","And when backed up with the fact that, since December, more than 28 transgender women have been murdered (most being transgender women of color), with nearly all of their stories unreported in the media, Blooms words hold even more significance. \"It's crucial that we're paid for our stories and talents so we're not subjected to other means of survival that's common with our lifestyles. Don't fetishize us, protect us.\"","Before Casil Mcarthur caught the eyes of industry heavyweights, he was held up in Colorado, exploring his gender through cosplay. McCarthur considered the form of fantasy dress up to be one of the only outlets he had to explore, and get comfortable with, his gender identity. \"It takes a lot of hard work, a lot of dedication — a lot of late night conversations with yourself,\" he says, admitting he didn't like himself before transitioning.","\"I had no energy, no drive. I felt like I was a black hole. I had pretty bad gender dysphoria up until I was able to get my top surgery done, even though I had been on hormones for a good amount of time leading up to then.\" Last year, photographer Collier Schorr shot him for Italian Vogue, pre-surgery, which led to a 16-page spread with Steven Meisel in W, a campaign for Kenneth Cole, stints on the Coach and Marc Jacobs runways at New York Fashion Week, and more. \"I've always been comfortable in front of the camera, but that weight on my chest caused massive insecurity no matter what I did.\"","Upon his entry to the fashion industry, he was met with another identity challenge: Would he model openly as a transgender man? Or did he even have to? \"Because I started modeling so young (at 10 years old), there was no point in hiding that part of me going into male modeling. It was out there already,\" he maintains. But McArthur was hesitant, not wanting to be seen as a transgender model, and thus separated from his peers. \"I just wanted to be a male model. I was scared to be seen as a trans man.\" His concerns with his outer appearance are valid, considering the physical requirements for male models, too — and, at one point, McArthur thought transitioning would mean the end of his career. Being open about his gender allowed him to pursue his dream without the fear of being outed, being made to fit in a gender that wasn't his, or the ultimate trap: being typecast.","\"Being open about my gender in the industry, I don't have anxieties over people finding out I am trans. It forces me to love myself as a trans person and to see the beauty in this experience. It helps me realize that this is completely normal, and every trans individual deserves to feel normal about themselves,\" he says. Sentiments like this are frequent on his Instagram, where McArthur often calls on the industry for radical improvements to the way it regards transgender models. \"We are not modeling being transgender. We are modeling the clothing, the art, the fashion, and so many other things that are not focused on our gender. Your gender can't hold you back.\"","It's a nice idea, but on set, it's not necessarily the most realistic expectation to have. While it's known that male models are just as prone to hyper-sexualization, which is just now coming to light, female-to-male models experience a heightened type of fetishization, including personal questions that move the line and then cross it. As he says, \"Don’t ask us about our dead name. It's dead. Don't tell us that we can trust you won't tell anyone as a way of guilting us into it.\" McArthur's referring to deadnaming, the act of calling a transgender person by their old name, which denies them the progress they've made in their transition.","And he's not done: \"Coming from a point of being trans male, don't refer to us as butch lesbians. We're not butch lesbians. We are men. We are also not tomboys. I know that when I first started modeling people loved to use the, 'You have such a tomboy look!'\" It's hard to believe people actually still commit these types of social snafus, given the progress that's been made, but the harsh reality is that they do, and most of the bubbled fashion industry is still unbriefed on the most basic of gender politics and terminology. \"It's unprofessional to not educate yourself. At the end of the day, it's all about respect and boundaries. If you want to change the world, you have to tell them you're here to do that.\"","If fashion is art and the industry is a museum, Gia Garison is the Mona Lisa. Still a teenager, Garison is both a veteran and rookie of Brooklyn nightlife — a persona that, via social media, has drawn the eyes of the industry her way. In just a few years, Garison has secured her stake among the fashion elite, attending and hosting parties that would otherwise require cocktail attire with Garison showing up in next-to-nothing glam — chokers, chains, and miniskirts.","\"I'm always the black sheep wherever I go. I could never be a full-blown commercial model, and I don't know if I ever really want to be. I don't conform to a lot of traditional standards of beauty,\" she says, looking at her stiletto nails. Garison doubles as a DJ on the weekends, and a Pat McGrath favorite during the week. \"I definitely receive a lot of negative attention for things like that, but I wish our society was more open to letting me do whatever the fuck I want.\" For the most part, Garison marches to the beat of her own drum.","Garison didn't find herself as a transwoman until later on in her life, which means she and those around her don't associate her outer appearance with [conventionally] feminine qualities as easily as her peers. \"It's not like I could really hide it or act like I was a woman my entire life. But I've never been one to hide anything about myself,\" she says, changing her tune. \"The bottom line is: Being trans is really hard; some people just want to fit in as a cis-passing person. It can be so overwhelming to constantly be fighting for your existence, so I totally respect if one would want to just keep quiet about that and just try and lay low.\"","Unlike the passing privilege inherited by cisgender-appearing trans models, Garison often modifies her look to fit in. \"I definitely change myself to sort of fit a mold, or sometimes be someone that I'm not. People sometimes make me think I’m not feminine enough,\" she admits. \"But a lot of it is just because I don’t want to deal with people harassing me. Some days I don't even want to leave my house because I have to shave my face or put on makeup just to get by. But I don't feel like doing that every day. It gets so stressful and expensive; beauty products are not cheap. Sometimes the combination of everything just makes it hard to even go outside.\"","She's since hit her stride and is no longer stuck between her gender identity and her gender expression. \"People still commonly misgender me (as in, for a male model), but now that I've become more feminine looking because of the hormones, it's made people more aware,\" she says. Though walking through the outside world may be tough, when it comes to the business side of fashion, it's what makes Garison one of the only models out there who are a true chameleon. \"If I go to a casting sometimes, people won't know what to do with me or what I am. It sounds so dark — but why does it have to be like that?,\" she asks.","Garison points out that most of the jobs she's gotten are due to her \"interesting\" appearance; that is, not necessarily because of her trans-ness, but because uniquely beautiful women are currently trending. It's these very qualities, ones that introduce mainstream audiences to cultures they've yet to immerse themselves in, that are behind the diversity movement happening in fashion right now. It both helps and hinders her.","\"A lot of people associate being transgender with this idea that we're more crazy or wild, or open to doing things that cis people wouldn't normally do,\" she reveals. \"But you can't act like everyone is the same. We don't all have the same lengths we'll go. I feel like being trans would only make someone feel like they could take control of you just because they feel like you're less-than, or damaged in someway.\"","From wrapping a T-shirt around her head as a child in the Philippines and telling her mom she was a girl, Geena Rocero's every step between the activism and fashion communities is rooted in the belief that gender is a destiny. After meeting a transgender beauty pageant manager at 15, she decided to give the modeling thing a try — and won. Rocero went from the boy who used fashion to express what he felt on the inside, to a woman representing transgender beauty queens across the Philippines. But Rocero acknowledges the transgender icons who came before her, who inspired her to \"come out,\" and who didn’t have it so easy — see: Lauren Foster, Crimsona Kaiser, Caroline Cossey, and more — women who paid a price when they got \"outed.\"","\"When I started modeling, there wasn't an out, trans-identified, fashion model, so I made the decision to not share my trans herstory to my agent,\" she says. After being discovered by a photographer, Rocero was signed to NEXT Model Management, working as a model for the next decade. \"After many years of living a life of constant paranoia, of thinking When will they find out?, I'd had enough. And I've learned to truly love and accept myself, and work through and heal the shame that I've had.\"","She expands on her decision to reveal her trans identity in the middle of her career. \"I needed to be ready before I made the decision to share my journey for the first time,\" she says, referring to her viral TED Talk from 2014 when she came out as transgender on International Transgender Day of Visibility. During her talk, Rocero told her story, that includes a religion that contains it own set of transgender roots, and a set of supportive parents — both advantages not experienced by many of those from the Western world. It changed her life.","\"When I decided to share my story, I was referred to by the industry and media as a 'transgender model'. It was an important moment in the American zeitgeist when the conversation on what it means to be trans was happening,\" she says. Despite it being an epithet that isn't technically necessary, the term comes with a degree of humanization. \"For the longest time, trans models were invisible. And the sudden mainstream conversation was an opportunity for trans people to proclaim our space, to be seen as we are. It allowed me to bring my full self into my career — no more hiding and paranoia.\"","While she isn't modeling, Rocero plays the role of producer, and is the founder of her own trans-focused and trans-specific company, Gender Proud Productions. Through her various projects, Rocero and co-founder Allie Hoffman seek to elevate the transgender conversation, providing more (paid) opportunities for transgender people. \"When I produce through our company, I try my best to be conscious of not just what stories are being told but also giving opportunities to trans and gender nonconforming people behind the scenes,\" she describes. It's through her own company that she sets the example for other working experiences for transgender people that are acceptable, furthering the point that trans-led projects are too few and far between.","\"I recently executively produced a documentary with LogoTV called Made to Model, on the history of trans models. One of the models that we featured said she experienced misgendering and mistreatment about 80% of the time during shoots. It's incredibly sad, but common,\" she explains. \"I think it's important to set intentions on the work environment. Before the shoot, educate the whole production team on language and pronouns, along with the goal of making the day on the job fun, inclusive, and supportive.\"","In terms of support, it's helpful to remember that Rocero, like most transgender models, didn't adhere to a formula for revealing her gender identity. There is no blueprint to coming out as gay, transgender, or anything — paths arguably less traveled when it comes to equal rights for all.

The administration sees that as a burden to economic growth and is looking to make the process as simple as installing electric lines, communication facilities or water infrastructure.","“Obtaining congressional approval for each pipeline crossing and facilities necessary for the production of energy is time consuming and delays construction,” the infrastructure plan stated.","The White House says that granting the secretary of the Interior Department the power to approve rights of way for pipelines and other energy production infrastructure on Park Service land “would reduce the delays and uncertainties caused by requiring congressional approval.”","Zinke’s first year in the Cabinet was largely marked by efforts to boost mining and fossil fuel production, prioritizing energy development over conservation. He overturned an Obama-era moratorium on new coal leases on federal land, moved to expand domestic mineral production and proposed last month to open nearly all U.S. waters to offshore drilling.","“Our nation can’t run on pixie dust and hope,” he said at a March signing ceremony for Trump’s executive order to roll back Obama-era policies aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions.","Trump’s new infrastructure plan also proposes to fix roads, bridges and buildings at America’s national parks and refuges using revenues from new oil, gas and mining operations on federal land. Zinke has repeatedly promised to address the ballooning $11.3 billion maintenance backlog at national parks.","In October, the administration proposed drastically hiking entrance fees at 17 of America’s most popular national parks, including Yellowstone, Yosemite and Glacier.

After penning the script for Episode 11 of the CBS comedy’s third season alongside fellow creator Carter Bays, he found himself handing off the pages they’d written. The scenes were to be filmed without his presence on set — or any of his writing staff, for that matter.","“We tried to get the script as tight and manageable as possible with the knowledge that there would be no writers on set to punch up any of the jokes or fix any of the words,” he explained. “At a certain time of the night, we just had to hit send and the script went to our producer and director and we said, ‘Have a great shoot week. We’ll be picketing outside of the lot.’”","Thomas and Bays were two of roughly 12,000 TV and film and television writers who were striking on behalf of the East and West unions of the Writers Guild of America, a walkout caused by stalled negotiations with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers that all but ground scripted television like “HIMYM” to a halt in late 2007 and 2008. (Members of HuffPost’s union are represented by WGA East.)","The organizations were in the midst of negotiating a new three-year contract. But after the AMPTP, the trade association affiliated with corporations like CBS and NBCUniversal, failed to meet the demands of the guilds, writers embarked on a 100-day stalemate.","During that time, guild writers no longer took work. In terms of television, that meant there were no new scripted episodes available for the networks to air besides those commissioned before the strike. More than 60 TV shows shut down as a result, and ratings and ad sales plummeted. By December 2007, most scripted series were off the air and not set to return for months. The CW’s “Gossip Girl” and “One Tree Hill” faced shortened seasons; NBC’s “Heroes” only completed 11 episodes of the 24 expected for Season 2, and was off the air for nine months; the third season of Fox’s “Bones” was cut short as the show went on a four-month hiatus. Late-night programming all but disappeared (until hosts like Conan O’Brien, Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert fought to return without writers citing the financial struggles of their non-writing staff), and award shows like the Golden Globes were canceled.","In total, the strike cost the state of California over $2 billion and 37,700 jobs, according to nonprofit economic think tank the Milken Institute.","For a show like “HIMYM,” the prospect of a lengthy pause was daunting.","“Everyone had to stop [working] and that was scary, as the show was just gaining some momentum,” Thomas said.","But there were larger interests at stake.","Audiences used to watching movies in theaters and TV at designated times in their homes were getting acquainted with a new kind of viewing experience: streaming video. Industry experts at the time predicted that so-called “new media” content ― shows and movies distributed online or viewed on computers, cell phones and other devices ― would eventually supplant DVDs in terms of profits. (Spoiler alert: They did.)","Initially, the big studios ― MGM, Sony, Warner Bros. and Disney, among others ― took home most, if not all, of the profits of this “new media” content; the WGA had no formal agreement with the companies on how to compensate writers for this kind of online or on-demand distribution. So when it came time to renegotiate a contract in November 2007, this issue was key.","According to the WGA, the AMPTP began negotiations by offering paltry residuals for new media and expressed a desire to deny the guilds future jurisdiction over scripts written for the internet. And the group felt as though it had no choice but to strike.","“It was one of the most important strikes of the new century to date,” Lowell Peterson, executive director of the WGA East, told HuffPost. Although Peterson was not a part of the WGA East until after the strike ended, he was interviewing for the role of director during the walkout and was in communication with leadership throughout the entire process. He witnessed the picketing firsthand and considers the strike to be “the first major labor action of the digital age.”","“This was a bunch of employees confronting the impact of information technology and digital technology on their way of living, and that was something that resonated very deeply across the labor force and the labor movement,” he said.","The strike officially ended on Feb. 12, 2008. The guilds won a piece of digital revenues and established a percentage payment on the distributor’s gross, and shows like “HIMYM” resumed with their writing staff in tact.","“Our perception was that it was very successful,” Peterson explained. “That as a result of the strike, the guilds were able to win jurisdiction and residual payment terms that otherwise simply wouldn’t exist. It looked like a great victory.”","But, it wasn’t an easy road. Not only had writers been out of work, they’d returned to an industry indelibly changed by their fight.","The Rising Tide Of Reality TV","While scripted television series were forced to take a hiatus during the strike, this was not the case for reality TV shows.","Once pre-strike commissioned episodes ran out and fictional series were on lockdown, broadcast and cable networks clamored for any original content they could find to fill their schedules. As a result, some industry watchdogs connect the writers strike with the boom of reality television, considering more than 100 unscripted shows ― from competition shows to dating shows to life improvement series ― either debuted or returned during that 2007-2008 season.","However, Eli Holzman, the current CEO of The Intellectual Property Corporation and the creator/developer behind series like “Project Greenlight,” “Undercover Boss” and “Project Runway,” has a slightly different take on the strike’s impact on reality TV. He believes the explosion of unscripted television in 2008 was a long time in the making.","“Nonscripted TV was on the march really from the early 2000s, with the advent of ‘Survivor,’ ‘Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?’ and ‘Big Brother,’” Holzman explained. “The genre came into its own and it mirrored the trajectory and growth of cable, and commissioning increased each year. Yes, the strike was one important factor in that. But to me, slightly less important than the growth of cable and the audience’s embrace of the genre.”","As Holzman described it, scripted television was in the doldrums beginning in the mid-aughts. Viewers, he said, were bored with the slog of too-similar sitcoms, cop dramas and medical shows. From 2005 to 2007, for example, “American Idol” reigned supreme while the high-rated “Grey’s Anatomy,” “CSI: Crime Scene Investigation” and “House” eventually slipped below “Dancing with the Stars.” According to Holzman, audiences craved a fresh start. Cue the rise in reality television projects, which hit their stride in the 2000s. They peaked in 2015, when 750 nonfiction programs (350 of them brand new) aired on cable.","“Suddenly, this genre — Oh my god, all these people are going to get left on an island with nothing and they have to vote each other off, and someone is going to win a million dollars? ― was new and different and we wanted new and different versus a copy of a copy of a copy,” Holzman said. “The strike is an easy moment to look at when suddenly we all became aware of a change that was going on that maybe we hadn’t noticed before. But that change was happening on its own.”","WGA East’s Peterson agrees with him.","“I would not say that reality TV was created by the writers strike. I would say that more people watched it because there was nothing else on,” he added, noting that reality TV was simply “the only alternative, other than reruns,” for networks to air in lieu of their regularly scheduled programming.","Still, Holzman admits the strike did help to advance certain reality programs. “Project Runway,” for instance, aired its fourth season from November 2007 to March 2008 and earned pretty solid ratings for Bravo. The finale roped in 6.1 million viewers in the 18-49 demo when Christian Siriano won. Later in 2008, Lifetime took over the series and ratings increased by nearly 30 percent. Episodes of NBC’s “Biggest Loser” moved from a one-hour slot to two in order to fill primetime space. CBS aired its first, and last, “Big Brother” winter season. “Keeping Up with the Kardashians” began its reign on E! “American Idol” capped off a historic season in May 2008 with 31.7 million finale viewers, helping Fox become America’s most-watched network for the first time ever.","“As the strike wore on, the [reality] business was robust,” Holzman reiterated. “As a typical Hollywood producer, I thought I was just really talented [Laughs]. I didn’t realize I was potentially riding a wave. I thought, ‘I’m so good at this! This is so easy!’ That was genuinely my impression, and I didn’t realize we were in the midst of what was going to be a boom.”o","Indeed, when guild writers returned to work, reality TV was no longer just a cloying trend. Thomas admitted that, as a scripted TV showrunner, it wasn’t easy to watch reality programs top the ratings week after week from there on out.","“I remember being really stressed out in the first couple of years of ‘How I Met Your Mother’ because we were losing to a reality show all the sudden,” Thomas recalled. “That show ‘Deal or No Deal’ was this huge sensation and we were like, ‘Oh man, we’re losing to suitcases of money being opened up!’”","The ‘Death’ Of The Baby Writer","There were other long-term effects of the strike, though, not just for veteran writers, but aspiring ones, too.","About 20 years ago ― a decade before the writers strike ― a handful of these promising writers’ assistants, or “baby writers” as they were sometimes called, were working with Holzman at Miramax Television on a Kevin Williamson project called “Wasteland.” The show, about a group of post-college pals, aired only three episodes in 1999 before ABC canceled it. But out of that particular wasteland came a crucial opportunity. Since the studio heads were still required to fulfill the 13-episode order for foreign buyers but no longer felt pressure to deliver top-level content, aspiring young writers were given the chance to pen the remaining scripts for the series.","“We were in a blowout game where you take the kids off the bench and you put them in because it doesn’t matter,” Holzman told HuffPost. “One of those writers’ assistants was Damon Lindelof, who would go on to create ‘Lost’ and has obviously had an extraordinary career. Here’s a voice that, because of that flourishing ecosystem, was able to be identified, nurtured and grown, and his writing was then brought to all of us: the audience.”","Unfortunately, the months of foot-dragging from AMPTP negotiators in 2007-2008 messed with that flourishing ecosystem, Holzman says, dismantling a once healthy community that fostered creators of all ranks.","“As the strike and the decline in commissioning wore on, the people who maybe had previously been a rung or two up the ladder were willing to take a job and come back at a lower level, a lower rate. If you’re running a show and have to staff it, you have the ability to hire a kid who’s promising but never done it before or someone who’s really competent and is going to take a pay cut to work at that level. You’re almost crazy not to hire that more seasoned person. So, that baby writer pathway into the business went away,” he said, “and that was tragic.”","Then-“baby writer” Nick Bernardone, however, was one of the lucky ones. “I got my first job as an office production assistant on ’30 Rock’ [in 2008] by literally walking into the office at the exact right time and asking if they needed someone. It was one in a million timing,” he told HuffPost. “The answer was something like, ‘Usually, this would be insane ... but can you start tomorrow?’”","After working alongside the likes of Tina Fey, Bernardone went on to become a member of the writers’ room on her Netflix series, “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.” He insists he wouldn’t have gotten the gig had he not worked similar jobs on shows like AMC’s “The Walking Dead” and Netflix’s “Bloodline” in the interim.","Thomas and Bays also entered the business relatively easily. They were hired as writers for David Letterman just a few months after graduating from Wesleyan University in 1997, well before the strike. And they opted to pay it forward.","“Through the run of ‘How I Met Your Mother,’ we promoted several of our writers’ assistants, mostly post-strike,” he said. “One of them was Matt Kuhn, who ended up being a writer on the show for the entire rest of the run after a couple of seasons as a writers’ assistant. We did the same thing with Craig Gerard and our personal assistant, Matt Zinman ― we promoted them to be full writers on the show for many years. And in the last couple seasons we promoted George Sloan.”","These days, Bernardone, who’s been nominated for four Emmy awards, believes breaking into the business is all about who’s willing to give you a slice of the pie.","“If someone likes an aspiring writer’s stuff, they’ll do their best to get them hired,” he said.","As unreliable as it might be, it’s a practice Holzman believes is necessary.","“It’s really important to nurture a new crop, a new generation of storytellers every year, because it takes a long time to get there and it takes a long time to learn your craft,” he said. “It’s like a bad year for grapes — in 10 years, we won’t have that vintage.”","The Streaming Pathway To Prestige TV","Beyond the birth of the reality television boom and the increase in obstacles for up-and-coming writers, the strike ushered in an era that the guilds and industry insiders always expected: the era of streaming TV.","In 2007, Netflix was on an upswing. The company had launched in 1998 as a mail-order competitor to the then-popular but ultimately terminal Blockbuster, which rented out VHS tapes, DVDs and video games to the masses largely via brick-and-mortar stores. By 2005, 35,000 different films were available through Netflix’s subscription service; they reportedly shipped out 1 million DVDs every day. But soon enough, Netflix went the way of the internet, allowing its subscribers to browse through and watch films and shows by streaming them straight to their devices. By 2008, it had already identified its video-on-demand platform as the future. By 2013, Netflix had 27.1 streaming customers in the U.S.","Today, the company has more than 100 million subscribers.","In Thomas’ eyes, the writers strike was a pivotal turning point for the digital revolution helmed by Netflix, Hulu and other platforms. When the WGA refused to negotiate a contract without new media residuals, it signaled to the AMPTP and the entertainment industry at large exactly how powerful streaming services could be.","“We had front-row seats to this huge change, and I credit ’How I Met Your Mother’s success a lot to the influence of Netflix,” Thomas said. “The popularity of Netflix started to get so much bigger and in those next couple of seasons, ‘How I Met Your Mother’ got onto Netflix and was very, very popular on there. [It] enabled all these new fans to binge the first few seasons and catch up and we saw ratings on live TV, on CBS, bump up because of this streaming service.","“That was part of what the strike was about: making sure writers were fairly compensated for work that wasn’t created for Netflix but got on Netflix,” Thomas continued. “Right away, we saw how important that side of things would become ― even with helping shows do better on network TV.”","And as platforms like Netflix grew and enhanced, so did original content, leading to, as Thomas put it, the rise of prestige TV. Sure, standout shows like “The Sopranos” and “The Wire” predated the walkout, but he believes writers had “firmer ground” to work on following the strike and were able to experiment with a plethora of innovative scripted series in ways they weren’t able to before ― knowing that they have the option of pitching their shows to multiple networks, premium channels and streaming sites.","“It’s certainly true that for a while people were more worried that what we did was hand the industry over to reality TV, and that definitely has not happened,” Peterson added. “What we’ve seen since the strike is an enormous explosion of high-budget scripted television. Reality definitely supplanted scripted for a while but in the 10 years since the strike, scripted has just expanded beyond anyone’s dreams.”","Were writers brainstorming the next decade of prestige TV while on the picket line years ago? Although Holzman doesn’t know how many successful TV scripts were created during on-strike downtime, he believes there were ideas brewing.","“It’s not likely they were stockpiling scripts for things that weren’t commissioned, but were they writing for themselves and creating things? I’m sure. Just because Picasso goes out of fashion, I don’t think he stops painting. Similarly, if there isn’t a market for writers work, I don’t think that means that they cease to write. I wouldn’t be surprised if some great stuff originated during that time period.”","Thomas can vouch for that.","“Everyone had in the back of their head, ‘What if this goes on a really long time? What if our show goes away after this?’ You never relax. You have to prove yourself and fight for it, so you take nothing for granted,” Thomas said. “So I think everybody had a little panicked thought about what to do next. ‘Should I be thinking about possible alternative shows or features for after the strike?’ It was definitely a moment.”","Today, the effects of on-demand viewing are still a major concern for the WGA East and West.","“On-demand viewing seems to be supplanting virtually everything else, and that has changed the way our members do their work,” Peterson said. “It’s changed the nature of the shows. No one is constrained to, ‘It’s 8 o’clock on Wednesday, I’m going to watch CBS now.’ People watch what they want, when they want, and that’s given our members enormous opportunities.”","In the spring of 2017, WGA and AMPTP negotiations once again hit a snag over issues of compensation related to new media.","According to Peterson, there were a few things that drove it, including the fact that average TV earnings were increasing, due in part to things like decreased costs as the average television season became shorter. Tens of billions of profits were not being shared with writers.","“We had this enormous ‘yes’ vote authorizing the committee to call a strike,” Person said of the 2017 negotiations. “I think it was 96.3 percent yes, which is really an affirmation that members were ready to take action.”","After threatening a walkout, the AMPTP agreed to some of the guilds’ demands, likely with knowledge of what another writers strike would do to its industry. The guilds made gains across the board, added funding to their health plan and increases in subscription TV residuals, high-budget SVOD residuals, and, for the first time ever, residuals for comedy-variety writers in Pay TV. Now, writers for late-night and shows like “SNL” could see payment for content that’s re-aired on subscription sites or the internet. The unions also pushed to restructure compensation terms for writers of shorter seasons, making sure creators saw a piece of the studios’ profits.","“The Writers Guilds East and West are committed to the possibility of striking if that’s what it takes to win gains for our members, and we make sure that’s clear to the AMPTP when we sit down with them,” Peterson said. “The studios and networks know that we mean it and will do it if necessary, and that’s a lesson from the 2007-2008 strike.”","Holzman, for one, is glad another strike didn’t happen.","“The macro feeling across the industry was a strike will be bad because if we’re looking at leisure activity and how people are spending their leisure time. Television has competitors in a way it never had before in the form of the internet and mobile,” Holzman said.","“We’ve seen, and continue to see, an enormous migration of advertising dollars out of proper television — cable, broadcast and otherwise — and onto the web,” he added. “There was a sense that a prolonged strike may result in the audience declining, which it has been anyway. Maybe if there wasn’t great TV being produced, maybe the audience wouldn’t come back. I think that was a collective fear shared by both the producers and the writers, which encouraged them to find common ground to avoid another strike.”","“It could’ve been quite bad,” he added.","Or good, if you consider the past."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a7b755f2000003800eae2c1.jpeg?cache=A54laJG0os&ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"QUEER VOICES","headline":"The Deep, Dark World Of Fake Porn","authors":"Refinery29, Editorial Partner","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-deep-dark-world-of-fake-porn_us_5a7dd50ce4b0a0f48092eb64","short_description":"In the fight against other forms of revenge porn, legislation has been slow, but strides have been made.","date":"2018-02-12"},"articleContent":["By: Madeline Buxton","Some people say the only way to stop online harassment is to stop going online. Well, we aren’t going anywhere. Reclaim Your Domain is Refinery29′s campaign to make the internet (and the world outside of it) a safer space for everyone — especially women.","Which is worse: having nude or intimate photos of yourself hacked and shared online, or having your face digitally placed on a porn star’s body so it looks as if you’re performing X-rated acts? That’s a rhetorical question, because in both cases, if you haven’t consented, it’s a lose-lose situation. Right now, both of these unsavory scenarios are affecting women in Hollywood, showing a dark side of the web and the nightmarish ways people are using new technologies for harmful means. In early December, Vice’s Motherboard first reported on a specific kind of porn video, which was distributed on Reddit by a user who went by the name “deepfakes.” Using open source machine learning algorithms — ones that are free and available to the public — deepfakes created realistic-looking fake porn that placed celebrities’ faces on porn stars’ bodies. Gal Gadot, Daisy Ridley and Margot Robbie were among the most high-profile actresses whose images were used in the films, which continued to proliferate under a subreddit named after the original creator.","The nonconsensual spread of deepfake videos has been compared to 2014′s “The Fappening,” the major hacking and release of celebrities’ nude photos. Besides the medium, there’s one obvious difference: Deepfake videos are not actually real (though it can be disturbingly hard to tell) and by splicing together two forms of media — footage from celebrities and footage from real porn videos — their harm extends beyond Hollywood, and has the potential to affect any woman with a large number of high-quality photos publicly available online.","It isn’t just Hollywood A-listers who are currently suffering the repercussions of deepfakes, Anna Arrowsmith, a professor of gender and sexuality studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and former porn director, told Refinery29:","“Everyone is upset about the actress or whoever the famous woman is, but the person who is behind that face, the real porn star, is going to be pretty pissed off because everyone is just going ‘Oh yeah, what a performance, what a body, and I’m not getting any credit because people can’t recognize me.’ There will be ramifications of income. This could have been the break for that woman but it’s not going to happen because she’s not going to be recognizable.”","The demand for porn remains extremely high: In 2017, people uploaded 595,482 hours of video to Pornhub and 50,000 searches for individual videos took place on the site every minute. And that’s just one porn platform — there are many others. Before deepfakes surfaced online, the porn industry already had a problem with copyright theft. According to an analysis from Bloomberg’s Bureau of National Affairs, up to 40% of all copyright claims in federal court come from a single adult film studio.","Despite the increased accessibility of porn, both due to the internet and illegal file sharing, it remains highly stigmatized. It’s something people watch and take pleasure from, yet seek to distance from their own lives. That separation is something that accounts for “the misogyny that’s inherent in a lot of porn,” Arrowsmith says.","Deepfakes takes this dynamic to another level: Most of the deepfakes that have created a stir online have featured a female celebrity. The only male celebrities whose faces were used in broadly shared, AI-assisted videos were Nicolas Cage, who appeared as the face of James Bond and Indiana Jones, and Donald Trump, who appeared as “The Office”’s Michael Scott. Both of those videos were parodies, not pornos.","It’s not hard to see why female celebrities have been the main target: The movie industry has a long history of objectifying and sexualizing women. In a 2013 USC Annenberg study observing gender roles in popular films, researchers found that women were onscreen far less often than men. Of the over 4,000 speaking characters in the films studied, only 28.4 percent were women, meaning that not only were women appearing less, they were also talking less. They were, however, far more likely than men to appear partially naked or in sexy clothing on screen.","Deepfake videos escalate Hollywood’s sexualization of women to disturbing extremes. The intense interest in deepfakes could be a desire to fulfill a fantasy, and see female celebrities who are admired but don’t do porn, but it could also be “a kind of putting down on someone,” Arrowsmith says. “[A way to say] ‘haha, they’ve been denigrated to porn.’”","That’s not to say there’s anything shameful about doing porn. But because porn is usually cast in a negative light, portraying someone in a sexually explicit image or video without their consent is a way to shame them in today’s world. The fact that this is simpler than ever has human rights activists concerned. While AI-assisted fake porn has been limited to celebrities so far, the technology is easy for anyone to access and use, suggesting that it could be used as a form of revenge porn.","There’s some evidence this may already be happening: According to Forbes, some Reddit users have inquired about making deepfakes using their ex-girlfriends’ photos. What is especially troubling is that it is becoming especially hard to separate what is real from what is fake.","“Improvements in the tech will make it even more difficult to convince others of its inauthenticity,” Carrie Goldberg, the founder of law firm C.A. Goldberg, PLLC, and a board member at the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, told Refinery29. “10 years from now we could all have prolific porn careers without our consent.”","The worst part may be that there are few laws in place to protect women against deepfakes — the legal system and many platforms haven’t kept up with the rapid spread of this new genre. Pornhub and Gfycat only just announced they were banning deepfakes, and Twitter announced a ban last night after an account publishing deepfakes was discussed on Reddit. Today, almost two months after the initial reports of the videos, Reddit finally banned them.","Questions of accountability have led to pointed fingers all around: Is it the creators of open source AI who are to blame? Or the social networks who aren’t policing the content fast enough?","These are the issues tech, and all other industries, will need to grapple with. “This is a stark example of how the rapid development of AI technology — and its increasingly widespread use — is raising big questions for human rights and society,” Azmina Dhrodia, a technology and human rights researcher at Amnesty International, said. “Governments, industry, and civil society are already playing catch up.”","In the fight against other forms of revenge porn, legislation has been slow, but strides have been made. This past November, senators introduced the bipartisan ENOUGH Act that, if passed, will hold perpetrators of nonconsensual photo sharing accountable. Deepfakes, by virtue of the fact that they are fake, present a whole new set of challenges for lawmakers, but they are ones that need to be addressed, and fast.","“In the case of true images, the underlying harm is a violation of privacy — the disclosure of true, private information to the public without authorization,” Mary Anne Franks, the Legislative and Tech Policy Director at the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, told Refinery29. “This is not the underlying harm of manipulated images — the harm of such images is not their truth, but their falsity.”","Nevertheless, Franks says that this messy issue is one that deserves our full attention: “The problem of ‘face-swapped’ porn helps highlight the harm of sexual objectification without consent, a harm that everyone should care about.”","More From Refinery29:","How To Divvy Up Finances In A Long Term Relationship","Why I Regret Plucking My Unibrow","How The End Of Net Neutrality Will Affect You","Meet The Coolest 7-Year-Old On Instagram","Here’s What People Who Get Raises & Promotions Always Do"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a7dd5211e0000d0007ab427.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Eyeing the Midterms, Some Republican Women Are Taking On The 'Aging, White' GOP","authors":"Laura Bassett","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republican-women-midterm-election_us_5a7e098ce4b044b3821d5888","short_description":"Republican women candidates are fighting for a voice.","date":"2018-02-12"},"articleContent":["The moderate Republican woman was speaking last week at the Texas Disposal Systems Exotic Game Ranch, just south of Austin. The first order of business was to confront that one “nasty little rumor going around” about herself.","This was Jenifer Sarver, a 40-year-old former staffer for Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas), and she was facing off in a forum with 12 other GOP candidates vying for U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith’s (R-Texas) seat in Congress.","Sarver was here to talk about policy and pragmatism. Surrounded by Trump supporters and taxidermied animals, she was not in her element, and she leaned into it with her confession. “It’s true,” she admitted. She voted for Hillary Clinton.","“I couldn’t support candidate Trump,” she said. “As a woman, I couldn’t do it.”","“Just then,” wrote one Austin-American Statesman columnist who was in the room, “some of the dead animal heads on the walls turned toward Sarver with looks of shocked disbelief.“","Sarver didn’t stop there. She took aim at the “aging, white” GOP and said Republicans need to learn how to work with the other side.","“We have a tone that is shutting people out,” she said. “Young people are not interested in joining our party. Women are leaving our party in droves. And if you look out over this audience, it’s a very white crowd here tonight. And it’s a pretty white group of people that are running as well.”","The room fell silent ― and then right-wing candidate Matt McCall chimed in. “We shouldn’t be getting along with the side that wants to kill babies,” he said. “Married women vote Republican.”","As Democratic women storm the 2018 midterm elections, running in higher numbers than ever before and inching closer toward equal representation in government, Republican women are becoming something of an endangered species in Congress. More than a quarter of GOP women in the House aren’t seeking re-election this year, leaving a gaping void in a caucus in which women already make up less than 10 percent of elected members.","Republican women are struggling to find a foothold in a party that rejects “identity politics” and therefore puts little effort into recruiting, training and financially supporting female candidates. Moderate GOP women, in particular, are increasingly marginalized in the bellowing, hypermasculine Republican Party of Donald Trump, President Grab ’Em By The Pussy. Look no further than the wagon-circling around Rob Porter, the former White House staff secretary who resigned last week over allegations of spousal abuse. Trump’s first instinct was to praise Porter and his second was to muse on Twitter about false accusations.","“Maxine Waters has coined the term ‘reclaiming our time.’ We want to reclaim our party,” said Meghan Milloy, co-founder of the nascent nonprofit group Republican Women for Progress, which aims to train moderate GOP women to run for office. “Many of us are for limited government and free markets, but we’re not these cuckoo ‘Let’s put the gays in a camp’ Republicans.”","Milloy and her co-founder, Jennifer Pierotti Lim, who spoke at the 2016 Democratic National Convention in support of Clinton, would love to fill Congress with more women like the broadly popular Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Susan Collins (R-Maine), who are moderate at least in their rhetoric if not always their votes. The “chupacabras,” Milloy and Lim call them.","But Republicans aren’t seeing the same surge in female candidates as Democrats are this year in response to Donald Trump’s presidency. The number of Democratic female House candidates has risen by 146 percent since the 2016 election, while the number of Republican women candidates has increased by 35 percent, according to an analysis by the Center for American Women in Politics (CAWP). In total, 99 GOP women are looking to run for Congress this year, compared with 351 Democratic women.","There’s no great mystery here. Many Republican women did vote for Trump and therefore aren’t motivated and inspired to run against his agenda. But there’s a structural deficit as well: The GOP also lacks its own equivalent to EMILY’s List, the massively influential PAC that recruits, trains and fundraises for female Democratic candidates.","“Most PACs are just waiting for Republican women to surface. I don’t know any doing recruitment on the ground,” said Milloy. “I wouldn’t say diversity is really a priority for Republicans at this point.”","“The Republican Party has made repeated statements that they’re not the party of identity politics, they’re just looking for the best candidate, and it’s hard to reconcile direct recruitment and targeting of women with that position,” said Kelly Dittmar, a scholar at CAWP. “That’s part of why you see less of that targeted work, which we know is essential.”","Republican PACs may also be low on energy this year, Milloy said, because the party of the president historically loses seats during a midterm election. “They may be thinking, ‘Why would we go recruit all these great women, only for them to lose?’”","Jesse Hunt, national press secretary for the National Republican Congressional Committee, counted “nearly 50 female candidates” who’d been recruited by the NRCC — “a tremendous job,” he called it.","Milloy and Lim, both attorneys who have been active in politics since the George W. Bush administration, are also hoping to fill the void and eventually become the Republican version of EMILY’s List. They’re holding a public candidate training for Republican women in Washington, D.C., next week, and they’ve identified about 10 center-right female candidates so far that they’d like to help train and support in the 2018 elections.","Sarver is one of them. She won’t have an easy time running as a moderate Republican woman in Texas, where Trump dominated the 2016 election, and which hasn’t elected a freshman woman to the House since 1996. But her pragmatic approach to policymaking may be refreshing to some who are frustrated by the direction of the GOP and the rightward polarization of politics in general.","“I’m pro-life, but I know standing and screaming at each other about abortion is not getting anything done,” she told HuffPost. “I wanna say, ’Let’s set aside the issue of abortion and come together on ways we can reduce unintended pregnancies,′ like talking about access to contraception, which ultimately reduces abortion.”","Sarver said her message seems to be resonating, at least in Austin ― a blue dot in a red state. “People keep coming up to me and saying, ‘Wow, you sound really rational.’ And I think, man, the bar’s really low. I don’t wanna be in a party that people think is extreme and isn’t sane.”","Sarver’s fundraising numbers are not ideal ― she’s raised only $150,000 so far. Her primary race is very crowded, which in part explains the low number, but she needs more money to be competitive. A candidate backed by a group like EMILY’s List would have raised much more by now. Chrissy Houlahan, a first-time Democratic candidate in Pennsylvania, had raised $660K by October thanks to EMILY’s List’s early help.","Republicans need to invest in female candidates, Dittmar said, to bring an essential fresh perspective to what is increasingly a party of old white men. The GOP strategy of choosing the “best candidate,” without regard for gender, only perpetuates a system that excludes more than half the population from the table.","“You’re not choosing a candidate based on her identity,” Dittmar said. “You’re just ensuring there’s equal opportunity for women, like men, to be considered from the job, and giving a voice to a group who have been historically marginalized from the process.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a7e0b401e000037007ab47b.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"What A Battle Over Virginia’s Most Powerful Monopoly Can Teach Democrats Everywhere","authors":"Daniel Marans","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dominion-virginia-monopoly-democrats_us_5a7de928e4b08dfc9303d14b","short_description":"Progress and setbacks on the road to curbing Dominion’s influence.","date":"2018-02-12"},"articleContent":["A few days into Virginia’s 2018 legislative session, a Democratic delegate named Sam Rasoul stood on the floor of the state House and gave a speech straight from the angry populist heart of his party’s new national platform. It wasn’t just a criticism of corporate monopoly, though it certainly was that. It was a jeremiad against the politics of monopoly, wherein politicians at all levels truckle to the very entities they have both the power and the popular support to regulate.","The subject at hand was a reform effort directed at Dominion Energy Virginia, a longtime foe of state consumer advocates, anti-corruption activists and environmentalists. Dominion had already used its considerable influence to kill off two bills in the state Senate that were designed to bring the state monopoly to heel. But there was a larger dynamic at work: Since the election of Donald Trump, Democrats have begun to fashion themselves into the anti-monopoly party. This has made for welcome rhetorical flourishes about the evils of corporate concentration, but the question of how the party would respond legislatively to these new priorities has in large part gone unanswered.","In Virginia, the Nov. 7 election swept into office a band of antitrust crusaders the likes of which the state had not seen in decades. Rasoul was the only incumbent in a group of 13 victorious House Democrats who had pledged not to accept campaign donations from Dominion and Appalachian Power, the other state-regulated electric utility.","The success of these candidates gave Rasoul and others hope that 2018 would be the year that lawmakers finally stood up to monopolies in general, and Dominion in particular. Rasoul and three other lawmakers who took the pledge went on to form the People’s Caucus, a nonpartisan consumer protection and campaign finance reform bloc whose members pledge to refuse contributions from state-regulated utility companies.","Here in Richmond, then, was an early test of the sturdiness of the new anti-monopoly plank in the Democrats’ platform.","As the session got underway, Rasoul, a smiley maverick from Roanoke, sensed that Dominion’s lobbying and charm offensive had some of the freshman lawmakers’ heads spinning. He tried to regain the momentum by expanding the bounds of the debate. “I made the calculated decision that we have to kick this wound wide open and make clear that this is not going to be business as usual,” he recalled.","And so Rasoul did something out of the ordinary: He criticized his colleagues. “When we allow for these monopolies... but we give the constitutional authority to the [regulatory agency] to protect the ratepayers, and then turn right around and pass a bill to peel back that very protection, it’s no wonder why people are frustrated,” he declared. “It’s no wonder why we can really give no other explanation other than ‘This law was a corrupt law.’”","In the genteel halls of power in Richmond, Rasoul’s blunt critique of his colleagues’ coziness with monopolies ruffled more than a few feathers. “I’d be willing to guess that nobody on the House floor has ever called a bill related to Dominion corrupt,” said Quentin Kidd, a Virginia politics expert at Christopher Newport University. “Having it happen does represent a tectonic shift in Virginia’s political landscape.”","A tectonic shift, perhaps, but not enough of one to win so much as a committee vote. There are lessons here for Democrats newly energized on the issue of corporate concentration. Bringing monopolies back into a mostly discarded regulatory framework won’t be easy. The status quo is durable because it is lucrative for a lot powerful actors. In the case of Virginia, undermining the prerogatives of Dominion means undermining the prerogatives of fellow legislators, too; for Democrats in the Virginia House and Senate, there’s even a perception that it could mean hurting their own chances at recapturing the chambers in 2019.","Rasoul and the neo-Brandeis caucus in the Virginia legislature failed in this round of efforts to rein in Dominion, in part because the public monopoly has long benefited from a different sort of market distortion: political monopsony. When it comes to votes on energy regulation, Dominion is the only buyer in town.","The ‘Ultimate Irony’ Of Pro-Monopoly Democrats","The Democratic Party put corporate monopoly at the heart of “A Better Deal,” the platform it released in July. The issue was a throwback just as surely as the slogan was — the old anti-bigness of the New Deal, recast for an era in which the downsides of bigness had become undeniable. The Democrats’ argument was simple: Excessively large companies, with the power to squeeze not only consumers but workers and small businesses, are an engine of inequality.","Among other things, the party embraced a higher legal threshold for the approval of corporate mergers and a “21st-century trust buster,” or antitrust czar, to enforce new regulations.","“We are going to fight to allow regulators to break up big companies if they’re hurting consumers and to make it harder for companies to merge if it reduces competition,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) wrote in a New York Times op-ed touting the plan.","This was a rhetorical reversal of a pro-monopoly consensus that had held since the late 1960s. Lawyers, economists and politicians in both parties laid the groundwork for decades of mega-mergers and anti-competitive practices by market leaders. An antitrust orthodoxy based on protecting and encouraging market competition gave way to one based exclusively on consumer welfare, i.e. lower prices ― when antitrust concerns were considered at all.","The result has been an anti-democratic economy in which a few big players dominate entire industries. For example, Google and Facebook take in 85 percent of internet advertising dollars, effectively allowing them to dictate terms to content creators. And in the airline industry, which once had nine major competitors, four companies now sell 80 percent of tickets.","A growing body of research suggests that corporate consolidation has depressed worker pay, particularly in less populous areas where consolidation has reduced the already small number of employers. It has disrupted the geographic distribution of wealth, enabling a handful of coastal enclaves to boom even as the middle of the country struggles.","While national Democrats and a new cohort of liberal policy experts are trying to broaden the public understanding about the effects of corporate consolidation, the fight in Virginia is at once simpler and more challenging.","Reformers here have their sights set on taming the state’s utility monopolies, which, unlike Amazon and Google, are literal monopolies operating with the blessing of the state.","Dominion and its predecessor, the Virginia Electric Power Company, or VEPCO, have long drawn the indignation of the state’s populists.","The heyday of the anti-Dominion movement was in the 1970s. At that time, “Howlin’” Henry Howell, a Democratic state lawmaker turned lieutenant governor who is widely considered the state’s most successful left populist politician, led the fight for stiffer regulation of VEPCO and won refunds for ratepayers. In 1977, Howell upset the establishment by nabbing the Democratic gubernatorial nomination with the help of organized labor and African-American groups. He campaigned on a platform of taking on the “Big Boys,” including VEPCO, which he playfully dubbed the “Very Expensive Power Company.”","But Howell ended up losing the governor’s race, a defeat for his populist ideology as well. With his loss, Virginia’s anti-monopoly movement went into hibernation, taking a back seat to the pro-corporate consensus in both parties for the better part of four decades.","It would reawaken in 2017, due to rising indignation with Dominion’s pricing and environmental practices, and a general anger at the influence of money, brought into focus by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ 2016 presidential campaign, over the state’s politics.","“What’s happened in the last two decades is that the Democratic Party has evolved in such a way that it’s very skeptical of business, monopoly business and the coziness it has with legislators,” Kidd said.","On the one hand, the fact that the anti-monopoly fight in Virginia is centered on public utilities makes winning accountability more challenging, since the electric power industry is one where even passionate antitrust advocates believe monopolies are sometimes necessary to ensure people have reliable access to power.","At the same time, absent any need to compete for consumers, government regulation of prices is that much more urgent. And in those circumstances, a state’s abdication of its regulatory authority is all the more egregious, according to Virginia Sen. Chap Petersen (D), the most prominent Dominion critic in the state Senate.","“The number one point I’d like to make ― I’d like to make it in Virginia, and I’d like to make it nationally ― is that public monopolies should not be writing their own regulatory laws,” Petersen said.","Petersen, the vice chair of the Virginia Senate Democratic caucus, considers it the “ultimate irony” that Virginia Democrats have not yet made antitrust a “party issue.”","“To me the Democratic Party represents people fighting against the aggregation of power and wealth in the hands of a few people,” he said. “As Democrats… we believe in giving people a chance, not just the powerful people.”","The Virginia Exception","The utility companies that provide power to consumers across the country typically operate as monopolies, because it is not profitable enough for a company to compete for customers while maintaining and operating the infrastructure needed to deliver power.","That creates a problem for consumers, though, since competition is ordinarily what keeps prices low. Some states and cities have responded to the challenge by taking over private utilities and operating them directly.","However, states and cities usually address the inherent problems associated with monopoly through regulation. In exchange for an exemption from antitrust laws, state governments get the final say in these monopolies’ utility rates. These regulators have the authority to approve or disapprove of rate hikes, with the goal of ensuring that the companies do not raise rates higher than is necessary to provide an attractive return for equity holders. If a regulator determines that a company has been overcharging customers, it can also order a refund.","Until recently, Virginia functioned in much the same way, at least on paper. Dominion dominates the household utility market, providing power to some 2.5 million homes and businesses ― more than two-thirds of the state’s electricity customers. Virginians living in Dominion’s domain cannot choose a different utility; neither can customers of Appalachian Power, the second-largest utility, or those who receive their power from one of 11 energy cooperatives in other parts of the state. But Virginia’s State Corporation Commission kept a watchful eye with biannual reviews of the utilities to make sure the rates they charged their customers, and the building projects they initiated, were justified.","Then, in February 2015, Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, signed a bipartisan law enacted by the GOP-controlled Virginia legislature that effectively robbed the SCC of its ability to do its job for six years.","The legislation froze Dominion and Appalachian Power’s base utility rates through 2020 and 2021, respectively, and simultaneously deprived the state utility regulator of the power to review the monopolies’ finances through those years.","On its face, the so-called “rate-freeze” bill gave both Virginia’s biggest utilities and their customers a square deal: frozen rates in exchange for a hiatus of regulatory oversight.","And Dominion claimed it needed the extra breathing room to comply with the now-defunct Clean Power Plan, the Obama-administration initiative that required utilities to switch to cleaner power sources.","But critics believed Dominion and Appalachian had used their political clout to lock in high base rates and avoid having to lower them in years when its earnings ballooned. The law also spared the company oversight on the considerable fees not included in the base rate that typically form about 40 percent of a monthly bill.","Sure enough, the SCC found in September that Dominion collected excess profits in 2016 that would have required it to refund $133 million to customers were it not for the 2015 law. Had Dominion not expensed the cost of a coal ash cleanup, a decision that the SCC previously would have been able to challenge, the company would’ve been on the hook for refunds ranging from $396 million to $426 million.","In addition, the SCC’s report reflects its best effort at oversight without the ability to actually audit Dominion’s books, as it had the power to do prior to the rate-freeze law. It also does not include potential over-earnings in 2017.","James Dimitri, one of the SCC’s three commissioners, estimated in 2016 that the rate-freeze law cost ratepayers over $1 billion in refunds to which they would otherwise have been entitled.","Consumer advocates were amazed that a utility monopoly had successfully shepherded a law that shielded it from regulation ― even temporarily.","“What Dominion was able to accomplish in 2015 is pretty remarkable,” said Shannon Baker-Branstetter, senior policy counsel at the Washington-based Consumer Union.","It has little if any precedent in other states, where utilities are also frequently powerful political forces, according to Baker-Branstetter.","“I’m not aware of another case where this has happened on this scale ― certainly not in recent memory,” she said.","John Howat, senior energy analyst at the National Consumer Law Center, offered a damning assessment.","“In most states, the regulator has at least the option of doing its job. They can issue orders and decisions and open their own proceedings. There are all kinds of avenues to accomplish the regulatory duties that these statutorily authorized agencies have,” Howat said. “In Virginia, that’s out the window, and the ratepayer is left holding the bag as a result.”","Ashley Brown, a former Ohio public utility commissioner who now heads the Harvard Electricity Policy Group, said that, as a rule, stripping regulators of decision-making power is “poor public policy.”","“If the legislature wants to have hearings about what the regulator is doing, that’s fine, they have every right to do that,” Brown said. “But to deprive them of the powers that they need to carry out their job is not a great idea.”","Rolling Back A ‘Corrupt’ Law?","Even before the SCC’s report showing that the 2015 rate-freeze law was preventing a massive refund to ratepayers, the legislation incurred bipartisan blowback. Liberal consumer groups joined conservatives angry about the specter of a profit-making entity charging consumers without either competition or regulation to keep prices in check.","When industrial electricity customers sued the SCC to challenge the constitutionality of the rate-freeze law, former state Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, a Republican who heads the hard-line Senate Conservatives Fund, co-authored an amicus brief supporting the plaintiffs on behalf of the Virginia Poverty Law Center and the Virginia Citizens Consumer Council. (The Virginia Supreme Court came down against the plaintiffs in a 6-1 ruling in September.)","“From a conservative standpoint, what bothers me here is the cronyism, one, and the further deviation from something approaching free-market pricing as we can achieve,” Cuccinelli told HuffPost. “It hurts everybody ― it hurts the poor, it hurts business, it hurts opportunity.”","Cuccinelli’s remark about “cronyism” refers to the way Dominion has used its considerable financial largesse to get its way in the Virginia legislature.","Virginia’s lax campaign finance rules make the company’s job a lot easier. The state permits unlimited campaign donations from corporations and individuals.","Since 1996, when the Virginia Public Access Project began collecting campaign finance data, the company has donated $11.1 million to Virginia politicians and political committees in both parties ― more than any other private-industry donor. This was the subject of Sam Rasoul’s Jan. 17 speech.","More subtly, Dominion exercises its influence through its technical expertise and sheer manpower. Virginia has a part-time legislature that convenes from January to March for marathon committee meetings and floor votes. Few lawmakers have the funding, staff or time to adequately vet the claims of Dominion lawyers and lobbyists about complex utility rate legislation.","Dominion has “had a monopoly on information,” lamented Petersen, the state senator.","And unlike, say, the Chamber of Commerce, which goes toe to toe with labor unions in fights over the minimum wage, Dominion is “operating alone,” Petersen said. “They have an army of lobbyists. There’s no countervailing authority.”","Virginia, unlike many other states, also does not have a state office devoted exclusively to defending the rights of utility ratepayers, according to Howat. The attorney general has a consumer affairs division, but it does not compare to, say, Maryland’s Office of People’s Counsel, Howat said.","“If there is going to be ratepayer money that is going to guarantee anything,” Howat argued, “some of that money ought to go to fund a real public advocate.”","That changed ever so slightly this past election with the advent of Activate Virginia, an unlikely David to Dominion’s Goliath. Josh Stanfield, a 31-year-old who returned in 2015 from a five-year teaching stint in South Korea, created the group with virtually no money shortly after the 2016 election. Stanfield had little formal political experience, but he was inspired to get involved by Bernie Sanders’ presidential bid and his call to end the corrupting influence of money in politics. He operates Activate Virginia from his laptop ― bouncing from his mother’s home in southeast Virginia to political events across the state ― with the help of two volunteers.","But in Virginia’s November 2017 elections, the group punched above its weight, securing a pledge from 74 House candidates and two candidates for lieutenant governor to refuse donations from Dominion and Appalachian. Stanfield is now executive director of the legislature’s People’s Caucus, which grew out of his group’s pledge.","“I can’t recall any candidates in the past having these conversations,” said Del. Elizabeth Guzman (D), a first-time legislator who took Activate Virginia’s pledge. “Activate Virginia did a good job of bringing it to the attention of people that this is what is happening in the Virginia Assembly.”","Former U.S. Rep. Tom Perriello raised the issue’s profile, making Dominion and Appalachian’s influences a central part of his unsuccessful bid for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination.","Although Perriello did not formally agree to Activate Virginia’s pledge, he vowed at a February 2017 press conference not “to take one dime from Dominion.” Since the 2017 election, he has made combating monopolies and their influence on the legislature a key focus of his new PAC, the New Virginia Way.","The success of Activate Virginia’s slate ― and other candidates like Del. Chris Hurst (D), who vowed to take on Dominion and Appalachian without formally adopting Activate Virginia’s pledge ― gave Petersen, Rasoul and others hope that the new legislature would curb at least some of Dominion’s power.","“I look forward to being able to work with Gov. Northam to repeal the rate-freeze bill as soon as possible,” Rasoul told HuffPost in November.","But when the legislature reconvened in January, Dominion proved surprisingly resilient.","The state Senate’s Committee on Commerce and Labor killed Petersen’s “clean” repeal bill, which would’ve simply undone the rate-freeze legislation, in a 13-1 vote on Jan. 15. The one vote to save the bill came from Sen. Richard Stuart, a Republican.","The following day, in a 12-2 vote, the Committee on Privileges and Elections killed a second piece of legislation introduced by Petersen that would have barred Virginia candidates from accepting donations from state-regulated utility companies.","Rayhan Daudani, a spokesman for Dominion, claimed it would be impractical to return to the pre-2015 regulatory framework, which dates to 2007.","“We’re not in a 2007 world,” he said. “You can imagine in 2007 nobody was worried about carbon regulation to the degree they’re worried about it now, solar energy hadn’t really proliferated to the degree ― it just wasn’t cost-effective to the degree it is now.”","Petersen rejected the idea that subjecting Dominion’s rates to regulatory review would limit its ability to invest appropriately in infrastructure. He noted that the previous regulatory framework allowed Dominion and other utilities to reinvest 30 percent of over-earnings in infrastructure. The 2007 law, he said, was “already one of most generous laws in the nation for a public monopoly.”","“As a reason to avoid rate review, this is frankly grasping,” he added.","Following the defeat in the state Senate of the clean repeal bills, a group of Dominion-friendly legislators introduced their versions of utility rate legislation in both chambers of the legislature. Under the guise of reform, the two companion bills actually scaled back the State Corporation Commission’s authority even further than it had been under the 2015 rate-freeze law.","After some revisions, the legislation specified that Dominion would make the one-time refund of $133 million to its ratepayers in 2018, and $67 million in 2019. Appalachian would have to give its ratepayers a cost reduction equal to $10 million.","But aside from those concessions, the new legislation locks in so many regulatory carve-outs that many experts believe it is worse for consumers than the 2015 rate-freeze law.","For one thing, the bill lengthens the utility rate review period to three years from the two-year interval in place before the 2015 law. Since the SCC can only order a base rate reduction after two consecutive reviews show the utility has been over-earning, the new law would lengthen the period of time before which a rate reduction would become a possibility to six years.","Then, after six years, even if the SCC found that the companies had been over-earning over two consecutive review periods, the legislation grants Dominion and Appalachian the opportunity to reinvest any over-earnings into renewable energy investment and grid modernization, in lieu of issuing mandatory refunds to their ratepayers.","The SCC, Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring, and the bill’s opponents in the legislature, say this provision is a license to “double dip,” or charge ratepayers for infrastructure once through rate payments, and again through the recycling of over-earnings that should be refunded.","“Effectively, customers will be paying twice for some of these investments,” Sam Towell, deputy attorney general for civil litigation, testified to both the Senate and House committees on commerce and labor.","For Scott Hempling, an attorney who specializes in utility regulation and who once worked for Virginia’s SCC, substituting potential refunds for ratepayers with renewable energy investments amounts to a smoke-and-mirrors public relations gimmick.","The clause enables Dominion to burnish its renewable energy credentials and effectively get a no-bid contract to construct new infrastructure courtesy of its ratepayers, according to Hempling.","Under different circumstances, Virginia might have an open bidding process in which contractors compete to modernize the grid and integrate more renewable energy resources, he said. But if Dominion gets it way, it will have first crack at the infrastructure, with excess profits from its captive ratepayers, Hempling said.","He compared it to a job going to “the boss’ son,” rather than to the most qualified person.","“That ain’t capitalism. That ain’t merits. It’s the old-boy network,” Hempling said.","What’s more, the legislation defines many of the same infrastructure investments that Dominion could make with its over-earnings as being “in the public interest,” and therefore automatically fast-tracked for SCC approval. In a letter to lawmakers, the SCC projected that the provision undermines the body’s ability to assess projects’ cost-effectiveness, which could “potentially result in billions of dollars of additional costs that must be borne by customers in higher rates.”","“That’s a departure from the normal state of affairs where the regulator and stakeholders have an opportunity” to jointly weigh a variety of factors associated with capital investments, including usefulness and cost-efficiency and the burden on ratepayers, the NCLC’s John Howat said.","It’s an especially pressing concern regarding Dominion, which, unlike many utilities, is a vertically integrated company that owns many of the power plants and gas wells that power the electricity it sells to Virginia customers. Without a regulator’s oversight, Dominion has little incentive to update the grid with an eye toward efficiency, since less efficient forms of energy delivery might actually pad its bottom line, Howat said.","“This appears to me to be self-dealing,” he said.","Dominion’s influence over the drafting of the legislation was obvious. The draft copy of the bills, SB 966 in the Senate and HB 1558 in the House, included a note at the top: “Legislation not prepared by the DLS.” The sentence informs people that the Division of Legislative Services, the legislature’s in-house law-writing service, did not author the bill.","Given the personnel and legal expertise needed to draft the nearly identical 21-page bills, multiple sources with knowledge of the matter told HuffPost that it is almost impossible they were written by the staff of a lawmaker. They were instead likely drafted by Dominion’s staff, the sources posited.","Asked whether Dominion authored the legislation, Daudani wrote in an email: “Legislation is the consensus product of many authors. We worked with other stakeholders for several months to provide input on the bill which a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers introduced.”","What’s more, the lawmakers who co-sponsored the Dominion-backed bills are a who’s who of the utility giant’s darlings in the legislature. State Sens. Dick Saslaw (D) and Frank Wagner (R) and Del. Terry Kilgore (R) are some of the General Assembly’s biggest recipients of Dominion donations, receiving a combined sum of nearly $600,000 from the company in the past two decades.","Del. Lamont Bagby (D), another co-sponsor of the legislation, is the director of operations at a charity that has received significant donations from Dominion and its CEO, Thomas Farrell, for several years. Farrell contributed $100,000 to the Peter Paul Center, where Bagby works, in 2016, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported in January.","Bagby, who claims he did not know about the contributions, told the Times-Dispatch, “I should have looked at that prior to signing on, but I think [the bill] is the right thing for my constituents.”","Dominion ‘On The Defensive’?","Of the Virginia lawmakers with close ties to Dominion, Dick Saslaw, the Senate Democratic leader, is perhaps the most outspoken about his faith in the company. From 1996 through 2017, he received $328,008 in campaign donations from Dominion, more than any other lawmaker.","Saslaw insists that Dominion’s largesse has never influenced how he votes. But in January, The Associated Press got its hands on an email exchange from several years ago in which a top Dominion executive complained to Saslaw when the state Democratic Party slammed a GOP lawmaker for excessive friendliness to Dominion. The executive, Bob Blue, told Saslaw the company was “very disappointed,” and reminded him of how “our company has supported Democrats over the years.”","Saslaw responded apologetically, expressing regret that he had not done his “homework” on “how generous Dominion has been to me.”","Saslaw has not made the same mistake again. He proved a crucial cheerleader for the Dominion-backed energy bill as it made its way through the Senate. In response to concerns that the bill allowed the company to “double dip,” Saslaw insisted last week that lawmakers could place their trust in Dominion lobbyist Jack Rust, a former General Assembly colleague.","“If he tells you this thing cannot be double-counted, you can pretty much take that to the bank,” Saslaw said.","Whether or not Saslaw’s peers found his argument compelling, he ultimately got his way. The state Senate went on to pass the bill on Friday in a 26-13 vote, with seven Republicans and six Democrats voting against it.","The Dominion-backed bill is due to come up for a vote on the House floor early this week, where it is widely expected to pass. Rasoul’s version of the clean rate-freeze repeal bill that Petersen introduced in the Senate died in subcommittee.","And last week, Gov. Ralph Northam (D), a recipient of direct and indirect Dominion largesse totaling more than $197,000 over the course of his career, signaled that the legislation would receive his signature, notwithstanding the objections of his attorney general. Northam maintains that Dominion has done enough to address the ”significant concerns″ he expressed about the legislation in January, and he does not believe the legislation will result in double-charging. In his statement supporting the Dominion-backed bill, Northam cited the utilities’ investment of $1.1 billion in energy efficiency projects and low-income energy assistance, and the bill’s instructions to the SCC to fast-track the approval of 5,000 megawatts of solar and wind energy projects.","“This compromise puts more money in ratepayers’ pockets, ensures real oversight of utility rates, paves the way for significant upgrades to Virginia’s electrical grid, and mandates historic investments in energy efficiency and clean power,” Northam said.","So when I caught up with Saslaw after the Senate adjourned on Friday, I expected to find him in high spirits. But his face reddened with anger as I asked about the legislation, beginning with a question about the attorney general office’s concern that the bill would enable the utilities to double-charge ratepayers.","“There’s no double-charging. Zero. Zero,” he declared, strands of his white hair bouncing as he spoke. He raised his voice: “Zero! Read the bill!”","I had consulted legal experts who read the bill and read the SCC’s letter assessing the bill’s impact, I told him.","“Well, the donors got some experts, too, OK?” he replied. “And they said there’s no double-charging. It appears to me there is a debate over who the experts are.”","Asked how he responded to criticism that the legislation would enable Dominion to get out of issuing refunds in years when it was over-earning, Saslaw sarcastically feigned outrage, claiming that past refunds never amounted to more than a few dollars a month.","“My God! We could have turned the whole state into Warren Buffett,” he said, lowering his voice to a whisper with mock urgency. “Bill Gates, look out!”","Let’s chalk up Saslaw’s testiness to the fact that advancing Dominion’s agenda in the legislature isn’t as easy as it used to be. Even Friday’s 26-13 vote suggests that lawmakers’ tolerance for Dominion’s influence is wearing thin. The legislation passed “easily,” Saslaw said. But the 2015 rate-freeze bill, the last major utility rate bill that Dominion passed, was enacted by the significantly wider margin of 32-6.","And Saslaw has elicited public criticism for his coziness with Dominion, including from David Jonas, a former Perriello policy director, who tweeted, “We absolutely cannot let this man become Majority Leader in 2019.” Jonas is rumored to be considering a primary run against Saslaw.","Some of the Dominion-backed bill’s supporters argue that the political backlash against Dominion had forced the company to make significant concessions, including the investment in weatherization of low-income homes.","“They were affected by public opinion pretty heavily. Of the 15 new Democrats elected to the House of Delegates, they all sort of ran against Dominion,” said state Sen. John Edwards, a Democrat from southwest Virginia.","Edwards voted against the 2015 rate freeze law and said he would have supported a clean repeal bill this time around. But given the political impossibility of clean repeal, the commitment to making low-income homes more fuel-efficient, among other things, was enough to earn Edwards’ vote for the Dominion-backed bill that passed Friday.","The weatherization of low-income homes “wouldn’t have happened without this bill. The utilities just wouldn’t have done it,” he said.","Other legislators were less thrilled with the way the process had taken shape. Dawn Adams, a new delegate from Richmond who took Activate Virginia’s pledge, was one of the last lawmakers left in the legislature’s Pocahontas office building on Friday evening. She wanted to pore over the flurry of last-minute changes that had been stuffed in the bill ahead of the House vote next week. She was frustrated by how quickly the legislation was being rammed through the chamber.","“As a new legislator, the deck is stacked to not understand it well,” she said. “I’ve had conversations with legislators who’ve been here for quite some time who are also struggling to understand it well.”","Adams said that Activate Virginia’s Josh Stanfield is “helpful” in this regard. His presence, she said, ensures that “there is at least one advocate for the other side that I get information from.”","Stanfield views Dominion’s eager push to enact the utility-rate bill as the last gasp of a monopoly that knows its days of impunity are numbered. Dominion is desperate to fight off new oversight precisely because it understands that the political “allure” of securing refunds for utility ratepayers will eventually prove irresistible to state lawmakers, Stanfield ventured.","“How many times as a politician can you get a check to every single constituent?” he said.","For Petersen, the fact that people like Adams are even expressing their concerns so vocally shows that Dominion is “on the defensive” ― and that the political debate is moving in the right direction.","Most importantly, the political monopsony long enjoyed by Dominion is also under assault. Michael Bills, an aptly named Democratic megadonor from Charlottesville, announced Thursday that he would shelling out big money as a counterweight to Dominion’s influence. Bills, a wealthy investor who donated $566,000 to Northam’s campaign, has promised to contribute $5,000 to delegates and $20,000 to senators who pledge to reject money or gifts from Dominion and to divest from the company. The contributions will be distributed by the Clean Virginia Project, a new branch of Tom Perriello’s New Virginia Way PAC.","And last week, Activate Virginia announced that a majority of Democrats running for Virginia U.S. House seats had taken its pledge to refuse Dominion and Appalachian donations.","“Ten years ago, this issue wasn’t even talked about. It was like homosexuality 50 years ago,” Petersen said. “People now are awake. Once the genie’s out of the bottle, you can’t put it back.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8086231e000037007ab5bc.jpeg?cache=md0EesH2te&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"Chrissy Teigen Has 2 Words For Hater Who Insinuated She's A Gold Digger","authors":"Carly Ledbetter","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chrissy-teigen-twitter-gold-digger_us_5a81f157e4b061625973ae7f","short_description":"She has her own money, thank you very much.","date":"2018-02-12"},"articleContent":["Given that cookbook author Chrissy Teigen is a clapback queen, it’s amazing Twitter users still try to egg her on.","On Sunday, the supermodel and “Lip Sync Battle” commentator drew the attention of a disgruntled Twitter user after she posted a lighthearted tweet.

The news comes almost a year after the departments of Justice and Education rescinded joint, Obama-era guidance that any school receiving federal money must treat a student’s gender identity as his or her sex, which included allowing individuals to use the bathroom conforming to their identity.","However, since that time, the Trump administration has been mum on information about how the Education Department’s civil rights division would officially handle these cases. In June, an internal memo from the department’s Office for Civil Rights told attorneys that these cases could be dismissed, but it was not necessarily a requirement. But a spokeswoman for the Department of Education told BuzzFeed that the administration does not interpret Title IX, the federal law prohibiting sex discrimination, to cover these types of cases.","“Where students, including transgender students, are penalized or harassed for failing to conform to sex-based stereotypes, that is sex discrimination prohibited by Title IX,” Liz Hill told BuzzFeed. “In the case of bathrooms, however, long standing regulations provide that separating facilities on the basis of sex is not a form of discrimination prohibited by Title IX.”","Hill told the outlet that transgender student complaints could still be investigated, just not those centered around the use of intimate facilities.","The Obama administration interpreted Title IX to include discrimination based on gender identity. Notably, a wave of recent court decisions have also interpreted the law this way.","In January, HuffPost learned of at least three recent cases in which the Office for Civil Rights dismissed complaints filed by transgender students regarding access to bathrooms, locker rooms and gender specific sports teams. The Office for Civil Rights wrote back to complainants and said their office was no longer required to deal with this type of discrimination.","HuffPost also previously learned that the number of complaints filed with the Department of Education related to the treatment of transgender students dropped precipitously, by about 40 percent, between January 2016 through January 2017, and January 2017 through January 2018. At the time, advocates for LGBTQ students told HuffPost they worried that the Trump administration was having a chilling effect on the students who would otherwise submit complaints of discrimination.","Upon rescinding the Obama-era guidance last year, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos met with a small group of transgender children and families to discuss issues facing this group of students. Vanessa Ford attended the meeting with her six-year-old transgender daughter, Ellie. During the meeting, DeVos mentioned that she had a young granddaughter, just like Ellie.","Ford told HuffPost that she found the news today “mind boggling.”","“We put our family at risk meeting with her in hopes it would make change. She now made the decision for the Department of Education that my daughter and thousands of daughters and sons shouldn’t have the protection her grandchildren should be afforded,” said Ford.","Eliza Byard, executive director of the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network, said that after the Trump administration first rescinded the student guidance last year, they saw school districts who had been supporting transgender students suddenly change course. She is now focused on making sure they feel supported and affirmed across the country.","“They are not alone,” said Byard. “It is ultimately most important right now every transgender student understands right now that this is wrong.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a81ca94210000c300600f86.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"CRIME","headline":"Three Milwaukee County Jail Staff Members Charged For Inmate's Dehydration Death","authors":"Antonia Blumberg","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/terrill-thomas-dehydration-death-charges_us_5a81d4e9e4b0c6726e15fd72","short_description":"Terrill Thomas died of \"profound dehydration\" in 2016 after guards cut off his water supply for a week.","date":"2018-02-12"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Do You Like Paying Tolls?

People who believed him really don’t understand how things work.”","Avoiding $400 billion annual deficits was just one of several promises Trump made on the campaign trail regarding federal spending. Trump told conspiracy theorist Alex Jones in December 2015 that if the country didn’t “balance up” its budget soon, “we’re not going to have a nation anymore.”","And in a March 2016 interview with The Washington Post, Trump said he would not only eliminate annual deficits, but actually pay off the entire national debt ― at the time, $20 trillion ― within eight years.","Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said that pledge was clearly ill-informed and not plausible. “What was plausible was that he would get into office and not be complicit in adding to the debt,” she said.","But with a tax-cut plan that the Congressional Budget Office estimated will add $1.5 trillion to the deficit over the next 10 years and a new spending plan that will add another $400 billion or so, Trump is, indeed, adding to the problem, she said.","“They are catapulting us toward trillion dollar deficits,” she said. “The president has no interest in leading on hard choices.”","Trump’s budget director, Mick Mulvaney, said at a White House briefing Monday that the administration’s budget proposal is telling Congress that lawmakers don’t have to spend all the new money called for in the recent two-year government funding agreement that the president signed into law.","“We do not have to have trillion dollar deficits forever,” Mulvaney said.","According to critics, though, that is exactly what Trump and congressional Republicans have guaranteed. Trump’s own budget proposal, even relying on a 3-percent growth rate in the economy that many experts call unrealistic, projects a deficit of $969 billion next year unless Congress cuts programs.","“His budget has nothing to do with reality,” Collender said","“We’re looking at oceans of red ink as far as we can see,” said Jared Bernstein, once the top economic adviser to former Vice President Joe Biden.","Biden and President Barack Obama were hammered, year after year, by Republicans for running annual budget deficits and doubling the national debt ― even though they took office facing a deficit of $1.3 trillion in the depth of the financial crisis. In the coming years, it fell to as little as $438 billion before increasing again to $588 billion by the time Obama and Biden left office.","Trump’s trillion-dollar deficits will come in a strong economy, and could rapidly reach record levels in the event of a recession.","“We’ve seen the deficit hypocrisy ever since Obama left the White House,” Bernstein said. “Republicans love to cut taxes, but their constituents don’t want to lose the government services that they’re using.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a81fb9c1e00002c007ab777.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Twitter Bans GOP Candidate For Racist Meghan Markle Tweet","authors":"David Moye","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-nehlen-meghan-markle-twitter-ban_us_5a81c9c3e4b08dfc930694cc","short_description":"Paul Nehlen superimposed a picture of Cheddar Man, an ancient Briton with dark skin, over Markle's face.","date":"2018-02-12"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"POLITICS","headline":"Activist Wants To Stop Muslims From Participating In Minnesota's GOP","authors":"Rowaida Abdelaziz","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/minnesota-gop-muslims_us_5a81d2e8e4b08dfc9306adf8","short_description":"It's not clear whether any actually want to.","date":"2018-02-12"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"RELIGION","headline":"French Bishop Declares Nun's Recovery A Lourdes Miracle","authors":"Carol Kuruvilla","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/french-nun-lourdes-miracle_us_5a81b39ae4b044b3821fab9d","short_description":"Bernadette Moriau said she was able to walk for the first time in decades after visiting the shrine.","date":"2018-02-12"},"articleContent":["Nearly 10 years ago, a French nun named Bernadette Moriau visited the Catholic shrine in Lourdes in a wheelchair. After she returned to her convent near Beauvais, she said, she was miraculously healed and able to walk for the first time in decades.","The Roman Catholic Church in Lourdes investigated her claim, and on Sunday a French bishop placed a stamp of approval on it, formally declaring Moriau’s recovery to be a miracle.","Bishop Jacques Benoit-Gonin of Beauvais announced the 79-year-old nun’s story of healing to be the 70th recognized miracle associated with Lourdes, a popular pilgrimage site. He called her recovery a “sudden, instantaneous, complete and durable change,” according to The Associated Press.","The Sanctuary of Lourdes in southern France marks the spot where in 1858, a 14-year-old girl named Bernadette Soubirous claims to have seen apparitions of the Virgin Mary. Millions visit the site every year, believing that water from a spring in the sanctuary’s grotto has healing powers.","Moriau visited Lourdes on a pilgrimage in 2008. According to La Stampa, the nun had cauda equina syndrome, a rare condition that affects the spinal nerve roots and can lead to paralysis of the legs. She’d had four operations on her spinal column and had been unable to walk since 1987.","Moriau said that when she visited the grotto, she “never asked for a miracle,” per AP. She just “asked for the conversion of my heart and the strength to continue my path as a sick person,” La Stampa reports.","She returned to her home convent and visited the chapel to pray.","“I felt a [surge of] well-being throughout my body, a relaxation, warmth. ... I returned to my room and, there, a voice told me to ‘take off your braces,’” Moriau said in a diocesan video about the event. “Surprise. I could move.”","Below, Bernadette Moriau discusses her experiences in French.","The nun’s claims were evaluated by the International Medical Committee of Lourdes, a team of medical professionals brought together by the Bishop of Tarbes and Lourdes in order to assess whether stories of healing that emerge from Lourdes can be explained on the basis of current medical knowledge.","The committee reportedly found that Moriau’s case could not be explained scientifically. The bishop of Beauvais, who has the last word on cases involving people living in his diocese, agreed that her healing appeared to be miraculous.","“She immediately started to walk without any help, in a totally autonomous way,” Benoit-Gonin said.","The last officially recognized miracle at Lourdes was announced in 2013. In that case, an Italian woman who had visited the shrine in 1989 said she was miraculously healed of severe high blood pressure and other problems.","The Catholic Church requires extensive documentation to verify the claim of a miracle. The process, which can take years, includes fact-finding, psychological examinations and theological evaluations.","Miracles are tied to canonization in the Catholic Church. Before being declared a saint, the deceased candidate will usually have been credited with performing at least two verified miracles."],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a81b5652000003900eae9a1.jpeg?cache=JfNibavzgS&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"ENTERTAINMENT","headline":"5 Cable-Cutting Problems You Probably Didn't Think About","authors":"Todd Van Luling","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cable-cord-cutting-problems_us_5a81adb9e4b044b3821fa129","short_description":"Some important things to keep in mind before you cut the cord.","date":"2018-02-12"},"articleContent":["As alternatives to live television ― such as Sling TV, YouTube TV and Hulu Live ― improve and other streaming services ― like Netflix and Amazon Prime ― add better original programming, it’s become increasingly tempting to cut the cord.","But cord-cutting isn’t quite the obvious choice just yet. There must be a reason nearly 200 million U.S. adults still have cable.","HuffPost did a call-out to our readers to find out a few of the unexpected problems consumers have faced after cord-cutting. The majority of the responses expressed satisfaction in their decision, thanks to money saved, monopolistic cable providers avoided and the huge library of content offered by streaming services.","So if you’re thinking of making the cut and want to know what to expect ― read on.","Streamline makes recommendations for streaming shows and movies. Every Saturday, Streamline highlights the best shows to watch online, with a focus on Netflix.","Subscribe to the newsletter.","1. The new live services have buffering issues.","Readers identified this as the most widespread problem with making the change from cable.","“I’ve subscribed to DIRECTV Now. But it kept freezing during the Super Bowl, sometimes for minutes at a time.” ― Sarah Cummings","“We liked Hulu live until it froze that last 45 seconds of the Super Bowl ” ― Darcy Leal DeShazer","“We cut out cable and tried to replace it with just streaming options, then with those plus PlayStation Vue (because they were the only option for live sports). That was a bust because the internet streaming couldn’t keep up with the speed of most sports, plus the DVR options were abysmal [which made missing live game broadcasts not an option]. So we went back! We are the proud payers of a DIRECTV bill and I’m not even sad about it.” ― Stephanie Bowen Earley","2. It’s impossible to get every channel you had before.","The different streaming options don’t offer the exact same packages as the cable companies, meaning you’ll almost definitely be missing out on something. If you’re one of those people who actually does watch tons of different channels, the live streaming services might offer less that what you’re looking for.","“I realized that I missed my Live TV. I bought an HDTV antenna, however the only channel I could get was NBC because I’m not close to the towers. I researched all of the live streaming options including Hulu Live ($40/month), Sling TV ($20, $25 or $40) and DIRECTV NOW ($35). I got free trials for all three. I liked Hulu Live, however the live user interface took me awhile to get used to. Plus it was the most expensive at $40, still for a bunch of channels I don’t watch. Also it did not have Animal Planet or TLC, channels that I watch. Next I was excited about Sling because of the price, however even with Sling’s $40 option, you don’t get all of the major broadcast networks. So my final selection for live streaming TV is DIRECTV NOW (Live a little package). It has the best value at $35/month with all of the major broadcast networks plus TLC and Animal Planet. Plus I like the user interface for browsing live TV. It has a nice channel guide similar to cable. The only channel that I don’t have live and would like is the OWN network, but I’m not going to pay an extra $15 a month for the next higher package that includes it.” ― Angela L. Lee","“Many apps require cable subscription.” ― Mike Legg","“I tried Aereo before they lost their court case. Then I was a SlingTV user for a couple of years and really enjoyed it. Just switched to YouTubeTV in the last week. Mostly so we could get local channels. It’s okay but I am already missing A & E, HGTV and History Channel. We are going to give it a try for a while but may check out DIRECTV now because it has most of the channels we like as well as local options.” ― Sean Cook","3. Streaming live sports can be particularly tricky.","Companies such as ESPN have spent a ton of money acquiring the rights to live events. They’re not going to let you stream every major sports event easily. Even ESPN’s upcoming streaming service won’t have all the games that the cable channels are going to air.","In many of these cases, you might have to buy the sport’s individual streaming service ― such as NBA League Pass or MLB.TV, but even those don’t have everything that’s shown on cable.","“We have Netflix, Amazon, Vudu and the T1 from Xfinity (with their best package) plus internet and sports packages. We would definitely cut cable as there is enough with Netflix, Amazon and Vudu ... BUT my husband HAS to have the football and baseball packages and local channels. That’s the only thing keeping us from cutting completely as we only pay about $30 a month combined for streaming compared to almost $300 a month for cable.” ― Anna Day","“Watching the Super Bowl, Golden Globes, Oscars, Emmys are all more work without cable. We have an antenna but the consistency of the channels is lacking.” ― Erin Mcnally-Goward","“Paid for an extra Hulu package to watch sports games and some live TV, but it only works on my iPad, not my smart TV or Apple TV. I was watching the Super Bowl on the networks app, and it cut off in the fourth quarter due to ‘streaming rights’... on the networks app?? How? What am I paying for? Pretty crappy time to cut me off! I had to scramble with guests at my house to find it on YouTube. I am frustrated with paying extra but then the options are still so limited.” ― Ashley Ryan Larrabee","4. Internet problems can mess with streaming.","The U.S. doesn’t rank very well with the rest of the world in terms of internet speed. Depending on where you live, you might have a better shot having reliable cable than internet.","And then if you do cord-cut, you may have to pay more for your internet to make sure the streamed shows and movies don’t overload your internet connection. As one reader pointed out, certain areas of the country with sub-par internet could have no good way of avoiding this problem.","“My internet slowed down to a crawl and no amount of resetting the box helped. Turned out it was something wrong with the box and it was replaced. However, it was still occasionally cutting out. When we moved from Los Feliz to Boyle Heights [in Los Angeles], connection with these services greatly improved. I think it’s due to it being adjacent to downtown so that connections are underground and stronger.” ― Ruby McNeil","5. You might have to fight your cable company.","Your cable company doesn’t want to lose that sweet, sweet monthly payment. So that company might try to make it really difficult to cord-cut.","This often entails pushing you to pay more for internet or hiding large overage fees. Expect some resistance.","(We should note in passing that Verizon — which owns HuffPost’s parent company, Oath — is one of the largest cable and internet providers in the U.S.)","“We did it! Finally cut the cable cord. It was an oddly empowering moment. However within a few weeks of basking in our joy and anticipation of the savings we were going to experience we started getting some rather concerning emails from our former cable company about data overages! We could stream to our hearts content while we paid exorbitant rates for cable that supplied us with an endless supply of channels we never used. The minute we took charge that old pesky cable company somehow infiltrated our lives again with the promise of extra fees. We started getting a daily deluge of emails letting us know for a few more drops of blood ... I mean dollars ... we could keep our overages in check and be safe and complacent again. We were floored. But alas we caved but in our small protest we vowed to neva-eva-eva-eva go hungry again... I mean pay for cable again!” ― Lucy Fellows","“My cable company tried to tell me that if I cancelled the digital service and just got internet and phone service it would cost me more... ” ― Janna Olson","“I cut dish and only use open TV, Netflix, Hulu, Amazon prime video and HBOnow, but now Comcast limited my monthly data to 1,000 gig and if I go over they charge me 10 dollars for every 50 gig above.” ― Manuel Briceño","Bonus: The shows and movies you thought were on streaming might not be there anymore or might be leaving soon.","This can be fixed with a little research. But since streaming companies like Netflix, Hulu and Amazon are constantly changing their content libraries, you might not be getting all the shows and movies you expected.","These companies also seem to be pivoting to more original content rather than maintaining huge libraries of quality shows and movies by other creators. So you might have to subscribe to quite a few streaming companies to get an extensive library.","“I’m really disappointed in the slow deterioration of popular film offerings from the Big 3 (Hulu, Netflix, Amazon). I remember when they started up, Netflix had an amazing selection. But now it seems like they never have any of the films I’m looking for. I have Amazon Prime, but any of the movies I really want to see inevitably require that I pay extra to rent them. The number of B and C-grade movies that are on these services is quite remarkable. That’s a lot of chaff to pad their offerings.” ― Susan Houston","Responses have been edited and condensed for clarity.

Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and first daughter Ivanka Trump are pushing for a paid parental leave plan that is actually worse than the current federal policy ― which is no policy at all. The U.S. is the only industrialized nation that offers no paid time off to new mothers.","Under the Rubio-Trump scheme, which is based on a proposal from the conservative Independent Women’s Forum, new parents would fund their parental leave by tapping into their Social Security benefits early.","Parents would get 12 weeks of benefits ― estimated to be about 40 percent of average worker pay ― in exchange for what the Independent Women’s Forum claims would only be six weeks of Social Security retirement benefits down the line.","The plan does not account for anyone who needs to take time off to care for a sick relative or deal with a personal illness.","In a Tweet last week, Rubio admitted that the plan isn’t “perfect,” but it’s better than the status quo.","He’s wrong.","Paid leave is generally understood to be a policy that would help women, who typically bear the burden of childbearing and rearing. Mothers who get paid leave are more likely to stay in the labor force and are less likely to rely on social programs like food stamps to get by.","But the Rubanka plan would have parents pay for children with their retirement funds ― essentially stealing from their own future well-being. That’s a particularly painful proposition for women. Though they live longer than men, women have less money saved for retirement. Indeed, women on average get $1,154 a month in retirement from Social Security, according to the agency’s data. Men get $1,466.","This is partly because women are more likely to take time out of the labor force to care for children and other family members, working just 75 percent of the years men work.","It’s also thanks to the gender pay gap. Overall, women make 80 cents for every dollar on average a man makes. Mothers face a wider pay gap of 71 cents. If you’re a woman of color, the numbers look even worse.","The plan does not account for a mother (or father) who has several children. The more kids, the bigger the penalty, with each leave period funded by another chunk of retirement benefits. This could effectively discourage people from having kids ― maybe not a great idea in a country with an increasingly aging population and declining birthrate that’s also trying to cut back on immigration.","“With the changes in the labor force and potentially in immigration, we need to be encouraging people to have kids,” said Jeff Hayes, program director at the Institute for Women’s Policy Research. “They’re the workforce of tomorrow.”","Rubio and Trump haven’t floated a written policy. What we know about the workings of the scheme comes from the Independent Women’s Forum paper, which was published last month.","The Independent Women’s Forum was founded in 1991 by women who defended the nomination of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, who was accused of sexually harassing Anita Hill. These days, the group is busy backing President Donald Trump, decrying the #MeToo movement, promoting the idea that raising the minimum wage would harm women and downplaying the role that discrimination plays in the gender pay gap.","The group touts the plan as a “short deferral” of benefits. In practice, that’s not how it would work, says Kathleen Romig, who worked for years as an analyst at the Social Security Administration.","The plan’s backers suggest that a person applying for Social Security benefits would just have to wait six more weeks to collect, Romig explained. In reality, the recipient would receive a lower benefit, she said.","“It’s cutting your benefit for the rest of your life,” said Romig, who is now a senior policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.","Until the policy can be thoroughly analyzed, it’s not totally clear how much that reduction would actually be, she said. However, she expressed disbelief that it would only be the equivalent of six weeks’ pay. “We can’t know how much it’ll cost until we get an official cost from the scorekeepers,” Romig said, noting the actuarial complexity of such an undertaking.","Perhaps most alarming: The very idea of using Social Security funds as a private piggy bank threatens to destabilize the very notion of a social insurance program.","“If we start treating Social Security, really the bedrock of financial security for elderly people, as just another asset to tap, we are imperiling people’s financial security,” Romig said.","That may be an intentional part of the Independent Women’s Forum plan. In a piece written for the conservative publication The Federalist, the group’s managing director, Carrie Lukas, writes that a policy like this could have the added “benefit” of changing Americans’ thinking about Social Security as a bedrock benefit that cannot be changed.","“Indeed, encouraging people to think about Social Security’s assets as if those benefits are their property for use now or at retirement could even encourage people to want to move more in that direction and transform the current pay-as-you-go system into one that pre-funds future benefits and with assets that belong to individuals,” Lukas writes. She says that many Americans don’t want that much money when they’re older ― since they need it now ― and are happy to work longer into old age.","But a key part of Social Security is keeping those retirement benefits untapped ― even when young Americans desperately do need money ― thus staving off terrifying poverty for the nation’s elderly.","The proposal comes at a time of enormous bipartisan support for paid leave, traditionally a more liberal policy darling. Eighty-two percent of Americans support giving mothers paid leave following the arrival of a child, according to a Pew survey last year. Conservative groups are increasingly in favor of doing something for parents.","Yet even the president isn’t buying the Rubanka plan. He has put a paid family leave proposal in his budget plan, released Monday. However, it’s structured differently from his daughter’s. Under his plan, the U.S. would offer six weeks of family leave, paid for with unemployment insurance.","But don’t get too excited: It’s a dubious policy he’s suggested before, without taking any action to move it forward.","“It’s understandable that people have seen how popular family leave is and want to get out in front of it,” said Ellen Bravo, co-director of the paid family leave advocacy group Family Values @ Work. “But [Rubio’s plan] is a step in the wrong direction.”","Advocates like Bravo have been fighting for paid leave since the 1993 passage of the Family and Medical Leave Act, which provides 12 weeks unpaid leave for some employees at large companies. It’s beneficial to wait a little longer for the right solution, she said.","Bravo and others support a different proposal on family leave: The Family Act, sponsored by Democrats in the House and Senate, which would pay for leave through a small payroll tax levied on employers and employees.","“We’re not gonna get many bites of this apple,” she said. “Let’s make sure the one we get has some nutrition in it.”"],"image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8201ce1e000037007ab787.jpeg?cache=OGdDfyB40f&ops=crop_985_328_1854_1118%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale&format=webp","isValid":true},{"otherData":{"category":"TECH","headline":"Instagram May Start Ratting On You If You Screenshot Someone's Story","authors":"Andy McDonald","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/instagram-screenshot-notification_us_5a81d9aae4b08dfc9306b717","short_description":"This is Insta-tattling, plain and simple.","date":"2018-02-12"},"isValid":false},{"otherData":{"category":"WORLD NEWS","headline":"Winter Olympics Organizers Confirm Cyber Attack, But Refuse To Reveal Source","authors":"Karolos Grohmann, Reuters","link":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cyber-attack-winter-olympics-pyeongchang_us_5a801645e4b0c6726e144204","short_description":"A cyber attack disrupted Friday’s opening ceremony, but \"all issues were resolved and recovered\" by Saturday, Games organizers said.","date":"2018-02-11"},"isValid":false},
